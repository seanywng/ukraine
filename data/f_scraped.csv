Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Jun 2021,"MYANMAR, The volatile security situation in northern Shan State, including frequent armed clashes between ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and fears of forced recruitment, continue to cause people to flee their homes. Around 550 people from two townships in northern Shan State reportedly fled their homes between 12 and 21 June due to insecurity. Some 210 people from Sant Hing and Kant Kan village tracts were displaced to Kant Kan monastery in Kyaukme Township due to active hostilities between the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army and the allied forces of the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army. In mid-February, close to 360 people from the area had been displaced and most of them managed to return home by mid-May. Local partners indicated that over 290 people remained displaced in Kant Kan monastery and need immediate assistance, including food and hygiene kits. In Kunlong Township, over 330 people were displaced between 12 and 18 June in fear of forced recruitment. Population movements in Shan State remain fluid, with the displacement of an estimated 18,350 people in total across 14 townships since January 2021, including about 3,640 people still displaced and over 14,700 people who have been able to return., AFGHANISTAN, On 22 June, the Government of Afghanistan officially declared a drought in the country. Little snow pack accumulation over the winter months and low rainfall in recent weeks resulted in drought conditions, low crop yields and rising food prices in the southern, eastern and western parts of the country. In the South, farmers in Kandahar Province are reporting water shortages which are threatening agricultural outputs. In the East, reduced food production is expected to contribute to an already dire food security situation exacerbated by the effects of La Niña and a continued dry spell. In the West, the provinces of Hirat, Badghis and Ghor are facing either extreme or severe drought conditions and humanitarian partners are assisting vulnerable people with food, water, sanitation and hygiene, cash and the rehabilitation of water sources. In the North-East region, drought does not pose an immediate threat at present, but forecasted water shortages may affect 60 per cent of farmers (about 586,000 people) in 12 districts during the upcoming agricultural seasons beginning in September 2021. The declaration of the drought comes at a time when Afghanistan is experiencing a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases and intensifying conflict against the background of ongoing peace talks and the withdrawal of US forces. In total, more than 12 million people – about one third of the population – are facing high levels of acute food insecurity due to high food prices, conflict, COVID-19, and widespread unemployment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asia-and-pacific-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-22-28-june-2021

Health
Protection and Human Rights",18 Jun 2021,"June 18th, 2021 / KHRG # 21-97-S1, This Situation Update describes events that occurred in all four townships of Dooplaya District in March 2021. Civil servants involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement have fled to areas controlled by the KNU to escape from persecution by the security forces. In parallel, the SAC military has stepped up its activities in the area and declared a curfew. Local villagers are now afraid that fighting might break out due to the increased presence of government soldiers. Anti-coup protests were held in every township of Dooplaya District. Local villagers plan to hold more protests, but they do not know how the SAC military will react. On March 9th 2021, DKBA and SAC soldiers prevented around 500 villagers from attending a protest in Myawaddy., Civil Disobedience Movement, In early March, we learned that people involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) were fleeing to Dooplaya District to escape from the State Administration Council (SAC) military’s torture and killing. Many people who joined the CDM came to these townships. They are teachers and doctors. They have to flee because SAC soldiers are trying to arrest them and kill them. They fled to the Karen revolutionary areas [to the areas controlled by the Karen National Union - KNU]. More and more people involved in the CDM are coming every day., As of March 7th 2021, 1,310 government staff involved in the CDM had sought refuge in the KNU areas of Dooplaya District. They are from Ayeyarwady Region, Kawkareik, Mawlamyine and Hpa-an. They used to work for the following agencies: Ministry of Health and Sports; Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation; Ministry of Internal Affairs (Myanmar Police Force, Fire Service Department); Ministry of Education; Ministry of Construction; Ministry of Electricity and Energy; Ministry of Transport and Communications; Ministry of Social Welfare and Resettlement; Ministry of Defence (SAC military); Ministry of Justice; and Myanmar Economic Bank. There are also municipal employees, township-level staff and village administrators [General Administration Department]., [There could be even more people involved in the CDM in KNU areas]. Some name lists have not been sent [by local administrators] to the [KNU] township and district [authorities] yet [local authorities must report new arrivals of people involved in the CDM to the KNU]. Some of them [people involved in the CDM] are hiding in villages and the village heads have not sent their names yet [to the KNU authorities]. We are not sure whether more people involved in the CDM will come to our areas., Military activity, The SAC military cut down bamboo in A--- village, Pone Yay village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township to strengthen their army camp [KHRG was not able to establish the exact date]. The local villagers told them that SAC soldiers were not allowed to trespass into the restricted areas. [The soldiers did not threaten or do anything to the local villagers but they did not listen to them and trespassed anyway]. Their commanding officer was Aung Zaw Lin, a deputy company commander from Infantry Battalion (IB) #13, Column #1., The SAC military is stepping up its activities in the local areas. Since the military coup,8 the local villagers have been seeing more SAC soldiers in the jungle or bushes around the villages, including in Kheh Hkoh [a place where villagers go to collect T’La Aw leaves], between B--- and C--- villages, Kyauk Hkee village tract, Kawkareik Township. Therefore, the local villagers are now afraid to go and collect Ta La Aw leaves., Since the protests against the military coup started, it has not been easy for patients to go to the hospital [because healthcare staff is participating in the CDM]. They have to buy medicine from outside [at the pharmacy]. One of the children from D--- village, Waw Loo village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township had a motorbike accident. He was sent to the hospital, but there was no one to look after him, give him medicine and clean his wounds. [KHRG was not able to establish the exact date of this incident]., The students who attend Myanmar government schools could not go to school this year. Since the first wave of COVID-19, they have to work instead. However, Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools are still open. Local villagers/civilians are concerned that fighting [between the SAC military and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)] might break out. They have to live in fear now. Some of them are getting ready and storing food such as rice because they worry the situation might go back to what it was the past [before the 2012 preliminary ceasefire]., We realised that the SAC military had been stepping up its activities since March 7th 2021. They patrol at night, but we are not sure whether they are trying to find and arrest people who joined the protests; or if they are trying to find KNLA soldiers and shoot them. It creates concerns among local villagers. The SAC military also sent drones to KNU-controlled areas. SAC soldiers are now checking people on the main roads. They check people who go to Seikkyi Town, and sometimes they even check their phones. This is not happening every day, but they conduct surprise checks., On March 19th 2021 at midnight, SAC soldiers from IB #32 shot at a group of Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA) soldiers in Kyainseikgyi Town. The DKBA soldiers were in the streets after 9 pm despite the curfew. They [SAC soldiers] could not kill any of them but they arrested one of them. We do not know what they did to him. The SAC military declared a curfew. No one can go out after 9 pm since March [but not everyone knows about the curfew]. These are just some of the SAC military activities this month [in March]., Anti-coup protests, In reaction to the military coup, protests were organised and held in every township of Dooplaya District. The demands of the protesters are: 1) Restore democracy; 2) Abolish the military dictatorship; 3) Free the detained people; 4) Abolish the 2008 Constitution; 5) Establish a federal Union; 6) We do not want influential nationalism [Burmanisation]; and 7) All ethnic groups should be united., On March 9th 2021, around 500 villagers from Thay Baw Boe, Maw Hkee and Su Klee village tracts, Kawkareik Township planned to hold a protest against the military coup in Myawaddy. However, they were stopped by DKBA and SAC soldiers on their way [to the city], so they could not hold the protest in Myawaddy. On the same day, local villagers from Aw Hpa Hpa Doh village tract, Kawkareik Township held a protest against the military on the Asia Highway., The local villagers from Kawkareik Township and Kruh Tuh Township held a protest on March 22nd 2021, and they plan to hold more protests in the future. They are going to hold protests in each of those townships on March 25th 2021. We heard that the SAC soldiers do not want the local villagers to hold protests. Therefore, we do not know what the situation will be on the days of the protests and we will have to monitor it. There are ongoing protests against the military because the local villagers are against military rule., Further background reading on protests against the 2021 military coup in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Mu Traw District Situation Update: Villagers protest against the military coup in Hpapun and K’Ma Maung towns, Lu Thaw Township, February to March 2021”, June 2021., “Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: Impact of the military coup on villagers in K’Ser Doh, Ler Muh Lah and Ler Doh Soh townships, February 2021”, May 2021., “An End to Peace Efforts: Recent fighting in Doo Tha Htoo District between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw following the 2021 Myanmar military coup (March and April 2021)”, May 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-situation-update-civil-disobedience-movement-military-activity-and
Supporting the victims of sexual violence in Myanmar,News and Press Release,The Lowy Institute,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jun 2021,"With the military often complicit in crimes, access to civil society organisations is increasingly difficult., Phyu Phyu Oo and Sara Davies, Conflict-related sexual violence has been a feature of fighting in Myanmar for decades – a crime explicitly singled out by the UN Secretary General since 2012. In most cases, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, is identified as the perpetrator of the crimes. Multiple forms of violence are recorded, from rape, gang rape, coerced sex, forced marriage to rape with additional brutality and killing, sexual slavery, and other forms of sexual violence., The military coup staged on 1 February expanded the brutal crackdown across the country, and has again seen sexual violence and harassment against political prisoners recently reported in the media. This follows crimes of sexual violence in recent years mostly targeting minority-ethnic communities, such as Rohingya Muslim community in Rakhine State, which were widely reported as “a hallmark of the Tatmadaw”. Mostly women and girls are identified as targets of sexual violence, however, some reports identify men and boys as victims while under interrogation. Incidents of conflict-related sexual violence are often underreported due to stigma, concerns with personal safety, and limited services available to survivors., To date, the coup has killed more than 800 civilians. Approximately 5,000 people have been detained, and arrest warrants issued for more than 1,900, including civil society activists, trade unionists, journalists, academics and social media influencers. In such a situation where it is unsafe for individuals to report acts of violence to the international community, it is unknown how many incidents of sexual violence are not being reported., There are significant barriers for survivors to report (to whom would they safely approach?) and seek justice in the current political context, especially if members of security forces are implicated in the incidents. The Tatmadaw has consistently denied allegations that it has condoned and perpetuated sexual violence crimes but impunity for armed forces is widespread. History indicates that there are limited chances for the survivors to seek justice from the military-ruled regime., Another concern is the limited first response care services safely available for survivors of sexual violence. Services are already inadequate in Myanmar. Since the coup, healthcare workers have joined forces with the civil disobedience movement and the majority of public health facilities are now non-functioning. The social and legal services in operation are under military control., In the conflict-affected states fighting has escalated, and growing numbers of people are now displaced in remote locations with no or limited access to humanitarian services. International humanitarian aid is severely constrained due to Covid-19 pandemic, physical insecurity, banking disruptions, road blockages, and pre-existing access challenges., In Myanmar, women-led and women-focused civil society organisations have been active for many years in peacebuilding activities, raising awareness of sexual violence and promoting women’s rights. They face significant barriers including a hostile conflict environment, a patriarchal, unrepresentative formal legal system, and unequal gendered norms that affect their own and survivors’ safety. These organisations are often the (only) bridge between international agencies such as United Nations and the local communities for delivering survivor-centered services due to their representation in the community, their ability to build trust and to overcome language barriers., In recent months, the work of these women-led civil society organisations has been limited or paused in certain locations due to safety and administrative challenges. With frequent internet disruption, remote delivery of services is not an option nor safe. Even prior to the coup, access to survivor-centred care and justice was limited across the country; now the (mostly) civil society providers of these services are under immense pressure and difficulty to support survivors of sexual violence., In Myanmar, and elsewhere, when international humanitarian actors access is restricted, local civil society organisations remain the only “first response” channel for the survivors of sexual violence. Local first responders do this work under immense political, security and logistic pressures. It is important to recognise the crucial role of local civil society response to conflict-related sexual violence., When international programs are interrupted due to access and/or sanctions, the question for the international community is how to support the work of local civil society organisations who are leading the survivor-centred response at the front line.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/supporting-victims-sexual-violence-myanmar

Taking Aim at the Tatmadaw: The New Armed Resistance to Myanmar’s Coup,Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",27 Jun 2021,"What’s new? Following Myanmar’s 1 February coup, newly organised militias have launched attacks in several parts of the country in response to regime killings of demonstrators. These lightly armed bands have inflicted significant casualties on the security forces, who have struck back with heavy weapons and bombardment of residential areas., Why does it matter? The regime’s heavy-handed, indiscriminate retaliation has displaced tens of thousands of men, women and children. Local networks and humanitarian agencies are unable to adequately assist these people, due to security and access restrictions, including military arrests, confiscation of supplies, and killings of those trying to deliver aid., What should be done? International actors – including in the UN Security Council – should press Myanmar’s regime to respect its legal obligations regarding the principles of proportionality and distinction, which its counter-insurgency strategy deliberately violates, and allow humanitarian access to all displaced people. Newly created militias must also refrain from abuses, particularly killing detainees., I. Overview, The Myanmar junta’s crackdown on protesters and the broader civilian population after the 1 February coup d’état has triggered violent resistance, including the formation of militias in parts of the country. Some such militias, armed with hunting rifles and other makeshift weapons, have used their numbers and knowledge of local terrain to inflict serious casualties on Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw. Security forces have responded with indiscriminate attacks on populated areas, using artillery, airstrikes and helicopter gunships. Tens of thousands of men, women and children have fled to the forest, with the regime blocking relief from reaching them. The Tatmadaw must meet its international obligations to respect the proportional use of force, distinguish between combatants and civilians, and allow unimpeded humanitarian access to those displaced. Outside actors have a responsibility, including in the UN Security Council, to ensure the regime faces consequences for international law violations. The militias, for their part, should not take the Tatmadaw’s grave abuses as an excuse to commit their own., Citizens in many parts of Myanmar watched in dismay as the regime unleashed deadly violence against protesters and residents in major cities from late February. Determined to continue demonstrating against the coup, but also concerned that they faced the same threat from security forces, they began forming militias to defend themselves. Such groups have emerged in several areas of the country, responding to the security forces’ attacks with determined campaigns of armed resistance. They have been most effective in places with existing militias or ethnic armed groups, or strong traditions of hunting – where many men have access to weapons and know the terrain intimately. Many of these areas have seen no active conflict in years or decades, meaning the Tatmadaw has little established military and intelligence capability there., Facing rising casualties, the military has responded with overwhelming force. With ground troops proving to be easy targets for ambushes, it has unleashed long-range artillery, airstrikes and airborne assaults on populated areas, such as the towns of Mindat (in Chin State) and Demoso (in Kayah State). The Tatmadaw is using its long-established “four cuts” counter-insurgency strategy in these areas, a cruel approach that deliberately targets civilians in an effort to deprive insurgents of food, funds, recruits and intelligence on troop movements (hence the four cuts). Attacks on populated areas are an integral part of this strategy, along with the looting of food stores and denial of relief supplies, in clear violation of international humanitarian law., The fast emergence of these militias, and their capacity to evolve from loosely coordinated groups of local people into more structured, better armed and sustainably funded forces, likely marks a new phase of Myanmar’s decades-old civil war. Given the deep grievances in areas such as Chin and Kayah States – about the coup, but also over decades of neglect, ethnic discrimination and denial of rights – these militias are unlikely to simply disband or quickly fade away. They constitute new fronts for the Tatmadaw, which will probably keep blindly lashing out at civilians, as it has done repeatedly in the past when fighting many of the country’s ethnic armed groups. While these militias generally express support for the National Unity Government (NUG), the civilian body that has emerged to contest the junta’s claim to rule, they are not under its command or control., In a context of national economic collapse and local penury, these new militias will have privileged access to resources and rent-seeking opportunities, such as other armed actors in the political economy of Myanmar’s conflict have long secured. Experience from other parts of the country shows that such groups can provide protection for residents but can also become a source of insecurity for them, as well as an economic burden., Addressing these conflict dynamics and their impact on non-combatants is difficult without a return to more democratic and accountable civilian government, which the regime appears determined to prevent. Nevertheless, some steps can be taken now that would help meaningfully improve the situation:, The Tatmadaw must cease attacks on civilians in line with its international legal obligation to respect the principles of proportionality and distinction. The security forces must also stop impeding humanitarian access to displaced populations., Outside actors should do what they can to ensure that the regime is held accountable for its violations of international law. UN Security Council members inclined to act could request that the UN secretary-general report in more detail on the extent of violence and any obstruction of aid in Myanmar, thus ensuring that the Council discusses these issues. All countries should stop the supply of weapons to the regime., Humanitarian agencies and donors should use all available channels to press the regime for timely access to displaced people. Asian countries, which are likely to have the most influence, should also advocate for expeditious humanitarian aid as a matter of priority., The militias likewise have an obligation to refrain from committing abuses, including killing of detainees and attacks on civilians and civilian property. All parts of the resistance must refrain in particular from targeting schools and medical facilities., Even if it does not have command and control of these groups, the NUG should take steps to strengthen and further disseminate its military code of conduct, continue to publicly signal the priority it gives to this code and press all elements of the resistance to adhere to the provisions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/taking-aim-tatmadaw-new-armed-resistance-myanmar-s-coup
Note to Correspondents: UN Special Representative Patten expresses grave concern over reports of sexual violence in detention setting in Myanmar,News and Press Release,OSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Jun 2021,"New York, United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, strongly condemns the Myanmar military’s widespread and systematic attacks against civilians, especially women and children, as well as other serious violations of human rights since it seized power on 1 February 2021. Night raids, arbitrary arrests, sieges of townships and neighborhoods, torture and deaths in detention, attacks on locations and sites where civilians are gathered or have fled, and reports of sexual violence in detention sites, particularly sexual assault, torture, physical and verbal abuse and intimidation, have become an alarming feature of daily life. These alleged reports of sexual violence may amount to violations of international criminal law for those who commit, command, or condone them., The patterns of sexual violence perpetrated by the Tatmadaw against women from ethnic and religious minority groups, as well as against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, as documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, is extremely concerning. These patterns of sexual violence have also been documented in successive reports of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence to the UN Security Council since 2011. In 2017, the UN Secretary-General listed the Tatmadaw as a party “credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in armed conflict on the agenda of the Security Council” and, with its integrated Border Guard, remains listed to this day., Special Representative Patten urges the Tatmadaw to cease all acts of sexual violence with immediate effect, which it is required to do following its listing in 2017 and pursuant to UN Security Council resolution 2106 (2013). Relatedly, an arms embargo is also a critical step towards ensuring the cessation of sexual violence. Special Representative Patten recalls that in December 2018, a Joint Communiqué to address and prevent sexual violence in conflict was signed between the then Government of Myanmar and the United Nations. Myanmar is also a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which entails a positive obligation to prevent, investigate, prosecute, punish and provide reparations for acts of gender-based violence., “The emerging reports of sexual violence in detention settings are very disturbing. I call for an end to all forms of violence against women, as well as unimpeded access to independently investigate the alleged reports.” Special Representative Patten said., At a time when Myanmar faces a continued threat from the spread of COVID-19, and access to public health services has been severely impacted by the political crisis, some public health facilities have also suspended their operations due to serious concerns related to attacks on, and the occupation and looting of health facilities and hospitals. “The current crisis is disrupting essential health and social services, including safe pregnancy and childbirth. In the midst of this civilian suffering, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that appropriate multi-sectoral services are available to all civilians including non-discriminatory care for survivors of sexual violence, and unimpeded access for humanitarian actors to provide essential lifesaving services,” SRSG Patten added., “I recognize and commend women’s rights organizations who are on the frontlines providing services and support at a time of heightened individual and collective security risks. The dignity and safety of survivors is paramount including access to timely medical care, as reinforced by Security Council Resolution 2467 (2019). My Office stands ready to support the UN Secretary-General’s renewed call to respect the will of the people and act in the greater interest of peace and stability in the country.”, For media inquiries, please contact:, Ms Géraldine Boezio, Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict

Myanmar’s Kachin State in Ruins 10 Years on from Collapsed Ceasefire,News and Press Release,Trócaire,Protection and Human Rights,24 Jun 2021,"This month marks 10 years since the breakdown of the ceasefire in Myanmar’s northern region Kachin. Since the breakdown, internally displaced persons (IDP’s) have had to live in over 170 displacement camps across Kachin State and northern Shan State in Myanmar. The situation in Kachin has taken a turn for the worse since the military took control in January. It is estimated that 900 people have been killed and 4,674 arrested, charged or sentenced in five months alone., There is an estimated 10,000 IDP’s on top of the 120,000 already displaced persons in need of urgent humanitarian aid and looking for shelter in overcrowded makeshift camps in Kachin. There is a heavy military presence in the area and checkpoints have increased which makes it challenging for IDP’s to move around in search of food and shelter. For five long and difficult months, transport has been blocked and the banking system has collapsed which means access to money is near impossible for civilians and aid organisations to access. The colourful markets which once adorned the region are no longer in operation and prices for goods and supplies have risen to astronomical prices, way above what locals can afford. On top of this, humanitarian organisations like Trócaire are struggling to gain access to those in urgent need of help., The military is back in charge and there is no progress in Kachin
Newly displaced persons in Kachin have found themselves with no permanent place to live and no food or medical supplies. New IDP’s can typically stay one month at a time in one place but due to a shortage of space, they are forced to move on. Searching for somewhere to stay has become a monthly challenge for them as they endure the daily hardships of their new way of living., Many new IDP’s have been forced to move out to remote jungles where monsoons and food shortages are a threat to their survival. IDP’s fear that they will never return to their farmland and homes because of this recent conflict. These new IDP’s, in desperate need of help, have effectively become another pressure on older IDP’s who already struggled to survive in makeshift camping sites., Until the coup, many people in Myanmar had accepted the military as playing a central role. Now, millions see it as a brutal force serving only itself., For a region rich in jade, timber and mineral wealth, times are hopeless for new and old IDP’s in the area. The military is back in charge and has declared a year-long state of emergency and there is no indication when it will get better., Pressure is growing on foreign governments as elected parliamentarians and campaign groups push for sanctions. For locals living in armed conflict, the international community has failed massively to help them., Covid-19 is thought to be worsening but no official data is available
No one knows how many people have contracted Covid-19 in Myanmar but the disease, which has dominated headlines for the past 15 months is not the main worry or stress in Myanmar. To the detriment of Covid-19 recovery efforts, in the months since January, hundreds of thousands of Burmese people have taken part in protests against the coup and in favour of improved living conditions and human rights for all across the island., The Covid-19 situation is believed to be worsening every day in the overcrowded camps but there is no official data available. The health service systems have been stopped and despite a donation of 1.5 million vaccines from India, many who received their first vaccine will not take the second one. It is feared that vaccines were not safely stored, and locals are too afraid to risk it., How is Trócaire getting humanitarian aid into Kachin?
IDP camps are hard to access areas in Kachin, but Trócaire’s partners continue to negotiate to access those in need. Trócaire is facing major issues providing cash to local partners but we are continuing our efforts to get support existing and newly displaced communities with food, cash assistance, water and sanitation and emergency kits of essential items like blankets and tarpaulins.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-s-kachin-state-ruins-10-years-collapsed-ceasefire
"Landmines Continue to Kill and Injure Citizens in Myanmar, in Midst of Humanitarian and Political Crisis",News and Press Release,CMC,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",24 Jun 2021,"(Geneva, 24 June 2021) - The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) is concerned with reports of new antipersonnel mine use and civilian casualties due to landmines and other explosive ordnance in Myanmar. Following the military coup staged on 1 February 2021, violent crackdowns and fighting between the Ethnic Armed Groups, People’s Defense Forces, newly formed non-State armed groups and the Myanmar military continues with no end in sight. A trend of increasing mine casualties had already been reported in recent years, according to the Landmine Monitor. In a context where landmines continue to be planted as a method of warfare, obstructing the movement of civilians and provision of humanitarian aid, it is key for Myanmar to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty and to recognize that humanitarian mine action is a prerequisite to any immediate or long-term recovery., Civilians pay a heavy human cost for the State’s failure to clear landmines and other explosive ordnance from contaminated areas. UNICEF has reported a total of 72 incidents across Myanmar in the first four months of 2021, with a spike of incidents in March and a total of 25 people dead and 47 injured. The impact of incidents is more concerning on men and boys. 28 children have already been killed or injured in 2021. The survivors of landmines and other explosive ordnance may experience lifelong impairments, psychological trauma, social exclusion and educational hurdles. Persons injured do not have appropriate access to emergency healthcare and rehabilitation services due to the collapse of the healthcare system since the coup., There have been reports about the new use of landmines by both the Myanmar military forces and ethnic armed groups.

"Landmines Continue to Kill and Injure Citizens in Myanmar, in Midst of Humanitarian and Political Crisis",News and Press Release,ICBL,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",24 Jun 2021,"(Geneva, 24 June 2021) - The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) is concerned with reports of new antipersonnel mine use and civilian casualties due to landmines and other explosive ordnance in Myanmar. Following the military coup staged on 1 February 2021, violent crackdowns and fighting between the Ethnic Armed Groups, People’s Defense Forces, newly formed non-State armed groups and the Myanmar military continues with no end in sight. A trend of increasing mine casualties had already been reported in recent years, according to the Landmine Monitor. In a context where landmines continue to be planted as a method of warfare, obstructing the movement of civilians and provision of humanitarian aid, it is key for Myanmar to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty and to recognize that humanitarian mine action is a prerequisite to any immediate or long-term recovery., Civilians pay a heavy human cost for the State’s failure to clear landmines and other explosive ordnance from contaminated areas. UNICEF has reported a total of 72 incidents across Myanmar in the first four months of 2021, with a spike of incidents in March and a total of 25 people dead and 47 injured. The impact of incidents is more concerning on men and boys. 28 children have already been killed or injured in 2021. The survivors of landmines and other explosive ordnance may experience lifelong impairments, psychological trauma, social exclusion and educational hurdles. Persons injured do not have appropriate access to emergency healthcare and rehabilitation services due to the collapse of the healthcare system since the coup., There have been reports about the new use of landmines by both the Myanmar military forces and ethnic armed groups. In areas of intense clashes between armed groups and the military since the coup, such as Mindat, Chin State and Kayah State, reports of the military forces planting landmines surfaced among local groups.

ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (12-18 June 2021),Analysis,ACLED,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",24 Jun 2021,"Last week in Southeast Asia, protests against the military coup in Myanmar continued across the country as protesters expressed an unusual show of support for the Rohingya ethnic minority. Additionally, the Myanmar military accused the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) of killing civilians, after claiming to have discovered mass graves in Kayin state. Elsewhere, fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) decreased. Clashes in Kayah state also decreased after the military and the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) agreed to a ceasefire. In the Philippines, the separate killings of two minors by state forces, as part of the ongoing ‘war on drugs’ and operations against the communist New People’s Army (NPA), sparked widespread controversy., In Myanmar, anti-coup supporters continue to protest against the military regime, with the majority of protests concentrated in Mandalay, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, and Yangon regions. On 13 June, protesters staged a rally in Yangon, holding placards to show support for “the oppressed Rohingya” (CNA, 14 June 2021). The protest coincided with the “#Black4Rohingya” social media campaign launched by activists on the same day, encouraging people to share photos of themselves expressing solidarity with the persecuted ethnic minority group. The public show of support marked a stark difference from past years, where recognition of the term “Rohingya” itself was controversial (Al Jazeera, 14 June 2021). The campaign comes after the National Unity Government (NUG) — formed by a committee of deposed lawmakers — pledged to grant citizenship for the Rohingya under a future democratic Myanmar (Frontier Myanmar, 3 June 2021)., Also in Yangon, a grenade was reportedly hurled into a military vehicle carrying security forces, killing a police officer and wounding several others (DVB, 18 June 2021). As with most other similar attacks against the military and military supporters, no party has claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, targeted attacks against military and police personnel, military informants, local administrators, and members of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) continued across Myanmar., Elsewhere, regime forces reportedly torched a village in Magway region with over 200 houses, killing two elderly residents (Myanmar Now, 16 June 2021). The incident drew condemnation from the Myanmar public and diplomatic missions in Myanmar, including the UK and US (Irrawaddy, 22 June 2021). State media sources rejected the claim, instead attributing the fire to “terrorists”, stating that any media reporting differently were “deliberately plotting to discredit the military” (BBC, 17 June 2021)., In another war of words, the junta accused the KNDO — one of the armed groups under the Karen National Union//Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) — of killing civilians, claiming to have uncovered two mass graves with 25 bodies in a forest clearing in Kayin state (Reuters, 18 June 2021). State-run media reported that the 25 civilians belonged to a group of 47 people who were abducted by the KNDO on 31 May. The KNDO has since refuted the allegations, alleging that the 25 victims were Myanmar military soldiers gathering information about military training conducted in KNU territory (RFA, 18 June 2021). In response, the KNU/KNLA pledged to conduct investigations into the allegations by the junta (Straits Times, 18 June 2021)., Elsewhere, fighting between the Myanmar military and EAOs decreased, with clashes mainly concentrated in Kachin and northern Shan states. Meanwhile, in Kayah state, the KNDF and the Myanmar military agreed to a ceasefire on 15 June following talks between both sides. Nonetheless, the KNDF says it would continue to oppose the military in other ways (Myanmar Now, 16 June 2021). This comes after weeks of heavy fighting between both sides that has displaced over 100,000 civilians (Myanmar Now, 16 June 2021). Following the ceasefire, locals returned to villages that had been ransacked, and found more than a dozen decomposed bodies (Irrawaddy, 18 June 2021)., In the Philippines, there was an increase in drug-related violence against civilians last week, predominantly perpetrated by police. In a particularly high-profile case, police officers killed a minor in Binan city, Laguna province. They allege that he and his older companion had exchanged fire when they attempted to serve an arrest warrant to the older man (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 22 June 2021). Such allegations are commonly used by police to justify extrajudicial killings of drug suspects (Human Rights Watch, 2 March 2017). However, relatives of the slain teenager strongly refute the police’s account of the incident, citing witness testimony that the boy had been shot while handcuffed and lying face down (Rappler, 18 June 2021)., The boy’s death comes just two days after the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that she had requested authorization to proceed with an investigation into the “situation in the Philippines,” particularly in the context of the ‘war on drugs’ (ICC, 14 June 2021). Preliminary examinations carried out by the Prosecutor’s Office conclude that “there is a reasonable basis to believe that the crime against humanity of murder has been committed…between 1 July 2016 and 16 March 2019” (ICC, 14 June 2021). Additionally, it found that members of the Philippine National Police “have unlawfully killed between several thousand and tens of thousands of civilians” during the same period, the start of which coincides with President Rodrigo Duterte’s assumption of office (ICC, 14 June 2021). Human rights groups and survivor support groups, many of whom have long been pinning their hopes of securing justice for victims of the drug war on the opening of an ICC case, celebrated the prosecutor’s announcement. In response to the announcement, the Philippine government criticized the prosecutor’s request for judicial authorization as “legally erroneous” and “politically motivated” (Philippine Star, 15 June 2021). It also vowed not to cooperate with the investigation “as long as President Rodrigo Duterte is in power” (Philippine Star, 15 June 2021)., Finally, also in the Philippines, three Lumad people — including two females, one of whom was a 12-year-old girl — were shot dead by the military amid ongoing government efforts to quell the NPA communist insurgency. The bodies of the girl and the woman bore signs of rape, and all three bodies were almost “beyond recognition” (Davao Today, 18 June 2021). According to Lumad advocacy groups, the victims were harvesting abaca at a farm with several others when the soldiers opened fire (Davao Today, 18 June 2021). However, the military insists that the victims were members of the NPA, and that all three of them had exchanged fire with the soldiers. It also claims that the NPA was using the girl as a child soldier (PNA, 16 June 2021), although this has been heavily disputed by locals and advocacy groups (ABS-CBN, 18 June 2021). Since the start of the Duterte administration, at least 34 Lumad people have been killed by state forces.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-12-18-june-2021

"Myanmar: Teenager Describes Torture, Mock Burial",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jun 2021,"Many Tell of Beatings, Ill-Treatment in Detention, (Bangkok) -- Myanmar's security forces have arbitrarily detained thousands of people and, according to numerous credible sources, subjected many to torture, routine beatings, and other ill-treatment since the February 1, 2021 military coup, Human Rights Watch said today., Myanmar's military and police often hold detainees in custody for extended periods, in overcrowded and unhygienic interrogation centers and prisons. Those detained are frequently kept incommunicado, unable to contact relatives or legal counsel. The victims, among them a 17-year-old boy who spoke to Human Rights Watch, described beatings, burnings from lit cigarettes, prolonged stress positions, and gender-based violence., ""Since the coup on February 1, Myanmar's authorities have been using torture without fear of repercussions,"" said Manny Maung, Myanmar researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The sheer brutality of the beatings and abuse shows the lengths to which Myanmar's military authorities are going to silence anyone opposing the coup."", The 17-year-old boy said he was beaten for days while blindfolded and was forced into a pit, then buried up to his neck in a mock burial. The military arrested him in early May during a night raid of his home and accused him of being the ringleader of a protest group. He said that he was beaten on his head with a rifle butt during the arrest, blindfolded, and then taken to an interrogation center at a location he couldn't identify. Over the following four days, military interrogators repeatedly hit him with a bamboo stick filled with cement, as well as grinding the rod against his shins during questioning, he said., ""On the third day, they drove me to a forested area about an hour away from wherever the interrogation place was,"" he said. ""They forced me to lie down into a pit while I was blindfolded, and my hands tied. They also planned to hit my head with a mattock, and I thought I was going to be buried alive when they started covering me with the dirt."", The boy said he and others arrested with him were denied food and water for four days, and drank toilet water to survive. Authorities held him at the interrogation facility for seven days total before transferring him to Insein prison. There, the authorities finally acknowledged that he is a child and sent him to a juvenile detention center. He was eventually released after he signed a false confession, he said. Human Rights Watch found his statement credible because of multiple similar accounts from other people arbitrarily detained by the military., Other sources interviewed said security forces often transported detainees to police precincts or military interrogation facilities, where they would be beaten and forced to stand, kneel, or lie in stress positions for hours., Han Thar Nyein and Nathan Maung, both journalists, were arrested on March 9, and taken to the Ye Kyi Ai interrogation center, near Insein township, where authorities tortured them for two weeks, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported. The journalists were severely beaten, burned with cigarettes on their belly, thighs, and buttocks, and forced to kneel on blocks of ice during interrogations. The authorities later transferred them to Insein prison, where both were charged under penal code article 505A for ""spreading fake news."", On June 14, the authorities dropped all charges against Nathan Maung, who has now left the country. However, Han Thar Nyein remains in custody and faces up to three years in prison under the charge. All charges against Han Thar Nyein and other journalists arrested in the wake of protests since the coup should be dropped, and they should be immediately released, Human Rights Watch said., Police arrested Yuki Kitazumi, a Japanese journalist, on April 19, and held him at Insein prison. After his release and deportation to Japan on May 15, Kitazumi told Human Rights Watch that other prisoners he was incarcerated with told him they were brutally tortured at a military-run holding facility before being sent to Insein prison. Kitazumi said they described torture, including beatings during interrogations that continued for days, and not being permitted to sleep., Kitazumi said the experience took a heavy toll on him mentally. ""There were times when I became unstable, because there's no one to stop you from thinking negatively, and no friends,"" he said., On April 17, the police arrested a woman they accused of involvement in a series of bomb attacks against security forces during raids of homes in Yangon. Local media reported that the woman was taken to a police station in Yankin township, where she was severely beaten during interrogation, including on her genitals, causing extensive injuries., The woman was later taken to an interrogation center in Shwe Pyi Thar township, where she was again beaten. By the time she arrived at the Shwe Pyi Thar interrogation center, she had vaginal bleeding due to her injuries, and she could not easily eat or urinate, according to her cell mate -- who also described to Human Rights Watch how she was molested, threatened with a gun, and slapped during her own interrogation at another police precinct in Sanchaung township., Under international human rights law, the use of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is prohibited under any circumstance. Articles 330 and 331 of Myanmar's penal code expressly prohibits the use of torture during interrogations and states that anyone who ""voluntarily causes grievous hurt for the purpose of extorting from the sufferer"" shall be punished with imprisonment up to 10 years, and a fine., According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), at least 870 people have died since the coup. Of those killed, at least 22 died from torture in custody. ""The number of tortured to death while in custody is likely to be higher than confirmed,"" the group said in a statement issued on June 11., ""Myanmar's military authorities cannot be trusted to undertake serious investigations of allegations of torture, let alone to prosecute the police and military abusers,"" Maung said. ""The United Nations and concerned governments should publicly demand an end to torture and other abuse of detainees and make clear to the military that failure to comply will mean redoubled efforts to impose additional targeted sanctions on senior military and police officials, and military-owned enterprises.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-teenager-describes-torture-mock-burial

On 15 June, a landslide near Melamchigyang blocked the Melamchi River, resulting in a landslide dam outburst flood (LDOF) that submerged or destroyed over 500 houses and destroyed roughly 250 hectares of agricultural lands. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Initial Rapid Assessments, the impacts of the monsoon nationally include 17 reported deaths, 23 people missing, and 600 displaced families sheltering in various public buildings, posing significant COVID-19 transmission risks. Security forces are carrying out search and rescue operations. Humanitarian partners on the ground have provided relief support to affected people. This year’s rainfall is forecast to be above normal, and there is a high likelihood of further floods and landslides this monsoon season, which comes at a time when Nepal is hit hard by a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic., PHILIPPINES, In Maguindanao Province, at least 1,000 families fled their homes in the towns of Guindulungan and Talayan on 20 June due to the latest round of clashes between the military and the non-state armed group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). According to field verifications conducted by grassroots protection monitors, people left their homes when areas occupied by BIFF were shelled with mortars, followed by armed clashes on the ground. The NGO CFSI and its local partners further noted the presence of unexploded ordnance in one village and have informed the FSD demining group for appropriate coordination with the military and police. The situation remains volatile as security forces continue to operate in these areas, with local authorities encouraging communities to preemptively evacuate., MYANMAR, Humanitarian actors continue to make efforts to respond to the needs of people internally displaced and otherwise affected by conflicts, natural disasters, and the political developments across certain parts of the country. The World Food Programme delivered food assistance, consisting of monthly rice rations, to a total of 334,000 people in Hlaing Tharyar Township in Yangon Region since early May. This assistance was distributed directly to people living in vulnerable circumstances, including those living in most impoverished locations and informal settlements. This response is on top of WFP's continued humanitarian assistance in conflict-affected areas. Over the course of May alone, around 340,000 highly food insecure people in certain parts of Chin, Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states benefitted from WFP's food and cash assistance. The response targeted internally displaced people, families with older people, people living with disabilities, young children, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, and other groups with specific nutritional needs or vulnerabilities., INDONESIA, A 6.1 magnitude earthquake at a depth of 10km hit Maluku Province on 16 June, leading to the temporary evacuation of an estimated 7,000 people and damages to at least 227 houses.

GENERAL ASSEMBLYPLENARY
SEVENTY-FIFTH SESSION, 82ND & 83RD MEETINGS (AM & PM), Permanent Representative, Supporting Text, Denounces Delayed International Response, Calls for Strongest Action by Security Council, The General Assembly today unanimously appointed Secretary-General António Guterres for a second five-year term beginning 1 January 2022, while adopting a landmark resolution calling upon the armed forces of Myanmar to immediately stop violence against peaceful demonstrators and allow the sustained democratic transition of the country., Acting first on the recommendation of the Security Council to reappoint Mr. Guterres, the Assembly adopted a resolution by acclamation renewing his term for another five years. By the text, the Assembly also expressed its appreciation for his effective and dedicated service during his first term, which ends on 31 December 2021., Mr. Guterres, after taking the oath of office, said he is “deeply honoured and grateful” for the trust Member States have placed in him. History can go either way: breakdown and perpetual crisis or breakthrough and prospect of a greener, safer and better future for all, he said, declaring: “I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power during my second term in office to contribute to the positive, breakthrough scenario.”, Outlining some of his strategic priorities, he stressed that the United Nations must consolidate the current reforms and continue to develop new methods of work. A United Nations “2.0” needs to accelerate transformation through a quintet of change — better data, analysis and communications’ innovation and digital transformation; strategic foresight; stronger performance and results orientation; and a work culture that reduces bureaucracy., Equally, what is needed is a much more aligned and integrated Organization that works seamlessly across its pillars, he said, acknowledging that the Secretary-General alone neither has all the answers nor seeks to impose his views. Rather, the top official supports Member States and relevant stakeholders to lead the necessary changes by using the unique convening role of the United Nations and working as an honest broker to help find solutions., He said the Secretary-General must feel every day the acute responsibilities of the office. “It is my intention to serve with humility… in the spirit of building trust and inspiring hope,” he declared. “This is our common mission.”, Following the reappointment of Mr. Guterres, the Assembly reconvened to take up the draft resolution on the situation in Myanmar, introduced by Lichtenstein’s representative, who described a “real and present danger of full-fledged civil war”. The military crackdown has reversed the democratic transition, killed peaceful protesters and stifled political dissent, he said, stressing that the text aims to bring Myanmar “back on the path to democracy”., Adopting the resolution by a recorded vote of 119 in favour to 1 against (Belarus) with 36 abstentions, the 193-nation organ called on the armed forces to respect the will of the people — as freely expressed in the 8 November 2020 general election — to end the state of emergency, respect all human rights and to allow sustained democratic transition, including the opening of a democratically elected parliament and by bringing all national institutions under a fully inclusive civilian Government., By other terms, the Assembly called on Myanmar’s armed forces to immediately and unconditionally release President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and all others who have been arbitrarily detained, charged or arrested, and to engage constructively with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to realize an inclusive, peaceful dialogue among all stakeholders through a political process led and owned by the people of Myanmar. To de-escalate violence, the Assembly called on all Member States to prevent the flow of arms to the country., When delegates took the floor to explain their positions, Myanmar’s representative said his delegation supported the resolution from a belief that it will pressure the “murderous military” to cease its inhumane acts and consolidate the people’s efforts to restore democracy. He expressed disappointment, however, that it took three months for the Assembly to act, recalling that on 26 February — “from this very seat” — he had appealed for the strongest possible action to end the coup. If the international community had acted sooner, he observed, it could have prevented more than 800 civilian deaths., Many delegates supported the resolution’s recognition of ASEAN’s efforts in the region and emphasizing the need to support the will of Myanmar’s people to restore democracy. The resolution may be imperfect, some observed, but it is timely. Others abstained, either stating that the text does not do enough to address the Rohingya crisis, falls outside the General Assembly’s purview, or citing a principled position against adopting country-specific resolutions., The representative of Belarus — who called for the vote and cast the one lone ballot against the measure — denounced the “rushed”, “closed” process to produce a text, stressing that the failure to consult his delegation amounted to “open discrimination”. Country-specific resolutions are always biased and one-sided, he added, and today’s text was no exception., Canada’s representative, however, emphasized that attacks on civilians are not matters pertaining to just one country, and that, while the Charter of the United Nations speaks of the principle of sovereignty, it does not say that it “trumps every other value that we have as an Assembly”., The representative of Bangladesh, whose country hosts 1 million Rohingyas who fled violence in Myanmar, said her delegation abstained from the vote, as the resolution fell short of its expectations, failing to recognize the urgent need to create the conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of the Rohingyas. Any resolution on Myanmar will remain incomplete if it does not recognize the root causes of the crisis and make recommendations to address them, she asserted., Also speaking in explanation of position on “L.85/Rev.1” were representatives of Iran, Egypt, Thailand, Bangladesh, Malaysia, India, China, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Viet Nam, Algeria, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Cambodia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. Representatives of Costa Rica, Ukraine, Dominican Republic, Republic of Korea and Japan delivered general statements., Volkan Bozkir (Turkey), President of the General Assembly, delivered opening remarks on the Secretary-General’s reappointment. Delivering statements were representatives of Eritrea (on behalf of the African States), Kiribati (on behalf of the Asian States), Slovakia (on behalf of the Eastern European States), Costa Rica (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States), United Kingdom (on behalf of the Western European and other States) and the United States (on behalf of the host country). Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of Portugal, also spoke., The General Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Monday, 21 June, to discuss the United Nations global counter-terrorism strategy., Action — Appointment of United Nations Secretary-General, SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia), President of the Security Council for June, said that at its meeting held in private on 8 June, the 15-member organ adopted resolution 2580 (2021), recommending to the General Assembly that António Guterres be appointed Secretary-General of the United Nations for a second term, from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026. Following the adoption, this information was conveyed to the Assembly President in a letter dated 8 June 2021 (document A/75/912)., He went on to explain that the Presidents of the Assembly and the Council received a communication dated 24 February from the Permanent Mission of Portugal presenting the candidature of Mr. Guterres, who was the only candidate presented by a Member State. The Council held an informal dialogue with Mr. Guterres on 18 May, which members found “meaningful and productive”, and subsequently adopted resolution 2580 (2021) by acclamation, expressing unconditional support for Mr. Guterres. In the Council’s view, Mr. Guterres corresponds to the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and a firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations., Acting on the recommendation of the Security Council, the General Assembly then adopted by acclamation a resolution, submitted by its President (document A/75/L.100), appointing António Guterres Secretary-General of the United Nations for a second term, beginning on 1 January 2022 and ending on 31 December 2026., ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, after taking the oath of office, said: “I find myself experiencing a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts. I am deeply honoured and grateful for the trust you have placed in me to serve as the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a second term.” Calling himself “a committed multilateralist” and “a proud Portuguese”, he said he is aware of the immense responsibilities entrusted to him at such a critical moment in history and at the cusp of a new era. History can go either way: breakdown and perpetual crisis or breakthrough and prospect of a greener, safer and better future for all. “I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power during my second term in office to contribute to the positive, breakthrough scenario,” he declared., The last 18 months have been unprecedented, with the COVID-19 pandemic revealing the cracks in society, he warned. Millions of families lost their loved ones, 114 million jobs have been lost, more than 55 per cent of the world’s population is left without any form of social protection, and poverty has risen for the first time in 20 years. Citing other global challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, growing inequalities, a decline in human rights and a widening digital divide, he pointed out that implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals has seen a setback. His strategic vision outlines priorities during his second term, he said., Stressing that the Organization must consolidate the current reforms, build on their results and continue to develop new work methods to be able to deliver to the world, he said: “A United Nations 2.0” must accelerate transformation through a quintet of change — better data, analysis and communications, innovation and digital transformation, strategic foresight, stronger performance and results orientation and a work culture that reduces unnecessary bureaucracy and fosters collaboration. Equally, what is needed is a much more aligned and integrated United Nations that works seamlessly across its pillars of work, as well as an institution that is transparent and accountable., Citing the words of Sophocles that “trust dies but mistrust blossoms”, he pledged that he would give his all to ensure the blossoming of trust between and among nations, large and small, to build bridges and to engage relentlessly in confidence-building. The Secretary-General alone neither has all the answers nor seeks to impose his views. Rather, the Secretary-General supports Member States and relevant stakeholders to lead the necessary changes, fully using the unique convening role of the United Nations and working as a mediator, a bridge and trust-builder — and an honest broker to help find solutions that benefit everyone involved. The Secretary-General must feel every day the acute responsibilities of the office, guided by the Charter and making human dignity and peace with nature — including for future generations — the core of common work and endeavour. “It is my intention to serve with humility […] in the spirit of building trust and inspiring hope. This is our common mission,” he said., VOLKAN BOZKIR (Turkey), President of the General Assembly, said he has confidence that Mr. Guterres, as the world’s top diplomat and advocate, will continue to lead the United Nations with sincerity and integrity. “To your credit, you have sought to bring this Organization closer to the peoples it serves and their needs,” he said, noting that when setting out his vision for his second term, recovery from the pandemic was fittingly first on the list. In the Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the United Nations, Member States reaffirmed the necessity of multilateralism as the international community builds back better for a more equal, more resilient and more sustainable planet. As the world begins to turn a corner towards recovery, he said he has no doubt Mr. Guterres will ensure that the United Nations is positioned to foster connections and collaboration “to strengthen our weakest link” and leave no one behind. As the interconnectivity among peoples and counties continues to increase, so grows the need for a multilateral system that is fit for purpose, he stressed, welcoming the strong universal support from Member States for his reappointment., The representative of Eritrea, speaking for the African States, welcomed the United Nations commitment — under the Secretary-General’s leadership — to working closely with African countries on vaccine roll-out through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) mechanism. Noting the egregiously uneven distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the world, she called for a fair, equitable dissemination that prioritizes people over profit, praising the Secretary-General’s vocal support of patent suspension and technology transfer relating to these vaccines. She also called on the United Nations to increase its efforts to ease the pandemic’s economic and social fallout by seeking debt relief for African countries and a new allocation of special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund (IMF)., She also urged the Secretary-General to dedicate his tenure to working with the African Union on both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063, calling for increased cooperation and collaboration between these two organizations, along with regional economic communities and mechanisms, to advance peace and sustainable development on the continent. A strong United Nations is impossible unless Africa meaningfully participates in its decision-making, she added., The representative of Kiribati, speaking for Asia Pacific States, said the selection of a Secretary-General is not only important for the Organization but also for its 193 Member States and the 7.8 billion people who call this planet “home” for themselves, their children and succeeding generations. Thankfully, this task was simple, and the Secretary-General’s sole candidature serves as a clear indication that he enjoys the full trust and confidence of the entire United Nations membership during these “unprecedentedly difficult and challenging times”., The representative of Slovakia, speaking for the Eastern European States and highlighting the transparent, inclusive process used to select the Secretary-General, expressed commitment to exploring ways to enhance this undertaking by promoting gender equality and equitable geographic representation. The Secretary-General has demonstrated his respect for the values and principles enshrined in the Charter over the past four-and-a-half years, leading the international community to overcome challenges imposed by conflict, natural disaster and climate change, as well as economic, food, social and health crises. He praised the Secretary-General’s personal engagement in conflict prevention — focusing on “diplomacy for peace” — and efforts demonstrating to the world that “multilateralism matters”., The representative of Costa Rica, speaking on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States, expressed confidence that the Secretary-General’s leadership in the second term “will bring us even closer to realizing the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations”. His delegation looks forward to five more years of reform, innovation, delivery and results. From steadfast commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change, to calls for equitable vaccine distribution, universal health coverage and expanded parity of female representation in the Secretariat, “you have been indispensable in crafting a United Nations prepared for the twenty-first century,” he said to the Secretary-General, welcoming his vision of a more transparent, accountable and unified “UN 2.0.”, The representative of the United Kingdom, speaking on behalf of the Western European and other States, said that the last five years were framed by three global challenges — rising humanitarian needs, COVID-19 and climate change — all against the backdrop of difficult international relations. Mr. Guterres met the moment, leading efforts to resolve and prevent conflicts and issuing a clarion call for bolder action to address climate change, among other achievements. The complexity of these issues requires more coherent responses. Mr. Guterres is “the right person for the job”, she said, expressing confidence in his skills, ability, commitment and vision towards integrating the three United Nations pillars: peace and security, development and human rights., The representative of the United States, speaking for the host country, said the Secretary-General has proven his capable leadership in a demanding role and welcomed further collaboration with him. The Secretary-General has again “been charged with the gravest of responsibilities,” demonstrated by the serious challenges posed by the climate crisis, imperilled human rights, mass hunger, increased humanitarian needs and a global pandemic. Expressing hope that the next five years will be more peaceful, secure and prosperous than the last, he stated that achieving this difficult task will require greater partnership with civil society and the private sector, along with dedication to purpose and results-based accountability., MARCELO REBELO DE SOUSA, President of Portugal, said that his country submitted the Secretary-General’s name five years ago for a simple reason: “the strong conviction that António Guterres is particularly suited for the job.” The Secretary-General’s commitment to effective, efficient multilateralism is complemented by his compassion, which compels him “to put people at the very centre of his action”. Recalling the work the United Nations has undertaken during his tenure — needed reforms, the representation of women, youth empowerment, the pandemic and climate action — he said the Secretary-General’s persistence, boldness, fairness and spirit of solidarity will be instrumental over the next five years., Myanmar, VOLKAN BOZKIR (Turkey), President of the General Assembly, said political turmoil has given way to an increasingly dire situation in Myanmar, where civil rule has collapsed, people are subject to arbitrary detention, the military carries out violence against civilians and humanitarian needs are growing. Communities are being uprooted as tens of thousands flee violence, humanitarian access remains restricted in all conflict-affected areas and many civilians are in acute need of food, shelter and sanitation facilities. He questioned how the spread of COVID-19 in Myanmar can be prevented if the people cannot safely socially distance, wash their hands and be vaccinated., This is not just a crisis for the people of Myanmar, he stressed, highlighting the 1 million Rohingya sheltering in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, and commending that country for helping its neighbours in their “darkest hour.” Recalling a visit to that city marked by driving rain, he said the effects of extreme weather on the Rohingya cannot be underestimated, as Myanmar’s rainy season begins. While voluntary, dignified and safe return for these individuals is the ultimate goal, conditions in Myanmar must first improve. Welcoming the united voice of the Security Council and the engagement of regional organizations to that end, he called on the international community to stand united to support the people of Myanmar and expressed hope that the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus., The representative of Liechtenstein, introducing the draft resolution titled “The situation in Myanmar” (document A/75/L.85/Rev.1), said conditions in the country continue to deteriorate, as democratic transition has been reversed, peaceful protestors have been killed and political dissent has been stifled by a military crackdown. “There is a real and present danger of full-fledged civil war,” he emphasized. The draft resolution — a product of lengthy consultations — supports, complements and strengthens efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to bring Myanmar back on the path to democracy. It condemns the use of lethal force by the armed forces of Myanmar, affirms the General Assembly’s support for the population and seeks accountability for crimes against the same, including the Rohingya. Stressing that the people of Myanmar deserve the Assembly’s full support in their struggle for a peaceful, democratic future, he said that the resolution aims to strengthen the efforts of ASEAN and the United Nations to that end., The representative of Iran, speaking in explanation of vote, expressed concern over the crisis facing Rohingya Muslims, calling on national authorities to uphold their responsibility to this population and ensure the voluntary, sustainable return of internally displaced persons and refugees. Further, those responsible for brutal acts and crimes against the Rohingya must be held accountable. He said that Iran will abstain from the vote because the draft resolution fails to adequately address the plight of Rohingya Muslims., The representative of Egypt stressed the need to ensure the safe, sustained repatriation of the Rohingya and protect that population’s fundamental rights. She urged, however, that the General Assembly consider how today’s draft resolution can help the current situation and said Egypt will abstain from the vote due to the unclear link between the agenda item under which the resolution falls and the current crisis., The representative of Thailand, highlighting the close link between the peace, stability and prosperity of Myanmar and his own country, said that, while Myanmar’s future must be decided by its people, the international community can play a role in creating conditions conducive to dialogue. Thailand will abstain from the vote, however, because the General Assembly was not able to reach consensus on this resolution., The representative of Liechtenstein then asked for clarification on who requested a recorded vote, to which the Assembly President answered that it was Belarus., The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 119 in favour to 1 against (Belarus), with 36 abstentions., By its terms, the General Assembly called on the armed forces of Myanmar to respect the will of its people — as freely expressed by the results of the general election held on 8 November 2020 — to end the state of emergency, respect all human rights of the population and to allow sustained democratic transition, including the opening of a democratically elected parliament and bringing all national institutions under a fully inclusive civilian Government. The Assembly further called on the armed forces to immediately and unconditionally release President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and all others who have been arbitrarily detained, charged or arrested., The text also had the General Assembly call on the armed forces of Myanmar to engage constructively with ASEAN to realize an inclusive, peaceful dialogue among all stakeholders through a political process led and owned by the people of Myanmar. Pursuant to the resolution, the armed forces must also immediately cease all violence against peaceful demonstrators and end certain civil restrictions. Further, they must facilitate a visit by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar and provide safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need. The General Assembly additionally called on all Member States to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar., The representative of Belarus said his delegation voted against this politically motivated country-specific resolution, stressing that in no way will Belarus become an obstacle to international efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. Regrettably, the spirit of multilateralism is lacking in this document. Country-specific resolutions are always biased and one-sided — and today’s text is no exception. The process was rushed and he expressed disappointment at the closed nature of negotiations, emphasizing that Belarus was never consulted, a fact he characterized as “open discrimination”. He asked rhetorically where pluralism and multilateralism had been demonstrated, noting that today’s meeting was held in place of a high-level meeting on middle-income countries in which the Foreign Minister of Belarus was due to address. This is unacceptable, he said., The representative of Bangladesh said today’s resolution is of utmost importance to her country, which shares borders with Myanmar. Stability in Myanmar is critically important for finding a durable solution for the 1 million Rohingya hosted by Bangladesh who are victims of atrocity crimes. Her delegation abstained as the resolution fell short of its expectations, failing to recognize the urgent need to create conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of the Rohingyas. “We do not see our key priorities reflected in the resolution, especially in the operative part,” she asserted. Any resolution on Myanmar will remain incomplete if it does not recognize the root causes of the crisis and make recommendations to address them., She said the international community’s failure to address the root causes of the crisis, even after the ethnic cleansing in 2017, has led to a culture of impunity in Myanmar. “We see this playing out now for other minorities as well,” she added. The resolution calls for implementation of the five-point consensus reached at the ASEAN leaders’ summit, which does not address the issue of repatriation. Myanmar’s military chief, who attended that meeting, has ruled out the possibility of any policy reforms that would ensure the safe return of the Rohingyas, making it all the more important for today’s resolution to stress the need for creating a conducive environment for return. Expressing disappointment, she said today’s text deviates from other resolutions and outcomes adopted in the Third Committee (Social, Cultural and Humanitarian), the Human Rights Council and the Security Council., The representative of Malaysia expressed grave concern over the situation in Myanmar following the 1 February military takeover. The continued use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians is unacceptable under any circumstances, he said, noting that Malaysia has consistently called on all parties to exercise utmost restraint to stop the deplorable situation immediately. Although the core group tabling the resolution could have held more inclusive meetings, ASEAN proposals were taken on board. The resolution is not perfect — but it is timely. Malaysia takes the position of constructive engagement with Myanmar, rather than isolating the country, and advocated for its accession to ASEAN in 1997. His delegation’s vote was based on that approach, he explained., The representative of India, noting that his country has direct stakes in the maintenance of peace and stability in Myanmar, said its diplomatic engagements are aimed at upholding the ASEAN five-point consensus. India has strongly condemned the use of violence, urging maximum restraint, and will continue to engage with measures to accelerate democratic transition in Myanmar. On the repatriation of persons displaced from Rakhine state, India has called for a balanced and constructive approach, he said, expressing support for people on the ground in Cox’s Bazar and in Rakhine. Their safe and speedy and sustainable repatriation from Bangladesh to Rakhine must be expedited., During discussions on the text, India had hoped to find a pragmatic way forward, he said, however its views are not reflected in the draft. A consultative approach involving neighbouring countries and the region remains important. The lack of support from all neighbouring countries — and several countries in the region itself — for today’s text should serve as an “eye opener” to those who chose to pursue a hasty course of action. Its tabling was not conducive to aiding joint efforts for strengthening the democratic process in Myanmar. For these reasons, India abstained from the vote., The representative of China said his country has worked with Myanmar’s parties and constructively participated in Security Council discussions and joined consensus. He expressed hope that Myanmar’s parties will resolve their differences through dialogue, avoid a recurrence of violence, restore social stability and relaunch the domestic transition. Describing the ASEAN delegation’s visit to Myanmar as an important step towards implementing the five-point consensus, he said Beijing is in close communication and has reached broad consensus with the regional bloc. China supports ASEAN in playing a constructive role in handling Myanmar’s domestic issues. China will maintain its close communications with ASEAN and play a constructive role “in its own way”. Myanmar’s current issues are essentially domestic questions. Whether they are resolved properly depends on the country itself. Sanctions often aggravate and harm the people of Myanmar, he said, urging Member States to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar and to avoid inappropriate interventions. China opposes country-specific resolutions as they lack transparency and inclusivity, he explained. As such, his delegation abstained from the vote., The representative of Myanmar said his country voted in favour of the resolution from a belief that the text will contribute to pressuring the military to cease its inhumane acts and to consolidating the people’s efforts to restore democracy in Myanmar. He expressed regret, however, that it fell short of the people’s expectations by not imposing an arms embargo to prevent the military from killing civilians and peaceful protestors with imported weapons. He called on all Member States to immediately stop selling arms to the “murderous military,” as such action can be seen as aiding and abetting crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and genocide., Expressing disappointment that it took three months for the Assembly to adopt today’s watered-down resolution, he recalled that on 26 February — “from this very seat” — he had appealed for the international community to take the strongest possible action to immediately end the military coup. One hundred days later, almost 900 people — including a 7-year-old girl — have been murdered. The international community could have prevented more than 800 civilian deaths if it had acted sooner. Stressing that no State should support the military — which would encourage further violence against civilians — he urged strong, decisive action from the international community to save lives and called on the Security Council to take the strongest action against the military and the State Administration Council without further delay., The representative of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, explaining his country’s abstention from the vote, welcomed the resolution’s support for ASEAN’s efforts but stated nonetheless that some wording does not comport with the General Assembly’s previous practice., The representative of Singapore opposed the use of lethal force against unarmed civilians, calling on the military authorities to stop the violence and release all political detainees. He urged all parties to refrain from further escalating tensions and instead to engage in meaningful dialogue. Singapore voted in favour of the resolution because it recognizes the central role of ASEAN, he explained., The representative of Brunei Darussalam said her country shares the international community’s concern about the situation in Myanmar, especially over civilian fatalities and the escalation of violence. Welcoming the resolution’s support for ASEAN, she said the regional bloc will continue its work to facilitate a peaceful solution., the representative of Viet Nam, expressing concern over recent clashes across Myanmar, stressed that people must be protected from the threat of an all-out civil war and called on all parties to end the violence and engage in dialogue. While today’s resolution is not perfect, Viet Nam voted in favour of the text to express its strong commitment to facilitating de-escalation and dialogue., The representative of Algeria expressed regret that more efforts were not made towards achieving consensus, which would have sent a positive signal. Joining others in expressing solidarity with the people of Myanmar and calling for restraint to pave the way for a democratic solution, she said Algeria nevertheless abstained because of its principled position against the General Assembly adopting country-specific resolutions. Further, the resolution should have afforded greater recognition to the fact that regional organizations are well-placed to understand the root causes of conflict in their own areas., The representative of the Russian Federation said his delegation was puzzled by the circulation of the text. Tabling a country-specific resolution in the General Assembly erodes the division of labour among United Nations organs, he explained, noting that the situation in Myanmar is already on the Security Council agenda and that just this morning, the Council held its latest meeting on Myanmar. The text reflects the lack of desire by the sponsors to generate balanced content which addresses the complexity of the situation in Myanmar. The text “planted division” in the Assembly and the Russian Federation therefore was unable to support it., The representative of Saidi Arabia said his delegation abstained as the resolution ignored his delegation’s request for sponsors to include a clear reference to the plight of Rohingya refugees in the operative paragraphs., The representative of Cambodia said his delegation abstained from the vote; however, it joined others in expressing support for ASEAN efforts, including the five-point consensus., The representative of Iraq said her delegation voted in favour of the resolution, however the text does not accurately describe the situation facing Rohingyas on the ground. Her delegation disassociated from preambular paragraph 19., The representative of the United Arab Emirates said her delegation also abstained because certain operative paragraphs did not sufficiently address the Rohingya issue., MARITZA CHAN VALVERDE (Costa Rica), speaking in a general statement, said 137 days have passed since a coup wrested control from Myanmar’s democratically elected Government. Yet, the General Assembly is only now taking measures. “It is in no one’s interest that this junta endures,” she said, which is why Costa Rica voted for the resolution. She urged an immediate suspension to the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer of all weapons and ammunition to the junta, which it uses to “fire bullets into children’s eyes”, she said. “Continuing to supply weapons to the junta is like giving them a blank check for violence.”, She advocated for accountability for all grave human rights violations in Myanmar, calling impunity “a pernicious virus”. The United Nations Special Envoy must be granted immediate entry into the country, without obstruction. She reemphasized the role of youth in defending Myanmar’s democracy, stressing that millions of people — in all their ethnic, religious and regional diversity — are courageously challenging the military coup as it attempts to steal their democratic future. “The junta is not the face of Myanmar,” she assured. “It is illegitimate in its origin, form and function.” She called for immediate and decisive action against it, stressing that the international community must demonstrate, through resolutions such as today’s, that “juntas cannot assault, arrest and attack their way into legitimacy”., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), condemning the military’s use of lethal force against civilians, called for the immediate release of those arbitrarily detained, the ending of the state of emergency, the restoration of the rule of law and the facilitation of unimpeded humanitarian access. He expressed regret that the resolution was not adopted without a vote at the behest of Belarus — “the lonely red dot on the screen in front of us” — stressing that “all dictatorships should and will eventually feel lonely in this Hall”. Noting that the Security Council cannot act on this issue due to opposition by the Russian Federation, he expressed hope that today’s resolution will facilitate a timely response by the international community., JOAN MARGARITA CEDANO (Dominican Republic) expressed concern over the arbitrary detention of political officials and members of the press and the continued attacks on civilians. The United Nations should not have taken so long to respond, she emphasized, but today’s resolution “amends the long silence to a certain extent”. She called on the international community to work towards a viable solution that ends repression and violence against civilians and supports the people’s pursuit of democratic governance in Myanmar., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada), pointing out that attacks on civilians are not matters pertaining to just one country but to the entirety of the United Nations membership, stated that it is neither legally nor politically correct to believe that the principle of sovereignty nullifies all others of democracy and humanitarian law. Nevertheless, the United Nations continues to hear that national sovereignty has absolute value — exemplified today by Belarus — and that this means that Member States have nothing to say about human rights. He spotlighted, however, that important international laws have been passed to ensure the existence of such rights and, while the United Nations Charter speaks of the principle of sovereignty, it does not say that it “trumps every other value that we have as an Assembly”., “We must try to respect the dignity of difference among us,” he said, but the international community must also respect the universality of what it means to have rights as a human being, which the Organization has championed over its 75 years of existence. Recalling atrocities in Canada mentioned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, he said that the existence of this shameful past does not preclude Canada from saying today that “we renew our commitment to human rights and reconciliation”. The armed forces of Myanmar obliterated the results of an election, jailed the opposition and killed hundreds of civilians. The international community must aspire to achieve greater unity, he stressed, not to interfere in States’ internal affairs, but to save lives, stop killings and bring countries to peace., BAE JONGIN (Republic of Korea), welcoming the resolution’s adoption, expressed hope that the strong message sent by an overwhelming majority today will complement the Security Council’s unified statements on the matter. He also expressed hope that the United Nations will continue to support democratic transition in Myanmar., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan) noted that the resolution adopted by an overwhelming number of votes today was the product of long consultations, during which Japan insisted that the text reflect regional voices, particularly that of ASEAN. Expressing regret that the final draft was put to a vote, he said that its adoption is nevertheless a signal of the international community’s condemnation of the acts of Myanmar’s armed forces, who must not misjudge this point., For information media.

Health
Protection and Human Rights",18 Jun 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Lu Thaw Township, Mu Traw District from December 1st to February 17th 2021. During this period, the Tatmadaw sent more soldiers to Lu Thaw Township. They patrolled local areas and indiscriminately fired mortar rounds at nearby villages on several instances, resulting in displacement and disrupting access to education. On December 30th 2020, local villagers held a protest to call on the Tatmadaw to withdraw from the area. In parallel, COVID-19 travel restrictions have resulted in difficulties for local villagers, as food and medicine supplies are running short., Introduction, This situation update describes the Tatmadaw activities in Lu Thaw Township, Mu Traw District between December 2020 and February 2021. It includes indiscriminate mortar shelling by Tatmadaw soldiers and displacement. In addition, this situation update highlights the situation of local villagers during the COVID-19 pandemic; and the living conditions displaced people face., Protest, On December 30th 2020, 3,982 villagers from Lu Thaw Township held a protest to call on Tatmadaw soldiers to withdraw from the area. The protest was held in T--- village, Naw Yoh Hta village tract. The protestors came from multiple village tracts: Hkay Poo, Naw Yoh Hta, Ler Muh Plaw and Saw Muh Plaw., COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 travel restrictions have resulted in difficulties for the villagers, notably when it comes to travelling, trading and buying or selling [inability to buy food and other household items, to sell their harvest, etc.]. However, local authorities allowed villagers to travel to buy food three days a month. The travel restrictions were put in place to prevent COVID-19 from reaching the local villages. The most common diseases that affect local villagers are malaria, runny nose, bloating, stomachache, diarrhea, joint pain and age-related sight issues. Furthermore, medicine and food supplies are running out because of the travel restrictions., Education, Many students were not able to attend school due to the COVID-19 pandemic [government schools were closed]. It was not easy for the students to move from [government] schools to [Karen Education and Culture Department - KECD] schools [some parents decided to enroll their children in KECD schools as they generally remained open throughout the pandemic]. There were not enough school materials and teachers in [KECD] schools [to accommodate these additional students]. It has also been difficult to hold meetings and communicate since the military coup [because the junta has disrupted telecommunications]., Tatmadaw activities, On January 1st 2021, a group of Tatmadaw soldiers based in Lu Thaw Township, fired mortar rounds at villages and farming areas [KHRG was not able to establish the exact location]. Local villagers were concerned and afraid, which prompted them to flee from their villages. They thought this situation was unfair, as it made them understand that genuine peace had yet to be achieved. This shows that the political situation in our area is not clear [stable], and that nothing is guaranteed. These kinds of incidents threaten our security. Local villagers in Lu Thaw Township do not want this kind of situations to happen. They want the [Karen National Union - KNU] leaders to prevent any further conflict., There are more and more Tatmadaw soldiers in their army camps in Lu Thaw Township, and they patrol with their mortars. That makes life difficult for local villagers and threatens their security. It is really necessary that the leaders pressure the Tatmadaw soldiers to withdraw from their bases in Lu Thaw Township., The Tatmadaw is operating drones in Lu Thaw Township and spying on the localities there. They must put an end to these activities. Villagers need assistance from the leaders to prevent such things from happening., Living conditions, After the ceasefire agreements [preliminary ceasefire and Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement], fighting decreased and the security situation improved. However, local villagers want the Tatmadaw soldiers to withdraw so that they can work on their farms freely and free from danger. Villagers insist that they would have no problem if there were only KNU [Karen National Liberation Army – KNLA soldiers] in their area., In December 2020, Tatmadaw soldiers started firing mortar rounds indiscriminately, and they continued to do so in January 2021. This made local villagers very worried and afraid. The villagers would like the [KNU] leaders and international news agencies to pressure the Tatmadaw soldiers to withdraw so they can live in peace. These are the demands of the villagers who live in the Salween Peace Park., Indiscriminate shelling by the Tatmadaw, On January 31st 2021, at 11:25 am, Tatmadaw’s Infantry Battalion (IB) # 60 from Wa Klay Too army camp fired four mortar rounds at K--- village, Hplah Hkoh village tract and at local villagers’ farms in the eastern part of Nyah Peh Day Place., On February 1st 2021, at 5:30 pm, Tatmadaw soldiers [KHRG was not able to identify the exact unit] fired four mortar shells at local villagers’ farm in Ghay Hkee, Paw Weh Loh and Eh Aaw Hkee places, Hplah Hkoh village tract., On February 2nd 2021, at 7:30 am, IB #39 from Paw Khay Hkoh and Keh Deh Kyoh army camps fired seven mortar rounds at D--- and H--- villages, Hplah Hkoh village tract; and into Paw Htoh Loh [Ler Muh Plaw village tract], Paw Hkaw Hkee [Ler Muh Plaw village tract] and Dwe Ghoh Thee Loh [Saw Muh Plaw village tract] places., On February 2nd 2021, at 12:42 am, IB #39 fired eight mortar rounds [at an unidentified location]., On February 2nd 2021 at 11:35 am, IB #39 fired 15 mortar rounds at the eastern part of Nyah Hpah Plaw [Saw Muh Plaw village tract], T’Hkaw Kyoh [Saw Muh Plaw village tract] and Htee Thoo Hta [Yeh Muh Plaw village tract] places. At 3:30 PM, IB #39 from Kheh Deh Kyoh army camp fired one more mortar round at H--- village [Hplah Hkoh village tract]. The mortar landed next to Haw Hta Plaw farms [Saw Muh Plaw village tract]. At 6:30 pm, a Tatmadaw excavator from Kheh Deh Kyoh army camp arrived at Paw Khay Hkoh army camp [KHRG was not able to establish why this excavator was sent]., On February 3rd 2021, at 9:25 am, IB #39 from Paw Khay Hkoh and Keh Deh Kyoh army camps fired 14 mortar rounds at local villagers’ farms in Ta Koo Deh area., On February 7th 2021 at 1:39 pm, IB #124 from Loh Kaw Kyoh army camp fired three mortar rounds at K--- village, Hplah Hkoh village tract., On February 10th 2021 at 8:30 am, IB #440 from Maw Poo and Kyoo Loo army camps fired eight mortar rounds at B--- village, Thay Thah Muh Der area, Tay Muh Deh village tract, Lu Thaw Township. As a result, B--- and M--- villagers fled to A---, P---, and O--- places, Kaw Loo Deh village tract. They did not receive humanitarian assistance from any organisation despite being in need of food, shelter, tarpaulin and hammocks. [They eventually returned to their village a few days later.], On February 10th 2021, at 2:15 pm, Tatmadaw’s Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #705 from Khaw Daw Hkoh army camp fired five mortar rounds at S--- village, Hkay Poo village tract and 25 mortar rounds at L--- village, Hkay Poo village tract. These Tatmadaw soldiers are guarding the area from K’Mah Moh to Hpapun town. The Tatmadaw sent about 120 soldiers to Hkaw Poo village tract, Bu Tho Township [KHRG was not able to establish the exact date]., On February 11th 2021, LIB #703 from Hsa Law Kyoh army camp trespassed into the restricted areas. As a result, villagers from Kaw Hteh Deh and Kleh Hta areas, Hkay Poo village tract fled their village and the local schools had to close., On February 12th 2021, at 5 pm, IB #440 from Maw Poo and Kyoo Loo army camps fired one mortar round at B--- village, E--- area, Tay Muh Deh village tract. At 6 pm, they fired one more mortar round at the same area. At 7:30 pm, IB #440 soldiers from Maw Poo army camp fired two mortar rounds at Thay Thah Muh Deh village, Tay Muh Deh village tract, and Blah Poo Hta area, Saw Muh Plaw village tract., On February 13th 2021, at 8 am, LIB #402 and LIB #409 [Military Operations Command (MOC) #8] from Hkoo Thoo Hta army camp indiscriminately fired mortar rounds and small arms. They were led by Battalion commander Way Lin Htun. Because of the shelling, two buffaloes were killed and three more were injured in Kah Hta place, Hkay Poo village tract., On February 13th 2021, at 3:30 pm, villagers from S--- village, Kah Hta place, Hkay Poo village tract fled from their village and local schools had to close because LIB #705 soldiers from Khaw Daw Hkoh army camp patrolled and trespassed into restricted areas. Villagers are always afraid when Tatmadaw soldiers trespass [into KNU territory, as it could result in fighting with the KNLA]. At 4:20 pm, Tatmadaw soldiers from Hkoo Thoo Hta army camp fired two mortar rounds at Kah Hta place., On February 14th 2021, from 12:24 to 12:50 am, Tatmadaw soldiers fired three more mortar rounds at B--- village, Tay Muh Deh village tract. On February 15th 2021 at 6 am, LIB #402 and LIB #409 shelled B--- village again, prompting 202 local community members [91 women and 111 men] from 25 households to flee. The local school also had to close. There were two teachers, 12 female students, and 28 male students. They were all displaced., On February 17th 2021, 514 villagers from 74 households in K---, L--- and W--- villages, Hkay Poo village tract had to flee from their villages because Tatmadaw soldiers from Hsa Law Kyoh and Khaw Daw Hkoh army camps patrolled in KNU-controlled areas. After they fled, villagers were afraid to return to their village due to the presence of Tatmadaw soldiers. The schools in all three villages had to close temporarily. There were 21 students in W--- and H--- schools; and 30 students in K--- school.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-situation-update-indiscriminate-shelling-tatmadaw-results

Protection and Human Rights",18 Jun 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bilin and Thaton Townships, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District between April and May 2021, including skirmishes between the KNLA and the SAC military, as well as several instances of indiscriminate shelling by SAC forces. In late April, the BGF sent 200 soldiers to Doo Tha Htoo District to relieve their troops based in Ta Paw and Lay Kay army camps. During the troop rotation, the BGF indiscriminately fired mortar rounds at the villages surrounding their camps and forced civilians to transport BGF soldiers on their trucks. On April 23rd 2021, a villager from Kyeik Kaw Thein Seik town was forced to give a ride to SAC soldiers. He was killed in the crossfire after his truck was ambushed by KNLA soldiers., 1. Indiscriminate shelling by SAC forces in Bilin Township, On April 4th 2021, Border Guard Force (BGF) [and State Administration Council - SAC] soldiers [from Lay Kay SAC army camp] indiscriminately fired mortar rounds at Lay Kay village, Lay Kay village, P’Ya Raw village tract, Bilin Township, destroying one farm hut belonging to a local villager. Fortunately, the owner was not inside the hut on the night of the incident. [Another civilian building was also damaged.], 2. Fighting breaks out during a protest in support of the NUG in Thaton Township, On April 23rd 2021, at around 8 am, fighting broke out between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and an unknown SAC unit from Thaton army camp. The incident happened on the highway between Thaton town and Yangon town, beside Kaung Kyet shop, Thaton Town, Thaton Township. On that day, local civilians were holding a protest in support of the National Unity Government (NUG) under the protection of KNLA soldiers. However, fighting broke out after SAC soldiers arrived at the protest location., 3. Indiscriminate shelling by SAC forces in Bilin Township, On April 23rd 2021, the SAC Artillery Unit #314 based in Htee Hpoe Nya Lee Hkee army camp, near Kyaw T’Raw village, Shway Yaw Pya village tract, Bilin Township indiscriminately fired mortar rounds at nearby villages such as Ma Yan Gone, Mi Chyaung Aaing and Htee Nya Paw, among others. Since April 23rd 2021, Artillery Unit #314 has been regularly firing artillery rounds at local communities, especially those located in areas controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU). These rounds are bigger and have a longer range than 120mm mortar rounds. The platform they are fired from must be moved by truck. The SAC artillery rounds landed in villages such as T’Rer Hkee, T’Rer Wah, Yo Poe and Htee Poo Wah [among others], T’Rer Hkee village tract., As a result of the SAC indiscriminate shelling, one Ma Yan Gone villager, Saw T---, sustained a shrapnel injury to his leg. Many plantations local villagers rely on for their livelihoods have also been damaged, and no compensation was provided to their owners. Moreover, about 3,000 villagers from the areas affected have been fleeing their villages since April 27th. The only villagers who still remain in the area [hiding in the forest near their villages] are the villagers who do not have relatives in towns or in other places., 4. Villager killed in crossfire after being forced to transport SAC soldiers, On April 23rd 2021, an unidentified villager from Myaink Teh Su section, Kyeik Kaw Thein Seik town, died during a skirmish between the KNLA and SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #406, Military Operations Command (MOC) #8 [under the authority of Battalion Commander Kyaw Yaw Hla] beside the vehicle road near Chaw Bee Na and Kaw Ler villages, Kaw Ler village tract, Thaton Township. Before the incident, the victim was delivering bricks to Noh Htoe Day village, Maw Lay village tract., He encountered SAC LIB #406 soldiers from T’La Aww Poe Klah army camp on his way back from Noh Htoe Day village. The soldiers forced him to stop and to take them on his truck to an unknown location, so he could not refuse this order. Unfortunately, [the truck was ambushed by] KNLA [soldiers] along the way. The driver was killed during the ensuing skirmish. Some SAC soldiers were also killed, and others got injured. Local villagers think that these LIB #406 soldiers were on their way to help the SAC troops involved in the fighting in Thaton town [see Section 2]., 5. BGF activities in Bilin Township, Most of the SAC military operations between Ta Paw army camp, Ta Paw village tract and Lay Kay army camps, P’Ya Raw village tract, Bilin Township are conducted by the BGF. [According to information received by KHRG, BGF soldiers make up around 90% of the SAC forces in the area.], Between April 27th and May 3rd 2021, BGF Battalion #1014 led by Bo Tin Way and Battalion Commander Bo Maung Chit sent about 200 soldiers to Doo Tha Htoo District. Local villagers do not know where these soldiers are from and they claim that they were sent to relieve the troops based in Ta Paw and Lay Kay army camps., On April 29th 2021, fighting between the KNLA and BGF broke out when these BGF soldiers arrived at Baw Ta Pro village. The soldiers then crossed the Baw Naw Kloe River at Ha Ta Reh Place and headed towards Ta Paw army camp, Ta Paw village tract, Bilin Township. They reached the camp on May 1st 2021. While staying at the camp, the BGF indiscriminately fired mortar rounds at nearby villages, destroying one farm hut belonging to a Ta Paw villager on May 1st 2021., The BGF troops spent the night at the camp before continuing their journey towards Lay Kay army camp on May 2nd. They always fired mortar rounds indiscriminately when arriving and leaving their camps to clear the road [and surrounding areas of KNLA soldiers]., On May 3rd and 4th 2021, the BGF in Lay Kay army camp fired mortar rounds at nearby villages. At least five of these rounds did not explode. One house was damaged and one villager sustained injuries as a result of the shelling. In addition, Saw Z---, a Lay Kay villager, also sustained a shrapnel injury on May 3rd and his car’s windows were damaged., In the afternoon of May 3rd 2021, BGF soldiers ordered Lay Kay villagers to provide four trucks for their soldiers’ return to Ta Paw army camp, but the villagers could only provide three trucks. [The truck owners had to drive the BGF soldiers back to Ta Paw army camp.] KHRG does not know whether these villagers received payment. Even though the truck owners were afraid and did not feel safe, they had to take the soldiers back to their camp nonetheless. Local civilians do not know where the BGF troops went after that. Some BGF soldiers who used to be based in Lay Kay army camp remained there after the new troops arrived, so villagers assume that the BGF sent reinforcements instead of just relieving their troops this time., According to a KHRG researcher, several skirmishes broke out while the BGF was sending more soldiers to relieve its troops based in the area because local villagers could hear gunfire every day. However, the KHRG researcher and local villagers could not tell whether it was the sound of fighting or indiscriminate shelling. The fighting paused after the BGF troops [that were relieved] returned to their area of origin in early May 2021. However, fighting is still on-going along the border between District 5 [Mu Traw] and District 1 [Doo Tha Htoo]., Moreover, from April 27th to May 18th 2021, SAC helicopters also conducted a couple of reconnaissance missions over Bilin and Thaton townships., 6. Fighting, On May 16th 2021, fighting broke out on the road between Bilin and Na Gyi towns between KNLA Battalion #3 and SAC soldiers who were sending rations to Meh Pray Hkee army camp, Meh Pray Hkee village, Meh Pray Hkee village tract, Bilin Township. The SAC troops then headed towards their army camps in Mu Traw District with the rations., According to an update provided by a KHRG researcher on May 18th 2021, fighting and indiscriminate shelling happen regularly along the vehicle roads used by SAC and BGF troops. This is notably the case along the road between Ka Ma Moe Town and Wan Bo Taw Place and the road between Bilin Town and Nan Gyi village., 7. The KNLA and BGF restrict the transportation of food, In response to the BGF sending more troops, the KNLA banned villagers from transporting large amounts of rice without obtaining a permission letter from the village tract authorities starting on May 1st 2021. The KNLA took this decision because they were worried rice supplies might be sent to the Tatmadaw in Mu Traw District., On May 17th, one villager [who was transporting food or household items] was stopped by the BGF in front of Ta Paw army camp so he/she showed his permission letter to the BGF. After learning that the KNLA had restricted the transportation of rations [rice], the BGF forbade villagers from transporting rice [even with a permission letter]. The new restriction took effect on that same day. [This seems to be a retaliatory measure against the KNLA]., 8. Education, Local teachers, KHRG researchers and villagers think that most of the students from government schools will go to Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools this year [many teachers have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), which resulted in the closure of government schools]. However, KECD schools will not have enough classroom/dormitory space, teachers and funding to accommodate all these students., 9. Healthcare, Government hospitals are closed as most doctors and health workers became members of the CDM. Only private clinics remain open. Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) clinics remain open, but they do not have sufficient medical supplies or the ability to treat major illnesses.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/doo-tha-htoo-situation-update-fighting-and-indiscriminate-shelling-sac-forces-april
"Myanmar: Timely support and action by Security Council ‘really paramount’, says UN Special Envoy",News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,18 Jun 2021,"The UN Special Envoy for Myanmar said on Friday she has called for timely action from the Security Council in response to the ongoing crisis in the Southeast Asian country stemming from the military coup in February., Speaking to journalists following her closed-door briefing to the Council, Christine Schraner Burgener described the situation in Myanmar as “very worrisome” and “very bad”., Alarming, on the ground, Some 600 people have been killed in the nearly five months since the coup, she said, and 6,000 arrested, with 5,000 still in detention. Around 100 people have “disappeared” without trace., The crisis has uprooted some 175,000 people, which has added to internal displacement that existed before the military seized power and detained political leaders, including President U Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. Roughly 10,000 refugees have fled to India and Thailand., “I asked the Security Council for timely support and action; that it’s really paramount,” she said. “We have an alarming situation on the ground for all civilian people because the health system collapsed completely, and food security is also in danger.”, Ms Schraner Burgener warned that around half the population could be living below the poverty line next year if the situation continues., “I urged the Council to speak in unity and especially against violence, and also that the political prisoners will be released as quickly as possible,” she said., Questioned about the lack of Council unity on Myanmar, the Special Envoy responded that she has also held bilateral talks with ambassadors., “Clearly not all share the same position, what they should do together, but my role is always to urge them to show action and to be united,” she said., Ms Schraner Burgener further reported that violations have increased in Myanmar, while violence is occurring in regions where it had not occurred before, and on the part of ethnic armed organizations., Discussions and dialogue, She said violence has also emanated “from the ethnic armed organizations who were attacked also by airstrikes from the army, or keep people from other regions under their protection, and therefore I think it’s important that we have an all-inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders”., “I am in contact with almost every ethnic armed organization to discuss how we can solve the overall problem in the country to find a peaceful solution. And I’m sure talking is always better than violence.”, Ms Schraner Burgener will brief the UN General Assembly later on Friday, and will continue her engagement in the region. She said she recently had an “open discussion” in Jakarta with the military’s commander-in-chief, and expressed hope that talks will continue., “Clearly, I can imagine that he would not like to see me now in Myanmar because the people know me…and they would probably be very encouraged by my presence, so I think this is not in the interest of the army,” she said., “But as long as I can have contact with them, that is the most important thing. And I will soon also contact them again to bring them also in a dialogue.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-timely-support-and-action-security-council-really-paramount-says-un-special

There are now an estimated 200,000 people who have been displaced within Myanmar since 1 February, a nearly 15% increase since two weeks ago. In southeast Myanmar, the security situation remains volatile, with intense armed clashes in Kayah State, Kayin State and eastern Bago Region, as the MAF clashed with both the Kayah People’s Defense Forces and Karen National Union. Among over 160,000 people displaced in or from the southeast since 1 February, some 97,000 are in Kayah State and 48,000 in Kayin State. Following an outbreak of conflict in an area of Kayin State, some 400 Myanmar nationals crossed into Thailand’s Tak Province in early June, but have since returned to Myanmar., In Chin State, new fighting between the MAF and local defence groups has further increased displacement and spread into Magway Region, where an additional 5,000 people have recently been displaced. Violence has also continued in Kachin State, with more armed clashes between the MAF and the Kachin Independence Army, as well as instances of explosions and arson. As a result of the situation in Chin State, Indian state authorities have been reported in the media as estimating that the border states neighbouring Myanmar are currently sheltering around 15,000 new arrivals, although UNHCR is unable to verify precise figures.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-regional-bureau-asia-and-pacific-rbap-myanmar-emergency-external-update-15-june

Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",17 Jun 2021,"By Fiona Wong and Anders Lee, Last week in Southeast Asia, anti-coup demonstrations in Myanmar continued amid growing dissatisfaction over the response of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to the situation. Meanwhile, targeted killings of individuals perceived to be aligned with the junta continued. Fighting between the Myanmar military and local defense groups also continued unabated in Chin state and Sagaing region. Elsewhere in Myanmar, fighting between rival Shan ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) continues to affect civilians, with reports of villagers being detained by the EAOs and displaced by the fighting. In the Philippines, fighting between state forces and the communist New People’s Army (NPA) increased significantly following a landmine attack by the NPA that resulted in two civilian deaths. Finally, in Thailand, anti-government demonstrations continued to decrease last week following the granting of bail to detained protest leaders the week prior., In Myanmar, anti-coup demonstrations continued last week as protesters held rallies against the military junta across the country, including in Mandalay, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, and Yangon regions, as well as northern Shan state. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts led by ASEAN to resolve the political stalemate intensified, as two ASEAN envoys met with the junta’s leader on 5 June. The visit drew anger from anti-coup supporters who remain skeptical of ASEAN’s efforts, criticizing the bloc for not meeting with representatives from the National Unity Government, which they view as the legitimate government of Myanmar (RFA, 11 June 2021). At a protest held on the same day in Mandalay, protesters set the ASEAN flag ablaze to express their anger at ASEAN’s decision to only meet with representatives of the junta (The Guardian, 6 June 2021)., Separately, targeted killings of police officers, local administrators, and individuals perceived to be in support of or connected to the military continued last week, albeit in lower numbers compared to the week prior. Notably, a member of the Mon Unity Party (MUP) who contested the 2020 general election was shot dead by unidentified gunmen on 8 June. The attack comes a week after a member of another opposition party, the People’s Pioneer Party (PPP), was also killed by unknown assailants. Both the MUP and PPP have been criticized by anti-coup supporters after members of the parties were appointed as officials under the military regime (Irrawaddy, 5 February 2021; HURFOM, 24 February 2021)., Meanwhile, heavy fighting between the Myanmar military and local defense groups was reported in Chin state and Sagaing region. In Chin state, the Myanmar military and the Chinland Defense Force (CDF) clashed on 6 June, after the military attempted to deploy more troops to conduct raids on villages in Mindat township. The CDF claims that around 50 military soldiers were killed in the clashes (Irrawaddy, 7 June 2021). In Sagaing region, the military reportedly suffered heavy casualties during a shootout with the People’s Defense Force – Kani (Irrawaddy, 10 June 2021)., Elsewhere, rival Shan armed groups — the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army-North (SSPP/SSA-N) and the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S) — engaged in a days-long battle over territory in southern Shan state. Civilians continue to be affected by the fighting between the two groups, as villagers accused of being connected to the RCSS/SSA-S were abducted by SSPP/SSA-N. Additionally, hundreds of villagers have been displaced by the clashes and are seeking refuge in monasteries (Shan Herald Agency for News, 11 June 2021). Clashes between the two warring groups have continued unabated despite repeated calls by civilians to end the conflict and instead support the Myanmar public in fighting against the military (Burma News International, 8 June 2021)., Meanwhile, in the Philippines, clashes between the communist NPA and state forces spiked last week following a landmine explosion in Masbate city that killed two civilians. The deadly explosion garnered widespread condemnation after one of the victims was identified as a top university footballer, forcing the NPA to issue a rare apology (Philippine Daily Inquirer; 8 June 2021). Aside from the government and the Commission on Human Rights, political groups that share ideological affinities with the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) — which oversees the NPA — also issued condemnations of the attack (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 9 June 2021). These groups include the New Patriotic Alliance (BAYAN) and the Patriotic Coalition of the People (Makabayan) bloc in Congress. Alongside their condemnation, Makabayan and its allied groups called for the resumption of peace talks between the CPP and the government. However, the government rebuked the Makabayan bloc’s pronouncements, calling it an attempt to avoid “exacting accountability from the NPA” (Philippine News Agency, 9 June 2021). Throughout the rest of the week, fighting between state forces and the NPA increased as state forces pursued the NPA rebels responsible for the explosion., Lastly, in Thailand, anti-government demonstrations continued to decrease last week, after all remaining detained protest leaders were granted bail the week prior. The granting of bail comes after months of opposition from anti-government activists, including a 57-day hunger strike by one of the detained activists, Parit “Penguin” Chiwarak (Thaiger, 13 May 2021). It also marks an end to daily protests in front of the Supreme Court in Bangkok calling for the release of the detained protest leaders. These daily protests, during which participants stood still for one hour and 12 minutes to oppose Section 112 of the Criminal Code, or the royal defamation law, lasted for 71 consecutive days. The release of the protest leaders also comes amid a relentless third wave of COVID-19 infections in the country that has been driven primarily by infections in overcrowded prisons (BBC, 17 May 2021). Several of the detained protest leaders contracted COVID-19 while in detention (Prachatai, 2 June 2021).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-5-11-june-2021

Safety and Security",16 Jun 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., UN WARNS OF “IMMINENT FURTHER BLOODSHED” IN MYANMAR, The security forces in Myanmar have killed at least 865 people since the 1 February military coup, while more than 4,900 people remain arbitrarily detained. Despite the deadly crackdown and escalating armed conflict in some states, pro-democracy protests continue. Armed resistance is also growing. On 15 June the military burned down the village of Kin Ma, in Magway region – destroying over 180 homes and forcing 1,000 people to flee – in retaliation for local attacks on the military. At least two elderly villagers were burned to death., Meanwhile, in response to escalating armed conflict in Kayah and Chin states, on Friday, 11 June, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, warned of “imminent further bloodshed and suffering” in Myanmar. According to Bachelet, “state security forces have continued to use heavy weaponry, including airstrikes, against armed groups and against civilians and civilian objects, including Christian churches.” At least eight churches have been destroyed or damaged by the military in recent weeks in Kayah and Shan states and the UN has received credible reports of civilians being used as human shields by the military., More than 108,000 people have fled their homes in Kayah State over the past three weeks. On 8 June the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, appealed to the international community for immediate action, stressing that, “mass deaths from starvation, disease, and exposure, on a scale we have not yet seen since the February 1 coup, could occur in Kayah State absent immediate action.”, On Monday, 14 June, the trial of Myanmar’s democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, also began in the capital, Naypyidaw. The military has charged Aung San Suu Kyi with various alleged crimes and if found guilty she could face up to 15 years in prison., This Friday, 18 June, both the UN Security Council and General Assembly will meet to discuss the situation in Myanmar. The General Assembly is expected to adopt a resolution that calls on the military to “immediately and unconditionally release President Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi … and all those who have been arbitrarily detained, charged or arrested” and calls on “all member states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar.”, All UN member states need to uphold their responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar, including by imposing targeted sanctions and an arms embargo. There should be no diplomatic recognition of an illegal military junta that is committing atrocities against their own people., NIGERIA FACES NEW SECURITY CRISIS AS BANDITS KILL 150 PEOPLE, Communities in north-west Nigeria are coming under increased attack from armed groups – described as “bandits” by locals – who are engaged in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape. At least 88 people were killed when bandits attacked seven villages in Kebbi state on 3 June. Less than a week later, on 8 June, armed groups attacked Munawa, Malele and Randa villages in Zamfara state and kidnapped 60 women. Then from 10-11 June armed men on motorcycles attacked the villages of Kadawa, Kwata, Maduba, Ganda Samu, Saulawa and Askawa in Zamfara state, killing more than 50 people., The alarming rise in violence in recent months has caused a humanitarian and protection crisis, with many people fleeing their homes, farms and grazing lands. According to the International Organization for Migration, there were more than 124,000 displaced persons in Zamfara State as of February. The bandits have also perpetrated attacks on secondary schools in Zamfara, Katsina and Niger states, kidnapping more than 800 children since December 2020., Many of Nigeria’s bandit groups have been formed over the past decade in response to inter-communal conflict over land and resources. While the bandit gangs are driven largely by financial motives, many bandits come from the Fulani herder community and prey on settled farming communities, increasing ethnic tensions., Meanwhile, civilians in the north-east of Nigeria have been severely impacted by increased attacks by the armed extremist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa. Since the beginning of the year, these groups have conducted dozens of raids on military bases and remote towns, forcing thousands of civilians to flee., Facing the combined threat of large-scale banditry and ongoing attacks by armed extremist groups, Nigeria’s armed forces are now deployed in two-thirds of the states in the country. President Muhammadu Buhari is facing intense criticism for the security forces’ inability to provide civilians with adequate protection. There have also been reports of human rights violations and abuses perpetrated by the security forces., Military operations alone cannot comprehensively defeat the combined threat of bandits and armed extremism in northern Nigeria. Dr. Simon Adams, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “the government also needs to address the grievances of local communities in the north and confront structural issues of endemic poverty, corruption, youth unemployment and environmental degradation that are exploited by bandits, armed extremists and other groups to recruit and grow.”, HAZARA MINORITY UNDER ATTACK IN AFGHANISTAN, On Monday, 13 June, seven civilians were killed when bombs were detonated in Dasht-e-Barchi, a predominantly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul, Afghanistan. The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that the bombing targeted “disbeliever Shiites.” Earlier in June at least 18 people were killed in a series of attacks in Dasht-e-Barchi when four minibuses were bombed. On 8 June ISIL-K also carried out an attack on staff from the humanitarian mine-clearance organization, HALO Trust, killing 10 civilians and injuring 16, many of whom were Hazara., The Hazara are one of Afghanistan’s most vulnerable ethnic and religious minorities and have frequently been targeted by armed extremists, with an increasing number of attacks taking place in Dasht-e-Barchi. On 8 May a bomb attack in front of the Sayed Al-Shuhada school in Dasht-e-Barchi killed over 85 Hazaras, many of them school children. During May 2020 unidentified attackers also stormed a maternity hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi, killing at least 24 civilians, including newborn babies and mothers., Attacks targeting civil servants, journalists, professional women, human rights defenders, politicians and minority communities have all surged since the start of intra-Afghan peace negotiations last September. ISIL-K have claimed responsibility for some of these attacks, while the government often blames the Taliban, who deny responsibility. The intra-Afghan peace talks are now stalled as the Taliban and ISIL-K intensify their attacks on both government forces and civilians., Jahaan Pittalwala, Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “until all parties to the conflict meaningfully commit to a comprehensive ceasefire, targeted attacks on Afghan civilians, including religious and ethnic minorities, will continue to claim innocent lives. Intra-Afghan negotiations must prioritize the protection of civilians and adherence to international humanitarian and human rights law, as well as justice for victims.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-257-myanmar-burma-nigeria-and-afghanistan

"Myanmar: As Aung San Suu Kyi goes on trial, ASEAN’s indecision is enabling military rampage",News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,15 Jun 2021,"- Aung San Suu Kyi faces seven charges and decades in prison as the UN General Assembly sets to vote on a landmark resolution on Myanmar., - Since the coup, more than 800 civilians including 58 children were killed, more than 4800 people were detained and more than 100,000 displaced in Kayah State alone., - ASEAN states play pivotal role. They must support call for UN arms embargo or will effectively shield military’s crimes against the civilian population., - ASEAN senior official's call for release of political opposition welcome, but other ASEAN states must follow., The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) must stop shielding the Myanmar military from international pressure and accountability, Amnesty International said today as the country's human rights crisis continues to worsen dramatically., With the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi having started on 14 June, the organization further urges all ASEAN member states to finally get behind calls for the release of all those arbitrarily detained in the country and support measures to stop the flow of weapons to the Myanmar military., “ASEAN’s usual commitment to non-interference is enabling the military’s deadly rampage, fuelling a human rights and humanitarian crisis that will sink both ASEAN’s credibility and the very stability it seeks to uphold,” said Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research., “Millions of people in Myanmar are losing faith in ASEAN. The regional bloc must change course and offer a lifeline to people in Myanmar by getting behind international efforts to protect civilians and urge the release of all those arbitrarily detained, including Aung San Suu Kyi.”, Aung San Suu Kyi is currently facing a total of seven charges. If found guilty, she can face decades in prison and will effectively be barred from holding office again. Her charges include violating Section 55 of the Anti-Corruption Law, the Official Secrets Act, Section 67 of the Telecommunications Law and the Export and Import Law (possessing walkie talkies in her home). She also faces two charges under Section 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law and “incitement” under Section 505 (b) of the Penal Code., “The military is digging deep into its arsenal of repressive laws, including those from the colonial-era, in a desperate attempt to silence Aung San Suu Kyi, opposition leaders and many other vocal critics who have been arbitrarily detained,” said Emerlynne Gil., The Myanmar security forces continue to kill, injure and arrest civilians. Since the 1 February coup, an estimated 863 civilians, including 58 children, have been killed and a countless number of people have been injured, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners – Burma (AAPPB). Reports of torture and deaths in custody keep emerging. Internet restrictions remain in place, and media freedom is severely restricted., Meanwhile, fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and groups of protesters taking up arms is escalating and spreading across the country, killing or injuring civilians, damaging civilian properties, and displacing hundreds of thousands of women, men and children. Recent clashes, including air raids, in Karenni or Kayah State alone has displaced estimated 100,000 civilians who are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Approximately 200,000 civilians have been displaced so far this year, adding to over 300,000 existing displaced persons reliant on humanitarian aid., High-level meeting exposes faltering ASEAN diplomacy, On 4 June, a high-level delegation comprised of ASEAN Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi and Erywan Pehin Yusof, the second minister for foreign affairs for Brunei, the current chair of ASEAN, met with coup leader and head of the Myanmar military authorities, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar’s capital., The high-level meeting in Nay Pyi Taw reported little tangible progress on ASEAN’s “Five-Point Consensus” on the Myanmar crisis, including calls for the cessation of violence, humanitarian access and the appointment of an ASEAN special envoy on Myanmar., ASEAN must implement a call for Myanmar to release arbitrary detainees, In one welcome advance, in a statement after the meeting, the Chairman of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, Erywan Pehin Yusof, called for the release of political detainees in Myanmar., According to AAPPB, as of 13 June, 4,863 people are currently detained or have been sentenced in in the wake of the 1 February coup, including the country’s elected civilian leadership., “The belated commitment of a senior ASEAN official to the release of the political opposition is welcome and essential and we hope that this view is adopted as consensus by ASEAN,” said Emerlynne Gil. “It should also be clear that ASEAN’s mediation efforts would be all but impossible if key stakeholders are all behind bars.”, “ASEAN should place top priority on demanding that the Myanmar military immediately release not only prominent political detainees, but all of the thousands of people arbitrarily detained, and call for their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” said Emerlynne Gil., Shocking lack of progress since ASEAN emergency summit, The Five-Point Consensus was agreed at an emergency summit in Jakarta attended by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on 24 April, but the Myanmar military authorities have since repeatedly stated that it would not act upon the plan until the country had reached “stability.” Between the ASEAN summit and 13 June, 115 more people have been killed and 1,474 more people are arbitrarily detained or sentenced., ""Myanmar's generals are making a mockery of ASEAN's meek efforts to lead the international response - continuing to kill, jail, and drive the country into the ground before the ink had dried on ASEAN's 'Five Point Consensus',"" said Emerlynne Gil., “The regional bloc must get behind efforts at the UN to protect civilians, ensure their humanitarian needs are adequately met, urgently stop the flow of weapons to the military and secure the release of all those arbitrarily detained.”, Growing calls at the UN for a global arms embargo on Myanmar, ASEAN states continue to negotiate with the states sponsoring a UN General Assembly resolution to address the human rights crisis in Myanmar, of which only some of the ASEAN members are supportive of a comprehensive arms embargo., “ASEAN must support the passing of a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a halt of weapons transfers to the Myanmar military. Anything less is an abdication of ASEAN’s leadership role on the Myanmar crisis, and shows ASEAN is siding with a military that is continuing to kill and imprison unarmed protesters and other civilians., Even if adopted, a call for halting transfers by the UNGA has only moral force and may not deter the major arms suppliers to the military – including China, Russia and India. The UN Security Council must urgently then make a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar mandatory for all states to stop the military's killing spree against its own people., “Whether through willful obstruction or internal disagreement, ASEAN has become the Myanmar military's shield at the highest levels of global diplomacy. Instead, ASEAN states must stand together against rampant military atrocities and urgently get behind the calls for a global and comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-goes-trial-asean-s-indecision-enabling-military-rampage

In Cotabato City, the main referral hospital which covers Central Mindanao including the Bangsamoro region announced that it is operating beyond full capacity, and is in need of high-flow oxygen machines, mechanical ventilators, and pop-up laboratories for swab testing. The Bangsamoro Ministry of Health, with support of UNFPA, convened a Health Cluster meeting on 10 June to discuss the situation and support to be provided to government hospitals. WHO is supporting the testing capacity of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and has called on partners to scale-up support for Risk Communication and Community Engagement., AFGHANISTAN, Heavy fighting and the displacement of civilians in eastern Afghanistan continues across Laghman and Nangarhar provinces, including the use of airstrikes. As of 12 June, sporadic fighting is still ongoing near and within the Nurgaram District Administrative Centre in Nuristan Province, Bad Pakh and Alishing districts in Laghman province, Hisarak district in Nangarhar Province, and Ghaziabad in Kunar Province. Military operations are ongoing across Nangarhar Province with a focus on Pachiragam, Achin, Dehbala and Surkhrod districts. Humanitarian partners have mobilized more resources to meet needs identified through the ongoing assessments. Based on assessment findings, food, NFIs, WASH and health needs are the most urgent. As of 10 June, inter-agency teams have assessed some 23,000 IDPs in Laghman province with 19,000 IDPs verified as being in need of assistance. Some 7,000 IDPs across the province have received a double-ration of food assistance. Four mobile health teams have assisted 1,800 IDPs with basic health and nutrition care. Partners have also distributed some 400 NFI kits and 400 hygiene kits to IDPs as well as more than 181,000 litres of clean water through trucking. In Nangarhar province, inter-agency teams have also assessed over 12,000 IDPs across four districts of which 5,000 IDPs have been verified as being in need of assistance as of 10 June.

"Myanmar: Stop Holding Family, Friends Hostage",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jun 2021,"Detaining People to Coerce Others is Collective Punishment, (Bangkok) – Myanmar security forces are arbitrarily arresting and detaining family and friends of activists, protesters, and opposition members, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should immediately and unconditionally release all those wrongfully held and end all collective punishment, which violates fundamental principles of international human rights law., Since the February 1, 2021, military coup in Myanmar, security forces have detained at least 76 people, including an infant, during raids when they were unable to find the person they sought to arrest, according to documentation by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). At least 48 of those people are still in detention, with some now held for more than three months., “Seizing family members and friends as hostages is a thuggish tactic by Myanmar’s security forces to terrorize the population and coerce activists to turn themselves in,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director. “The authorities should end the practice of collective punishment immediately and release everyone held on this illegal basis.”, Security forces unable to find specific suspects have arrested their parents, children, other relatives, and friends who happened to be present during the search. Cases include:, In some cases, witnesses allege that the security forces beat the relatives before detaining them. Tin Htut Paing, an activist who is in hiding, told the media that, on May 2, security forces searching for him and his brother beat his 90-year-old grandmother and 64-year-old mother. Security forces detained his mother and charged her with “incitement.” On May 28, she was sentenced to three years in prison. According to the AAPP, security forces searching for Associate Judge Kaung Myat Thu of Chaung-U Township Court beat his mother before arresting her. His mother is still in detention, Young children and even an infant have also been detained, at least temporarily. Security forces detained five relatives of strike leader Ko Jay Lah, including two girls aged 2 and 4. Similarly, forces searching for protest leader U Tan Win detained his wife and 20-day-old baby. While in both cases the family members were released later the same day, the arrests send a chilling message to activists and members of the Civil Disobedience Movement that no member of their family is safe, Human Rights Watch said., The detention of people based solely on their relationship to another person is a form of collective punishment, which violates the right to liberty and security of person and the right to a fair trial, Human Rights Watch said., “Myanmar’s junta has taken unlawful detention to a noxious new level by detaining those close to people who themselves should not be facing arrest,” Robertson said. “Concerned governments should urgently impose targeted sanctions and a global arms embargo or expect the junta to continue to raise the stakes on abusive actions.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-stop-holding-family-friends-hostage

The ensuing waves of mass protest grew increasingly violent. The political crisis resulted in a collapse of public services and widespread armed conflict, impacting the lives of people living in urban centres as well as remote rural villages., Communities where many ACT Alliance partners are working face massive impacts as a result of the combined emergencies of armed conflict and COVID-19. Market systems and food production systems are disrupted due movement restrictions imposed to prevent spread of COVID-19 and related to the conflict itself. In some parts of the country, farmers are not planting rice this monsoon season (May – October) because they fear that this substantial investment will just result in their crops being confiscated by the combatants. The banking sector has been severely disrupted and people are very cash poor. Food prices have started to skyrocket., As of 01 June 2021, the situation has further deteriorated, and the needs have increased. Priority needs include food, shelter, and access to water and latrines. The lack of WASH facilities may lead to deadly diarrheal outbreaks and entire communities are vulnerable to COVID-19 because large numbers of displaced households are now sleeping together in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces such as churches and monasteries. Furthermore, cases of malaria have been reported among the displaced population sheltering in the jungle following the early arrival of the monsoons. Access to IDPs remains restricted due to ongoing fighting, remote muddy terrain, road blockages, and increasing landmine risks. Local partners and experts warn of a looming food security crisis if internally displaced persons (IDPs) are not able to return to their homes to tend to their crops and livestock. The full onset of the monsoon season in June will pose additional logistical challenges for humanitarian access.

Bachelet issues strong warning of imminent further bloodshed and suffering in Myanmar,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,11 Jun 2021,"GENEVA (11 June 2021) – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday warned that a further escalation in violence is unfolding across Myanmar and must be halted to prevent even greater loss of life and a deepening humanitarian emergency. Reports indicate a military build-up, notably in Kayah State in the east and Chin State in the west of the country., “As I had feared, armed conflict and other violence are intensifying in many parts of Myanmar, including Kayah State, Chin State and Kachin State, with the violence particularly intense in areas with significant ethnic and religious minority groups,” Bachelet said. “State security forces have continued to use heavy weaponry, including airstrikes, against armed groups and against civilians and civilian objects, including Christian churches., “There appear to be no efforts towards de-escalation but rather a build-up of troops in key areas, contrary to the commitments the military made to ASEAN to cease the violence.”, Credible reports indicate that security forces have used civilians as human shields, shelled civilian homes and churches in Loikaw, Phekon and Demoso in Kayah State and blocked humanitarian access, including by attacking humanitarian actors., “More than 108,000 people have fled their homes in Kayah State over the last three weeks alone, many into forest areas with little or no food, water, sanitation or medical care. These are people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance,” Bachelet said., “Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, have a duty to protect civilians. The international community needs to unify in its demand that the Tatmadaw cease the outrageous use of heavy artillery against civilians and civilian objects and respect the principle of distinction. The newly formed “people’s defence forces” and other armed groups must also take all feasible measures to protect civilians.”, The High Commissioner appealed for hospitals, schools and places of worship to be protected throughout the country. The Office has received credible reports of several incidents in which hospitals, schools and religious institutions have been entered and occupied by the Tatmadaw, fired upon and damaged in military actions., Explosions that have occurred in or near schools are likely to dissuade parents from enrolling their children for the new school year. Thousands of schoolteachers have refused to return to work or have been suspended from their jobs by the military authorities. As a result, the vast majority of children will not be able to access their right to education., Credible reports indicate that a minimum of 860 people have been killed by security forces since 1 February, mostly in the context of protests., Meanwhile, sweeping arrests of activists, journalists and opponents of the regime have continued across the country, with credible sources indicating that at least 4,804 people remain in arbitrary detention. The High Commissioner said she was also deeply troubled by reports of detainees being tortured, and of collective punishment of family members of activists – one mother of an activist was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in place of her son on 28 May., “Rather than seeking dialogue, the military is branding its opponents as ‘terrorists’ and pursuing politically-motivated charges against the democratic leadership,” Bachelet said., The High Commissioner encouraged the intensification of regional diplomacy, including by ASEAN and other influential States, to insist on the immediate cessation of violence and ongoing human rights violations. Dialogue is urgently needed with the National Unity Government and civil society stakeholders., “In just over four months, Myanmar has gone from being a fragile democracy to a human rights catastrophe. In addition to the loss of life, people are suffering from severe impacts on the social and economic rights. The military leadership is singularly responsible for this crisis, and must be held to account,” Bachelet said., The High Commissioner will be updating the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Myanmar on 7 July., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

"Myanmar: More than 100 attacks on schools in May, says Save the Children",News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",11 Jun 2021,"11 June 2021 – Myanmar saw 103 schools and other education facilities attacked and often damaged by explosives in May this year alone, new data from Save the Children reveals, as armed forces continue to occupy schools and university campuses across the country., Explosive devices such as IEDs and hand grenades were reportedly used in the vast majority of incidents where bomb blasts occurred in and around schools, posing a serious risk to children and teachers. The blasts reportedly killed and injured several people and severely damaged education facilities across the country., The shocking figures come as deeply disturbing images emerged on social media this week of armed soldiers in class rooms, apparently encouraging young children to hold guns. Armed forces have also occupied at least 60 schools, and university campuses across the country since March., These attacks cause yet more disruption to education in Myanmar, where more than 12 million children have already lost more than a year of education as a result of COVID-19-related school closures. Over two million of these children were already out of school before the pandemic., Following the military coup on 1 February, children’s education has been marred by political strife and conflict, Save the Children said, with almost daily attacks on schools and widespread teacher lay-offs. Local media reports have suggested that only one in four children returned to school since they officially re-opened on 1 June., One nine-year-old boy from Magway, a region in central Myanmar, said:, ""Our school didn't open this year. When I see other children going to school, I want to go too. But I’m afraid because I heard guns and bomb blasts at my school. I don't like bomb blasts and guns shooting at school, because [I’m scared that] the school will be on fire and students will die. If there were no more soldiers and bomb blasts at school, I want to go back."", A 10-year-old girl, also from Magway, said:, “I wasn't able to go to school for the whole of last year because of the virus. And this year I dare not go. I want to go to school, but I’m scared. Although the school gates are closed, there are soldiers inside, and I’m afraid of the soldiers. I’m afraid that there might be a bomb blast at our school while we are there."", Save the Children said:, “Save the Children is appalled by these attacks, which not only put the lives of children in danger, but also further compromise what is already a disastrous situation when it comes to children’s learning in Myanmar. Schools are protected places of learning for children that must be free from attacks at all times. Attacks on schools constitute a grave violation against children, and no school should be deliberately targeted., “We are also deeply concerned by the images that have emerged of armed soldiers in classrooms. Armed soldiers have no place in schools or other learning spaces. Under no circumstances should children be made to hold weaponry of any kind. This highly irresponsible behavior by armed personnel is unacceptable, it puts children at risk and violates international standards for safe education., “Save the Children urges all parties involved to put the best interests of children first. All children have the right to a safe education – a right that is safeguarded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), both of which apply to Myanmar., “Learning spaces must be made safe again for children and appropriate measures to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 must be implemented. Save the Children calls for everyone in Myanmar who has an interest in children’s wellbeing to step up and make their safety and learning a priority.”, Save the Children and its partners are investing in safe, quality and inclusive learning opportunities for children in Myanmar across a range of options. It is also providing mental health support for children affected by the crisis.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-more-100-attacks-schools-may-says-save-children

The international community must act”, UN Special Rapporteur for Myanmar, Tom Andrews, tweeted late on Monday., In his alert, Mr. Andrews noted that the Kayah state attacks were just the latest in a series throughout Myanmar that had caused mass displacement and suffering, from Mutraw in Karen state to Mindat in Chin state and Bago city., The independent rights expert, who reports to the Human Rights Council, emphasised that that the lives of many thousands of men, women and children were under threat from indiscriminate attacks, on a scale not seen since the 1 February coup, “that likely amount to mass atrocity crimes”., The development echoes concern by the UN Country Team in Myanmar, which on Monday underscored the rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Kayah State and other parts of the country, linked to protests caused by the military takeover., Basic needs blocked, Citing credible reports, Mr. Andrews said that people were in dire need of food, water, medicine and shelter after reported clashes with volunteer community militias, while the UN country team said that many had also sought safety in host communities and forests across Kayah and southern parts of neighbouring Shan state., Aid deliveries had been allegedly blocked to those forced to flee their homes to escape bombing raids and artillery fire and the military had also placed landmines on public roads, said the Special Rapporteur., “Any pressure or leverage UN Member States can put on the junta must now be exerted” to encourage junta leader Min Aung Hlaing to allow lifesaving aid in, and to stop “terrorising the population by ceasing the aerial bombardment, shelling and shooting of civilians”., Medical teams a target, In its appeal, the UN Country Team reiterated earlier calls for all parties to protect all civilians and civilian infrastructure, “particularly medical units and health workers”., Despite that fact that UN aid teams and their partners had supplies that were ready to be deployed “insecurity, travel restrictions imposed by security forces, and poor road conditions are delaying the delivery of supplies”, the team said in a statement., The team called on ""the security forces to allow for a safe passage of humanitarian supplies and personnel and to facilitate our ability to directly provide aid to all those who need it."", “Now, more than ever, the international community must cut off access to the resources that the junta needs to continue these brutal attacks on the people of Myanmar,” Mr. Andrews said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mass-deaths-alert-myanmar-100000-flee-junta-s-heavy-weapons

Safety and Security",8 Jun 2021,"(Yangon, 8 June 2021): The United Nations in Myanmar is concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Kayah State and other areas in southeastern Myanmar., Recent violence in Kayah State, including indiscriminate attacks by security forces against civilian areas, has led to the internal displacement of an estimated 100,000 men, women and children. Many of them are currently seeking safety in host communities and forests across Kayah and southern parts of neighboring Shan state. This crisis could push people across international borders seeking safety, as already seen in other parts of the country., The United Nations reiterates its earlier calls for all parties to urgently take the necessary measures and precautions to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, particularly protected objects such as medical units and personnel, and to adhere to the fundamental principles of distinction, necessity, proportionality and protection., People fleeing and those remaining in locations affected by ongoing hostilities are in urgent need of food, water, shelter, fuel and access to healthcare. The United Nations and its partners have humanitarian supplies, including food, shelter materials and other basic relief items ready to be deployed to complement the local response, which has been immediate, but insufficient to address all needs, particularly for those persons in remote locations. Ongoing insecurity, travel restrictions imposed by security forces, and poor road conditions, however, are delaying the delivery of these supplies. The United Nations calls on the security forces to allow safe passage of humanitarian supplies and personnel and to facilitate the direct provision of relief assistance by the UN and its partners to all those in need in Kayah, as well as other states and regions across the country where there are urgent humanitarian needs., The United Nations reiterates the Secretary General’s call for a global ceasefire made in March 2020 and to join forces to respond to the growing risk of another outbreak of COVID-19 and other humanitarian and health challenges.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-united-nations-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-south-east-enmy

Health",8 Jun 2021,"Kuala Lumpur/Yangon/Geneva, 8 June 2021 – The Myanmar Red Cross supported by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is scaling up emergency support as hundreds of thousands of people in Myanmar need immediate assistance and access to health services., The Red Cross is urgently ramping up efforts to meet the rising humanitarian needs of 236,000 people across Myanmar., Prof. Dr. Htin Zaw Soe, Secretary General of the Myanmar Red Cross Society said:, “Covid-19 has caused immense economic hardship across Myanmar in the past year. The current crisis has led to further social and economic upheaval. Many people are struggling to earn an income and have very limited access to basic services such as healthcare.”, “We are preparing to provide assistance to people who face worsening poverty, including immediate food relief, and cash assistance that enable people to buy produce locally, in turn stimulating local economies.”, Factory and retail closures signal an emerging economic crisis with thousands left jobless. With no income, people living in informal settlements in urban areas are particularly vulnerable, With a nationwide network, Myanmar Red Cross Society is the country’s largest humanitarian organisation delivering humanitarian assistance across the country., Since February 1, over 2,000 trained Myanmar Red Cross first aid volunteers have played a critical role on the frontlines of the current crisis, providing lifesaving first aid, healthcare and ambulance services, in line with their fundamental humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality and impartiality, to individuals injured and/or ill including pregnant women for safe delivery of babies. Until now, more than 3,000 people have already received these services., In the coming months, the Myanmar Red Cross will scale up its first aid and basic healthcare services and will also address rising food insecurity and poverty among families, including longer term support to re-establish people’s fractured livelihoods., Joy Singhal, IFRC’s Head of Delegation in Myanmar said:, “With a steady increase in humanitarian needs we are preparing for what could become a protracted crisis. This means scaling up both immediate and longer-term support while also factoring in the limited COVID-19 prevention efforts in the country.”, “As the deadliest COVID-19 surges worsen across Asia, every effort needs to be made to contain the virus as the monsoon season looms large, with cyclones and floods adding another layer of hardship for hundreds of thousands of people in the coastal regions.”, Four of the five most vulnerable regions in the upcoming monsoon season - Ayeyarwady, Bago, Tanintharyi and Mon – have also been impacted by the current civil unrest. Between 2000 and 2019, Myanmar was one of the top three countries, most affected by the impacts of extreme weather events., In preparation for the monsoon season, the Red Cross is pre-positioning stocks of key relief items including shelter equipment for people displaced due to disasters and emergency response equipment such as water purification units., Note to Editors:, The IFRC’s emergency appeal in response to the civil unrest in Myanmar can be downloaded here, For more information or to arrange an interview, contact:, In Kuala Lumpur: Antony Balmain: +60 12 230 8451, antony.balmain@ifrc.org, In London: Patrick Fuller, +44 7377730878, RRcomms.Myanmar@ifrc.org, In Geneva: Ann Vaessen, +41 79 405 77 50, ann.vaessen@ifrc.org, About IFRC, IFRC is the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising 192 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies working to save lives and promote dignity around the world. www.ifrc.org - Facebook - Twitter - YouTube",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-red-cross-ramps-response-humanitarian-crisis-deepens

The update highlights the protests held in Hpapun and K’Ma Maung towns in the weeks following the military coup. The villagers held protests to show their disapproval of the military takeover. Even though they were stopped at one point by Tatmadaw soldiers, negotiations between the protest organisers and Tatmadaw officials made it possible for the protests to continue. The civilians were able to hold the protest successfully., The beginning of 2021 has been a devastating moment for civilians living in Myanmar. The military (led by Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing) forcibly seized power from the National League for Democracy (NLD) vice-president U Myint Swe on February 1st 2021. Since the coup, NLD government officials and [anti-coup] protestors have been detained [by security forces]., Since the military coup, civilians living in Myanmar who do not want the dictatorship have protested against the military coup. People living all throughout Myanmar have participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) by banging metal boxes and metal barrels to express their disapproval.

UNHCR – March 2021, Insecurity and violence across Burma continue to escalate following the February 1 military coup d’état against the civilian government, displacing tens of thousands of people and exacerbating humanitarian needs., Hostilities in Burma’s Kayah State displace between 85,000 and 100,000 people from mid- to late May., Health actors, including USG partners, continue to respond to a surge in COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar District., The USG announces nearly $155 million in additional funding to support the Burma and Bangladesh regional humanitarian response., KEY DEVELOPMENTS, Clashes Across Burma Displace Tens of Thousands of People in May, Clashes between Burmese military forces, ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and other local non-state armed groups across Burma have escalated in recent months, resulting in rising displacement and humanitarian needs, the UN reports. Increased hostilities have been particularly pronounced in Chin State, northern Shan State, and southeastern Burma, comprising Bago and Tanintharyi regions, as well as Kayah, Kayin, and Mon states. In the southeast, fighting between the Burmese military and both the Karenni Army and the Karenni People’s Defense Force erupted in Kayah in mid-May, displacing between 85,000 and 100,000 people as of May 31. Insecurity also continued to prompt displacement in other areas of the region during the month, including Kayin and Bago. As of late May, 151,000 people remained displaced in the southeast due to recent insecurity, requiring urgent cash, food, health, shelter, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance., In Chin, fighting between Burmese military forces and the Chinland Defense Force—an armed group formed in response to the February 1 military coup—since late April had displaced approximately 10,000 individuals, including 9,000 people from Mindat town, as of late May, according to the UN. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Mindat are sheltering primarily in 16 sites in Chin and Magway region and require immediate food, health, protection, shelter, and WASH support. Meanwhile, in northern Shan, clashes between Burmese military forces and EAOs, as well as among EAOs, displaced approximately 2,800 people in May. An estimated 8,400 people remained displaced in northern Shan due to insecurity since January—in addition to the approximately 9,800 IDPs displaced in 2011 who continue to reside in state-managed protracted displacement camps in the state—as of late May., While USG partners continue relief activities in Burma, access challenges, restricted banking operations, and limited cash availability resulting from coup-related instability are adversely affecting the provision of humanitarian assistance. Insecurity due to hostilities in areas of Chin, Kachin, northern Shan, and southeastern Burma; landmine contamination; and roadblocks impede humanitarian access, according to the UN. Additionally, deteriorating cash liquidity has challenged relief actors’ ability to conduct cash and voucher assistance programs, procure necessary commodities, and pay staff salaries, amid rising humanitarian needs in the country., Health Actors Respond to Surge in COVID-19 Cases in Cox’s Bazar, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases continued to increase among Rohingya refugees and host community members in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar District in May. Between May 17 and 30, health actors confirmed more than 400 COVID-19 cases among refugees in the Cox’s Bazar camps, representing a more than 120 percent increase compared with the nearly 190 cases confirmed in the previous two-week period. Seven COVID-19-related deaths among refugees have been reported between early April and late May, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO). Meanwhile, health actors confirmed more than 800 COVID-19 cases among host community members from May 17 to 30, representing a 48 percent increase compared with the previous two-week period., In response to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, health actors have bolstered infection prevention and control efforts and strengthened laboratory capacity in the Cox’s Bazar camps. Humanitarian organizations also began activating additional severe acute respiratory infection isolation and treatment center beds in late May at the request of Cox’s Bazar health authorities. As of May 30, approximately 70 percent of the more than 520 isolation and treatment center beds available in the camps were occupied, up from a 26 percent bed occupancy rate in late April. USG partners the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and WHO continue COVID-19 response efforts throughout Cox’s Bazar to strengthen the health sector and prevent excess morbidity and mortality from COVID-19., USG Announces Nearly $155 Million in Additional Funding to the Burma and Bangladesh Regional Response, as UN Launches 2021 JRP, On May 18, the USG announced nearly $155 million in additional funding to humanitarian partners—including more than $80 million from USAID/BHA and nearly $74 million from State/PRM—to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing violence in Burma’s Chin, Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan states. The new funding will support continued delivery of food, nutrition, protection, shelter, and WASH assistance in Burma and Bangladesh., The UN released the 2021 Joint Response Plan (JRP) for the Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in early May, requesting approximately $943 million to continue providing multi-sector humanitarian assistance to approximately 1.4 million people—including 884,000 Rohingya refugees and 470,000 host community members—in Cox’s Bazar through the end of 2021. According to the Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment conducted between July and August 2020—which informed the development of the JRP—shelter, food, livelihood, and education support remain priority needs among Rohingya households, with women and girls identifying access to safe WASH facilities and electricity as major concerns. Among host community households in Cox’s Bazar, access to food and income-generating activities are key needs, reflecting the economic impact of COVID-19 containment measures in the district. The JRP is also centered on a strategy to bolster humanitarian and protection conditions in the 34 Cox’s Bazar refugee camps and support access to basic services through refugee registration and efforts to bolster coordination among relief actors for the delivery of assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/burma-and-bangladesh-regional-crisis-response-fact-sheet-5-fiscal-year-fy-2021

ACLED Regional Overview - Southeast Asia (22-28 May 2021),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,4 Jun 2021,"Last week in Southeast Asia, demonstrations against the military junta continued in Myanmar amid a growing trend of low-intensity explosions targeting government buildings and infrastructure across the country. Meanwhile, deadly fighting between the Myanmar military and armed groups in Kachin, Karenni, and Chin states continues unabated. Deaths of civilians caught in the crossfire of these battles have also been increasing. In the Philippines, protests last week focused on the bill to extend the Bangsamoro Transition Authority’s (BTA) term in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Meanwhile, protests in support of the separatist movement in Papua continued in Indonesia, amid reports of an internet blackout in the region. Lastly, demonstration activity remains low in Thailand as the country struggles to contain its latest wave of coronavirus infections., In Myanmar, demonstrations against the military junta continued across the country. Protests continue to be concentrated in Mandalay, Sagaing, Tanintharyi, and Yangon regions. In Yangon, demonstrators continue to hold small flash-mob style protests as a way to avoid crackdowns by security forces. Additionally, ahead of the reopening of basic education schools next week, demonstrators — including students and teachers — held protests calling for a boycott of the public education system under the junta (Frontier Myanmar, 1 June 2021)., Meanwhile, there is a growing trend of low-intensity explosions using improvised explosives, with such incidents reported in 12 states and regions in Myanmar last week. These explosions have largely occurred at schools, police stations, local administration offices, public infrastructure such as railway lines and bridges, as well as military-linked businesses. While a small number of these events have been claimed by local resistance groups, for the majority of these incidents, it is yet unclear who the perpetrators are., Separately, clashes between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) were reported in Bago and Sagaing regions, as well as in Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, and Shan states. On 22 May, the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) launched an attack against military outposts located in Hkamti town, a key jade mining area in Sagaing region. This marks an expansion of KIO/KIA operations outside of its traditional territorial boundaries (Straits Times, 22 May 2021). Elsewhere in Kachin state, there were recurrent clashes between the Myanmar military and the KIO/KIA. Notably, the KIO/KIA raided the house of the leader of a military-supported Ja Htu Zup People’s Militia Force, prompting a firefight between both sides that resulted in the deaths of at least three KIO/KIA soldiers., Meanwhile, fighting between the Myanmar military and the Karenni National Progressive Party/Karenni Army (KNPP/KA) continued in Kayah state, after both sides clashed for the first time in years on 20 May. At the same time, fighting between the Myanmar military and several Karenni resistance groups escalated in Kayah state and a bordering township in southern Shan state. In some of these clashes last week, the KNPP/KA fought alongside the Karenni resistance groups. The Karenni resistance groups claim that more than 40 military soldiers were killed in the battles between 23 and 24 May (Myanmar Now, 24 May 2021). Civilian casualties were also reported in the clashes last week after the Myanmar military shelled civilian areas, including churches where locals had sought refuge (Irrawaddy, 24 May 2021). Elsewhere, the Myanmar military clashed with the Chinland Defense Force (CDF) in Chin state, as well as with several local resistance groups in Sagaing region., In the Philippines, protests last week focused on a bill, which is currently being discussed in the Senate, to extend the transition period leading to the full establishment of the BARMM by three years (GMA News, 20 May 2021). Supporters of the bill view the extension as necessary in order for the BTA — the interim government of the BARMM established in 2019 — to complete the transitional programs stipulated in the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) (Philippine News Agency, 27 May 2021). The law was a product of decades-long peace talks between Moro insurgents and the government. The implementation of the transitional programs have been hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Supporters of the bill also called for the postponement of the very first BARMM elections scheduled for 2022. However, supporters of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which holds a minority of seats in the BTA, decried the bill as an attempt by the Senate to completely sideline the MNLF in the BTA (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 27 May 2021)., Meanwhile, in Indonesia, Papauns continue to protest to demand the release of Papuan political prisoners and show opposition to the extension of the Special Autonomy Status in West Papua. In Manokwari town, the capital of West Papua province, police arrested 146 people during a protest (Human Rights and Peace for Papua, 26 May 2021). A similar demonstration in Malang city turned violent when nationalist groups clashed with the Papuan demonstrators., Amid these developments, there have been reports of an internet blackout in Jayapura city and its surrounding areas since the end of April (Jubi, 25 May 2021). The Indonesian government, as well as state-owned telecommunications company Telkom, claims that the disruption has been caused by broken submarine cables (Rest of World, 20 May 2021). However, there is speculation that the blackout has been imposed, as it comes amid escalating tensions between state forces and Papuan separatists (Jubi, 25 May 2021). Journalists say the internet disruptions have made it exceedingly challenging for them to carry out their work in the region (Benar News, 27 May 2021)., Finally, as with previous weeks, demonstration activity continues to remain low in **Thailand **relative to previous months. Protesters have stayed off the streets in recent weeks due to the ongoing third wave of coronavirus infections in the country. Nonetheless, there has been increasing discontent with the government over its failure to implement an effective vaccination campaign and to contain the coronavirus pandemic (Deutsche Welle, 20 May 2021).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-22-28-may-2021

In the last two weeks, the estimated number of new IDPs has nearly tripled from 61,000 to 175,000, largely due to new armed clashes and a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Myanmar’s Kayah State., In Kayah State, located in eastern Myanmar, an estimated 100,000 people have now been displaced since 1 February, most of whom have been displaced since 20 May. The security situation also continues to be particularly tense across southeast Myanmar, with explosions and shelling reported in various locations and intensified clashes also observed in Kayin State and eastern Bago Region. Many of the 149,000 total IDPs in southeast Myanmar remain in hiding. In northern Myanmar, internal displacement has increased due to ongoing fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Kachin Independence Army, expanding across Kachin State, the northernmost state in Myanmar, and into northern Sagaing Region. In northern Shan State, armed conflict among ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and between EAOs and the MAF continued to displace people across a number of townships., As a result of recent fighting in Kayah and Shan States, there have not yet been new reported movements from Myanmar toward Thailand. From earlier displacement from Myanmar, Mae Hong Son Province remains the most affected area in Thailand, though humanitarian actors have not yet formally been granted access. The group of over 1,700 arrivals from Myanmar reported on 13 May has now reduced to some 255, who are being accommodated in four temporary safety areas, managed by the Royal Thai Government. The remainder of the group has reportedly returned to Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-regional-bureau-asia-and-pacific-rbap-myanmar-emergency-external-update-1-june

Such visits and activities are essential to secure humane treatment and conditions of detention for all detainees and to restore communication between detainees and their families., In the framework of ICRC's confidential dialogue with military and security forces in Myanmar, President Maurer also raised key humanitarian issues including the use of force during security operations., Finally, President Maurer reiterated ICRC's commitment to reinforce its support to the Myanmar Red Cross Society's humanitarian work, especially in the area of first aid, ambulance services, emergency response and COVID-19 prevention. This support is in close cooperation with other Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners in Myanmar., The ICRC has been helping people aected by armed conflicts and violence in Myanmar for more than 30 years.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Jun 2021,"MYANMAR, An estimated 151,000 people in southeastern parts of the country have been internally displaced by insecurity and armed conflict between various parties as of 31 May. In Kayah State, between 85,000 to 100,000 people are estimated to have been displaced by ongoing hostilities between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Karenni Army as well as the Karenni People's Defence Force. Fighting in the area continues to escalate with airstrikes and indiscriminate shelling reported. The majority of the displaced people are concentrated in Demoso, Hpruso and Loikaw townships in Kayah State as well as Hsiseng and Pekon townships in southern Shan State, according to UNHCR. The displacement in Kayah State is in addition to 51,200 people who had been displaced in the south-east, over 47,300 people in Kayin State, with a further 3,900 in parts of Mon State and eastern Bago Region, since 1 February due to insecurity and clashes between the MAF and the Karen National Liberation Army. The humanitarian impact of hostilities in the region remains severe, with people displaced and those who remain in areas affected across the south-eastern parts of the country in urgent need of food, shelter, medicine, water as well as sanitation services. Humanitarian access to people in need is constrained by insecurity, road blockages, landmine risks and lengthy or unclear approval processes. As needs grow, the capacities of local partners are increasingly stretched and require additional financial support. Despite the challenges, operational partners are responding to needs where possible. During the reporting period, a small number of families displaced across several townships in Kayah State, Kayin State, and eastern parts of Bago Region received shelter and emergency kits, hygiene assistance, and basic medical supplies. The partners will continue to explore all possible options to respond to the needs of people displaced and everyone affected., INDIA/BANGLADESH, Tropical Cyclone Yaas made landfall over north Odisha on 26 May, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and storm surge of more than four meters which affected the Indian States of Odisha and West Bengal, and low-lying coastal areas in Bangladesh., In India, an estimated 300,000 houses were destroyed or damaged as sea waters along the Bengal coast and rivers started swelling and breached embankments. In West Bengal, more than 4,600 villages were affected, and about 230,000 people are displaced across 14,000 relief camps. According to authorities in the neighboring state of Odisha, more than 128 villages have been severely affected across ten districts. UNICEF is supporting response efforts of the Governments of West Bengal and Odisha by providing assistance in the areas of health, water and sanitation, protection, nutrition, education, and COVID-19 risk communication., In Bangladesh, tidal surge combined with the collapse of embankments flooded low-lying coastal areas in the districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bhola, Patuakhali and Borguna, leaving at least four people dead, displacing about 15,000 people across 200 villages, and damaging or destroying thousands of houses, farm land and fish enclosures. WHO and UNICEF are working with local administrations and have medical teams and emergency medical supplies on standby. Several humanitarian partners are providing emergency supply in the form of drinking water and dry food., Challenges in maintaining social distancing and limited availability of sanitation facilities in emergency shelters may complicate efforts to halt the surge in COVID-19 cases at a time when the region is battling with another wave of infections., PHILIPPINES, A weather disturbance east of Mindanao has intensified into a tropical storm labelled as TS Choi-wan (local name Dante) bringing heavy rains and flooding in the Davao and CARAGA regions. There are no exact figures yet on displacements, but local media report that rescue teams have evacuated families in various areas to safer ground over the weekend. TS Choi-wan is not expected to make landfall but will strengthen to a severe tropical storm in the next two days. Its outer rain bands could also affect the Visayas region and result in landslides and floods in highly susceptible areas.3",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asia-and-pacific-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-25-31-may-2021
"Myanmar risks state failure without significant increase in international pressure, The Elders warn",News and Press Release,Elders,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jun 2021,"The Elders today called on the international community to intensify pressure on the military leadership in Myanmar to prevent the country descending into endemic violence and state failure. The UN, ASEAN and other regional and international actors must urgently step up their level of engagement to prevent consolidation of the coup, and give their full backing to a return to democratic, civilian rule., The Elders warned that the cost of inaction is high, as can be seen from other protracted conflicts worldwide and their humanitarian consequences. Although international media attention on Myanmar is receding, state violence, repression and coercion continue to be systematically deployed against civilians who stand up against the coup., More than 800 people have been killed by security forces since 1 February, and violence is escalating in many parts of the country. The impact of the crisis on health, education and other basic services has been devastating, and the economy is on the verge of collapse. Teachers who have been striking as part of the Civil Disobedience Movement have reportedly faced suspensions and threats by the military ahead of today’s deadline for public schools to reopen, risking further tensions and violence., Mary Robinson, Chair of The Elders and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said:, “Myanmar is currently on a dangerous path towards state failure. The international community must stand firm in opposition to the military coup. Allowing the coup to succeed through inaction and disregard would further undermine the international rules-based order upon which global stability depends. Regional states and international organisations, notably the UN, should use all the tools at their disposal to convince the military of the urgent need for constructive dialogue between all relevant parties, as the only way out of the crisis."", The Elders noted that divisions within the UN Security Council continue to impede concerted action, and they urged its Permanent Members to enable the Council to fulfil its obligation under the United Nations Charter to maintain global peace and security., Within the region, more than a month has passed since the ASEAN summit in Jakarta on 24 April, without visible progress on implementation of the commitments in the five-point plan. ASEAN must hold Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the coup leader, accountable for his adherence to the commitments agreed in Jakarta, without preconditions. Ban Ki-moon, Deputy Chair of The Elders and former UN Secretary-General, said:, ""Unfortunately, ASEAN is failing to live up to its mandate and responsibilities. It must now step up and play the crucial role expected of it by countries around the world in the resolution of this crisis. A visit by a high-level ASEAN delegation, to initiate dialogue with all parties, is long overdue. Myanmar’s regional neighbours have the levers in their hands to change the trajectory of this crisis. Now is the time to use them."", The Elders warned that the State Administrative Council established following the coup does not have the legitimacy or authority to govern Myanmar. The threat by the military-appointed Union Election Commission to dissolve the National League for Democracy, which won an overwhelming majority in elections last November, only diminishes the junta’s legitimacy even further and exposes their fear of Myanmar’s people., The Elders reaffirmed their solidarity with the people of Myanmar, including those living outside its borders, in their quest for a better future based on democratic freedom, inclusion and prosperity., ENDS, Media enquiries

All parties must ensure unimpeded access to healthcare in Myanmar,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",28 May 2021,"Nearly four months after the military seized power in Myanmar, people are struggling to access healthcare., Hospitals are closed or occupied by the military and many facilities are severely understaffed, while COVID-19 remains a threat., The economic fallout of the military takeover has also resulted in reduced or uncertain access to services, including healthcare and clean water., MSF urges the military government to ensure people have unhindered access to healthcare, and to allow health workers to provide care without fear or intimidation., Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) calls on Myanmar’s de facto military government, and other groups, to take all steps to ensure people have safe and unhindered access to healthcare, regardless of where they seek it. Equally, medical staff must be able to provide lifesaving care without attacks, detention or intimidation., Patients typically must choose between seeking treatment at a private facility they may not be able to afford, or at a military-controlled hospital where their safety could be at risk, particularly if they have been involved in protests or the civil disobedience movement., Non-government organisation clinics do exist in some locations, but they are unable to cover all needs and have had their activities restricted by the military authorities. An MSF-supported clinic was told by security forces it could not treat protesters. The security forces visited the facility, ordered the emergency beds removed and insisted all injured people be taken to the military or military-controlled hospitals. Police also arrested one of its volunteers for being involved in protests and demanded names and addresses of others working there. The facility was forced to temporarily close and is now barely functioning, operated by a skeleton staff., Patients in Myanmar are forced to travel farther to get care at a time when risks are much greater. Security forces at checkpoints scrutinise those moving around, search their belongings, intimidate them and contribute to a climate of fear. For patients with conditions requiring regular and long-term care, such as HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C, the ongoing insecurity and delays in accessing medicines could be life-threatening., “What patients are worried about now is if they can access the clinic to get medication,” an MSF doctor in Kachin state said. “If the security forces at the checkpoints don’t let the patients pass, what can the medical personnel do for their patients?”, Attacks on healthcare workers, Doctors and nurses continue to be targets of violence. Staff working in medical facilities MSF has provided support to have shared reports of medical staff being arrested and detained., There have been 179 attacks on health staff and facilities since the start of the military takeover, and 13 people have killed in these attacks, according to the World Health Organizations’s Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare., Media reports have shown emergency medical workers and first responders on the frontlines of peaceful protests being shot at with live rounds, while trying to help the wounded. Our partners have also witnessed raids on organisations providing first aid to injured protesters, and their supplies destroyed., As Myanmar approaches four months of military rule, public health services remain severely disrupted. Many public hospitals and clinics are closed or occupied by the military, and those that are open have limited services available while medical staff are on strike. MSF has few options for referring people for specialised treatment. These challenges leave many people struggling to access healthcare., If a wave of new COVID-19 infections grips Myanmar, it will be a public health disaster given the country’s capacity to test, treat and vaccinate is a fraction of what it was before the military seized power., Economic fallout threatens humanitarian response, As the public health system in Myanmar deteriorates, its economy is also collapsing. Cash is increasingly difficult to obtain, with people facing huge queues at sporadically filled ATMs. The kyat – the local currency – has fallen 17 per cent against the US dollar, pushing up the cost of imports and goods like cooking oil, rice and fuel., Humanitarian agencies are not immune to this liquidity crisis. Facing shortfalls in cash and increased costs can prevent organisations, including MSF, from buying supplies and medications, paying staff salaries and moving goods around., We are already seeing the impact of this in our HIV programme in Kachin state. Before 1 February, we had been gradually shifting our HIV patient cohort to the government's National AIDS Programme. However, these clinics are no longer open, and MSF has seen nearly 2,000 patients return to our facilities for consultations and drug refills, and over 200 new HIV-positive patients register., In Rakhine state, water and sanitation has long been a problem in camps for the Rohingya, where people rely on humanitarian aid for access to clean water. Now that many organisations are scaling back their activities as they struggle to access cash and get supplies into the camps, we are seeing a spike in people seeking treatment for acute watery diarrhoea., Reignited conflict exacerbates humanitarian crisis, An estimated 60,000 people in Myanmar have been displaced within the country and 10,000 more in neighbouring nations since the 1 February seizure of power, according to data from UNHCR. This is largely due to a resurgence of conflict in Myanmar’s borderlands, particularly in Chin, Kachin and Kayin states – predominantly between the military and ethnic armed groups, but also increasingly including pro-democracy people’s defence forces. Airstrikes and shelling are forcing people to flee their homes and have caused an unknown number of civilian casualties., MSF had to withdraw staff from one town in Kachin state due to fighting, temporarily interrupting our services, while the sound of shelling and gunshots are commonplace in several locations. This impacts our activities and staff wellbeing, and raises significant concerns for people’s ability to travel to seek healthcare. Medical staff and humanitarian organisations must be protected from violence and given unhindered access to conflict areas to ensure those at risk can access lifesaving care., MSF fears for the people of Myanmar in this worsening crisis. All obstacles preventing sick and wounded people from seeking healthcare, including the violence, detainment and intimidation of health workers, must be dismantled., MSF has been working in Myanmar since 1992, with our medical and humanitarian programs growing and developing significantly. Today, over 1,100 staff provide high-quality care through a network of health facilities and mobile clinics.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/all-parties-must-ensure-unimpeded-access-healthcare-myanmar

Protection and Human Rights",28 May 2021,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo [Nyaunglebin] District from March 28th to May 4th 2021. Since early April, the Tatmadaw in Ler Doh Town have been sending an increasing number of soldiers to Mu Traw Distict through the military road from Ler Doh Town to Mu Theh area, resulting in several skirmishes with the KNLA and KNDO. Because of the fighting, as well as the continuous presence of Tatmadaw soldiers and observation aircrafts in the area, IDPs in Ler Doh Township are now too afraid to return to their villages. They might face livelihood difficulties in the future as they are currently unable to tend to their farms., Ler Doh Township, Since March 28th 2021, after the airstrikes on Day Bu Noh village, Lu Thaw Township, Mu Traw District, Tatmadaw jets and drones have been flying regularly over Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Towship, Kler Lwee Htoo District [presumably on reconnaissance missions]. It also happened on April 20th 2021. Local IDPs [who were displaced because of fighting and indiscriminate shelling by Tatmadaw troops] and villagers are now afraid that the Tatmadaw will carry out airstrikes in their area like they did in Day Bu Noh village [airstrikes are usually preceded by reconnaissance flyovers]., Since early April, the Tatmadaw based in Ler Doh army camp has been sending more soldiers, as well as military supplies and ammunition to Mu Traw District. These reinforcements usually travel on foot on the military road between Ler Doh and Mu Theh area. According to a KHRG researcher, they seem to be heading to Mu Traw District’s frontlines [territory controlled by the Karen National Union - KNU]. The Tatmadaw sent around 270 soldiers [local villagers assume it was an entire Light Infantry Division - LID] and 140 horses [to carry military supplies, rations and ammunition] to Mu Traw District [KHRG was not able to establish when these soldiers left their camp]., On April 16th 2021, at about 6 am, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[7] attacked these Tatmadaw soldiers in Pwa Ga Kyoh area, near T’Kaw Der village, Keh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township. The fighting lasted for about five minutes. During the fighting, the Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired mortar shells at nearby villages. Fortunately, there was no one in the villages because local communities had previously fled to the forest [due to fighting, indiscriminate shelling and fear of airstrikes]. However, the fighting and shelling caused security concerns among IDPs in the area. According to information received by the villagers, there were no casualties, but three Tatmadaw horses were killed during the fighting., The increased Tatmadaw presence in Ler Doh Township also resulted in skirmishes between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA/Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO). On May 4th 2021, fighting between Tatmadaw and KNDO troops broke out in Eee Tha Plaw Place, Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township. IDPs from Kheh Der village, Kheh Der village tract heard the sound of gunfire, as well as several mortar explosions. The fighting did not reach the displacement site so no IDPs were injured. Villagers do not know whether [KNDO or Tatmadaw] soldiers sustained injuries during the fighting., IDPs in Ler Doh Township cannot return home due to the increasing presence of Tatmadaw soldiers; flyovers by observation drones and jets; and on-going fighting between Tatmadaw soldiers and the KNLA/KNDO in the area. At this time of the year, the villagers should be preparing their paddy farms [the farms need to be cleaned ahead of the rice planting season in June-July]. However, they are now hiding in the forest so they cannot work on their farms. Because of this situation, they are deeply concerned about their current and future livelihoods.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kler-lwee-htoo-district-short-update-increased-militarisation-and-fighting-between

Left Behind: Ethnic Minorities and COVID-19 Response in Rural Southeast Myanmar,Analysis,KHRG,"Agriculture
Education
Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",27 May 2021,"Introduction, From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were concerns about what would happen in Myanmar, given its extremely weak health infrastructure, its long history of conflict and political instability, and its large impoverished and at-risk population. The low spread of the virus in Myanmar through the first half of 2020 however led some to believe that the Myanmar government was getting it right. The World Health Organisation’s country representative in Myanmar boasted in July 2020 that “Myanmar has done extraordinarily well so far”. He cited Myanmar’s “whole-of-government” approach, adding: “So the country has really gone all out to strengthen the public health side and preparedness and response, which has been critically important to try and make sure we have as few cases as possible in Myanmar.”, Although the Myanmar government’s COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (entitled “Overcoming as One”) made claims about being a coordinated action “leaving no-one behind”, many of the positive actions of the government have not reached the entire population. Aid and support have remained insufficient in most rural areas, like that of Southeast Myanmar, which is largely populated by ethnic minorities who are already vulnerable due to protracted and on-going conflict, displacement, and ethnic oppression by the central government. Thus Myanmar’s “success” should and can only be gauged through a closer look at COVID-19 response and impact in rural ethnic areas., Very early on in the pandemic, despite the relatively slow spread of the virus, political fractures and infrastructure weaknesses due to Myanmar’s long and on-going history of conflict could be seen not simply in the government’s response, but that of other stakeholders, like Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs), locally based civil society organisations, and NGO/INGOs. In a brief report on the situation in Southeast Myanmar during the first wave of the pandemic, KHRG noted the poor coordination and collaboration between stakeholders and the delayed and uneven response to the crisis. KHRG argued that “the lack of coordination between political stakeholders has meant that villagers and local leaders have struggled to obtain information and consistent training and regulations, and has left too much of the responsibility of figuring out what to do in the hands of those who lack information and resources to effectively organise awareness and prevention”. Not only did this poor coordination result in the forced removal of screening checkpoints by the Tatmadaw, KHRG also found the rise of conflict and tension between villages, increasingly critical challenges to livelihood, as well as the breakdown of local systems of mutual aid., Given the early indications that COVID-19 response and support were failing in some of the most vulnerable areas in Southeast Myanmar, KHRG continued to monitor the situation to more fully assess the structural weaknesses and barriers that might lead to crisis as the pandemic entered a second wave of outbreaks beginning in August 2020. Increased threats of infection in rural areas did in some cases lead to new efforts at awareness and prevention, but in general sparked heightened restrictions by both the Myanmar government and the Karen National Union (KNU). Thus rather than working to increase individual knowledge and responsibility on the part of villagers, most measures ended up being in the form of broad restrictions like travel bans and school closures that have had significant negative impact on villagers’ lives. These restrictions also seemed to be matched by a reduction in the range of stakeholders providing services and aid. Although the government has provided small amounts of financial and material assistance to households in need, villagers living in KNU-controlled and some mixed control areas have been excluded, leaving local authorities and CSO/CBOs to figure out solutions to support these communities., Most rural areas in Southeast Myanmar have not (yet) experienced widespread local transmission of the virus, and thus impacts have been more clearly tied to restrictions and prevention measures as opposed to the full-on health crisis seen elsewhere. But because of the already extremely vulnerable situation of many rural communities, the livelihood impacts are themselves at risk of creating a humanitarian crisis. The poor handling thus far of information and prevention, as well as of testing and treatment, may also have wider implications if outbreaks start occurring in the more remote areas., On February 1st 2021, the Myanmar military seized power by staging a coup against the newly elected government. Although this report focuses on the situation prior to the coup, the infrastructure and services (albeit insufficient) that the central government, EAOs and other stakeholders have put in place over the past year are in the process of being dismantled. Public healthcare services in some areas have come to a halt, and there have been major disruptions to communication, transportation, supply chains, and banking services. COVID-19 testing has been largely reduced, with little reporting now taking place. Any plans for widespread vaccination seem to have been entirely interrupted., If rural areas of Southeast Myanmar have not yet faced widespread problems of infection, all of this is likely to change. As local doctors have pointed out: “Since the military takeover, the COVID-19 response has stalled. Mass public rallies and protests are both serving a critical function for resistance and unity, but also as likely superspreader events for virus transmission. Without adequate testing, public compliance and goodwill for isolation, access to acute clinical care, and continued immunisations, the implications for COVID-19 spread, morbidity, and mortality are substantial.” Thus, there is need more than ever to find solutions to bring support and aid to rural villagers, whose situation has already deteriorated and become more precarious over the past year. With the military now in control, there is even less likelihood that support and services will reach rural ethnic communities., Although this report covers the period prior to the coup, and describes an infrastructure that may now barely exist, the problems created by COVID-19 and the government’s response have not disappeared, and will need to be addressed. Furthermore, the underlying political dynamics that impede the development of a support infrastructure capable of addressing the needs of rural ethnic minorities continue to play out. The report thus begins by providing a brief overview of the political dynamics that have shaped access to services and COVID-19 response. Followed by that is a discussion of COVID-19 reporting and testing, and the prevention measures that have been put in place to address the rise in COVID-19 cases. The discussion then turns to impacts on livelihood, access to different forms of support, and the situation of healthcare and education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/left-behind-ethnic-minorities-and-covid-19-response-rural-southeast-myanmar

The next update will be issued towards the end of June 2021., HIGHLIGHTS, Around 46,000 people were displaced in the south-eastern part of Myanmar between April and May due to the conflict and insecurity, about 37,000 of them displaced in late May following the clashes in Kayah State., In Chin State, thousands have been internally displaced following an escalation of hostilities in the town of Mindat since 12 May., In northern Shan, clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) and among EAOs continue and around 2,800 people were displaced in May. A total of 8,400 people who have fled since January 2021 remain displaced., In Kachin State, there has been no new displacement during the reporting period, despite the active armed conflict between the MAF and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA); about 8,500 people who fled insecurity since mid-March remain displaced., No new population displacement has been reported in Rakhine State. Cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) are reported in IDP camps in Mrauk-U, Paukaw and Sittwe townships., Humanitarian response remains severely constrained in all conflict-affected areas due to insecurity, banking disruptions, road blockages and pre-existing access challenges., Myanmar Humanitarian Fund First Standard Allocation of US$10 million launched on 13 May has been amended with an additional $0.35 million to scale up response in Chin State., A total of US$40.2 million has been mobilized under the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan, which seeks $276.5 million to address the needs of around 1 million people in conflict-affected areas. This represents less than 15 per cent of the funds required., KEY FIGURES, 85.9K people internally displaced in the South-east due to clashes and insecurity in 2021, 15K people internally displaced in northern Shan due to armed clashes in 2021, 10K people internally displaced in Kachin State due to armed clashes in 2021, 10K people hosted in sites in Chin State and Magway Region due to hostilities in Mindat in May, SITUATION OVERVIEW, UPSURGE IN DISPLACEMENT IN THE SOUTH-EAST: Around 46,000 people were displaced in the southeastern part of the country between April and May, according to data obtained by UNHCR from various sources. This includes the displacement of an estimated 37,000 persons across 57 locations in Kayah State where violence had erupted in late May between the MAF and the Karenni Army, the armed wing of the Karenni National Progressive Party, as well as the Karenni People’s Defense Force, an armed group formed by civilian resistance fighters., There have been additional displacements, mainly in Kayin State due to insecurity and the clashes between the Karen National Liberation Army and the MAF. Around 45,000 people are currently internally displaced in Kayin State. The majority of them are hiding in jungles with some 8,000 sheltering in caves along Salween River at the border with Thailand. A further 3,900 people remain displaced in Mon State and Bago Region since February. This makes 85,900 the total number of people who have been internally displaced in the region due to armed clashes as well as insecurity as of 24 May., The internal displacement comes in addition to cross-border movement that remains fluid. Around 7,000 people from Kayin State have crossed the border to seek safety in Thailand since late March and some 1,000 remain in temporary areas in Mae Hong Son Province in Thailand as of 23 May, according to UNHCR., Humanitarian needs include food, shelter and access to hygiene and sanitation facilities. Additionally, there have been reports of cases of water-borne diseases among the displaced population in the jungle as result of extended lack of access to hygiene and sanitation facilities compounded by the early arrival of the rainy season. Local sources warn of a looming food security crisis if people are unable to return to their villages of origin to tend to their crops and livestock., Humanitarian partners are doing their best to respond to these needs, both within Myanmar and across the border. For example, in Kayah State, partners provided food and basic households items, child protection and health interventions to a small number of IDPs. However, access restrictions due to insecurity, road blockages, remote terrain, landmine contamination and other bureaucratic impediments continue to impede programme delivery across Kayah and elsewhere., INCREASING HUMANITARIAN NEEDS IN CHIN STATE: Thousands of people have been displaced following an escalation of violence between the MAF and the Chinland Defense Forces (CDF) in and around the town of Mindat in Chin State on 12 May. The MAF deployed heavy artillery, military helicopters and snipers to the area, and despite the reported retreat of the CDF the following day, the MAF reportedly continued its attacks, including against civilian areas and infrastructure in the town of Mindat, which is home to about 25,000 people (2014 data)., Over 9,000 IDPs are currently hosted in 16 sites, mainly in churches and monasteries, in and around Mindat and 7 sites in Saw in Magway Region. Thousands more had reportedly fled to nearby forests and mountains in search of safety and protection. There are also reports of civilian casualties, damage to and occupation of civilian infrastructure, incidents of the MAF using civilians as human shields and alleged cases of sexual assault against women and girls. Clashes also occurred between the MAF and the CDF in Loklung Village near the capital city of Hakkha on 18 May. This has led to the displacement of around 1,000 people to neighboring villages, according to local partners., The displaced population and those who remain in town are in urgent need of food, water, medicine, shelter and protection services, such as gender-based violence and psychological support. Local communities and religious institutions are making efforts to provide humanitarian assistance; however, this is not reaching everyone in need. Access restrictions, including due to road blockages and insecurity, are complicating the efforts to verify the reports of displacement, casualties and other incidents, as well as assess needs and respond. The Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF) is supporting an operational partner in Chin State to scale up response, by topping up with an additional funding an existing humanitarian programme., MORE PEOPLE DISPLACED IN NORTHERN SHAN: Population movement remains fluid in northern areas of Shan State with new displacements and small-scale returns reported on a regular basis. In Hsipaw Township, around 2,510 people fled from their homes to safe areas due to hostilities between the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army and the allied forces of the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army on 18 May. Small-scale population movements were also reported in Nawnghkio and Namtu townships and over the course of May, 2,800 people were internally displaced due to various clashes. A total of 15,151 people have been internally displaced in northern Shan since the start of 2021. While almost half of them returned to their places of origin within weeks, some 8,400 people remain displaced in 34 sites in Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Momeik, Namtu, Namhkan and Nawghkio townships. The IDPs are unable to return due to damage to their property and livelihoods as well as insecurity and risks from landmine contamination., Humanitarian partners organized three missions to the displacement sites and protracted IDP camps over the course of May to assess people’s needs and strengthen response coordination. Despite some assistance provided by host communities and local partners, the needs of families newly displaced remain largely unmet. The IDPs currently require temporary shelter, food, basic household materials, including mosquito nets, blankets, and mats, as well as access to water and sanitation facilities., NO NEW DISPLACEMENT IN KACHIN DESPITE INSECURITY: There has been no new population displacement in Kachin during the reporting period. Close to 10,000 people have been displaced across Kachin State following the resumption of clashes in mid-March. While many have returned to their places of origin since then, over 8,500 people remain displaced in Bhamo, Hpakant, Injanyang, Momauk, Myitkyina, Sadung, Shwegu and Waingmaw townships. Local communities and operational partners are responding to the needs of newly displaced people; however, access challenges and insecurity are complicating these efforts., The security situation remains volatile in Kachin State, with regular armed clashes between the MAF and the KIA in several townships and general insecurity across the state. Hostilities were reported across as many as 13 townships; however, clashes were intense in Momauk Township in particular, where fighting around the Ah Law Bum mountain area, currently controlled by the KIA continues unabated, with reports of aerial strikes by the MAF and artillery shelling by both sides. Since March, over 100 armed engagements were reported across Kachin. According to public sources, 11 civilians were killed and 22 others injured between 11 March and 12 May. The details of these incidents could not be verified at the time of reporting due to access challenges., ACUTE WATERY DIARRHEA IN CENTRAL RAKHINE: AWD cases were reported in IDP camps in MraukU, Pauktaw and Sittwe townships with majority of cases affecting children under five. Based on available information, the cases were reported to be highest during the week of 3 May, with 1,200 cases, and majority reported from six IDP camps. Over 2,000 cases of AWD have so far been reported as of 25 May. The situation has started to stabilize as the number of cases started to go down since 16 May, following robust response by operational partners who are coordination with relevant entities to scale up awareness raising efforts of good hygiene, testing of water quality, chlorination of the boreholes, and cleaning of solid waste and disinfection of latrines. Disease surveillance is ongoing and operational hours of mobile clinics have been extended in certain camps with larger caseloads. Case investigation and laboratory sample collection were also conducted with relevant entities and findings were directly shared to frontline health partners for appropriate clinical management., NO NEW DIPLACEMENT IN RAKHINE: There has not been any new clashes between the MAF and the AA since November 2020 and no new displacement has been reported. Some small-scale returns among IDPs continue to take place in a number of townships. Close to 82,000 people remain displaced at 147 sites and 27 host communities in 10 townships across Rakhine State. This is in addition to 126,000 IDPs hosted in protracted camps established in 2012.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-7-27-may-2021
"Atrocity Alert No. 254: Myanmar (Burma), Ethiopia and South Sudan",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,26 May 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., ARMED RESISTANCE GROWS AS MYANMAR’S MILITARY CONTINUES TO COMMIT ATROCITIES, Since Friday, 21 May, Myanmar’s security forces have used heavy weaponry, including tanks and helicopters, against civilian areas of Kayah State as they attempt to repel civilian resistance fighters from the Karenni People’s Defense Force and members of the Karenni Army armed group. At least nine civilians have been killed in the state capital of Loikaw, including four people who were killed while sheltering in the Sacred Heart Catholic Church on 24 May when it was shelled by the military. Such attacks may constitute war crimes., The fighting in Kayah State comes a week after violence escalated in Mindat, Chin State, where the military used helicopter gunships and heavy artillery against civilian fighters from the self-styled Chinland Defense Force. Across Myanmar, ethnic armed groups and a growing number of recently formed “self-defense groups” are trying to protect protesters from the security forces, who have killed over 820 people since 1 February for opposing military rule. On 23 May an attack by a local self-defense group on a police station in the eastern town of Mobye killed 13 members of the security forces., Meanwhile, in an attempt to consolidate his power, the leader of the 1 February military coup, General Min Aung Hlaing, who will turn 65 in July, abolished the mandatory retirement age for senior military officers. On 21 May the junta-appointed Union Election Commission also announced their intention to dissolve Aung Sang Suu Kyi’s popular National League for Democracy, which won the general election last November with an overwhelming majority of votes., Attacks on press freedom by the military junta also continue. Forty-nine journalists are currently being detained by the security forces, including an American journalist and managing editor of Frontier Myanmar, Danny Fenster, who was arrested at Yangon airport on 24 May as he attempted to leave the country. He has been transferred to Yangon’s notorious Insein Prison. A Japanese journalist, Yuki Kitazumi, who was arrested during April but was subsequently released following lobbying by the Japanese government, has said he witnessed abuse and torture at Insein., “As the situation in Myanmar continues to deteriorate, the country is approaching a point of no return,” said Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. “The UN Security Council and the entire international community must impose punitive measures on the junta, including a global arms embargo. Otherwise, more civilians will lose their lives, armed conflict will intensify, and the democratic gains of the past decade will be completely lost.”, INCENDIARY WEAPONS REPORTEDLY USED AGAINST CIVILIANS IN TIGRAY, ETHIOPIA, Reports emerged earlier this week of the probable use of white phosphorus against civilians in Ethiopia. A video, reportedly smuggled out of the Tigray region and seen by the British newspaper, The Telegraph, shows victims – including a 13-year-old girl – covered in horrific burns as a result of attacks in Eastern and Central Tigray on 9 and 20 April., The report also cited analysis from Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert, who indicated that the injuries suffered by Tigrayan civilians are similar to those witnessed in Syria, where white phosphorus has been used to set fire to towns and drive out civilians. Survivors of the attacks in Tigray testified that there had been no fighting in the vicinity of their homes prior to the use of incendiary weapons., White phosphorus catches fire when exposed to air and burns at an extremely high temperature. When used as an incendiary weapon, white phosphorus causes horrific injuries as it burns through structures and people. While it is legal for militaries to utilize white phosphorus for illumination at night or to make a smoke screen, its use in civilian-populated areas is prohibited under International Humanitarian Law and may constitute a war crime., Both Eritrean and Ethiopian armed forces are operating in Eastern and Central Tigray. Neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea are signatories to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which bans the use of indiscriminate munitions such as white phosphorus and landmines. These are, however, prohibited under the customary laws of war. The Ethiopian government has denied using incendiary weapons against civilians., The commission of atrocities in Tigray cannot continue to go unpunished. While the 21 May announcement of the conviction of four soldiers in an Ethiopian court for crimes against humanity committed in Tigray is welcome, civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict. Global Centre Communications and Digital Media Officer, Sarah Hunter, said, “states should join the United States and European Union by imposing targeted sanctions and withholding all development aid until there is an end to the conflict, unfettered humanitarian access and meaningful progress towards accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against civilians in Tigray.”, DEADLY ATTACKS ON HUMANITARIAN WORKERS IN SOUTH SUDAN, Despite the 2018 Peace Agreement and the formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity, for the past year South Sudan has experienced a steady escalation in violence, including localized conflicts and civilian killings. In recent weeks there has also been an increase in attacks targeting humanitarian workers and assets., On 21 May a local doctor working for the International Rescue Committee (IRC) was killed inside a health facility in Ganyliel Payam, Unity State. A humanitarian convoy, including an ambulance, was also attacked in Koch, Unity State. Ten days earlier, an aid worker was killed in Budi, Eastern Equatoria. During April, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported separate incidents in Torit, Eastern Equatoria, where youths physically assaulted staff from a UN agency and an NGO. The IRC also reported an attack on 24 April in the Ruweng Administrative Area, during which youths entered their compound and physically attacked staff., In response to the recent attacks in Unity State, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan, Alain Noudéhou, said that, “I am appalled by this horrific news of another act of violence against humanitarians in South Sudan.” Noudéhou commented that, “humanitarians who are working hard to provide much-needed assistance to people in need must be respected and protected.”, At least 126 humanitarians have been killed since the civil war broke out in 2013, making South Sudan one of the most dangerous countries for aid workers. Approximately 8.3 million people, nearly 70 percent of South Sudan’s population, are currently in need of humanitarian assistance. An estimated 7.2 million people are also severely food insecure, including 1.4 million malnourished children., The UN Security Council (UNSC) is scheduled to decide this month whether to extend South Sudan’s sanction regime, including the arms embargo. Due to delays in the implementation of the Peace Agreement, the UN Secretariat proposed a set of benchmarks to assess the efficacy of the current arms embargo on South Sudan. Many of the benchmarks – including the one on improving humanitarian access and addressing human rights violations – have not been met. As a result, lifting the arms embargo would be premature, with arms proliferation previously contributing to inter-communal violence and other atrocities., The government of South Sudan must ensure the protection of humanitarian workers and facilitate their unhindered access to vulnerable populations. It should also thoroughly investigate recent attacks on humanitarian organizations and hold perpetrators accountable. The UNSC should closely monitor progress on achieving the proposed benchmarks and assist the South Sudanese authorities in upholding their responsibility to protect.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-254-myanmar-burma-ethiopia-and-south-sudan
"Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: Impact of the military coup on villagers in K’Ser Doh, Ler Muh Lah and Ler Doh Soh townships, February 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,26 May 2021,"Situation Update, May 26th 2021 / KHRG # 21-46-S1, This Situation Update describes events that occurred in K’Ser Doh, Ler Muh Lah, and Ler Doh Soh townships, Mergui-Tavoy District in February 2021. This report includes information related to the military coup that took place on February 1st 2021. Due to the military coup, villagers living in K’Ser Doh, Ler Muh Lah and Ler Doh Soh townships are deeply concerned about a renewal of military abuse as in the past and are now living in fear. Some villagers have engaged in anti-coup protests, but others have not because they were warned against doing so by local leaders. Even though villagers can travel as they used to, the price of some goods has increased due to the military coup, thus adding to the livelihood challenges of villagers. Medical and banking services have also been impacted by the coup., Since the military coup that took place on February 1st 2021, local people have felt fear and concern [about the return to military rule], and have been protesting against the dictatorship. Villagers also keep watch at night [to protect themselves because they heard rumours that the military leaders released prisoners to attack villagers]., Many civilians are fearful and worried about the [recent] military coup because during the coups that took place in 1962 and 1988, there were unlawful killings of innocent civilians. Furthermore, the activists who stood up for peace [at that time] were put in prison. During the armed conflict in 1947, many Karen civilians were arrested and forced by the Tatmadaw to carry rations and ammunition. The Tatmadaw also used civilians as human shields when attacking areas under Karen National Union [KNU] control. This traumatised civilians and they remain fearful [to this day]., On February 2nd 2021, local villagers in P’law area, Ler Muh Lah Township, and in Kleh Muh Htee area, K’Ser Doh Township heard a rumour about the Tatmadaw forcing people to become porters. Out of fear, male villagers fled to hiding places and began sleeping outside of the village. However, this rumour was not true and nothing happened in the end., Civilians in K’Moh Thway area in Ler Doh Soh Township, Way Ta Eh and Paw Hkloh areas in K’Ser Doh Township, as well as P’law area in Ler Muh Lah Township took part in protests against the military coup. There were four slogans used in these protests: (1) Abolish the military dictatorship; (2) Abolish the 2008 Constitution; (3) Implement a federal democracy; (4) Release the wrongfully detained., There are many Karen people who have not been involved in the protests. On February 21st 2021, [Mergui-Tavoy] district [KNU] leaders held a meeting with local [KNU] leaders in Kleh Muh Htee area, K’Ser Doh Township, telling Karen people not to participate in the protests. As a result, local Karen people did not get involved. When villagers [tried to] organise Karen civilians to participate in the protests, they responded that their leaders would not allow them to do so., A rumour spread throughout Ler Muh Lah and K’Ser Doh townships about the Tatmadaw releasing prisoners to commit violent abuses [against the protesters and other civilians]. This resulted in fears and concern by villagers. As a result, they have been keeping security watch in their villages located in P’law area, Ler Muh Lah Township, and in Kleh Muh Htee area, K’Ser Doh Township during the night. However, no released prisoners have been caught [in the area] so far, and there has not been any issue [caused by the released prisoners]. Villagers have, however, seen in social media that some [released] prisoners were caught [found] in the towns of Tavoy and Bleik., There is no issue for villagers travelling and working. The situation remains the same as before [the coup]. The prices of some products and food items have however increased due to the military coup. This is creating challenges for poor people and is leading to food insecurity [for civilians]., In addition, the banks closed down because of the military coup, and the bank workers have been participating in the protests. Because of this, families who live abroad can no longer transfer money [to Myanmar] and no one can withdraw money from the bank either., [Public] hospitals closed down while nurses and doctors participated in the anti-coup protests and in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) [it is unclear if the hospitals were able to continue operating on some days]. This became a challenge for sick people to get medical treatment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mergui-tavoy-district-situation-update-impact-military-coup-villagers-k-ser-doh-ler

Over the past three months, from February to May 2021, hundreds of people, including children, have been killed and many injured during the protests., The military-run State Administrative Council has targeted doctors and other health workers for taking a leading role in the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM).

UN General Assembly Action Needed on Myanmar,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,24 May 2021,"Resolution Should Be Adopted, Urging States to Halt Arms Transfers, By Widad Franco, The United Nations Security Council, entrusted by the UN Charter to be the world’s guardian of international peace and security, has done little to help the people of Myanmar besides issuing statements asking the junta to end the violence and release prisoners. But the UN General Assembly can help motivate the council take action to stem the rampant abuses., In the absence of robust Security Council action, the 193-nation General Assembly should adopt a resolution condemning the junta’s rights violations and calling on all UN members to halt arms transfers to Myanmar. While not legally binding on states, such a resolution would carry significant political weight. As the UN’s most representative body, it would send a powerful signal to the junta and press members of the Security Council to adopt a legally binding resolution – as recently urged by a group of 205 nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch., Governments should recognize that arms and materiel sold to Myanmar’s military will likely be used to commit abuses against the population. Arms embargoes can help prevent such crimes, a possibility recently highlighted by UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet who warned Myanmar could escalate into a “full-blown conflict” like in Syria., Last week, a scheduled vote on a draft resolution circulated by Liechtenstein calling “for an immediate suspension of the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer of all weapons and munitions” to Myanmar was postponed. A vote could come as early as this week, though a revised version by members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) removes mention of suspending arms sales., The United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and other sponsor countries should work with Liechtenstein to ensure a vote is rescheduled as soon as possible, with the language on halting arms sales. They should not play the game of saying this is a regional issue and hiding behind ASEAN to avoid their own responsibilities; ASEAN is built on the principle of noninterference and will never deliver on Myanmar. Instead, they should lobby UN members to ensure a robust resolution receives support from the General Assembly. Concerned governments should then use the resolution to press the Security Council to act., Inaction by UN member states will only embolden Myanmar’s military and encourage more abuses. General Assembly action is needed now.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/un-general-assembly-action-needed-myanmar

"Statement by the United Nations in Myanmar on the situation in Mindat, Chin State [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,UNCT Myanmar,Protection and Human Rights,21 May 2021,"(Yangon, 21 May 2021): The United Nations in Myanmar is alarmed by the humanitarian impact of ongoing violence in the town of Mindat in Chin State in western Myanmar, following reports of indiscriminate attacks by the security forces against civilians and resulting population displacement and civilian casualties.
Local sources indicated that close to 4,000 people have been internally displaced since the hostilities escalated in the town of Mindat on 12 May, with an unconfirmed number, believed to be in thousands, hiding in nearby forests and mountains in search of safety and protection. A higher number of civilians remain in Mindat as they were reportedly not allowed to leave during the height of the hostilities.
There are reports of houses and other civilian property damaged, destroyed or occupied by security forces. An unconfirmed number of men, women, and children have lost their lives or sustained injuries because of the violence. The United Nations is also concerned by reports about the security forces using civilians as human shields and incidents of sexual assault perpetrated against women and girls.
People who have already fled and others who remain are in urgent need of food, water, shelter, access to healthcare and gender-based violence and psychological support. The United Nations and humanitarian partners are making efforts to assess and address these needs; however, humanitarian access challenges, including due to insecurity and road blockages, are complicating these efforts.
The United Nations calls on security forces to urgently take all necessary measures and precautions to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure, and to adhere to the fundamental principles of distinction, necessity, proportionality and protection.
We also call upon security forces to allow civilians who choose to leave areas of danger to do so without obstruction or delay, securing their safety, and to ensure that those who are injured are transferred to a medical facility situated in a safe area.
We urge everyone involved to facilitate the delivery of relief by the United Nations and all humanitarian partners to people fleeing the violence, those trapped in their homes and everyone affected, by ensuring safe and unhindered humanitarian access.
The United Nations reiterates its strong commitment to continue making all efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and protection services to people in need wherever they may be, guided by the internationally recognized principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence., Media contacts:, Valijon Ranoev Public Information Officer Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs +95970007815, ranoev@un.org, David Swanson Regional Public Information Officer UN Development Coordination Office, +66 6 5982 5682, swanson@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-united-nations-myanmar-situation-mindat-chin-state-enmy

The coup d’état has driven the collapse of public services and rising needs across Myanmar and compounded pre-existing humanitarian conditions and the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health system and banking sector have been severely disrupted, as have supply chains for food and other essential supplies. Schools have already been closed for more than a year due to Covid-19, and prospects for wide-scale resumption of in-person learning for Myanmar’s children look increasingly dim. Last month, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) highlighted the evolving cumulative socioeconomic impact of the pandemic and the political crisis. It warns that in a worst-case scenario, close to half of the country could be living in poverty by the beginning of 2022, effectively reversing gains made over the preceding decade. The coup and the ensuing political crisis contributed to an intensification of conflict, most notably in the south-east of the country. UN OCHA reported this month that there are about 366,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) spread across Myanmar., There have been escalating displacements caused by air strikes and armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Karen National Liberation Army in Kayin State since late 2020, which have destroyed homes and schools. The air strikes have affected over 45 villages in Kayin State where people have fled their homes to hide in the jungle (read Bangkok Post story here).

Myanmar: water shortage and Covid-19 pandemic against a political crisis backdrop,News and Press Release,SI,"Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 May 2021,"The Burmese people have been afflicted by a political, a social, and an economic crisis since the military junta seized power on the 1st of February 2021. In this strained context, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is worried about the aggravation of the health crisis and the water scarcity that concerns Myanmar during the dry season., The intense drought, a natural disaster that occurs every year, Every year, a long period of drought comes after the monsoon season, and people have to cope with water scarcity. The consequence of this natural disaster severely impacts the displaced people in the Rakhine State where nearly 130 000 Rohingya still live isolated in camps since the community conflicts broke out in 2012. In this tough situation, the global warming increases the pressure on the stocks of drinking water as well as it deepens and extends drought periods., SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has been going into action for a decade in order to answer to the urgent needs of Pauktaw camp's people and anticipate the repercussions of this scarcity that occurs earlier and earlier each year. Our teams keep a close watch on the drying up of the water reserves, especially the basins that collect monsoon water (which is then treated and distributed to the population). Campaigns are led alongside to raise communities' awareness on the moderate use of water several months before the dry season thereby ameliorating the water stocks management and delaying the drying up of the stocks. Besides, this year again Ramadan -- during which the use of water is generally increased- occurred during the dry season, affecting the level of the available stocks., When basins and ponds are empty, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL, in cooperation with UNICEF, provides water to the communities in order to meet their basic needs. To do so and when it is possible, our team uses a remote pumping system that enables the carrying of water from watering places to the water treatment centres in the camps or villages -- which are sometimes located 7 kilometres away., For other areas in Pauktaw which can only be reached by water ways, the only solution is to deliver it by boat., « It's a real logistical challenge. The teams organize the tasks of the different actors involved in the process -- contracting parties, partners, material suppliers and the communities who receive the deliveries- several months before the dry season so that everybody is ready on time. They have to handle daily difficulties: tide times, possible breakdowns, etc. The teams have to adapt to this kind of challenges all the time » explains Jean-Loup Gouot, Country Director of the mission in Myanmar. In the end, the local population receives about 7.5 litres of drinking water per person and per day, barely the third of the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organization., The COVID-19 pandemic, a challenge which adds to the water rarefaction, The water management became more complicated in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, since the mitigation of the virus' propagation requires large quantities of water in order to raise the hygiene level. SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL's response to the pandemic consisted in the setting-up of hand-washing stations in Pauktaw, water taps and hand pumps, the disinfection of latrines, the distribution of hygiene kits (soaps, antibacterial) and the dissemination of preventive measures., The current crisis may jeopardize SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL's projects, The current political crisis reduces the public's attention as well as the country's capacities to prevent and handle the virus. This situation also impacts the banking sector and directly threatens our current and coming projects. While improved hygienic practices are essential in this pandemic period, limited access to liquid funds delay our payment capacities which in turn affect the maintaining of good hygienic conditions. This liquidity shortage equally affects the renovation of the basins which has to be done during the dry season and can't wait any longer., ""We have to carry on with our efforts, in cooperation with the communities and the partners involved in the area in order to identify appropriate and lasting solutions, and therefore keep helping the most vulnerable people"", concludes Jean-Loup Gouot.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-water-shortage-and-covid-19-pandemic-against-political-crisis-backdrop

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 May 2021,"On Saturday, May 15, 2021, the Myanmar military – known as the Tatmadaw – launched a coordinated attack against the town of Mindat in Myanmar’s western Chin State. This latest crackdown was precipitated by several weeks of sustained fighting between the Tatmadaw and civilian defense forces in Mindat, formed in March in response to increasing military violence against civilians participating in the peaceful nationwide anti-coup resistance. Following an imposition of martial law on the grounds of insurgency, the siege of Mindat has been characterized by indiscriminate deployment of heavy weaponry by land and air, widespread use of forced labor and human shields, and active obstruction of delivery of basic humanitarian necessities for civilians, including food, water, and access to medical care and supplies., In response to escalating violence against civilians in Mindat, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) issued the following statement:, “The reports out of Mindat, including the Tatmadaw’s blocking of humanitarian and medical aid and access to clean water, expose the horrifying reality of ongoing violence against tens of thousands of civilians in Mindat by the Myanmar military. These actions further echo the unconscionable actions and severe breaches of international human rights law perpetrated by the Tatmadaw since the group seized power in a February 1 coup d’état. Physicians for Human Rights is appalled by the Myanmar military’s unlawful implementation of martial law in Mindat, who has pushed civilians into Mindat’s surrounding jungles to escape detention, and the reported obstruction in access to clean drinking water., “Through an unlawful and violent campaign to seize power, directly violating security forces’ responsibility and duty to protect, the Tatmadaw continues to violate the basic human rights of Myanmar’s people. Mindat civilians, mostly men, who have reportedly been forced into the forested areas around Mindat, have little to no access to shelter, water, food, or medical care. Their forced absence has left women and children in Mindat vulnerable to the brutal tactics of war deployed against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities by the Myanmar military, including sexual and gender-based violence, which PHR has long documented and corroborated., “This new wave of violence in western Chin State has further contributed to the displacement of tens of thousands of people, both internally and across the Indian border. The escalating crisis critically compounds already strained access to humanitarian and medical aid experienced by internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Myanmar. Medical personnel are reportedly unable to reach IDPs in Mindat without coming under artillery fire by the Tatmadaw, and are prevented from tending to patients in critical condition due to a lack of safe medical facilities available for emergency surgeries. PHR condemns the Myanmar military’s obstruction of critical medical and humanitarian aid, and the impediment of medical personnel’s duty to administer care to civilians desperately in need., “Physicians for Human Rights demands that the Tatmadaw immediately cease attacks against the Mindat community, reestablish access to clean water and medical supplies, and end the obstruction of medical and humanitarian aid, which is in grave violation of international human rights law. As well, PHR calls on international and regional actors, including the United Nations Security Council and the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, to urgently negotiate an agreement to establish a safe and secure demilitarized humanitarian corridor into Mindat and other similarly afflicted territories across Myanmar. PHR emphasizes the acute need for humanitarian and medical personnel to fully access affected civilians without encumbrance, as is necessary to provide health care to the sick and wounded, to deliver humanitarian aid more broadly, and to ensure the safety and security of surrounding communities., “The latest human rights violations demonstrate that ongoing sanctions and justice and accountability efforts are not sufficiently serving as deterrents. International actors that have been leading the effort to advance targeted sanctions against perpetrators of these abuses – such as the United States and European Union – should build a broad, international coalition comprised of governments and businesses in support of a sanctions regime that will prevent the Tatmadaw and other security forces from accessing resources to continue perpetrating abuses against the Myanmar people.”, Dr. Maung,* a volunteer surgeon based in Mandalay and a PHR medical partner, said that he had spoken with medical colleagues on the ground in Mindat who have reported on the dire need for immediate medical aid. “Several patients are in need of emergency surgery. Without it, they won’t survive for long. Surgeons are traveling from Mandalay to try and assist the wounded, but first they must be able to transfer the patients to a safe zone, as there is little they can do in the jungle,” he said., In a statement responding to the Myanmar military’s coup, PHR condemned mass arbitrary arrests and detention of civilian leaders and human rights defenders in Myanmar, and called for an immediate de-escalation of the situation, the prompt release of political prisoners, and the restoration of communications networks. Following escalating violence directly after the coup, PHR additionally condemned attacks against protestors and the reported detention of medical professionals., PHR reprises its call to the international community to hold the Myanmar military and other responsible actors accountable for its August 2017 campaign of widespread and systematic violence against the Rohingya ethnic minority in “clearance operations” that forced more than 720,000 Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh. The Tatmadaw has an egregious history of human rights violations against civilians, including perpetrating forced labor, sexual violence, torture, extrajudicial killings, child labor, and other abuses in Myanmar’s ethnic territories, including Chin State, which PHR documented in 2011. International efforts to quell the violence are critically important as the perpetrators of these grave violations increase their political power and continue to operate with impunity within Myanmar., *Dr. Maung asked that we use only his surname for security reasons., Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

Jesuit Refugee Service Calls for Protection of those Displaced by Crisis in Myanmar,News and Press Release,JRS,Protection and Human Rights,20 May 2021,"Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) expresses concern for the dire humanitarian consequences of the crisis in Myanmar and calls for peace, protection, and non-refoulement of Myanmar citizens as they seek refuge in neighboring countries. Government and military actors must refrain from all forms of violence against civilians, peaceful protestors, and journalists, and respect the fundamental human rights of all people in Myanmar, including freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, and free flow of information., Since February 1, over 10,000 refugees have fled Myanmar and 53,000 have been internally displaced as a result of the military coup. As Myanmar continues to experience ongoing violence, neighboring countries have imposed strict border restrictions to refugees seeking international protection., On May 9, more than 2,000 refugees from Myanmar were returned by the Thai Army. It is the latest of many pushbacks by Thailand putting refugees in grave danger. China and India have tightened its border restrictions citing COVID-19 but essentially barring entry of refugees. In March, Malaysia has deported more than a thousand Myanmar citizens exposing them to violence and insecurity., JRS urges countries in the region to offer safety and protection for those seeking safety, to protect those refugees already within their borders, and to refrain from forcibly returning refugees. Countries can abide by international standards of protection and transparency while also putting in place measures that manage risks to public health., JRS unites with Pope Francis in His call for peace: “I too kneel on the streets of Myanmar and say: stop the violence! I too extend my arms and say: let dialogue prevail!”, JRS urgently calls on countries across the region to offer refuge and protection to all those fleeing for safety. It is vital that anyone seeking asylum in another country is able to access it. Children, women, and men fleeing for their lives must not be returned to a place where their safety or freedom may be at risk. This principle of non-refoulement is a cornerstone of international law and is binding on all states., The US also has an important role to play in the protection of those displaced by the violence in Myanmar. “As the US continues to speak out against actions being taken by Myanmar’s military government, JRS/USA urges the Biden Administration to also engage with regional partners to ensure that refugees are offered the protection they seek and deserve,” said Giulia McPherson, Director of Advocacy. “US leadership on this issue can have a positive impact on how regional governments choose to respond to this crisis and we encourage the US to take decisive action.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/jesuit-refugee-service-calls-protection-those-displaced-crisis-myanmar
"Myanmar: UN expert welcomes “new blow” against junta’s finances, urges all nations step up with sanctions",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,20 May 2021,"GENEVA (20 May 2021) -- A UN human rights expert today welcomed the announcement of a new set of government sanctions against Myanmar's junta by the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, highlighting in particular the US designation of the junta itself, or the State Administrative Council (SAC) for sanctions., ""It is imperative that the international community ramp up the size and scope of sanctions as the junta ramps up its repression of the people of Myanmar,"" said Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar., ""This week the United States has taken one of the most significant steps to date against the Myanmar junta, first by sanctioning not only individuals but the State Administrative Council itself; and second, by opening the door to targeting those who continue to do business with the junta and therefore aid and abet their relentless attacks against the people of Myanmar., ""The designation of the SAC strikes a new blow to the junta's finances. It is a significant step in the right direction."", As a result of the designation of the SAC under US Executive Order 14014, all United States nationals are prohibited from providing funds, goods, or services that benefit the State Administrative Council. Additionally, transactions with, involving, or for the benefit of the State Administrative Council that are undertaken in US dollars are prohibited to the extent such transactions involve the US financial sector. This means that not only US banks, but also non-US banks and other entities that undertake transactions with a U.S. nexus could face criminal and civil penalties in the United States if they willfully facilitate US dollar transactions for the benefit of the SAC., The naming of the SAC paves the way for further designations of individuals or entities that are determined to have ""materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to"" the State Administrative Council., ""This is a warning to all those who are willing to conduct business as usual with the junta,"" Andrews said. ""Those who continue to aid and abet this murderous enterprise --- be they international businesses, banks, arms traffickers, or government entities providing financial, technological or other support --- are now on notice that they themselves could face sanctions., ""I am hopeful that this action will be a wake-up call. Not only is doing business with the junta morally reprehensible, it could now mean being cut off from the U.S. financial system and/or facing criminal or civil penalties in the United States. If doing the right and just thing is not a factor in one's decision making, then perhaps protecting one's self interest will be."", Andrews also welcomed the new sanctions imposed on Monday by the United Kingdom and Canada, including sanctions targeting the junta's profiting from the timber and gems trade., ""The coordination of these sanctions by the US, UK, and Canada is a welcome development,"" the UN expert said., ""Hopefully it will lead to a tough, fully coordinated multilateral sanctions regime that enables nations to deliver the most powerful blow possible against the horror that is being inflicted on the people of Myanmar."", Andrews said, however, that more must be done, and done quickly., ""The revenue that they continue to seize from the oil and gas sector has become a lifeline for the junta. Profits from this sector are estimated to be close to what is needed to supply the forces that are keeping them in power,"" he said. ""We know the junta's sources of funds are limited and that the income from oil and gas sales helped previous juntas withstand international sanctions. The people of Myanmar cannot afford for history to repeat itself."", Andrews also urged countries that have yet to impose sanctions on Myanmar to take action. ""I urge those countries that have yet to impose costs on the junta for its illegal coup and its systematic atrocities and human rights violations to reconsider. Now is the time to step up."", ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews* (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

"Myanmar: The outlook for Myanmar’s inorganic fertilizer use and 2021 crop harvest | An ex-ante assessment, Strategy Support Program | Working Paper 10 April 2021",Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 May 2021,"1. INTRODUCTION, Agro-chemicals are important inputs for crop production and increasingly so in many low and middle- income countries. Inorganic fertilizers, in particular, are often the most important purchased input for farmers. Thus, farmer access to affordable fertilizer is an important concern for governments, development partners, and farmers. Current international and local disruptions to fertilizer supply chains threaten farmer’s access to fertilizer in Myanmar. Moreover, effective farmer demand for fertilizer in Myanmar has taken a crucial hit as well due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the political crisis. This will likely lead to significantly lower fertilizer use in the country in 2021., International fertilizer markets have undergone several recent changes. First, international fertilizer prices are rapidly increasing. In March 2021, US prices of urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) were estimated to be 27 and 48 percent higher, respectively, than a year earlier (Quinn 2021). Higher prices are expected globally through 2021 due to high prices of feedstock (Ibendahl 2021) Second, international shipping costs in 2021 are substantially higher due to a global shortage of containers, which is especially problematic in Asia due to COVID-19 related trade reductions. International freight costs in the Southeast Asian region in the beginning of 2021 were estimated to be two to four times higher than during normal times (USDA 2021b, Fitch Ratings 2021)., Locally, COVID-19 and political crises have created unprecedented challenges to the functioning of agricultural value chains and the agri-food system. The COVID-19 crisis has led to large income declines in the country overall and to substantial disruptions in Myanmar’s agri-food system (Boughton et al. 2021; Headey et al. 2020). The political crisis has caused large problems in the banking and finance sector, in international trade, and in the local transport sector, among others (USDA 2021a). Moreover, the currency of Myanmar, the kyat (MMK), is rapidly depreciating. This is important as most inorganic fertilizer used in the country is imported. By early April 2021, the MMK had depreciated by almost 20 percent in USD terms compared to early February 2021, according to a licensed moneychanger in Yangon (USAID 2021). At the farm level, the political crisis is leading to lower credit availability for farmers, a decrease in farm prices for some crops, and more uncertain agricultural profitability (MAPSA 2021)., The purpose of this research note is to assess how both international developments and domestic crises might affect fertilizer use in Myanmar in the upcoming agricultural year. We discuss in turn the data and methods used for our assessment, the functioning of inorganic fertilizer value chains in normal years in Myanmar, recent increases in fertilizer prices and decreases in use, and the expected implications of reduced fertilizer use on crop output in 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-outlook-myanmar-s-inorganic-fertilizer-use-and-2021-crop-harvest-ex-ante

There has been a rise in both attacks and retaliatory activities throughout KHRG’s operational area, notably in Kler Lwee Htoo [Nyaunglebin], Mu Traw [Hpapun] and Doo Tha Htoo districts [Thaton], in complete violation of section 5(a) of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), which forbids the signatories from carrying out armed attacks in ceasefire areas., On March 27th 2021, KNLA Brigade 5 attacked and scorched a Tatmadaw outpost along the Salween River manned by Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #349 soldiers in Thee Mu Hta, near Meh Nuh Hta village, Pah Heh village tract,[7] Bu Tho Township. Ten Tatmadaw soldiers were killed during the attack, and at least eight were taken captive by the KNLA. One KNLA soldier also died., In what seems to have been a direct response to this attack, the Tatmadaw carried out a series of airstrikes against both KNLA and civilian targets in Mu Traw and Kler Lwee Htoo districts from March 27th to March 30th, killing at least 16 people and injuring 25. Airstrikes were in most cases preceded by reconnaissance flyovers by Tatmadaw drones or helicopters.

The support is aimed at addressing their most pressing needs such as medical expenses while reducing the risk of resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as borrowing money or taking on debt, or reducing expenditure on key items including water, food, education and healthcare., UNHCR continues to provide targeted non-food items (NFI) to meet the needs of displaced persons. In March and April, UNHCR distributed NFI items including blankets, mosquito nets, plastic mats, kitchen sets, tarpaulins, solar lights, soap, and jerry cans to 1,034 families (4,354 individuals) in Kachin and northern Shan states., In March, UNHCR and partners, completed a community-based project in Mogaung Township, Kachin State. A communal hall was completed with the involvement of the community and will benefit 450 individuals. Since the beginning of the year, UNHCR and partners have completed several projects benefitting over 4,000 individuals.

During the reporting period, a number of community-based projects have been progressing; two community water pond rehabilitation projects are near completion, as is the drilling of a borehole, while another borehole is in the early stages of work. The installation of 59 solar streetlights has been completed in three villages, and a road project and water pond project have been initiated in two village tracts. In another location, a project to improve village paths and access roads in two villages is more than halfway complete., South-east, Sustained armed clashes in the southeast region of Myanmar between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), including the use of airstrikes, have led to the displacement of an estimated 44,300 people, 5,000 of whom have crossed the border into Thailand and have subsequently returned to Myanmar and remain displaced internally., The current political situation continues to result in the suspension of many activities in the southeast, both of UNHCR’s and partners’, aside from a few including those carried out by UNHCR through direct implementation., On 27 April, UNHCR distributed non-food items (NFIs) to new IDPs who fled from airstrikes in Hpa-Pun Township, benefitting 46 families (191 individuals)., In coordination with the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS), UNHCR facilitated two first aid and trauma trainings targeting 35 members of the community and civil society organizations (CSOs) in Loikaw Township, Kayah State. Given the positive feedback received, two more similar trainings will be organized for May targeting 60 individuals., In March and April, the implementation of community-based projects in Kayin State progressed with an aim of improving infrastructure and supporting peaceful coexistence among communities. Several projects are in various stages of completion, including solar streetlight installation and the construction of a primary school, which are nearing completion, and the construction of a health centre including staff housing and the construction of a study hall are nearly half complete.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-myanmar-operational-update-march-april-2021

Will the UN hold Myanmar’s Military Accountable for Its Crimes against Children?,News and Press Release,IPS,Protection and Human Rights,13 May 2021,"By Yanghee Lee, SEOUL, May 13 2021 (IPS) - In one particularly bloody day in March, Myanmar’s security forces shot and killed at least ten children, some as young as 6, in violent crackdowns against peaceful protests. Since the military seized control over the country three months ago, more than 50 children have been killed, countless others injured, and more than 900 children and young people arbitrarily detained across the country., Security forces have also occupied more than 60 schools and university campuses, exacerbating the education crisis for almost 12 million children. This week, as we mark 100 days since Myanmar’s military seized control of the country, the chaos and devastation show no signs of slowing., The Myanmar military’s blatant disregard for children’s lives is nothing new. Known as the Tatmadaw, they forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya civilians into Bangladesh, the majority of them children, in 2016-2017. I had called this “the hallmarks of genocide”., The UN secretary-general has documented the Tatmadaw’s grave violations against children across the country year after year, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, and attacks on schools and hospitals. Currently, many schools and hospitals have been seized by the Tatmadaw. And at least three high schools were bombed last month, according to groups in Karen state., As the former UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar and a founding member of a new Special Advisory Council on Myanmar, I have seen first-hand the devastating consequences of the Tatmadaw’s brutal tactics on children’s lives., I have seen children who survived being thrown into fire by the Tatmadaw. It sent chills down my spine when a mother told me she had to leave behind her baby who had been thrown into a river, because she had to see to the safety of her other children in their exodus into Bangladesh. I heard many more similar testimonies., Since 2003, the secretary-general has included the Tatmadaw for recruitment and use of children in his ‘list of shame’—an annex to his annual report on children and armed conflict where he names those responsible for grave violations against children. Listing is an important accountability tool since it names the perpetrators, draws the UN Security Council’s attention, and opens the door to engagement with the UN to end abuses., But in June 2020, Secretary-General António Guterres removed the Tatmadaw from his list for recruitment and use of children, even though in the same report, the UN had documented 205 cases where the Tatmadaw had recruited or used children in its ranks in the preceding year., Having reported on human rights concerns in Myanmar for many years, I can say with certainly that despite Myanmar’s pledges to stop recruiting and using children in conflict, the Tatmadaw never ceased the practice. It was also a known fact that in order to leave the Tatmadaw, a regular soldier had to recruit two children to replace him, as term limits for service were vague., At the time, the secretary-general said he delisted the Tatmadaw due to “continued significant decrease” in recruitment and ongoing efforts to prevent new recruitments and release any remaining children in its ranks. He also said that the delisting was conditional and that failure to end recruitment and use would result in relisting. Prematurely removing parties like the Tatmadaw from the list—and this was not an isolated case—threatens the credibility of the list, a critical mechanism for protecting children and holding their abusers accountable., Being removed from the list seems to have emboldened the Tatmadaw to commit even more violations. In the first half of 2020, the Tatmadaw used 301 boys in support functions such as military camp maintenance and digging trenches. And in October 2020, two boys were killed after a Tatmadaw unit allegedly used them as human shields, in an incident that the UN publicly condemned., As protests across Myanmar continue, armed conflict is escalating between the military and ethnic armed groups. Children will face even greater risk, so the Security Council must urgently act to stop the military in its tracks. Instead, the Council seems hard pressed to reach consensus due to China and Russia’s opposition to strong measures such as an arms embargo., The 2020 delisting of the Tatmadaw was inexplicable and unjustifiable given the military’s conduct. Now Secretary-General Guterres has an opportunity to set the record straight. In a few weeks, he will release his 2021 report and list of perpetrators., He should return the Tatmadaw to the list for its recruitment and use of children. In light of the military’s total disregard for children’s rights, this is a concrete action he must take to hold the Tatmadaw accountable for its crimes against children., Yanghee Lee is Professor in the department of Child Psychology and Education at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul.

Myanmar refugee emergency (10 May 2021),News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2021,"With over 10,000 refugees fleeing Myanmar in just three months since February 2021 because of violence and the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, neighbouring countries in the region are witnessing increasing arrivals of people from Myanmar seeking international protection.' UNHCR and partners stand ready to support host countries and communities that have generously provided safety to these refugees to assist them and to find solutions to their plight. Persons already abroad who fear return to Myanmar should also have access to protection., Key protection messages, Words matter. The men, women and children fleeing Myanmar because violence since February 2021 are refugees. As refugees, they should be allowed access to the territory to seek asylum and be protected against refoulement, which means that they should not be returned to their country as long as it is not safe. People from Myanmar already abroad should not be returned when seeking international protection and should be referred to the appropriate authorities. Refugees have the right to return to their homes voluntarily, in safety and with dignity., While a solution to this crisis lies in Myanmar, the international community must provide protection and support to fleeing refugees. Governments are encouraged to keep their borders open and allow refugees from Myanmar safety and protection in line with long traditions of offering sanctuary to those in need. In order to respond to humanitarian needs, it will be important to provide support and adopt an inclusive approach in responding to the problems of refugees fleeing their country, including access to territory, protection from detention and abuse, and access to basic services. Humanitarian access to arriving refugees is essential to provide the necessary assistance. As the identification of individuals with specific needs and vulnerabilities is a key element of any humanitarian response, it is important to strengthen existing systems for the identification of unaccompanied minors and separated children, survivors of violence and torture and persons suffering from trauma amongst others., Where COVID-19 related bans or border closures are implemented, such measures must not result in denying refugees an effective opportunity to seek asylum or result in refoulement., As in any humanitarian crisis, the importance of upholding the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum is paramount and States would need to assess the situation of arrivals from Myanmar carefully so as to identify armed elements and separate them from the civilian refugee population.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-refugee-emergency-10-may-2021
Myanmar: Time for business to take a stand against human rights violations - UN experts,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2021,"GENEVA (12 May 2021) -- As powerful actors in the current fragile and deteriorating context in Myanmar, businesses must uphold their human rights responsibilities and put pressure on the military junta to halt grave human rights violations, UN experts* said today., The coup of 1 February has placed businesses with operations or business relations in Myanmar in a challenging situation. While some businesses have reiterated their public support for the rule of law and human rights, and cut ties with the junta, many continue to engage in business with the military as if nothing has happened, they said.
As the military junta is intensifying its campaign of repression against its own people in Myanmar, the experts urged companies to act in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to avoid contributing to human rights violations, or becoming complicit in crimes if they continue to operate in Myanmar., ""Because the risk of gross human rights violations has greatly increased in Myanmar, action by States and human rights due diligence by business, and investors, should be rapidly and proportionately heightened,"" said Surya Deva, Vice-Chair of the Working Group on Business and Human Rights., ""Businesses, both individually and collectively, should exert the maximum leverage on the military in Myanmar to halt what the High Commissioner for Human Rights has said may amount to crimes against humanity,"" added the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews., Information suggests that the military's economic interests, including access to arms and technology, remain largely untouched and unchallenged by other States, and businesses operating in the country., ""The revenues that the military earns from domestic and foreign businesses substantially enhances its ability and capacity to carry out these grave violations,"" Andrews said., The UN experts noted that measures taken by businesses, such as suspension of payments and financial flows that may aid the perpetration of widespread and systematic human rights violations, should target the military and have the minimum possible negative impact on the rights of employees and the general population., In 2019, the Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded that no business should enter into an economic or financial relationship with the security forces of Myanmar, in particular the military, or any enterprise owned or controlled by them or their individual members, until and unless they are restructured and transformed., The experts also endorsed the Human Rights Council's call for home States of businesses investing in, or with supply chains in Myanmar to take appropriate measures so that those businesses actively conduct heightened human rights due diligence and ensure their activities do not cause or contribute to any human rights violations., They added that States should also urge international financial and development institutions to exercise heightened due diligence and cut ties with the military., ""There may come a point at which businesses might need to suspend operations or even consider exit from the country if risks of involvement in human rights abuse cannot be reasonably managed, while doing so in a manner to safeguard the well-being of workers and affected communities,"" Deva said., Businesses which continue to operate in Myanmar should take all possible measures to protect their employees, support the exercise of all human rights by the people of Myanmar, including the right to peaceful protests, and speak up to preserve civic space and the independence of the media., All States, including leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and G20 countries, should take strong, decisive and coordinated action, and encourage their businesses operating in Myanmar to prevent further human rights violations, the experts added., The Working Group has addressed the topic of heightened action and human rights due diligence in its recent report to the General Assembly: Business and Human Rights in Conflict-Affected Regions: Towards heightened Action., ENDS, The experts: The UN Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises (known as the Working Group on Business and Human Rights): Mr. Dante Pesce (Chairperson), Mr. Surya Deva (Vice-Chairperson), Ms. Elżbieta Karska, Mr. Githu Muigai, and Ms. Anita Ramasastry; Mr. Thomas Andrews Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Health
Recovery and Reconstruction",11 May 2021,"This emergency appeal is part of a Federation-wide approach which is based on one plan with the response activities of all IFRC network members contributing to the response. The funding requirement of CHF 4.5 million comprises all the support and funding that will be needed for the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) supported by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to deliver the immediate assistance and ongoing support to people affected by Civil Unrest-Myanmar. It is acknowledged that in the initial phase of the response immediate and timely support was provided to MRCS through bilateral contributions by movement partners. This funding request reflects additional needs due to the escalating nature of the crisis, supporting MRCS across the 12-month response phase., Specifically, this Emergency Appeal seeks a total of CHF 4.5 million to enable the IFRC to support the MRCS to deliver assistance and support to some 236,400 people for 12 months., Situation overview, Since 1 February 2021, Myanmar has been undergoing a political crisis with civil unrest precipitating a humanitarian crisis affecting populations across many parts of the country., Confrontation between security forces and demonstrators across the country has led to increasing casualty rates. All 17 States and regions are impacted by the multiple effects of the crisis, with specific townships in at least 10 of these states/regions in need of immediate assistance. Martial law is in place in six townships in Yangon. Regulatory measures include a curfew, with arrests, detention and property searches as well as restrictions on the internet and social media. A large cross-section of the population is impacted, with a high casualty rate reported for young people., The ongoing Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) includes the critical sectors, of banking, health and transport. Banking limitations and a disrupted supply chain activity have added to increased food prices and limited access to cash at a national level. Economic impacts include job loss, particularly in peri-urban areas with already vulnerable populations facing food insecurity., Myanmar’s Public health system is also severely disrupted, reducing access for medical services, particularly for people with less income and access challenges. With a high number of injuries amongst the civilian population and a security environment, in which medical workers are at risk, affected people are facing restricted access to emergency hospital services for urgent medical care. The disruptions to the public health sector also increase risks for further widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 with reduced roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccine., In areas of protracted crisis, there has been an escalation and/or a renewal of clashes between the Myanmar military and EAOs, including in Kachin and Northern Shan and in Kayin State. The humanitarian implications are increased levels of displacement in these areas and an increase in basic needs for people already experiencing temporary or long-term displacement. There are also risks for cross border displacement at an increasing scale further compounding the regional implications of this crisis.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-civil-unrest-response-revised-appeal-n-mdrmm016
"Press briefing notes on Myanmar, 11 May 2021",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,11 May 2021,"Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Rupert Colville, Location: Geneva, Date: 11 May 2021, More than 100 days after the coup in Myanmar, the military authorities are showing no sign of letting up in their brutal crackdown on opponents in a bid to consolidate their hold on power. At the same time, there is no weakening of the resolve of the civil disobedience movement and other facets of opposition to the coup leaders., As of 10 May, credible sources indicate that the security forces, using unnecessary, disproportionate and lethal force to suppress demonstrations and other forms of public participation, have killed at least 782 individuals since the coup on 1 February. While much of the world's attention has been on the number of peaceful protesters and bystanders killed by the security forces, the authorities continue to commit other gross human rights violations against the people of Myanmar., There are daily raids on private homes and offices, and more than 3,740 people are currently in detention. We are deeply alarmed that the whereabouts and fate of hundreds of these individuals are unknown. These are situations that may amount to enforced disappearances., Of those in custody, the vast majority have not been brought before a judge, while most of the 86 people prosecuted thus far have been tried in secret, with limited or no access to any form of legal counsel. Military tribunals and courts martial have been established in several townships in which martial law was declared. At least 25 individuals have received the death sentence to date – some 20 of whom were tried in absentia., Over the past month, the military leadership has issued over 1,561 arrest warrants targeting civil society activists, trade unionists, journalists, academics, public personalities and online voices, so driving the vast majority of them underground. To intensify pressure, the military authorities have resorted to taking relatives of wanted people into custody to force them to turn themselves in to the police., The military authorities are also stepping up their efforts to pressure civil servants back to work. In recent weeks, the coup leadership has dismissed, removed, or suspended more than 3,000 civil servants – nearly 70 per cent of those targeted have been women. Those suspended include 990 university professors, researchers and assistants who in the last few days have been suspended for failing to report to work. There are reports that up to 11,000 more educational workers were suspended on Monday., We are also deeply concerned about the situation of people fleeing persecution, especially human rights defenders and journalists., As the armed conflicts between the Tatmadaw and some of the ethnic armed organizations, particularly in Kachin and Kayin states, have intensified, people seeking protection are being forced to consider seeking safety outside the country. When they do so, they should receive such protection and support from Myanmar's neighbours., It is clear that there needs to be greater international involvement to prevent the human rights situation in Myanmar from deteriorating further. Despite the five-point plan agreed at the ASEAN leaders' meeting on 24 April, the Myanmar military leadership has shown no sign of abiding by it. We call on ASEAN to react quickly and to intensify its actions to ensure the military keeps to these commitments and to hold them accountable for failing to do so., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:, Rupert Colville + 41 22 917 9767 / rcolville@ohchr.org or

Three months in and no way out: World Vision calls for an end to fear and uncertainty for Myanmar’s children,News and Press Release,World Vision,Protection and Human Rights,10 May 2021,"News about Myanmar has dominated global media reports over the past three months. The protracted instability in the country, set within the context of COVID-19 of which little has been reported by comparison, has fractured social progress and exacerbated vulnerabilities within communities, especially among children. World Vision is deeply concerned about the effects of local unrest and the global pandemic on Myanmar’s children, whose well-being and future is in jeopardy., From World Vision’s Aftershocks report, the rise in cases of early marriage, as well as sexual and physical violence against children, is alarming and often goes unreported. After suffering a year of lock-down, isolation and time away from school, Myanmar’s children now face the bleak prospect of arrested development on all fronts – physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual. To date, more than 50 children have been caught in crossfires and killed. Millions more live under a cloud of uncertainty. World Vision is calling for united action against the long-term effects of COVID-19, and for an immediate end to fear and suffering caused by human actions., At a time of the year when children usually prepare for and look forward to attending school, this excitement is overshadowed by their fears about personal safety, lost livelihoods, loved ones who are ill or in danger, and lost opportunities. World Vision is present in the communities we serve, and will continue to stand with children and their families to ensure they receive support. This includes providing counselling, food and financial aid within our limited operating context. We pray and urgently call for a peaceful resolution that respects international humanitarian law, so that the children and families in Myanmar can hope for the future and live life to their fullest potential., World Vision’s commitment to the children and people in Myanmar remains steadfast. We have been operating in Myanmar for almost 30 years, with programming in 12 out of 14 regions. Our work impacts the lives of 1.6 million people, including 475,660 children across the country. We facilitate long-term sustainable development plans that are focused on building livelihoods, improving food security and access to health care and education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/three-months-and-no-way-out-world-vision-calls-end-fear-and-uncertainty-myanmar-s

"Mu Traw District Short Update: Skirmishes, indiscriminate shelling by the Tatmadaw and landmine contamination in Dwe Lo and Bu Tho townships, March and April 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",7 May 2021,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Dwe Lo and Bu Tho townships, Mu Traw District from March 28th to April 5th 2021. The Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired mortar shells at several localities, resulting in displacement and unexploded ordnance contamination. The shelling occurred in a context of renewed fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA following the February 2021 military coup. Local civilians are now afraid for their security. New landmines were also planted in certain areas and now pose a security threat to local communities. On April 5th 2021, a civilian sustained injuries after stepping on a landmine in Na Koo Hkee village tract, Dwe Lo Township., Dwe Lo and Bu Tho townships, Between March 28th and April 5th 2021, Tatmadaw’s Infantry Battalion (IB) #19 and Light Infantry Battalions (LIB) #341, #434 and #340 indiscriminately fired mortars shells at the villages [and localities] around their army camps. These battalions are based near Hpapun Town, along the boundary between Dwe Lo and Bu Tho townships. They [Tatmadaw] fired mortars rounds because they received information about the presence of Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) troops near their army camps., Mortars landed in the following locations:, Section 3, Section 4 and Ah Naunt Hpeh Kan Section, Hpapun Town, Hkler Hkoh village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, According to a civilian from Hpapun Town: “On April 3rd [2021], the Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired mortars into the community. One of the mortar rounds exploded next to my house. Some of them landed in the monastery compound. Some of them did not explode.” Although there were no casualties, all the local civilians were afraid and worried for their security. They worry that the situation might get worse in the future, but they do not know where to flee to: “We cannot access social media so we do not have access to any update [about the] situation. Therefore, I want to know: where should we flee to? What is the best place to go?”, On April 4th 2021, the KNLA attacked the Koo Seik Tatmadaw camp, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. KNLA soldiers also blocked the military road with logs and landmines. In response, the Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired mortars rounds at nearby villages. Local civilians now live in fear of shelling and landmines. They also face travel restrictions [they do not dare to travel because of the security risks associated with the presence of Tatmadaw soldiers and landmine contamination]., On April 5th 2021, LIB #341 fired mortar rounds at K--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, prompting local villagers to flee to M--- village, Klaw Hta village tract, Dwe Lo Township. LIB #341’s commander ordered the M--- village administrator to tell local villagers to report any IDPs staying at their houses. He also ordered the village administrator to make two separate lists: a list of the villagers who did report hosting IDPs to the village administrator; and a list of the villagers who did not. [The commander did not specify why he needed these lists.], On April 5th 2021, a civilian from Hpapun Town stepped on a [newly-planted] landmine at Nga Inn Su junction in Na Koo Hta village, Na Koo Hkee village tract, Dwe Lo Township. He was taken to the clinic in LIB #434’s camp for treatment. Local villagers do not know how badly he was injured.

Myanmar: UN expert urges States to impose arms embargo,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,7 May 2021,"GENEVA (7 May 2021) -- The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, today welcomed the call by a broad number of civil society organizations to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar's military junta, and encouraged States to take their own actions immediately., ""Stopping the flow of weapons and dual-use weapons technology into the hands of the military junta of Myanmar is literally a matter of life and death. There is no time to lose,"" said Andrews., ""I applaud the efforts of more than 200 organisations to bring this to the attention of the UN Security Council. Action to stop the flow of deadly weapons into the hands of those who are using them to massacre their own people is needed now., ""I urge governments who support cutting the flow of weapons to a brutal military junta to consider immediately establishing their own arms embargo against Myanmar while simultaneously encouraging UN Security Council action., ""Bilateral arms embargoes should encompass weapons and dual-use technology, including surveillance equipment. Together, they will represent an important step forward to literally taking guns out of the hands of those killing innocent men, women and children."", Andrews said he was currently updating a list of States that have established arms embargoes against Myanmar. In his March report* to the Human Rights Council, he identified those nations that had already established arms embargoes against Myanmar., ""It is my hope that those who have yet to impose an arms embargo will do so in light of the horror that the Myanmar military continues to inflict on its citizens every day. I intend to publish this updated list next month,"" he said., ""Additionally, I urge organizations and advocates who have called for UN Security Council action to simultaneously urge governments to impose their own arms embargo. They can begin by carefully reviewing the list of nations who have established arms embargoes, and reach out to those who have yet to do so."", ENDS, See page 50, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar*, Thomas H. Andrews, Human Rights Council, Forty-sixth session, 22 February--19 March 2021., Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

ACLED Regional Overview - Southeast Asia (24-30 April 2021),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,6 May 2021,"Last week in Southeast Asia, anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar demonstrated in opposition to the consensus reached by Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders and Myanmar's military chief during a meeting on 24 April. Meanwhile, there was an increase in reports of explosives being used to attack government and military infrastructure in the country. Additionally, fighting between the Myanmar military and newly-formed armed resistance groups increased in Sagaing region and Chin state. Tensions also continue to remain high in Kayin and Kachin states as ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) clash with the military over control of strategic bases. In Indonesia, fighting between Papuan separatists and state forces increased last week after the rebels shot dead a high-ranking intelligence official. Meanwhile, a diplomatic spat between the Philippine and Chinese governments over disputed territory in the South China Sea continues to escalate as both sides attempt to assert their sovereignty over the region. In Thailand, anti-government protests continued unabated amid reports of the deteriorating health of detained protest leaders. Lastly, in Malaysia, protesters continue to demand that the state of emergency be lifted., In Myanmar, demonstrations against the military coup, which have been ongoing for nearly three months, continued across the country. Following the ASEAN leaders' meeting on 24 April, anti-coup demonstrators expressed their opposition to the ""five-point consensus"" that ASEAN leaders and the Myanmar military's leader came to at the meeting (ASEAN, 24 April 2021). The consensus calls for an immediate end to the violence in Myanmar, and a restoration of dialogue between all concerned parties towards a peaceful solution. However, anti-coup supporters have criticized the consensus for failing to ""reflect the views and voices of the Myanmar people"" (Straits Times, 26 April 2021). They also demand the release of all political prisoners --- a point not included in ASEAN's five-point consensus., Meanwhile, attacks on government buildings and military bases using improvised explosives are being reported with increasing frequency. Notably, two air force bases were hit by improvised rockets in Magway and Mandalay regions in central Myanmar --- where such attacks on military facilities are rare. The military later stated that there were no casualties and only minor damage to one of the buildings (Channel News Asia, 29 April 2021). Additionally, dozens of explosions caused by improvised explosives were reported across Myanmar, targeting government buildings, banks, schools, and universities. No one has yet claimed responsibility for these attacks., Separately, clashes between the military and local armed resistance groups were reported in Sagaing region and Chin state, as more organized forms of armed resistance against the regime's violence continue to take shape in these regions. In Sagaing region, clashes between the Myanmar military and a civilian resistance group resulted in the death of three soldiers, as the resistance group used bombs to target military troops. Elsewhere, in neighboring Chin state, retaliation by locals against the arrest of anti-coup demonstrators by security forces escalated into a four-day battle between the Myanmar military and a newly-formed armed resistance group called Chinland Defense Force (CDF). The four-day battle --- which resulted in the death of dozens of Myanmar military soldiers --- ended on 27 April, following a negotiated deal between both sides to swap prisoners (Myanmar Now, 29 April 2021)., Elsewhere, tensions between the Myanmar military and EAOs continued to escalate. In Kayin state, the Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) attacked and captured a military base near the Myanmar-Thai border, killing several Myanmar military soldiers (DW, 27 April 2021). In response, the Myanmar military mounted airstrikes against KNU/KNLA positions, displacing many Kayin villagers. As well, hundreds of Thai villagers living near the border were forced to evacuate amid the increased instability (RFA, 27 April 2021). Separately, in Kachin state, the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) continued to defend its position at the strategic hilltop of Alaw Bum, as the Myanmar military intensified its airstrikes in an attempt to recapture the base which was recently seized by the KIO/KIA., In West Papua, Indonesia, there was a spike in clashes between Papuan separatists and state forces following the killing of the Papua province State Intelligence Agency chief during an ambush by the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) on 25 April. The incident elicited a strong reaction from the government, with President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo issuing an order for security forces to ""chase and arrest all members [of Papuan rebel groups]"" (Antara News, 26 April 2021). Following this, a series of battles broke out in Papua province, resulting in the death of at least one police officer. Amid these heightened tensions, the government, on 29 April, declared that Papuan rebels --- which it refers to as ""armed criminal groups"" (KKB) --- have been added to its list of ""terrorist groups"" (Jakarta Post, 29 April 2021). Human rights observers are concerned that this designation will lead to an increase in raids by security forces in West Papua. Such raids have often been accompanied by allegations of rights abuses against local civilians (Human Rights and Peace for Papua, 25 April 2021)., In the Philippines, tensions in the South China Sea continued to rise amid ongoing protests by Manila against the presence of Chinese vessels in the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), particularly near the Whitsun Reef. Notably, the Philippine military announced that it conducted maritime drills in the Spratly Islands and the Scarborough Shoal. This led the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson to assert Chinese sovereignty over the areas and to call on the Philippines to ""stop actions complicating the situation"" (Philippine Star, 28 April 2021). In response, the Philippines further protested the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's remarks by filing yet another diplomatic protest (Philippine News Agency, 28 April 2021). On top of daily diplomatic protests against the presence of Chinese vessels in the Whitsun reef, Manila has already filed several protests to Beijing since March 2021 over the disputed maritime region. Amid these developments, external parties such as the European Union are also urging ASEAN to adopt a legally binding code of conduct to ease tensions in the region (Manila Bulletin, 24 April 2021)., In Thailand, anti-government demonstrations continued unabated as People's Party members across the country protested in solidarity with protesters in Bangkok who have been demonstrating in front of the Supreme Court on a daily basis since March of this year. The overwhelming majority of demonstrations saw People's Party members standing still in opposition to the lèse majesté law, which has been used to detain protest leaders. Tensions outside the Supreme Court also mounted last week as police intervened in the protests. The increase in tensions comes amid news of the deteriorating health of a protest leader, Parit Chiwarak, who has been on a hunger strike since 15 March to oppose the denial of bail for protest leaders by authorities. News about the detained protest leader's health in custody has been closely watched by anti-government protesters. However, notwithstanding Parit's hospitalization and the increasing protests, authorities continue to deny requests for bail to be granted (Reuters, 30 April 2021)., Finally, there was an increase in protests linked to coronavirus restrictions in Malaysia as the country struggles to contain the latest wave of infections. For the second week in a row, opposition and youth groups came together to demand that the state of emergency, which has been in place since January 2021, be lifted so that parliament can reconvene. Other than parliamentary sittings, all elections have also been suspended under the state of emergency. The imposition of the state of emergency is widely regarded as a political move by the government --- which came into power without an election --- to postpone elections and to remain in power (AP, 12 January 2021). Additionally, several protests against ongoing restrictions on movement were held in Tawau city, Sabah state, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. *For more on how state leaders around the world have used powers, such as declaring states of emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic, to bolster their positions and hold on power, see this recent report reviewing findings from ACLED's *COVID-19 Disorder Tracker *project. *",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-24-30-april-2021

Approximately 50,000 people have been displaced internally, these include an estimated 40,000 in southeastern Myanmar and 9,000 in Kachin and northern Shan states. Some 5,000 refugees crossed into Thailand in March and April, most of whom subsequently returned to Myanmar, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 refugees have sought safety in India., As those displaced since 1 February are fleeing persecution or generalized violence and events seriously disturbing public order, UNHCR calls on countries across the region to offer refuge and protection to all individuals from Myanmar seeking safety. Humanitarian actors should be granted access to them to assess and respond to their needs., RESPONSE, In Myanmar, the deteriorating security environment has exacerbated the precarious humanitarian situation that prevailed even before the military takeover. It has impeded the ability of affected populations to seek safety and access urgent life-saving assistance, including the stateless or internally displaced persons (IDPs) who were already in need of protection and assistance prior to 1 February. Although UNHCR has been able to continue field activities in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan States—such as needs assessments, quick impact projects and distribution of core relief items (CRIs)—humanitarian actors face increasing security, logistics and supply chain challenges. In southeast Myanmar, for example, UNHCR activities have been curtailed by security constraints, though UNHCR and partners have maintained communication channels with IDPs through community-based mechanisms and have distributed CRIs to IDPs in Kayin State., In India, UNHCR estimates that 4,000-6,000 refugees from Myanmar have entered the border states of Mizoram and Manipur since early March. UNHCR does not have access to the border areas, but local charity organizations and individuals have come forward to provide life-saving assistance to new arrivals. Some 190 have moved onward to New Delhi, where UNHCR is assessing their needs and has begun registering and providing basic assistance to them. UNHCR has offered its support to the Government of India in protection and humanitarian coordination and response to new arrivals from Myanmar., In Thailand, following the arrival in late March of some 2,800 refugees in Mae Hong Son province and their subsequent return to Myanmar, some 2,300 people crossed again on 27 April due to an outbreak of fighting and are currently hosted in safety areas managed by the Royal Thai Army. UNHCR has advocated for access to the population and offered support to the Royal Thai Government’s efforts to respond to further displacement from Myanmar and address refugees’ protection needs. The Government is preparing “holding areas” for receiving new arrivals in provinces along the Thai-Myanmar border. UNHCR has not had access to new arrivals, but has undertaken preparedness actions, including the prepositioning of CRIs for up to 5,000 households, to help ensure that any Government-led response in those areas will be complemented in a timely and coordinated manner. The humanitarian community already present in the nine temporary shelters for some 92,000 Myanmar refugees who fled previous waves of displacement—UNHCR, IOM and a consortium of NGOs—has established a multi-sector coordination mechanism to respond to humanitarian needs for new arrivals.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-regional-bureau-asia-and-pacific-rbap-myanmar-emergency-external-update-1-may
"Midwife, a community guardian of sexual and reproductive health, saves the lives of women and girls in Myanmar",News and Press Release,UNFPA,Health,6 May 2021,"Yangon, Myanmar – “Midwifery is my life and my passion. My parents used to travel a lot across the country especially to the remote areas of Myanmar when I was young. I saw how difficult the lives of the women particularly pregnant women have been in those areas where maternal health care services were hard to access. Since then, I wanted to help them as much as I can. This is why I chose my career as a midwife. Almost 40 years until now, I have dedicated my life to those in need,” said Aunty Thi, a community midwife., According to the 2019 Myanmar Inter-censal Survey report, the urban population is only 28.8 per cent of the total population in the country while others are in rural areas. The lifetime risk of maternal death indicates that 1 in 200 women in Myanmar will die from either pregnancy or childbearing based on Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015-2016). Therefore, midwives are the cornerstone for a functional health system, a point of contact in the community and institutions. They play a pivotal role in the reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality., People living in remote areas need to be provided public health knowledge including sexual and reproductive health and maternal health. It is important that they are informed of maternal health and family planning. Aunty Thi shared her experience, “I used to support pregnant women under many difficult conditions during their birth. Lack of maternal health care and services sometimes lead to life-threatening complications and maternal and infant death. It is really heartbreaking situation. In Myanmar, there is a saying related to the vulnerability of a pregnant woman, ‘Being pregnant is one step closer to the cemetery’. Therefore, besides having access to services, dissemination of sexual and reproductive health and maternal health knowledge is extremely essential., “Midwives not only deliver babies. We are sexual and reproductive health and rights promoters,” said Aunty Thi. Midwives have a strong link with the communities they serve. This enables them to overcome cultural barriers and create positive change for service delivery. Investing in midwifery care is a cost-effective way of not only saving the lives of women and children but also increasing their health and wellbeing for sustainable development., UNFPA, United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, advocates and works for strengthening the national midwifery services and providing support to upscale the capacity of midwives in Myanmar in order to contribute to the accomplishment of one of three zeros, “ZERO preventable maternal deaths”., In the context of the ongoing political crisis in Myanmar, the need for sexual and reproductive health services and rights have only become more important. The community needs midwives in the current situation more than ever to save the lives of adolescents, young people, mothers and babies. Aunty Thi is currently serving the community as a midwife in Hlaing Tharyar Township in Yangon Region, one of the most affected areas during the crisis. Even under the night curfew, she never stops providing life-saving services for pregnant women. She said, “I helped a woman giving birth in a car in Hlaing Tharyar successfully. As a midwife, I always prepare for every circumstance, mostly in emergency to save two attached lives – a mother and a baby .”, UNFPA Executive Director Dr Natalia Kanem mentioned in International Day of the Midwife 2021 that midwives deserve our respect and gratitude, but it is not enough. They deserve greater investment in their capabilities and workplaces that empower them and fully acknowledge their skills and contributions. In addition, the State of World’s Midwifery report 2021 underscores the needs to increase the number of midwives and the quality of their services so that it could save 4.3 million lives a year by 2035., Aunty Thi is now over 60 but age has not weakened her strong commitment to saving women and girls in the community. She said, “I started my career as a midwife. I am still doing this to help the people. I will try supporting them until my last breath. This is my commitment!”, On the occasion of the International Day of the Midwife, UNFPA Myanmar salutes Aunty Thi and the many hundreds of midwives for their unwavering commitment and dedication towards ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights in communities in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/midwife-community-guardian-sexual-and-reproductive-health-saves-lives-women-and-girls
"Atrocity Alert No. 251: Myanmar (Burma), Afghanistan and Central African Republic",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,5 May 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., THREE MONTHS SINCE MYANMAR’S MILITARY COUP, THE DEADLY CRACKDOWN CONTINUES, Last weekend marked three months since Myanmar’s military, headed by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, overthrew the civilian-led government. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 769 people have been killed by the security forces since 1 February and at least 3,696 people are in detention for resisting the coup., The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) held a high-level summit on 24 April to discuss the crisis in Myanmar and agreed to a “Five-Point Consensus” which includes an immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue among all parties, appointment of a special envoy to facilitate mediation, provision of humanitarian aid and a visit by the envoy to Myanmar. The military issued a statement two days later, indicating they would only consider ASEAN’s proposal “when the situation returns to stability in the country.” Since then, the security forces have continued their deadly crackdown., On 30 April the UN Security Council (UNSC) was briefed by the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, and the Second Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brunei Darussalam, Erywan bin Pehin Yusof, who currently Chairs ASEAN. The UNSC issued “press elements” after the meeting, welcoming ASEAN’s efforts regarding Myanmar and calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the release of detainees., Despite ASEAN’s “Five-Point Consensus” and four statements by the UNSC, neither body has imposed any binding measures on Myanmar’s coup leaders. Meanwhile, the security forces continue to kill civilians, including at least eight people during protests on Sunday. Conflict between the military and ethnic armed groups also continues to escalate, particularly in Kachin and Karen (Kayin) states. According to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, an estimated 40,000 people have been displaced due to clashes between the military and the Karen National Liberation Army, as well as from airstrikes on civilian areas. An estimated 5,000 people have also been displaced in Kachin State due to renewed violence between the military and Kachin Independence Army., On 5 May the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect released a joint statement along with over 200 civil society organizations from around the world, calling on the UNSC to urgently impose an arms embargo on Myanmar’s military regime. Dr. Simon Adams, Executive Director of the Global Centre, said that, “it is essential for the UN Security Council to finally adopt a resolution and impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar. Not one more bullet, bayonet or rifle should be sold to Myanmar’s Generals for them to wage war against their own people. This coup and these atrocities must end.”, DESPITE PEACE TALKS, ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS INCREASE IN AFGHANISTAN, On 30 April a car bomb detonated in Pul-e Alam in Afghanistan’s eastern Logar province, killing at least 30 civilians and wounding over 100 others. The improvised explosive device (IED) detonated as guests were breaking their fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The UN Secretary-General, UN Security Council and UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan all condemned the attack. Just days later, on 3 May, another bomb exploded near a school in Farah province causing 21 civilian casualties, including 10 children. No one has claimed responsibility for either attack., Afghanistan remains one of the deadliest places in the world for civilians, with 1,783 killed or maimed in various attacks so far this year. IEDs have frequently been used to target civil servants, journalists, human rights defenders and politicians, resulting in dozens of casualties every week. While the Taliban have been blamed for most attacks, they deny responsibility., The recent bombings come at a particularly perilous time. Intra-Afghan negotiations that began last September in Doha, Qatar, have stalled. While Turkey, Qatar and the UN have agreed to co-convene a high-level peace conference in Istanbul after Ramadan in order to complement the Doha talks, the Taliban have not yet agreed to participate. Despite the intra-Afghan peace talks, civilian casualties have increased by 38 percent since the negotiations began., Meanwhile, the 1 May 2021 withdrawal date for the estimated 3,500 remaining United States (US) forces in Afghanistan – agreed upon last February by the US and the Taliban – has been delayed by US President Joe Biden until 11 September. The Taliban have warned that this delay will result in further violence., After decades of civil war and international military intervention, Afghanistan is at yet another historic crossroads. The Taliban, Afghan security forces and all international military forces must ensure the protection of civilians and strictly adhere to international humanitarian and human rights law. Intra-Afghan talks should include meaningful representation of women, ethnic and religious minorities and civil society. Avenues for justice and the rights of victims should also be prioritized., 370,000 CHILDREN DISPLACED BY ONGOING CONFLICT IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, According to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Central African Republic (CAR) remains one of the worst places in the world to be a child. Due to ongoing armed conflict, at least 370,000 children are currently internally displaced in CAR – the highest level of child displacement since 2014., Violence in CAR has intensified since December when a coalition of armed groups launched an offensive to disrupt national elections and seize control of the capital, Bangui. While the offensive was repelled, the resulting fighting forced thousands of people to flee as parties to the conflict perpetrated widespread human rights violations and abuses., Almost 3,000 children have been forcibly recruited by armed groups so far this year. UNICEF’s Representative in CAR, Fran Equiza, said that, “we are extremely concerned about the fate of the thousands of children who, after seeing their lives turned upside down by conflict and violence, may now experience the additional trauma of being forced to join and live among armed actors, to engage in combat, putting both themselves and the lives of others at extreme risk.”, The escalation of violence in CAR has also resulted in schools being closed, occupied, or damaged in 11 out of the country’s 16 prefectures, affecting half of all school-age children. The risk of recruitment to armed groups, as well as sexual and gender-based violence, is especially acute when children are displaced or out of school. Attacks on schools are a grave violation of the universal rights of children and may also constitute a war crime., The CAR government, with support from MINUSCA – the UN peacekeeping mission – must continue to prioritize the protection of children and rigorously prosecute all those who perpetrate abuses against them.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-251-myanmar-burma-afghanistan-and-central-african-republic
"Myanmar Alert: National Union Government: People’s Defence Force, 05 May 2021",News and Press Release,Insecurity Insight,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2021,"Move by the National Union Government towards a Federal Union Army will see a more formal conflict develop., OVERVIEW, Myanmar’s National Unity Government (NUG), established by opponents of army rule, declared on 05 May that it would establish a “People’s Defence Force” as protection against government violent attacks towards its members., The statement noted that this was a prelude to establishing a Federal Union Army “in order to terminate the 70-year-long civil war.”, The Tatmadaw also responded with heavy weapons after reports that the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) shot down a military helicopter in the vicinity of Konelaw village, Moemauk Township, Kachin State on 4 May., The risk of deterioration within Myanmar was highlighted by Zhang Jun, the Chinese Ambassador to the UN, in one of China’s strongest statements yet, when he warned that further violence in Myanmar could lead to “civil war”., ANALYSIS, We predicted in our previous alert (27 Apr: Myanmar Border Area Clashes) that any further violence either along the Thai border area or between the Tatmadaw and the militia units (in this instance the Karen National Union - KNU) would likely escalate., Violent episodes are intensifying: on 4 May bomb blasts were reported in Myaing Township on 4 May, as were further clashes in Chin state, near the border with India, between the Chinland Defence Force (CDF) and Myanmar troops., The move by the NUG towards a Federal Union Army is highly likely in response to these clashes and would build a coordinated force against the Tatmadaw., Indeed, local sources have reported that units have been training “in the jungle” for several months and that militias have been using illegal arms traders to build up supplies of weapons., PREDICTION, The move by the NGU to establish a Federal Union Army, along with the intensifying number of incidents, and the UN Chinese Ambassador’s comments points to the high probability that a more formal civil war phase is imminent., Cross border illicit arms trading will see a major increase, whilst the Tatmadaw will likely receive more military support from China, and possibly India; both have geopolitical interests in supporting the Myanmar government., Both militia units and the “People’s Defence Force/Federal Union Army” are likely to receive illicit aid from countries opposed to either India or China., The numbers of IDPs within the country, and refugees seeking shelter on the Thai/Indian border is likely to increase, leading to the possibility of further spread of COVID-19 within the country and region – as Myanmar appears to heading into a third wave of the virus, with no effective vaccine deployment in place., MITIGATION, Organisations should carefully consider whether to deploy staff within 10 miles of the border areas – especially the China/Myanmar border region., Vary routes into and out of projects as often as possible., All staff should remove themselves from social media (if internet still available), remove satellite dishes from homes (if outside of main cities), and where possible, organisations should ensure that staff have a removable hard drive, and emphasize strict IT safeguarding protocols., Reinforce use of PPE and checking in protocols.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-alert-national-union-government-people-s-defence-force-05-may-2021
Global civil society statement on Myanmar,News and Press Release,ACCORD,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2021,"We, the undersigned organizations, call on the United Nations Security Council to urgently impose a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar to help prevent further violations of human rights against peaceful protesters and others opposing military rule. In recent weeks, Myanmar security forces have killed hundreds of people, including dozens of children, merely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly., Since the February 1, 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military junta has responded with increasing brutality to nationwide protests calling for the restoration of democratic civilian rule. As of May 4, security forces have killed at least 769 people, including 51 children as young as 6, and arbitrarily detained several thousand activists, journalists, civil servants, and politicians. Hundreds have been forcibly disappeared, the authorities unwilling to provide information on their well-being or where they are being held. Over the past few months, the military has demonstrated a callous disregard for human life that has driven its strategy for decades. In video footage from cities and towns across the country, soldiers can be seen shooting down protesters, including children, brutally beating medical aid workers, and firing shotguns into crowds of peacefully protesting doctors., In addition to the latest violations of human rights, Myanmar’s security forces have a history of grave abuses against peaceful critics of the government and military, and war crimes and other international crimes against the Rohingya and other ethnic minority groups. Of particular note is the military's widely documented use of sexual and gender-based violence as a weapon against ethnic communities., No government should sell a single bullet to the junta under these circumstances. Imposing a global arms embargo on Myanmar is the minimum necessary step the Security Council should take in response to the military’s escalating violence. Arms and materiel provided to Myanmar’s security forces are likely to be used by the security forces to commit abuses in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law., For this reason, the undersigned organizations urge the United Kingdom, the Security Council’s “penholder” on Myanmar, and other Security Council member states to begin negotiations on a resolution authorizing an arms embargo as soon as possible. This will demonstrate to the junta that there will be no more business as usual., Security Council members have increasingly spoken with one voice on Myanmar. The Council has called for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and others arbitrarily detained, including civilian leaders. It has condemned the military’s crackdown on peaceful protesters and called for an end to the ongoing violence. But unity is not an end in itself. The Council should now build on that unity and negotiate a resolution that would include an arms embargo and other substantive measures., A comprehensive UN arms embargo on Myanmar should bar the direct and indirect supply, sale, or transfer of all weapons, munitions, and other military-related equipment, including dual-use goods such as vehicles and communications and surveillance equipment, as well as the provision of training, intelligence, and other military assistance. Such an embargo should be accompanied by robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms., We note with disappointment the failure of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) April 24, 2021 summit to take more robust action to protect Myanmar’s people. Less than a day after the summit’s conclusions were published, the military’s violence continued, which only highlights the need for UN member countries and the Security Council to take decisive action to pressure the junta to reverse course., The time for statements has passed. The Security Council should take its consensus on Myanmar to a new level and agree on immediate and substantive action. An arms embargo would be the centerpiece of a global effort to protect the people of Myanmar from further atrocities and help bring an end to impunity for crimes under international law., Myanmar’s people cannot afford to wait any longer for the Security Council to take action., Signatories, ACAT-France, Access Now, Act Church of Sweden, Action Committee for Democracy Development, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), Africa Centre for Security, Governance and Research, African Council of Religious Leaders-Religions for Peace, Alliance for Democracy in Laos, ALTSEAN Burma, Amnesty International, Arakan Institute for Peace and Development (AiPAD), Arakan Rohingya National Organization, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, Asia Democracy Network, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), Association for Public Policy – APP (Argentina), Association INFO BIRMANIE (Info Burma), AVAAZ, Baptist Union of Denmark, Burma Campaign UK, Burma Human Rights Network, Burma Task Force, Burmese Rohingya Organization UK, Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, Calgary Karen Community (CKCA), California Shan Society, Cameroon Youths and Students Forum for Peace, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Canadian Rohingya Development Initiative, Center for Justice and Accountability, Center for Peace Education – Miriam College, Center for Victims of Torture, Centre Delas for Peace Studies, Centro de Estudios Ecuménicos, A.C. – México, Chin Human Rights Organization, Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), CIVICUS, Civil Rights Defenders, Committee of 100 in Finland, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, Control Arms, Cordaid, Dallas Ft.

Global civil society statement on Myanmar,News and Press Release,AOAV,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2021,"We, the undersigned organizations, call on the United Nations Security Council to urgently impose a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar to help prevent further violations of human rights against peaceful protesters and others opposing military rule. In recent weeks, Myanmar security forces have killed hundreds of people, including dozens of children, merely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly., Since the February 1, 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military junta has responded with increasing brutality to nationwide protests calling for the restoration of democratic civilian rule. As of May 4, security forces have killed at least 769 people, including 51 children as young as 6, and arbitrarily detained several thousand activists, journalists, civil servants, and politicians. Hundreds have been forcibly disappeared, the authorities unwilling to provide information on their well-being or where they are being held. Over the past few months, the military has demonstrated a callous disregard for human life that has driven its strategy for decades. In video footage from cities and towns across the country, soldiers can be seen shooting down protesters, including children, brutally beating medical aid workers, and firing shotguns into crowds of peacefully protesting doctors., In addition to the latest violations of human rights, Myanmar’s security forces have a history of grave abuses against peaceful critics of the government and military, and war crimes and other international crimes against the Rohingya and other ethnic minority groups. Of particular note is the military's widely documented use of sexual and gender-based violence as a weapon against ethnic communities., No government should sell a single bullet to the junta under these circumstances. Imposing a global arms embargo on Myanmar is the minimum necessary step the Security Council should take in response to the military’s escalating violence. Arms and materiel provided to Myanmar’s security forces are likely to be used by the security forces to commit abuses in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law., For this reason, the undersigned organizations urge the United Kingdom, the Security Council’s “penholder” on Myanmar, and other Security Council member states to begin negotiations on a resolution authorizing an arms embargo as soon as possible. This will demonstrate to the junta that there will be no more business as usual., Security Council members have increasingly spoken with one voice on Myanmar. The Council has called for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and others arbitrarily detained, including civilian leaders. It has condemned the military’s crackdown on peaceful protesters and called for an end to the ongoing violence. But unity is not an end in itself. The Council should now build on that unity and negotiate a resolution that would include an arms embargo and other substantive measures., A comprehensive UN arms embargo on Myanmar should bar the direct and indirect supply, sale, or transfer of all weapons, munitions, and other military-related equipment, including dual-use goods such as vehicles and communications and surveillance equipment, as well as the provision of training, intelligence, and other military assistance. Such an embargo should be accompanied by robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms., We note with disappointment the failure of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) April 24, 2021 summit to take more robust action to protect Myanmar’s people. Less than a day after the summit’s conclusions were published, the military’s violence continued, which only highlights the need for UN member countries and the Security Council to take decisive action to pressure the junta to reverse course., The time for statements has passed. The Security Council should take its consensus on Myanmar to a new level and agree on immediate and substantive action. An arms embargo would be the centerpiece of a global effort to protect the people of Myanmar from further atrocities and help bring an end to impunity for crimes under international law., Myanmar’s people cannot afford to wait any longer for the Security Council to take action., Signatories, ACAT-France, Access Now, Act Church of Sweden, Action Committee for Democracy Development, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), Africa Centre for Security, Governance and Research, African Council of Religious Leaders-Religions for Peace, Alliance for Democracy in Laos, ALTSEAN Burma, Amnesty International, Arakan Institute for Peace and Development (AiPAD), Arakan Rohingya National Organization, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, Asia Democracy Network, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), Association for Public Policy – APP (Argentina), Association INFO BIRMANIE (Info Burma), AVAAZ, Baptist Union of Denmark, Burma Campaign UK, Burma Human Rights Network, Burma Task Force, Burmese Rohingya Organization UK, Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, Calgary Karen Community (CKCA), California Shan Society, Cameroon Youths and Students Forum for Peace, Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Canadian Rohingya Development Initiative, Center for Justice and Accountability, Center for Peace Education – Miriam College, Center for Victims of Torture, Centre Delas for Peace Studies, Centro de Estudios Ecuménicos, A.C. – México, Chin Human Rights Organization, Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW), CIVICUS, Civil Rights Defenders, Committee of 100 in Finland, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, Control Arms, Cordaid, Dallas Ft.

UN Reiterates Call for Health Workers and Facilities to be Protected [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNCT Myanmar,"Health
Safety and Security",5 May 2021,"(Yangon, 5 May 2021) - The United Nations in Myanmar warns of the impact on public health, including the COVID-19 response, from attacks on medical personnel and facilities, and reiterates its call for health workers, health facilities and patients to be protected., According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global surveillance system, since the beginning of February there have been 158 reported attacks on health care, resulting in 11 deaths and 51 injuries. This is currently the majority of reported attacks on health care services worldwide since the beginning of 2021. Some 83 attacks impacted facilities, 21 attacks impacted ambulances, 76 attacks impacted health personnel, and 73 attacks impacted patients., The global tracking system cumulatively lists 51 health facilities across Myanmar as having been under occupation by security forces. At least 31 of these facilities remain currently occupied and have reported a drop in the number of people seeking medical care. Meanwhile, at least 139 doctors believed to be participating in civil disobedience have reportedly been charged under Section 505 (a) of Myanmar’s Penal Code. These include highly specialized health personnel whose expertise cannot easily be replaced, which will significantly impact both the quality and quantity of health services available., Attacks on health care pose a grave risk for the delivery of essential health services, as well as for the COVID-19 response, with potential devastating consequences for Myanmar and beyond. At a time when Myanmar needs them the most, health workers fear arrest or detention for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly., “The United Nations in Myanmar stands ready to continue its support of the national COVID-19 response but this requires a return to the comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic previously underway, that the inviolable nature of health facilities and health workers and patients is respected, and the immediate release of urgently needed medical and technical personnel detained or arrested while exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” Andrew Kirkwood, acting interim United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Myanmar, said., The United Nations Country Team in Myanmar consists of FAO, ILO, IOM, ITC, OHCHR, OCHA, UNAIDS, UNCDF,
UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UN HABITAT, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNODC, UNOPS, UNV, UN WOMEN, WFP, and WHO., NOTE: WHO’s recent article link has further information, including that this system does not intend to identify perpetrators or culpability, but to contribute to a conducive environment where health care is protected and safe, and to enable patients and providers to access and deliver health services without fear: https://www.who.int/myanmar/news/detail/01-05-2021-who-s-attack-on-healthcare-initiative-advocates-forsafeguarding-healthcare-does-not-aim-at-reporting-incidents",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/un-reiterates-call-health-workers-and-facilities-be-protected-enmy

An End to Peace Efforts: Recent fighting in Doo Tha Htoo District between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw following the 2021 Myanmar military coup (March and April 2021),Situation Report,KHRG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2021,"Introduction, In March and April 2021, KHRG documented nine incidents of fighting between the Tatmadaw[1] and Karen National Liberation Army’s (KNLA)[2] Brigade 1 on eight different days, with fighting occurring in each of the five townships (Th’ Htoo [Thaton], Hpa-an, Paw [Paung], Kyeh Htoh [Kyaikto] and Bilin townships) in Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District.[3],[4] KHRG researchers have also noted that other fighting and shelling in civilian areas has been taking place in Doo Tha Htoo District over the past few weeks, but they have been unable to document all of these cases. The fighting that was reported resulted in injuries and deaths among both KNLA and Tatmadaw soldiers, as well as injury to one villager. This fighting has also led to temporary displacements and restricted freedom of movement in local communities. Up until recently, there had been few reported cases of fighting in Doo Tha Htoo District since the signing of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)[5] in 2015, despite Tatmadaw military activities and repeated violations of the NCA, particularly concerning trespass into restricted areas.[6] Thus, these multiple outbreaks are particularly disconcerting, signalling a shift in commitment to upholding ceasefire agreements. Although the exact cause of the different incidents may vary, it is likely that the recent military coup has at least in part triggered these recent outbreaks., Since February 1st 2021, when the Tatmadaw seized control of the government[7] and detained many high-level political leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi, anti-coup protests and a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[8] have been taking place on a wide scale, even in rural villages. These anti-coup activities have led to major crackdowns and arrests, provoking many protestors to flee to Karen National Union (KNU)[9]-controlled areas seeking refuge. As a result, the KNU leaders in Doo Tha Htoo District welcomed into their villages over 50 Myanmar government staff who had joined the Civil Disobedience Movement and were in need of refuge.[10] Because of that some local communities commented that the Tatmadaw might target and attack the KLNA in Doo Tha Htoo District., Local villagers from Doo Tha Htoo have also been active in protesting against the military coup. During the anti-coup protests, local people, including students, have been arrested and shot by the Tatmadaw and the Myanmar Police Force (MPF).[11] Despite warnings by the KNLA not to disturb or harm protestors, the Tatmadaw has not abided., The military coup has led to concerns that the already fragile 2015 NCA is unravelling, even no longer in force.[12] This alone can have a significant impact on efforts of signatories to resist fighting and maintain the peace. The heavily violent response of the Tatmadaw and MPF toward civilian opposition to the coup has only reinforced the sense that any promises regarding the peace process on the part of the military junta are not to be trusted., The State Administration Council (SAC),[13] the interim government chaired by Tatmadaw Commander-in-Chief and coup leader Min Aung Hlaing, expressed from the outset its commitment to achieving “eternal peace” and claimed that the NCA was still in effect. And yet, the actions of the Tatmadaw since the military takeover have shown otherwise – fighting as well as attacks on villages and civilians have been increasing. In response to the escalation of fighting in multiple areas throughout the country, the SAC announced on March 31st a month-long unilateral ceasefire beginning April 1st 2021. The SAC noted however that it would continue to respond to “actions that disrupt government security and administration”, thus authorising its own military offensives while insisting all other armed actors “keep the peace”.[14], The fighting described in this news bulletin has all taken place since the coup, with some incidents taking place since the SAC’s March 31st unilateral ceasefire announcement, pointing to the unlikelihood that calls for ceasefire on their own, without other actions to resolve the larger political concerns, will bring about an end to the fighting any time soon., Although some incidents, namely those in and around towns, were directly tied to anti-coup protests, in other areas, the fighting seems more fully related to tensions that had already been building regarding military activity and violations of the NCA, but that may have now been enflamed by the coup., Since the 2015 NCA, and prior to the coup, KHRG had only reported two incidents of fighting in Doo Tha Htoo District: a series of skirmishes in June 2019, in Hpa-an Township between the Tatmadaw/Border Guard Force (BGF)[15] and a splinter faction of the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA splinter group)[16];[17] and a skirmish in January 2021, in Bilin Township between the BGF and the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO),[18] followed by the arrival of about 100 fully armed BGF soldiers to the area.[19] In both cases, villagers had to flee their homes as a result of the fighting. Despite these few incidents of fighting, the Tatmadaw have maintained a strong presence in and near rural villages in areas under KNU control most likely because of road construction and development projects. Local villagers in multiple parts of the district have thus continued to confront problems with the Tatmadaw, and fear the renewal of on-going fighting, as in nearby Mu Traw District, where KNU control is particularly strong., In late January 2021, subsequent to that first outbreak of fighting in the township since the 2012 preliminary ceasefire agreement,[20] villagers from Bilin Township held two demonstrations that united over 2,000 villagers total in the Yoh Klah area, calling for the Tatmadaw to withdraw their army camps from the area. They made the following demands:, 1. Implement the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement
2. Armed actors must respect the NCA Code of Conduct
3. Villagers do not want armed conflict
4. The Tatmadaw must withdraw their bases located inside the villages
5. The Myanmar government must solve the conflicts that are happening on the ground
6. Political problems must be solved by political means, Since that time, through the beginning of March, however, no other incidents of fighting in the area had been reported to KHRG., An outbreak of new skirmishes, Since March 2021, fighting has ignited in different areas of Doo Tha Htoo District. Some fighting did take place in Bilin Township near the Yoh Klah area where the fighting and demonstrations took place in January. However, most of the activity since March has taken place in Hpa-an Township and in the area where Hpa-an, Bilin, and Th’Htoo townships converge. This area holds special interest for the Tatmadaw because it occupies a space where a road from towns to the west could potentially connect to the central road that runs from Hpa-an to Hpapun. The Tatmadaw has thus maintained an active presence in the region, and has often encroached into areas of restricted access. Despite local communities’ disapproval of the Tatmadaw’s presence and activities in the area, the Tatmadaw has continued sending soldiers into KNU-controlled areas and also, at times, trespassed into KNU restricted areas without informing the local KNLA in advance, in violation of section 10(B) of the NCA Code of Conduct., Hpa-an Township, Multiple incidents of fighting took place in Hpa-an Township. Most of this fighting lies between two major roads, making the area of critical importance to the Tatmadaw and its ability to move about within this region (and/or simply cross through)., March 9th 2021, On March 9th 2021, fighting between KNLA Battalion #1, Company #1 and Tatmadaw Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[21] #204 broke out in K’Ser Law K’Tee Place, Kler Kheh [Nyaung Kone] village, Boo Prer village tract, Hpa-an Township, Doo Tha Htoo District, where the KNLA Battalion #1 Company #1’s army camp is located. The fighting started at 11:15 am and lasted until 1 pm. According to a local villager from Wah K’Reh village, Kyaw T’Loo village tract, Hpa-an Township, two KNLA soldiers were injured during the fighting. According to Karen Information Center (KIC), the KNU reported that five Tatmadaw soldiers died in the fighting.[22], Shortly before the fighting broke out, Tatmadaw soldiers entered Kler Kheh village without informing the local KNLA in advance. Due to this violation of the NCA Code of Conduct, the KNLA attacked the Tatmadaw as they left the village. A villager from Kler Kheh village told KHRG about the incident: “On that morning, Tatmadaw soldiers entered our village. They [the soldiers] were told [by villagers] not to come to our village because it is not good for villagers. A moment later, just after they left the village, the fighting happened [between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA] as the KNLA base is near our village.”, At 10:30 am, in response to the KNLA attack, more than 30 Tatmadaw soldiers led by Captain Thi Hah Zaw Win from LIB #409, Company #3 under Military Operations Command (MOC)[23] #2, along with BGF soldiers from Battalion #1013, went to attack the KNLA Battalion #1, Company #1 army camp in K’Ser Law K’Tee Place. Saw[24] A---, a villager from nearby Wah T’Reh village, Kyaw T’Loo village tract told KHRG: “I heard that they [the Tatmadaw] were dissatisfied after they [the KNLA] attacked them so they [the Tatmadaw] attacked their [the KNLA] army camp.” He added that the Tatmadaw and BGF soldiers largely outnumbered the KNLA battalion. As a result, the KNLA were forced to withdraw from their army camp.[25] A local authority described the fighting as “furious [intense]”. The Tatmadaw burned one car and four motorbikes owned by the KNLA. Currently, the BGF soldiers are occupying the KNLA army camp, and the KNLA have moved elsewhere in the area. Saw A--- also seemed to suggest that the KNLA has not since retaliated out of concern for the safety of local villagers: “They [the KNLA] also could not attack the Tatmadaw because if they did, it would impact the civilians, so they listened to [considered the safety of] the civilians.”, As a result of the fighting, villagers from Kler Kheh village fled to neighboring villages for their safety [KHRG was not able to identify how many villagers fled their village]. According to an update from a KHRG researcher on March 19th 2021, some villagers have already returned to their village, but others are still afraid to come back. In addition, the increase in Tatmadaw soldiers in the area has caused restrictions of movement for local villagers. Villagers are now only allowed to travel from 6 am to 8 pm. According to Saw A--- from Wah K’Reh village: “We are in fear. Villagers [in the area] do not feel secure to travel so we do not travel much [even during the authorised hours].” A villager from Kler Kheh village adds: “At this time, we have to band together. We have to travel with many people. We face difficulties travelling to buy and sell stuff.” The fighting has thus also created livelihood challenges for local communities., Saw A--- provided his perspective on the current movement of Tatmadaw in the area: “It would be good if they were not present in Karen territory because this is Karen area. However, the Tatmadaw do not retreat; instead, they continue moving forward [to extend their operation area] and send more soldiers.”, According to another villager, the BGF plan to stay as long as there is fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA. They are currently occupying the land of a local villager, although have told villagers that they do not plan to confiscate anyone’s land., Regarding the recent fighting in Kler Kheh village, the BGF claim that the KNLA shot at the Tatmadaw first, but P’doh[26] Saw Soe Mying, KNU Doo Tha Htoo District Secretary told KIC on March 10th 2021 that the skirmish between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw occurred in Kler Kheh village because the Tatmadaw had shot at the KNLA soldiers first.[27] The information received by KHRG does indicate that the KNLA attacked the Tatmadaw soldiers who had trespassed into the village earlier in the day, but no specific details of that attack were provided, other than it being motivated by a violation of the NCA Code of Conduct, section 10(B). Who shot first later that day, at 11:15 am when the fighting broke out, is unclear. Nevertheless, this fighting amounts to a violation of section 5(a) of the NCA, which forbids the signatories from carrying out armed attacks in ceasefire areas., According to a KHRG researcher from Doo Tha Htoo District, another skirmish broke out further south in Myaing K’lay between the soldiers of KNLA Brigade 1 and the Tatmadaw LIB #204 on March 9th 2021. No further information was obtained about this incident., March 19th 2021, On March 19th 2021 at 11:00 am fighting broke out between KNLA Battalion #1 and Tatmadaw LIB #409 in Guh Bee Htwee Place between Meh Leh Hkee area and Noh M’Kwee area, Hpa-an Township. A Tatmadaw truck mirror was damaged but nobody died or got injured in the fighting. The fighting happened because the Tatmadaw transported rations to a KNU restricted area without informing the KNLA, thus in violation of the NCA Code of Conduct., April 3rd 2021, On April 3rd 2021 at around 11 pm, more fighting took place in the lower part of K’Ser Law K’Tee army camp, Kler Kheh village, Hpa-an Township, in this case between KNLA Brigade 1, Battalion #1 and Tatmadaw LIB #409, supported by BGF Battalion #1014. Two soldiers from BGF #1014, led by Commander Tin Win, died in the fighting. During the skirmish, the Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired mortars at areas around their army camp. At the same time, Tatmadaw in nearby P’Nweh Klah army camp (MOC #8), Th’Htoo Township, also indiscriminately fired mortars toward the K’Ser Law K’Tee army camp. As a result, another 10 households from Kler Keh village have now fled to other villages. Some villagers returned to their village despite the high risk to their own safety. KHRG did not receive information about what caused the fighting., April 7th 2021, Fighting also happened in Meh Leh Hkee village, T’Kaw Boe village tract, Hpa-an Township on April 7th at 6:30 am between the KNLA and Tatmadaw LIB #208 under Light Infantry Division (LID)[28] #22. The platoon commander from LIB #208 died in the fighting. KHRG received no further information about this incident., Kyeh Htoh Township, March 9th 2021, According to a KHRG researcher, skirmishes between the soldiers of KNLA Brigade 1 and the Tatmadaw took place in multiple areas in Doo Tha Htoo District on March 9th 2021. Aside from the previously mentioned two skirmishes in Hpa-an Township on that day, a skirmish between the soldiers of KNLA Brigade 1 and the Tatmadaw LID #44 also took place in Kyaikto Kin Mon Sa Ken area, Kyeh Htoh Township on March 9th 2021. KHRG was not able to obtain further information about this incident., March 25th 2021, As a result of violence against anti-coup protestors, on March 25th 2021 at 8:00 pm, a skirmish broke out between KNLA Brigade 1 and Tatmadaw Infantry Battalion (IB)[29] #96 at the headquarters of IB #96 in Kyeh Htoh Town, Kyeh Htoh Township, Doo Tha Htoo District. The KNLA fired around 10 mortar shells at IB #96 army camp in Kyeh Htoh Town. In response to the KNLA attack, Tatmadaw indiscriminately fired small and heavy arms around their own army camp. The fighting lasted several minutes. KHRG was not able to determine if there were any casualties. After the skirmish, both the Tatmadaw and MPF began checking and questioning people who travel on the road in Kyeh Htoh Town for security purposes. They stopped cars to check for the presence of explosive devices or any item that they believed to be dangerous., The KNLA-led attack on the Tatmadaw in Kyeh Htoh Town was due to the Tatmadaw’s actions regarding villagers who participated in protests against the coup. According to a KHRG researcher, “The Tatmadaw requested the KNLA not to attack urban areas but [KNLA] Brigade 1 leaders also requested the Tatmadaw not to harm, impede or kill civilian people involved in the protests [against the coup] but they are still doing that. That is why they [the KNLA] had no choice but to fight back [in defence of civilian protesters].” The attacks on protestors have continued nevertheless. On March 29th 2021, a 27-year-old protester from Kyeh Htoh Town was shot dead by the Burma military.[30], Bilin Township, Multiple incidents of fighting broke out in Tar Paw and Lay Kay villages. Lay Kay had been one of the areas involved in the January 2021 demonstrations calling for the withdrawal of Tatmadaw army camps. Given the lack of information, it is difficult to determine whether there is any connection between the current fighting and the earlier incidents in January between the KNDO and BGF. It is clear from KHRG’s previous report that tensions in the area were high, and that in both cases, the incidents have left villagers in fear for their own safety., April 3rd – 4th 2021, Skirmishes occurred between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA in two different places in Bilin Township, the second skirmish taking place not far from the previous fighting in January 2021. The first incident took place in Tar Paw village, Tar Paw village tract on April 3rd around 8 or 9 pm in the evening. The second incident took place in Lay Kay village, P’yah Raw village tract at 2 am on April 4th between Tatmadaw LIB #406 and the KNLA. There is no further information about the fighting in Tar Paw, but in Lay Kay village, the Tatmadaw fired mortars into the central compound of the village and monastery, leaving some houses damaged., According to a local villager, Lay Kay villagers displaced to towns where they think it is safe. Some villagers fled to Lay Kay Mountain to hide in the caves because they were worried that Tatmadaw aircraft would drop bombs on their community. They had heard that these types of airstrikes were taking place in Mu Traw District. Because of the fear of additional mortar attacks, the villagers have dug hiding holes and built makeshift bunkers for self-protection. Local villagers near the fighting have also sent their children to towns and other safe places, in case the fighting renews. Another concern that arose for many villagers was that the Tatmadaw would impose forced labour upon them, as in the past, so they fled in hiding. A local villager reported that there were no casualties on either side., April 7th 2021, Fighting between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw broke out again in Tar Paw village, Tar Paw village tract, Bilin Township at 11 am on April 7th 2021., Th’Htoo Township, Multiple incidents of fighting occurred in Th’Htoo Township. One incident occurred close to the fighting in Hpa-an Township, and involved some of the same Tatmadaw battalions as the fighting that occurred in Hpa-an Township on April 3rd and in Bilin Township on April 4th., March 9th 2021, According to a KHRG researcher from Doo Tha Htoo District, skirmishes took place between the soldiers of KNLA Brigade 1 and the Tatmadaw in multiple places in Th’Htoo District on March 9th 2021: Alan Tayar area, involving Tatmadaw Military Training Battalion #9; and Thaton Taing Tayar area, involving Tatmadaw LIB #118. KHRG received no further information about these incidents., April 2nd 2021, On April 2nd 2021 at 7:30 pm, a skirmish broke out between KNLA Brigade 1, Battalion #2 and Tatmadaw LIB #406 in T’La Aaw Hpoh Klah village, Neh Hpaw Hta village tract, Thaton Township, Doo Tha Htoo District, where LIB #406 is based. The fighting lasted approximately 30 minutes., At 8 pm, however, Tatmadaw soldiers from P’Nweh Klah army camp (located near T’La Aaw Hpoh Klah village) indiscriminately fired 120 mm mortars in the vicinity in order to support their fellow soldiers in T’La Aaw Hpoh Klah army camp. Because the LIB #406 commander is based in P’Nweh Klah army camp (MOC #8), which is the main camp in the area, local villagers assume that he is the person who ordered Tatmadaw soldiers to fire mortar shells in the area. KHRG did not receive information about the reason for the fighting but, like the fighting at K'Ser Law K'Tee, Hpa-an Township on March 9th and April 3rd, it could be tied to tensions over road construction and issues of trespass by the Tatmadaw., Due to the shelling, one villager was injured. In addition, many buildings were destroyed or damaged. One villager’s house in Lay Gher Kler village, T’Maw Daw village tract was completely destroyed after catching fire due to the shelling. Many other houses were damaged by the shrapnel. The Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)[31] clinic in Lay Gher Kler was also hit by shrapnel, with people still inside. At that time, a hospitalised woman from Hpah Paw village, Neh Hpaw Hta village tract got hit in the back while she was breastfeeding her baby during the shelling. Currently, health workers from the clinic have to sleep outside of the village at night and they can only come back to the clinic during the day in order to treat the people who are ill. Villagers near the Tatmadaw army camps have also fled to other places to escape the shelling., Some villagers were able to return to their village after the incident but male villagers continue to sleep elsewhere because they fear that the Tatmadaw will arrest them and force them to do portering. In the past, male villagers were the first people Tatmadaw exploited as porters for military purposes. With the men in hiding, women and children have been left alone in the villages to look after their property, living and sleeping in fear. They also are afraid that the Tatmadaw soldiers will come into their villages., Paw Township, April 6th 2021, Fighting also happened in the far southern area of Doo Tha Hta District near Mote Ta Ma Town, Paw Township at 6 am on April 6th 2021 between Tatmadaw LIB #102 under LID #44 and KNLA Brigade 1, Battalion #1. No information has been reported about possible casualties., Conclusion, The fighting between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw has escalated not just in Doo Tha Htoo District, but other parts of Southeast Myanmar, despite the Tatmadaw’s statement on March 31st 2021 announcing a unilateral ceasefire from April 1st to April 30th 2021. The recent fighting is not only a direct violation of section 5(a) of the 2015 NCA, which forbids the signatories from carrying out armed attacks in ceasefire areas, but is proof that the recent post-coup ceasefire agreement carries no weight. According to a statement released by the SAC on April 30th, the April ceasefire has now been extended to the end of May 2021, while fighting and heavy airstrikes by the Tatmadaw continue to take place, only furthering distrust of the SAC and the Tatmadaw by Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs), thus making the possibility for successful peace negotiations in the near future even more tenuous., While the low incidence of fighting in Doo Tha Htoo District since 2015 had been a promising sign of a desire to maintain the peace, even in the face of military activity and NCA violations, that time has passed and we are clearly seeing a rise in both attacks and retaliatory activities not just in Doo Tha Htoo, but throughout KHRG’s operational area. Ultimately it is the villagers who pay the price. Although physical injuries to civilians have remained low thus far in Doo Tha Htoo, as one villager expressed, the psychological and emotional toll can already be felt: “At the moment, no villagers have been injured, but we are afraid and always have to be cautious -- nobody dares even to make a noise [because the soldiers are nearby].” Villagers are having once again to use their makeshift bunkers to hide, and past fears of being taken for forced labor have been reignited.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/end-peace-efforts-recent-fighting-doo-tha-htoo-district-between-knla-and-tatmadaw

Protection and Human Rights",4 May 2021,"MYANMAR, Armed conflict between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), an armed wing of the Karen National Union, continues unabated in the south-eastern parts of Myanmar resulting in new population displacement, mostly in Kayin State. During the reporting period, about 2,000 people from several villages in Hpa-pun District in Kayin State reportedly fled across the border to Thailand’s Mae Hong Son Province. The displacement was triggered by multiple airstrikes by the MAF and insecurity in the area, according to local sources. People who fled are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, with reports that heavy rain on 29 April washed away their food supplies and other belongings. According to information gathered from various sources by UNHCR, the new displacement comes in addition to about 40,000 people displaced to and within south-eastern parts of the country, mostly in Kayin State, and many since late March 2021, due to insecurity and armed clashes between the MAF and the KNLA. This included about 3,000 people who had crossed the border into Thailand in late March and subsequently returned to Myanmar by mid-April. Humanitarian actors are making efforts to provide assistance and protection services to the displaced population, but access and insecurity continue to be challenges., INDONESIA, Heavy rains have triggered a number of landslides in the past week. Five people died and eight others are missing following landslides on 29 April in South Tapanuli Regency in North Sumatra. Another landslide in Sukabumi Regency in West Java on 1 May killed a 5-year-old child and two other people were injured. Search operations and the response to meet to the needs of affected people are being led by local government agencies and local organizations., PAKISTAN, Pakistan is currently experiencing a major surge in COVID-19 and the number of cases has increased rapidly in recent weeks, with daily cases reaching a seven-day average of 5500 cases/day and 147 deaths/day last week, up from an average of 1100 cases/day and 25 deaths/day in February. The healthcare system has been impacted in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with hospitals reporting shortages of available beds, oxygen, and other essential supplies. The Government has announced the imposition of stricter ‘lockdown’ and movement restrictions with closures of public places and shopping areas. The Government has mobilized a major effort to ensure supply of critical medical supplies, while ensuring that the vaccination efforts are expanded to include additional segments of the population. To date, over 2 million people (1% of the total population) have been vaccinated across the country, including persons above 50 years and frontline healthcare workers., PHILIPPINES, About 4,600 civilians were forced to flee their homes in the town of Mamasapano, Mindanao, on 27 April following continuing military operations against the non-state armed group Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in Maguindanao Province. Mortar attacks carried out by BIFF in the town of Datu Saudi Ampatuan on 28 April resulted in the death of two women and the displacement of 3,900 residents. The fresh skirmishes come after a three-week lull which saw the closure of evacuation camps and the return of more than 48,000 people to their places of origin. According to the latest provincial government data, approximately 19,100 people are still displaced in 30 evacuation centers with additional 16,600 staying outside of formal camps since the start of the security operations on 18 March. The Mindanao Humanitarian Team is liaising with provincial authorities on the voluntary, safe, and dignified return of IDPs to their homes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asia-and-pacific-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-27-april-3-may-2021

"Mu Traw District Situation Update: Villagers face critical situation during COVID-19 pandemic and are concerned about an increase in military activity, July to October 2020",Situation Report,KHRG,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",30 Apr 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District during the period between July and October 2020. This report highlights the livelihood, education, and healthcare situation of local villagers during the COVID-19[1] pandemic. The second wave of COVID-19 has led to increased restrictions that have created livelihood, education, and healthcare challenges for villagers. In addition, an increase in Tatmadaw[2] activities and the transportation of military equipment has raised concern for villagers living in Bu Tho Township. This report also includes information on the 2020 general election as well as on KNU plans for road construction in Bu Ah Der, Meh Klaw and Meh Nyoo village tracts,[3] as well as Pa Heh village tract.[4], Introduction, This situation update for Bu Tho Township covers the period between July and October 2020. The update includes information about the livelihood, education, and healthcare challenges faced by villagers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, even though fighting subsided, Tatmadaw activities of transporting military equipment by military truck raised great concern for the villagers who live in Bu Tho Township. In response to the upcoming 2020 general election, villagers in Bu Tho Township were provided Myanmar National ID cards free of charge in the months prior to the election, without being asked to provide household registration documents. In October, Karen National Union (KNU)[5] district authorities held a meeting with three village tract administrators in Bu Tho Township about constructing two new vehicle roads (joining Meh Nyoo village tract, Bu Ah Der village tract and Meh Klaw village tract) for both cars and motorcycles. Another road is planned for Pa Heh village tract., Livelihood during the COVID-19 pandemic, The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in livelihood difficulties for villagers. Most of the villagers living in Bu Tho Township work on their farms for their livelihood. Travelling to crowded places has been restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From September to October 2020, increased travel restrictions were put in place, leaving villagers unable to travel to other areas, even within the township. These travel restrictions have created problems for the villagers who do trading [sell seasonal fruits such as durian]., In Bu Tho Township, there are also people who work as day labourers. The payment for a day’s work covers only a big tin of rice [about 15 kilogrammes, which costs 300 baht or 15,000 kyats –USD 9.63].[6] Day labourers have to find other work to be able to buy another tin of rice [if the previous one runs out].[7] If the travel restrictions continue month after month, and no special arrangements are made for the villagers, it will be difficult for them [to survive]. Because there are no more job opportunities [as day labourers] in Bu Tho Township, some villagers have begun selling betel leaves, jengkol [dog fruit], cardamom [seasonal fruit] and elephant foot yam. Other villagers have been selling bamboo. They sell these seasonal products depending on their availability. As such, this kind of work activity is not stable. People who rely on day labour are now in need. They need help with making other income arrangements., There is no one [no companies] doing big business in Bu Tho Township either [which means there are fewer job opportunities]. There are only people who do small trading [of seasonal products] and who sell cows and buffalos. From September to October 2020, people were however unable to sell any of their cows and buffalos due to travel restrictions., Education during the COVID-19 pandemic, Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, education has been impacted since July 2020. Students who attend government schools have been waiting for months [since June or July] and schools have still not re-opened. Moreover, KECD (Karen Education and Culture Department)[8] schools normally have limited numbers of students and teachers. Because of [government] school closures, the number of students is increasing [students who usually attend government primary schools have begun attending KECD schools], so the [KECD] schools do not have enough materials to use or enough space for students to study [they end up being cramped together in the classroom]. Students are provided materials such as books, pens and pencils by KECD, [but the quantity of these supplies is] based on the [regular] number of students [so there were not enough supplies to accommodate the increased number of students]. The number of students has increased in every KECD school in Bu Tho Township. Some of the schools are small and have also had to expand the school buildings., The grades also had to be extended. For instance, the primary school in Klaw Day village, Mae K’Law Village Tract normally only covers grades 1 to 2, but had to add grade 3, even though it only has two teachers for the school. Thus, there is a shortage of teachers in extending the grades. Teachers now have over 50 students [in their classes]., At the middle school and high school levels, students who normally attend the government schools have not been able to attend school at all. Instead, they have returned to their villages and stay at home or help out their parents., When the reported cases of COVID-19 began increasing in September, an order was released at the district level on September 25th 2020 to close schools for two weeks. If no more COVID-19 cases were reported within those two weeks, schools would be allowed to re-open. [That has still not happened.] The COVID-19 pandemic has created many obstacles for the education system., Healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, There have also been challenges for the villagers regarding healthcare. Villagers have started to worry that they are infected with COVID-19 when they suffer from malaria, catch a cold, or develop a cough. [However, there is no testing available in the village to confirm whether or not they have COVID-19.] Since everyone is currently facing difficulties, including livelihood difficulties, it is not easy to help one another. There are also communication and transportation problems [the road is not good]. If a person becomes sick, he or she will have to contact the doctor, but that is not always possible for the villagers. Regarding COVID-19 prevention, it is not easy for villagers to get prevention materials. Villagers really need protection., Many local villagers and villages are not close to a medical clinic or a Back Pack Health Worker Team (BPHWT) clinic. If something happens to them, they won't be able to follow healthcare procedures in line with the established COVID-19 prevention and protection guidelines., COVID-19 prevention measures, The local leaders from Mu Traw District formed a committee at the district and township levels to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the local areas of Bu Tho Township. On September 15th 2020, the committee from the township discussed building a quarantine centre for the suspected COVID-19 patients. At the time, there were not enough building materials, so they contacted the village tract administrators and relevant leaders to arrange for the needed materials. There are two quarantine sites planned for Bu Tho Township local areas. One will be at the clinic in Day Wah village tract and another one at the clinic in K---village, Meh Klaw village tract. They plan to build the one in Day Wah village tract 30 feet [9.14 metres] away from the Day Wah village tract clinic. These structures will not only be for the [treatment of] COVID-19 patients, they will also be for [the quarantine of] outsiders who come into the local areas. Outsiders will be required to quarantine there for 21 to 28 days., [The villagers were able to finish construction of the quarantine centre next to Day Wah clinic.] Construction of the quarantine site in K---village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township was planned for October 2nd 2020. The huts are to be built with wood, bamboo and other materials. On October 4th 2020, they started building, but have not finished construction., There are two screening checkpoints in D---village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township. [Although the committee agreed to build quarantine centres,] they did not [make plans to] build more screening checkpoints. They are just continuing as before [are not building more screening checkpoints] based on the decision of the local leaders. There are also concerns that there might not be enough supplies at the screening checkpoints., If local villagers want to travel, they are supposed to be screened for COVID-19. The local leaders and some villagers have noticed however that some people are travelling from Hpapun to A---, P---, and H---villages and then going back to Hpapun, yet there is no testing [screening] for them. Many places still need screening checkpoints. Local villagers from E--- and U--- are aware that it is essential to do screening or testing. They are concerned because they come into contact with people from Hpapun for the food deliveries [see below], but there is no testing [screening]., During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)[9] also gave awareness training about COVID-19 to the villagers. On September 20th 2020, KNU district authorities released a radio message with instructions for every village tract in all three townships (Bu Tho, Dwe Lo, and Lu Thaw) to follow. This included avoiding travel to crowded places. Each village tract informed the villagers about the instructions given by the district authorities to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak in their areas., [Travel restrictions], On September [20th] 2020, the KNU realised that the second wave of COVID-19 was taking place in Myanmar. Therefore, they immediately strengthened prevention strategies and sent out orders to the villages in every village tract. Since then, there have been restrictions on the main road and in public areas. The local villagers cannot travel if there is no important issue [reason]., The regulations vary by village tract. Some village tracts allow the local villagers to travel twice in a month. Some village tracts do not allow the local villagers to travel at all and they arrange provisions for the local villagers for two or three months ahead so that the villagers do not face a food shortage [see below]. Some village tracts have been waiting to see how the COVID-19 situation progresses. If there is no change, they will let the local villagers travel to buy food., Starting from September 22nd 2020, there were travel restrictions from Hpapun to K’Mah Moe for both cars and motorcycles. If no more cases are found in these areas, there will be another plan [regarding travel restrictions]. [As of this report, the restrictions have still not been lifted.], Due to the COVID-19 pandemic [and the livelihood issues faced by local villagers], Bu Tho Township leaders have been arranging food for villagers [and dropping it off for them] where they can access it more easily [since they cannot travel to town]. [The central KNU formed a COVID-19 relief committee to support the needs of local villagers during the pandemic. The committee has been purchasing food for villagers who are unable to travel to town to purchase supplies themselves. The committee arranges for a convenient drop-off point, and provides the food at cost (i.e., the original price)]. H---, P--- and A--- villages are brought rice, which is left for them near Khoh Loh Klo River. O---, W--- and Y--- also receive rice. There are also two places arranged for pick up near Hpapun Town for villagers living in E--- and M--- villages. For the rest of the village tracts such as S---, Z---, N---, B---, J---, K---, and A---, rice is arranged for pick up at a place close to the vehicle road which is easier to access., On October 7th 2020, each household from Meh Pa area, Bu Ah Der village tract was allotted one basket of rice, which they could choose to take or not. The rice was provided by the Myanmar government., 2020 general election, Villagers learned that [voting in] the 2020 election would be held in the local areas of Bu Tho Township. There are five parties in the area: KNDP [Karen National Democratic Party], USDP [Union Solidarity and Development Party],[10] UBP [Union Betterment Party], NLD [National League for Democracy][11] and UNDP/UDP [possibly the United Democratic Party]. (The villagers did not actually know the full name of these parties). The parties campaigning along the vehicle road in Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township were competing with each other and some parties tried to provide for the villagers' needs [in the hope of gaining votes]. Prior to the election, local immigration offices [presumably at the bidding of campaigning political parties] worked on processing the national ID cards for villagers without any payment. They did not even ask villagers to provide them household registration documents. The NLD party provided the villagers in L--- village [Meh Klaw village tract] with solar panels and batteries., Tatmadaw soldiers’ activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, Since July 2020, travel restrictions have been imposed to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 in local areas. Tatmadaw soldiers have taken advantage of this to continue travelling [to their army camps]. Furthermore, military trucks have been transporting military equipment. Some villagers were saying that military trucks were coming at night with the whole truck covered so that they [villagers] could not see what they were transporting from the outside. They have been transporting supplies unimpeded., On June 5th 2020, the Tatmadaw soldiers from Da Wei Army came into [Mu Traw District] during the day and at night. There was nothing impeding them. They came into Mu Traw District and stayed at the army camps of multiple Mu Traw battalions: Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[12] #434, LIB #341, LIB #340 and Infantry Battalion (IB)[13] #19., On July 5th 2020, Light Infantry Division (LID)[14] commander Thet Paing Zaw from the Tatmadaw Da Wei Army came with 400 soldiers to stay at the army camp of LIB #434, LIB #341, LIB #340 and IB #19 in Mu Traw District., On July 6th 2020, Daw Wei LID commander Thet Paing Zaw met with the village tract administrator and some of the village heads from X---, L---, G---, and Q---villages. He told the village heads that he was coming to maintain security during the [2020 general election] voting. He also told village heads that they would have to help with supplying medicine and medical services if needed. The meeting was held in LIB #434 army camp., The increase of over 400 soldiers became most apparent on the day of the elections since they were providing security for the voting., More Tatmadaw soldiers arrived and set up base close to Meh Klaw village tract. This created concerns for villagers. Villagers could see that there were more Tatmadaw soldiers guarding road security., Villages that are next to the vehicle road in Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township include: C---, X---, L---, F--- [villages]. [Due to the increased military activity,] villagers do not dare work on their hill farms to plant peanuts for their income. Most of the villagers said military cars come both day and night, and that this started in June 2020. Villagers do not know what was being carried in the vehicles., These types of concerns were not just reported by one or two village tracts. All villagers living in the township have been worrying about this [the increase in Tatmadaw military operations] and are fearful of it [new fighting]., KNU and KNLA activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, From July to September 2020, there were no special operations by the KNU. They were operating per usual instruction., KNU road construction, On October 14th 2020, the authorities from Bu Tho Township held a consultation meeting with three village tract administrators from the following three village tracts: Bu Ah Der, Meh Klaw and Meh Nyoo. The main issue was the construction of two new roads for vehicles (cars and motorbikes)., These roads will connect Meh Nyoo village tract, Bu Ah Der village tract and Meh Klaw village tract areas. Construction for the roads will begin in Pweh Loh Kloh, Meh Nyoo village tract and will then continue to Ba Kyoo or Bu Mee Kyoh which is in Bu Tho Hkoh Place[15] [Meh Nyoo village tract]. Then the road construction will continue, connecting Bu Ah Der to Hkoh Loh Kloh Nee Hkoh in Bu Ah Der village tract and Paw Dee Der areas [Bu Ah Der village tract], and then also connect with Meh Kaw Hta areas [Meh Klaw village tract]., On October 20th 2020, the three village tract administrators will go to do a survey of the area to determine where they will be able to dig the roads more easily. On October 25th 2020, these three village tract administrators will have to come back and report about the survey they did. They plan to pay a fair amount to the local villagers whose farms or livelihood areas would be affected by the road construction. The township secretary and township administrator told the village administrators that they will try to prevent the villagers from asking for compensation [they will discuss the impacts and make sure that the villagers are satisfied with the arrangements]., No road has ever been constructed near Pweh Loh Kloh, Meh Nyoo village tract, or from Bu Ah Der village to Khoh Loh Nee Hkoh and Meh Hkaw Hta places., Another road will be constructed in Pa Heh village tract, between I--- village and R--- village. This road only belongs to [is located in] Pa Heh village tract. The KNU district authorities aim to make this happen during 2020. This road construction is not related to any Myanmar government plan [the Myanmar government is not involved in this road construction]. This is the plan of [a project initiated by] the KNU and if the road is well constructed there will be benefits for local organisations and the local communities., A road from I--- to R--- villages was constructed once in 2018-2019. The road was constructed by the local villagers themselves. Then the road became usable only in the summer for motorbikes to travel. When the local villagers constructed the road, they also had to cut down some of the betel nut trees that were in the way. They are going to construct it [the new road] with a bulldozer but they will try to avoid the local villagers' livelihood areas., Conclusion, In conclusion, some situations are getting better but some situations have worsened. Even though the fighting is silent [has calmed down] in Bu Tho Township during this reporting period, travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have become an obstacle for the villagers. [Yet,] Tatmadaw soldiers have been travelling everywhere they want during the pandemic.

This coup transferred all legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar to the Commander in Chief of the Defence Services (Reuters 01/02/2021). In response, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) was immediately formed as a parliament, primarily by democratically elected members of the 2020 general election. CRPH recognises itself as the only legitimate government (CRPH 20/02/2021). By mid-April, a National Unity Government was established (CRPH 16/04/2021). This move, coupled with the formation and growth of a civil disobedience movement (CDM) and associated protests, has severely constrained the military junta’s ability to consolidate power and rule of law (01/02/2021)., Countrywide protests are ongoing, with the military junta using systemic and arbitrary violence against anti-coup protesters.

Myanmar: End Threats Against Rights Group,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,30 Apr 2021,"Respect Rights to Freedom of Association, Expression, (Bangkok) -- Myanmar's military junta should immediately stop threatening the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a leading human rights monitoring group, Human Rights Watch said today. The group has documented security force abuses since the February 1, 2021 coup, including killings of protesters, arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearances, and unjust court convictions., On April 26, the Home Affairs Ministry of the ruling State Administration Council (SAC) accused the AAPP of operating illegally because it was not registered as an organization. The junta's announcement threatened ""severe action"" against the group for causing ""State service personnel and public panic"" that will ""incite the occurrence of more riots"" and ""harm State stability, rule of law and restoration of law and order."", ""While the world's media and diplomats regularly cite the AAPP's daily updates on the military crackdown, Myanmar's generals are desperately trying to silence the group to keep the truth from getting out,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""The threats are part of the junta's shroud of silence and censorship, targeting frontline groups like AAPP, arresting journalists, and shutting down the internet."", The junta's efforts to target the AAPP are illustrated in the 115-page briefing paper, obtained by Human Rights Watch, that the junta leader, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, presented to leaders at the ASEAN summit in Jakarta on April 24. Min Aung Hlaing claimed, without providing evidence, that the AAPP uses ""data"" that ""appeared in fake and hoax news."" He added that the junta was ""very upset"" that ""world media and international organizations restated"" that information., Responding to the allegations, AAPP Secretary-General Bo Kyi, a recipient of the Human Rights Watch Alison des Forges Defender Award in 2009, told *The Irrawaddy *magazine that: ""I think it is just a political move as international governments, media and UN are referencing our data ... The key issue is the violence they have committed, their killing and arrests. Instead of solving those problems, they are targeting a group like ours which is revealing the true events."" The AAPP told Human Rights Watch that the military's threats have forced them to close their office in Yangon and compelled their staff to go into hiding and work from undisclosed locations., The junta has also arbitrarily arrested journalists to prevent reporting on the opposition Civil Disobedience Movement's broad-based resistance to the coup and the security force abuses. UNESCO reported that the junta has arrested at least 71 journalists since the coup. The AAPP says that 48 journalists are currently known to be in detention, most in undisclosed locations without access to their families or legal counsel. Many other journalists have fled to border regions controlled by ethnic groups, or to neighboring countries., The junta has brought charges against numerous journalists and activists under revised penal code provisions adopted on February 14. The State Administration Council inserted a new provision, section 505A, that could be used to punish comments regarding the illegitimacy of the coup or the military government, among others. The new section would criminalize comments that ""cause fear,"" spread ""false news, [or] agitates directly or indirectly a criminal offense against a Government employee."" Violation of the section is punishable with up to three years in prison. The law arbitrarily interferes with the exercise of rights protected under international law, including freedom of expression., The junta has also increased pressure on independent media outlets by revoking their operating licenses. On March 8, the State Administration Council announced that it had cancelled the licenses of Mizzima, Myanmar Now, 7Day News, Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), and Khit Thit Media. While these media groups have continued to report on events, they do so at great risk since journalists working for these outlets face immediate arrest if they are discovered doing their jobs as reporters., ""Groups like the AAPP and the independent media are playing a critical role holding Myanmar's junta accountable, and they need to be able to continue their work,"" Robertson said. ""Governments concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Myanmar should be offering public support for these organizations and their brave staff members.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-end-threats-against-rights-group

The next update will be issued towards the end of May 2021., HIGHLIGHTS, In south-eastern Myanmar, an estimated 40,000 people have been displaced due to insecurity, armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), and indiscriminate attacks by the MAF on civilian areas., In Kachin State, around 5,800 people have been displaced since armed confrontation between the MAF and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) resurged in early March; about 5,000 remain displaced., In northern Shan, the volatile security situation and clashes, mostly involving Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs), have caused the displacement of about 11,000 people since January., In Rakhine and Chin states, casualties due to landmines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) are on the rise, with 11 civilians, including 9 children killed or injured in April., Humanitarian assistance and protection services in conflict-affected areas continue despite the impact of the political crisis on operations and pre-existing access challenges. The escalation of violence in parts of Myanmar increases threats to the safety of humanitarian operations and compounds existing access challenges., The 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan, which seeks US$276.5 million to assist around 1 million people in conflict-affected areas, remains severely underfunded, with only 12 per cent of requirements covered so far – FTS., KEY FIGURES, 40K people displaced in the South-east since December 2020, 11K people displaced in northern Shan since January 2021, 5.8K people displaced in Kachin State since mid-March 2021, 11 civilian casualties due to explosive hazards in Rakhine and Chin states in April, SITUATION OVERVIEW, SURGE IN DISPLACEMENT IN THE SOUTH-EAST: Armed conflict in the south-eastern parts of Myanmar continues to intensify between the MAF and the KNLA, an armed wing of the Karen National Union, resulting in further internal displacement and civilian casualties, mostly in Kayin State and Bago Region. The clashes, which erupted in early December 2020, had internally displaced around 7,100 people by mid-March, mostly in Hpapun Township in Kayin State, where the displaced families were hiding in the jungles with limited access to services and humanitarian assistance., The humanitarian situation in the area has worsened since late March, with thousands of people having reportedly fled from their homes in Kayin State after the MAF launched airstrikes, including in civilian areas. The continued hostilities, shelling of civilian areas by the MAF, and increased insecurity reportedly led to the displacement of an estimated 40,000 people throughout south-eastern Myanmar by 20 April, according to data gathered from various sources by UNHCR. Prior to developments on 1 February 2021, Kayin State and Bago Region had hosted about 12,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in four locations, both in camp-like and out-of-camp settlements, since 2006., The hostilities in Kayin and Bago between 27 March and 8 April have killed at least 20 civilians and injured more than 25, according to public sources. There have also been reports of a local school destroyed in Dwe Lo Township in Hpapun District of Kayin State, in addition to damage to other civilian property. The details of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure could not be verified at the time of reporting. Humanitarian interventions remain constrained due to severe and longstanding access challenges, compounded by growing insecurity in the area. Nevertheless, operational partners are doing their best to deliver assistance to the newly displaced and those otherwise affected by hostilities. Humanitarian partners are planning to roll out a displacement tracking system and carrying out a stocktaking exercise to assess the capacities of partners in Kayin State. This is to facilitate the efficient prepositioning of emergency supplies among partners to ensure a coordinated response., NEW DISPLACEMENT IN KACHIN DUE TO RESURGENCE OF CONFLICT: The security situation in Kachin State, which began to deteriorate following the eruption of clashes between the MAF and the KIA in early March, remains volatile. Armed confrontations between the MAF and the KIA were reported in at least 12 townships, including Bhamo, Hpakant, Injayang, Kamaing, Mogaung, Momauk, Myitkyina, Putao, Shwegu, Sumprabum, Tanai and Waingmaw, ranging from local skirmishes, to attacks on convoys, airstrikes, artillery and mortar shelling. Hardly any clashes had not been reported in Kachin State since September 2018., The conflict led to the displacement of over 5,800 people since early March 2021. Around 800 people returned to their places of origin within a few days, while about 5,000 remain displaced across several townships. Some 4,800 people are currently hosted in churches, monasteries and displacement sites in Injanyang, Momauk and Shwegu townships. The remaining IDPs are dispersed in small numbers across Dawthponeyan and Hpakant townships. Attempts are being made to reach the affected communities with assistance; however, insecurity and other access constraints make it difficult for partners to scale up the efforts to address needs, which include emergency shelter, food, basic household items and healthcare. The new displacement comes on top of protracted internal displacement in Kachin State, where about 95,000 people have been living in IDP camps established in 2011., In addition to increased humanitarian needs and population movement, the ongoing insecurity is raising serious protection concerns, with reports of increased conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) perpetrated against women and girls. Reported incidents included brutal and systematic CRSV committed by multiple perpetrators and most of these violations were perpetrated against women and girls of ethnic minority groups., POPULATION MOVEMENT IN NORTHERN SHAN: Clashes between the MAF and EAOs or between EAOs in northern Shan continued unabated in the first quarter of 2021 and escalated in March. The Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army (RCSS/SSA) and the allied forces of the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Shan State Progress Party/Shan State Army (SSPP/SSA) engaged in armed confrontations in Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Monghsu and Namtu townships. There were also clashes, albeit with less intensity and frequency between the MAF and the KIA in Lashio, Kutkai and Muse townships, between the MAF and the TNLA in Kutkai and Namhkan townships, and between the MAF and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army in Hseni and Kutkai townships., Clashes between January and April displaced close to 11,000 people in Hsipaw, Kyaukme, Lashio, Namtu, Namhkan, Monghsu and Muse townships. Displacement generally remains temporary; over 6,000 people returned to their places of origin within a few days. The remaining 4,770 people are currently hosted in churches, monasteries and displacement sites, with Kyaukme and Namtu townships hosting around 1,650 and 1,340 IDPs respectively. Local humanitarian partners and host communities are providing life-saving assistance and protection services, although as with other states and regions, operational challenges, including due to pre-existing access constraints and insecurity, continue to hinder their abilities to scale up., The conflict dynamics and their humanitarian impact in northern Shan so far in 2021 demonstrate an upward trend compared to the same period in 2020, when there were only a few brief armed skirmishes between the EAOs that temporary displaced some 720 people. In addition to the most recent displacements, about 9,800 IDPs continue to reside in protracted displacement camps in northern Shan established since 2011., EXPLOSIVE HAZARDS A THREAT IN RAKHINE AND CHIN: Despite the absence of hostilities in Rakhine and southern areas of Chin states since November 2020, the physical wellbeing of civilians remains threatened by the presence of landmines and ERWs. In April, a total of 11 civilians were killed or injured by landmines and ERWs, mostly in Rakhine. In Kyauktaw Township in Rakhine State on 4 April, the explosion of an ERW killed a mother and her two children and injured another child. Another explosion reportedly injured six children under 16 years old near Taung Ywar Village in Buthidaung Township on 8 April. A landmine incident was also reported in Paletwa Township in Chin State on 15 April, in which one civilian sustained injuries., Meanwhile, there are reports that the MAF is demining villages and roads across several townships in Rakhine, tied with efforts to encourage people displaced by the MAF-Arakan Army (AA) conflict to return to their places of origin. However, many IDPs remain unwilling to return due to the continued presence of armed personnel around their villages, concerns about landmines, and the lack of livelihood opportunities. As of 21 April, more than 78,000 people displaced by the MAF-AA conflict were hosted in 146 sites and 5,038 people in 28 host communities in Rakhine State. Another 9,841 IDPs remained in 27 sites in Chin State, as of 21 January. This is in addition to around 126,000 IDPs, mostly stateless persons, who are hosted in protracted camps established in 2012.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-6-30-april-2021

Protection and Human Rights",30 Apr 2021,"Pandemic and political crisis could result in half of Myanmar’s population living in poverty by 2022, UNDP says, The combined effects of the two crises could put over a decade of progress on poverty reduction in the country at risk, Yangon – After more than a decade of hard-won gains in the fight against poverty, the number of poor people in Myanmar could double as a result of the combined impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing political crisis, according to new research released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)., The study, entitled “COVID-19, Coup d’état and Poverty: Compounding Negative Shocks and their Impact on Human Development in Myanmar” warns that, if unchecked, the combined effect of these two crises could push up to 12 million people into poverty. That could result in as much as 25 million people - nearly half of Myanmar’s population - living below the national poverty line by early 2022, a level of impoverishment not seen in the country since 2005., The analysis indicates that, by the end of 2020, 83 per cent of households had reported that their incomes had been, on average, slashed almost in half due to the pandemic. With these unprecedented circumstances, the number of people living below the poverty line in Myanmar is estimated to have increased by 11 percentage points as a result of the socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis., And according to the projections outlined in the report, the worsening security, human rights, and development situation in Myanmar since February 2021 could cause another sharp rise in the country’s poverty rate – driving it up by an additional 12 percentage points by early next year., “In the space of 12 years, from 2005 to 2017, Myanmar managed to nearly halve the number of people living in poverty. However, the challenges of the past 12 months have put all of these hard-won development gains at risk,” said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “Without functioning democratic institutions, Myanmar faces a tragic and avoidable backslide towards levels of poverty not seen in a generation.”, According to the study, women and children are projected to bear the heaviest brunt, with more than half of Myanmar’s children projected to be living in poverty within a year., Urban poverty is expected to triple, and the worsening security conditions have continued to fracture supply chains and hinder the movement of people, services, and commodities including the provision of agricultural goods. Small businesses, which provide the majority of jobs and incomes for the poorer segments of the urban population, have been hit hard., The pressure on the country’s currency, the Kyat, has increased the price of imports and energy. At the same time, the country’s banking system remains paralyzed, resulting in shortages of cash and limited access to social welfare payments. It also prevents much-needed remittances from reaching hard-pressed families., “We are witnessing a compounding crisis of unprecedented severity and complexity. Myanmar had managed to halve poverty, and with its democratic transition was showing signs of firming up fragile human development gains. Now it feels like a push-back to 2005. The combined effects of COVID-19 and the political crisis have caused a systemic shock which could lead to a long-lasting disruption in Myanmar’s development trajectory, unless addressed and resolved soon,” said Kanni Wignaraja, UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific., As the situation in Myanmar continues to worsen, UNDP joins the United Nations Secretary-General in condemning, in the strongest terms, the killing of civilians, and in calling for a firm, unified and resolute international response to the crisis., Link to the report: https://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/covid-19-coup-d-etat-and-poverty-impact-on-myanmar.html, About UNDP, UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (17 - 23 April 2021),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,29 Apr 2021,"Last week in Southeast Asia, anti-coup demonstrations continued in Myanmar, as demonstrators expressed their support for the newly-formed National Unity Government (NUG) composed of lawmakers elected in the November 2020 elections. Demonstrators also demanded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) invite NUG representatives to the ASEAN leaders’ meeting convened on 24 April. Meanwhile, the Myanmar military launched deadly offensives against anti-coup demonstrators in Sagaing and Mandalay regions. Fighting between the Myanmar military and Kachin and Kayin rebels also continued throughout the week. Elsewhere, in the Philippines, a diplomatic spat with China continued after Chinese vessels delayed their withdrawal from disputed areas in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In Thailand, anti-government demonstrations increased last week as members of the People’s Party rallied across the country. In Indonesia, labor unions held a protest ahead of the first hearing of the judicial review for the controversial Omnibus Law. Finally, in Malaysia, opposition parties led a protest calling for an end to the state of emergency, which has been in place since January 2021., In Myanmar, anti-coup demonstrators took to the streets for the twelfth consecutive week to express their opposition to the military junta. Demonstrators also expressed their support for the newly-formed NUG and called on countries to recognize the NUG as the legitimate government of Myanmar. The NUG, made up of elected lawmakers and prominent activists, was formed on 16 April. Ahead of the ASEAN leaders’ meeting on 24 April, the NUG issued a statement calling for international recognition and an invitation to the meeting (Channel News Asia, 18 April 2021). The bloc has been criticized for only extending an invitation to the leader of the military coup (Irrawaddy, 23 April 2021). On the day before the meeting, around 150 demonstrators held a protest march in downtown Yangon, stating that the military leader’s attendance would only serve to legitimize the unlawful takeover of power on 1 February (AP, 24 April 2021). The march also marks the first open demonstration in downtown Yangon in recent weeks after crackdowns and increased surveillance by security forces have quelled protest activities., Meanwhile, clashes between the military and anti-coup demonstrators continued in Sagaing region, which has seen some of the most persistent armed resistance to military rule in the past few weeks. On 20 April, Myanmar military soldiers launched a deadly operation against demonstrators in Yinmarbin township, which resulted in the deaths of five demonstrators and two soldiers. During the offensive, drones and long-range artillery were reportedly used by the military to track and attack the positions of demonstrators (Myanmar Now, 21 April 2021). Elsewhere, in Mandalay region, a two-day battle between security forces and demonstrators defending themselves against the regime’s violence resulted in six members of the regime’s security forces being killed (Irrawaddy, 19 April 2021)., Separately, battles between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) continued as the Myanmar military sought to recapture bases that have recently been seized by the KIO/KIA. The Myanmar military has not been successful in reclaiming these bases (Myanmar Now, 23 April 2021). Elsewhere, in Mon state, clashes erupted between the Myanmar military and the Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) after the military attempted to crack down on demonstrators. The KNU/KNLA, which was providing security for anti-coup demonstrators in the area, reportedly intercepted the military, which prompted a battle between both sides (Irrawaddy, 24 April 2021)., In the Philippines, tension mounted over a diplomatic spat with China due to the continued presence of Chinese vessels in the Philippines’ EEZ. Despite diplomatic protests lodged by the Philippine government two weeks ago, a reported 160 Chinese vessels remain in the EEZ. In response, the Philippine government filed additional diplomatic protests on 21 April. This is in addition to the daily protests that it has been filing for “every day of delay” in which Chinese vessels remain in the disputed area (Philippine Star, 23 April 2021). The Philippine government alleges that hundreds of thousands of kilograms of fish are illegally taken from the area every day that the Chinese vessels remain in the disputed waters (Rappler, 23 April 2021)., In Thailand, there was a significant increase in anti-government demonstrations last week, with the majority of demonstrations led by the People’s Party. During the week, daily demonstrations were held by the People’s Party members who stood still for 112 minutes to denounce the use of Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code — or the lèse majesté law — to detain protest leaders. The series of demonstrations were held to express solidarity with protesters, who have been demonstrating daily for over a month in front of the Supreme Court in Bangkok. On 23 April, two prominent leaders of the anti-government movement were released on bail after two months of detention. Nineteen other protesters remain behind bars, including two leaders who have been on a hunger strike for over a month (Bangkok Post, 23 April 2021)., Elsewhere, in Indonesia, after months of inactivity, labor groups gathered once again in Jakarta to voice their opposition to the Omnibus Law on Job Creation in Jakarta. The protest was held ahead of the first hearing of the judicial review for the Omnibus Law at the Constitutional Court (Tempo, 21 April 2021). Labor unions filed a judicial review to challenge the Omnibus Law last November, following weeks of nationwide demonstrations against the law. The Omnibus Law has been criticized by labor unions for being pro-business and for undermining labor rights (Channel News Asia, 24 September 2020)., Lastly, in a rare show of unity, members of several opposition parties in Malaysia submitted a memorandum to demand an end to the state of emergency (Malaysiakini, 21 April 2021). Following a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in January 2021, Malaysia has been placed under a state of emergency to tackle the third wave of the pandemic. Under the state of emergency, all parliament and state assembly sittings — and all national, state, or by-elections — have been suspended (The Straits Times, 12 January 2021).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-17-23-april-2021

Explosions and gunfire were heard across the border and the reported casualties include a Thai national, although the exact location where they were wounded is currently unclear., ANALYSIS, The KNU has used both the protests triggered by the coup and the more recent ASEAN meeting - when Junta leaders agreed to tone down violence – to step up their campaign in the hope of generating greater international attention. The reported Thai casualty highlights the growing (though still limited) risk from indirect fire on both sides of the border., PREDICTION, The Tatmadaw will likely respond to their latest losses with further air and artillery strikes, likely exacerbating the existing IDP situation., The Tatmadaw will likely also use the intensified fighting to justify delaying existing commitments to release prisoners and maintain dialogue., The KNU look set to continue their campaign of attacks against isolated Tatmadaw positions – and may also step-up ambushes, increasing the threat from mine/IED and small arms fire on roads in the area. Indeed, their propaganda/recruitment videos are now being embedded in international media reports, which will likely encourage further action., The Thai authorities are credibly reported to have pushed back refugees trying to cross the border and this trend will likely continue in the absence of international media in the area because of security restrictions and the COVID-19 pandemic., MITIGATION, Increase situational awareness around the Thai-Myanmar border area., Consider further limiting any road movement in the area., Carry (and wear) personal protective equipment if indirect fire is reported/expected.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-alert-thai-border-area-clashes-eastern-myanmar-27-april-2021

The shooting took place near the hospital’s outpatient treatment centre for patients suffering from heart-related health issues., Mass Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) protests have been taking place across Myanmar after the Myanmar armed forces (known as the Tatmadaw) seized control of the country on 1 February following a general election that the National League for Democracy party won by a landslide., The military have since declared a state of emergency to last for at least a year, and numerous countries have condemned the takeover and subsequent violent crackdown on protesters., Hundreds of people, including children, have been killed and many injured during the protests.

ASEAN member states must work together, with other countries in the region and the international community, to find a durable and peaceful solution to this crisis., “The agreement for ASEAN to provide humanitarian assistance is also welcome but it is crucial that national and international aid agencies are granted unfettered access to deliver much-needed assistance to affected communities., “There was no mention in the summit consensus points that neighbouring countries are agreeing to grant refuge to people escaping violence and refraining from pushing back people in need of protection. Those fleeing across international borders must be offered a safe refuge., “CARE calls on ASEAN member states to immediately formulate a clear plan to ensure that this talk turns into action.

The detained individuals were sent to Taunggyi Prison., “The Myanmar military’s persecution of health workers is taking many horrifying forms: ambulances shot at, clinics taken over by armed forces, medics killed,” said Jennifer Leigh, an epidemiologist serving as PHR’s Myanmar researcher. “By attacking the health system, the junta is terrorizing the population and cutting off access to life-saving care in the middle of a pandemic.These are gross violations of human rights, and threats against long-standing international principles of protection of health care, including the obligations of health professionals to care for the sick and wounded without interference.”, “Attacks on health care are a global phenomenon, experienced in many conflict settings but also fueled by the pandemic,” said Christina Wille, managing director of Insecurity Insight. “Tragically, Myanmar has emerged as a major hotspot for violence against health care, as the military brazenly assaults health workers and attempts to control the country’s health infrastructure.”, The research brief highlights reported incidents of violence against health workers, facilities, and transport in Myanmar between February 11 and April 12, 2021. It does not include information on violence against patients., Insecurity Insight, PHR, and CPHHR used an open-source methodology to compile incidents noted in local, national, and international news outlets, online databases, and social media reports. The incidents reported are neither a complete nor a representative list of all incidents. Most incidents have not undergone verification by Insecurity Insight, PHR, and CPHHR. Data collection is ongoing and data may change as more information is made available. However, the data offers a snapshot of how Myanmar’s military is persecuting health workers and targeting facilities amid its broader crackdown on dissent., The research brief makes several recommendations to United Nations (UN) Member States, urging the international community to ensure the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2286, adopted May 2016, which strongly condemns attacks on medical personnel in conflict situations., Earlier this month, PHR and 20 other organizations sent an open letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the Biden administration to take immediate additional actions to address the public health and human rights crisis in Myanmar., ***, Insecurity Insight monitors open sources for information on incidents that interfere with the delivery of health care.

Myanmar: Human rights must be top priority for emergency ASEAN summit,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,23 Apr 2021,"Summit is “existential crisis” for regional bloc as it faces major challenge to its credibility, Indonesia must investigate coup leader Min Aung Hlaing expected to attend summit, The catastrophic aftermath of the Myanmar coup is the biggest test in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) history, said Amnesty International today, calling on the regional bloc to prioritise protecting the human rights of people in Myanmar and prevent the situation deteriorating into a human rights and humanitarian crisis., The organization is also urging the Indonesian authorities and other ASEAN member states to investigate Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on credible allegations of responsibility for crimes against humanity in Myanmar.As a state party to the UN Convention Against Torture, Indonesia has a legal obligation to prosecute or extradite a suspected perpetrator on its territory., “The Myanmar crisis trigged by the military presents ASEAN with the biggest test in its history. The bloc’s usual commitment to non-interference is a non-starter: this is not an internal matter for Myanmar but a major human rights and humanitarian crisis which is impacting the entire region and beyond,” said Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research, “The crisis initiated by a murderous and unrepentant Myanmar military has engulfed the country, and will cause severe aftershocks – humanitarian and more – for the entire region, particularly if the military can continue to commit serious violations and crimes with complete impunity., “Moreover, the Indonesian authorities are duty-bound to investigate Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other Myanmar military officials who may join his delegation to Jakarta., “The extensively documented allegations against Myanmar’s coup leader, by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, Amnesty International and many others, must be investigated. The Indonesian authorities and other ASEAN member states cannot ignore the fact Min Aung Hlaing is suspected of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.”, ASEAN's credibility on the line, In an open letter to ASEAN member states, Amnesty International highlights the fact that hundreds of people have been killed and thousands have been detained in the weeks following the 1 February military coup in Myanmar. The Myanmar military remains unmoved by the various calls from the international community and civil society organizations., Myanmar’s economy is on its knees and expected to contract by up to 20%, while food prices increase and banking system disruptions and limited cash availability hinder humanitarian operations. The World Food Programme has warned that up to 3.4 million people in Myanmar face hunger in the next several months., “The Myanmar military appears to be operating with the assumption of total impunity. The situation today is the direct result of a broader failure by the international community, including the ASEAN, to hold the Myanmar military to account for its past crimes., “If not stopped, the violations committed by the Myanmar military will result in escalating violence and conflict, worsening inequality, hunger and mass displacement, including into ASEAN Member States – all amid the COVID-19 pandemic., “Amnesty International urges the ASEAN and its Member States to work together and take immediate action to protect the people of Myanmar, prioritizing their human rights and to end impunity,” said Emerlynne Gil., The need to end impunity, On 10 March 2021, after examining over 50 clips from the ongoing crackdown, Amnesty International found that the Myanmar military is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country. Many of these killings amount to extrajudicial executions., In a statement to the UN Human Rights Council on 11 March 2021, the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, noted that the repression of peaceful protests since the coup likely meets the threshold of crimes against humanity., In 2018, Amnesty International released a report containing extensive and credible evidence implicating Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and 12 other named individuals in crimes against humanity committed during the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya population in northern Rakhine State. Thousands of Rohingya women, men and children were murdered – bound and summarily executed; shot and killed while running away; or burned to death inside their homes. Rohingya women and girls were raped in their villages and as they fled to Bangladesh., Over the last few years, Amnesty International has also documented war crimes and other serious human rights violations committed by the Myanmar military against various other ethnic minorities in Rakhine, Chin, Kachin and northern Shan States., Amnesty International continues to call on all states, including ASEAN Member States, to exercise universal and other forms of jurisdiction to investigate any person who may reasonably be suspected of committing crimes against humanity, war crimes or other crimes under international law in Myanmar. ASEAN should not shield perpetrators from accountability and must put an end to the years of impunity of the Myanmar military., “Thereis sufficient evidence to reasonably suspect that Min Aung Hlaing is responsible for crimes under international law, including torture, and this needs highlighting at every opportunity,” said Emerlynne Gil., “The deadly operations by the military since the 1 February coup only magnify the urgency of bringing Min Aung Hlaing and other suspected perpetrators to justice. The Indonesian authorities have an obligation to investigate him and must do so.”, Background, In its open letter to ASEAN and member states ahead of the emergency summit, Amnesty International calls on the following:, To the ASEAN -, Unequivocally condemn all human rights violations in Myanmar and continue to call for the release of all individuals who are arbitrarily detained, and the end of the use of lethal force against children, peaceful protesters and bystanders., Direct the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) to develop a common approach to ensure that all engagement with Myanmar takes into account and addresses human rights concerns, in accordance with the AICHR’s mandate in Section 4.11 of its Terms of Reference. This common approach shall be adopted by ASEAN and shall guide the regional body in all of its engagement in Myanmar, including in relation to the situation in Rakhine State and to repression of opposition to the military coup., Support the work of independent international mechanisms, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar to investigate human rights violations in Myanmar., Urge the United Nations Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar as a whole to the International Criminal Court., Support the call for the UN Security Council to impose a comprehensive global arms embargo against Myanmar., Support the call for the UN Security Council to impose targeted financial sanctions against officials suspected of responsibility for crimes under international law and serious violations, including in the context of the repression of opposition to the 1 February coup., To ASEAN member states -, Refrain from returning any person to Myanmar under the current circumstances, regardless of their immigration status, and continue to halt all deportations and returns until human rights protections can be guaranteed. Returning any person under the current circumstances would constitute a breach of the principle of non-refoulement, which, as part of customary human rights law, prohibits the return of any person, irrespective of migration status, to a state where there are substantial grounds to believe they would face irreparable harm upon return due to serious human rights violations., Ensure that any future repatriations or returns of refugees are only conducted when safe, voluntary, and dignified, with explicit human rights protections in place, including the right to citizenship. States should provide an individual assessment for each person to evaluate needs for international protection., Exercise universal and other forms of jurisdiction to investigate Senior General Min Aung Hlaing for allegations of committing crimes against humanity, war crimes or other crimes under international law in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-human-rights-must-be-top-priority-emergency-asean-summit
WFP step up operations in response to fast rising hunger in Myanmar,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,22 Apr 2021,"YANGON, Myanmar – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is to mount a new food assistance operation, targeting up to 2 million vulnerable people in the poor townships in Myanmar’s main cities and other areas where population displacement has recently taken place., With the triple impact of pre-existing poverty, COVID-19 and the current political crisis, hunger and desperation are rising sharply across Myanmar. WFP estimates that within the next six months, up to 3.4 million more people will be hungry, particularly those in urban centres., “More and more poor people have lost their jobs and are unable to afford food,” said WFP Myanmar Country Director Stephen Anderson. “A concerted response is required now to alleviate immediate suffering, and to prevent an alarming deterioration in food security.”, Already, there are signs of families in and around Yangon being pushed to the edge, skipping meals, eating less nutritious food and going into debt, just to survive. WFP’s response in Yangon will target 10 of the poorest townships, many of which are home to large informal settlements. WFP is also monitoring the situation in other parts of the country, and is ready to provide assistance to affected communities, including those newly displaced by armed conflict, if required., The latest WFP market monitoring shows that in Yangon and across the country, the average rice price has increased by 5% since January, and the average cooking oil price has increased by 18% since February. In Yangon, an up to 25% increase in cooking oil price was also recorded. The increases are particularly high in some border states including Rakhine, Kachin and Chin. In Kachin state, for example, rice prices have risen by up to 43% in some townships, and cooking oil by 32%. The price of fuel has increased by roughly 30% nationwide., Despite the volatile situation, WFP has maintained its humanitarian assistance to internally displaced people and other vulnerable populations affected by long-running conflict. In March, WFP assistance reached 374,000 people in conflict affected areas of southern Chin, Kachin, Rakhine and northern Shan states., In the coming months, the number of people WFP assists will nearly triple – from 1.3 million to 3.3 million. To do this, US$106 million is required urgently., “To prevent a large-scale humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of our eyes, we must step up. We count on the international community to continue standing with the people of Myanmar,” said Anderson., Contact

Myanmar: Analysis of the economic fallout & food insecurity in wake of the takeover,Analysis,WFP,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",14 Apr 2021,"Key takeaways, Prior to 1 February 2021, 2.8 million people were considered food insecure in Myanmar. WFP estimates that 1.5 to 3.4 million additional people could be at risk of food insecurity and in need of assistance due to the economic slowdown provoked by the political crisis in the coming three to six months. This is largely because poor people have lost jobs and income, making it harder to afford food., Vulnerable people in urban areas affected by the economic standstill are at greatest risk, while longer term impact on food systems will also add pressure on rural populations’ food security., In addition to job and income loss, increasing food and fuel prices, disruptions in trade, slumping economic growth, and internal displacement of ethnic minority groups bode ill for Myanmar’s poor. The latest forecast from the World Bank indicates a GDP contraction of 10% in 2021., Market prices of rice and cooking oil have increased across all monitored markets since the start of February 2021 by 5% and 18%, respectively; however even higher increases were registered in border states including Rakhine, Kachin and Chin. Given the importance of rice and cooking oil in diets and the expenditure of poorest households on rice, continued price increases will likely further impact household food security., Myanmar’s economy was already severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in2020; a quarter of the country’s population were poor and a further third were vulnerable to poverty., The current situation is extremely precarious and there may be additional short- and longterm impacts on Myanmar’s food security and poverty levels., This brief provides an analysis of the short-term, immediate food security impacts of the current events and perspectives for the longer term to inform WFP operations. Considering the fluidity of the current situation and the lack of fresh primary data on affected populations, the analysis builds on secondary data and employs a broad set of assumptions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-analysis-economic-fallout-food-insecurity-wake-takeover
"Atrocity Alert No. 249: Myanmar (Burma), DR Congo and Nigeria",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,21 Apr 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., ASEAN MUST UPHOLD ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF MYANMAR, As anti-coup protests continue, during a 19 April interview the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said that, “according to the responsibility to protect [R2P], the international community… has a responsibility to do what it can to protect the lives of innocent people in countries that are unable or unwilling to do so, or are in fact attacking them.” He stressed that it was “definitely appropriate” for the international community to act in accordance with the R2P principle and that Myanmar was “exactly the situation” where we “have a responsibility to protect.”, According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 739 people have been killed by the security forces since 1 February and at least 3,331 people are currently detained for resisting the military coup. Two protesters were killed in the city of Mogok on 17 April, when the security forces opened fire on people gathered to show support for the National Unity Government (NUG), which was formed a day earlier by a coalition of democratic opponents to military rule., Clashes also continue between Myanmar’s military and the ethnic armed group, the Kachin Independence Army. The military is reportedly using civilians as human shields in northern Kachin State, forcing them to walk ahead of soldiers. Such acts violate international law and are a war crime., Meanwhile, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will discuss the ongoing crisis in Myanmar during a summit to be held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 24 April. Controversially, Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, the coup leader, was invited to the summit, while NUG representatives were not. It is unclear whether General Min Aung Hlaing – who an earlier UN Fact-Finding Mission found was responsible for the 2017 genocide against the country’s Rohingya minority – will attend the summit virtually or in person., In an address to the UN Security Council (UNSC) on 19 April, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed, “the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States should not be used as a pretext for inaction in the face of serious human rights abuses. ASEAN must make it clear to the Myanmar military that the current situation is so grave that it cannot be regarded only as an internal matter.” He further called on the current UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, “to engage directly with the Myanmar military” and urged the UNSC to “seriously consider” the principle of R2P, “using a range of tools at the Council’s disposal.”, The UNSC and ASEAN must implement practical measures to help mediate an end to the crisis in Myanmar. Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “the country is currently ungovernable under the military junta. The UNSC and ASEAN should immediately impose a global arms embargo, as well as internationally binding sanctions on senior military officials and affiliated businesses. Accountability is essential. The time for so-called quiet diplomacy has passed. Now is the time for bold diplomatic action.”, ETHNIC VIOLENCE, DISPLACEMENT AND HUNGER THREATEN DR CONGO, Last Friday, 16 April, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) warned of a resurgence of violence in the Grand Kasaï region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According to UNHCR, clashes between fighters from the Luba and Kuba ethnic groups in the Bakwakenge locality erupted in late March. Local authorities have reported that at least 21,000 people have been displaced, 13 people killed and 190 homes burned down. Tensions between the two communities have been increasing since August 2020 when a deadly cycle of reprisal attacks resulted in 40,000 people being displaced., The risk of widespread ethnic violence is particularly acute in the Kasaïs, as the region continues to recover from atrocities perpetrated between 2016-2018 that forced more than 1.4 million people to flee. During that time the UN identified at least 80 mass graves, and more than 3,000 people were estimated to have been killed, including two members of the UN Panel of Experts who were investigating the violence. Most fighting took place between Kamuina Nsapu (a mainly Luba militia), Bana Mura (a mainly Chokwe militia), and the armed forces of the DRC. A UN Team of International Experts found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the militias, including extrajudicial killings, rape, torture, and recruitment of children, as well as abuses that “could amount to persecution based on ethnicity.”, UNHCR spokesperson, Babar Baloch, called for “a renewed focus on restoring peace and defusing tensions in Kasaï to prevent another wave of mass displacement in the country.” There are currently an estimated 5.2 million people displaced in the DRC where recurring conflict in the eastern provinces has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis. On 6 April the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme announced that an estimated 27.3 million people – one in three Congolese – are critically hungry, which is “the highest number of people in urgent need of food security assistance in the world.”, The DRC government needs to urgently deescalate tensions in the Kasaï region, protect vulnerable civilians and ensure that the violence does not derail the ongoing truth, justice and accountability process for past atrocities., ARMED EXTREMIST GROUPS TARGET HUMANITARIAN WORKERS IN NIGERIA, A series of attacks by armed extremist groups on the town of Damasak, in northeast Nigeria, have forced 65,000 people – 80 percent of the town’s population – to flee. Since the attacks began on 11 April at least eight people have been killed and dozens wounded. The armed groups looted and burned down houses, as well as offices and warehouses of international humanitarian organizations, including a health clinic and UN Refugee Agency facility. Armed fighters also conducted house-to-house searches looking for aid workers., Humanitarian operations in Damasak have largely been suspended as result of the violence, adversely affecting 8,800 internally displaced people and 76,000 people in host communities in the area. Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that these “humanitarian aid operations and facilities are the lifeline of people in northeast Nigeria who depend on our assistance to survive.”, Over the past year, humanitarian organizations have become the focus of recurring attacks by armed extremist groups operating in Nigeria. On 2 March alleged fighters from the so-called Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) attacked a UN base and overran a humanitarian hub in the north-east, trapping 25 aid workers. In response to this attack, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, stressed that, “civilians and aid workers, their facilities and assets should never be a target. They must be protected and respected at all times.”, While no group has claimed responsibility for the assault on Damasak, both Boko Haram and ISWA continue to conduct attacks in the north-east and have killed at least 3,000 people since January 2018., Intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, materials or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance operation is a war crime. Recurring attacks on humanitarian workers demonstrates the need for the Nigerian authorities to radically improve security in the north-east. The Nigerian government also needs to expand programs that directly address grievances that armed extremist groups exploit for recruitment, such as poverty, endemic corruption, youth unemployment and environmental degradation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-249-myanmar-burma-dr-congo-and-nigeria
Peri-Urban Yangon Approaches a Food and Nutrition Crisis in the Face of Loss of Livelihoods,News and Press Release,UNOPS,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2021,"In the wake of Myanmar’s military coup on February 1, 2021, the UNOPS-managed Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) signals a warning on food and nutrition., In the wake of Myanmar’s military coup on February 1, 2021, the UNOPS-managed Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) signals a warning about the rapidly deteriorating food and nutrition security of thousands of migrant workers and their children in impoverished peri-urban Yangon. As the political crisis continues to unfold, families, who were already surviving on the edge prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, are now living in growing insecurity, facing the complete loss of or reduced income, limited access to food amidst skyrocketing food prices and barriers to accessing health services. The threat of an emerging nutrition and health crisis in peri-urban Yangon is real as thousands of people, women and children in particular, can no longer meet their basic food and healthcare needs., Even before the arrival of COVID-19, only 40 per cent of the Myanmar population could afford a diet that met their nutrient needs.[1] In some pockets of the country, including peri-urban Yangon, the nutrition context before 2020 reflected particular vulnerability including a high rate of child wasting (9.3%), stunting (28.8%) and maternal underweight (13.7%) while the coverage of essential nutrition and health services was low in Yangon’s informal settlements. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically worsened the nutrition situation with estimations suggesting an additional 110,000 children under-five have become wasted. The ongoing political crisis will certainly trigger a further stark increase in hunger and child malnutrition, particularly among a growing number of vulnerable households in peri-urban townships., Access to food is becoming harder, The widespread closure of markets, shops and grocery stores has limited access to food, especially for the most vulnerable families. Where food is available, prices are rising, particularly for staple foods such as rice, oil and fuel which have already gone up on average by 10-15 per cent and continue rising, intensifying the food insecurity of the poorest families. Many families struggle to afford basic foodstuffs, let alone all those other food products that make up a diverse, nutrient-dense diet. This puts nutritionally vulnerable groups, particularly young children, adolescents and women of reproductive age at greater risk of undernutrition., A mother of a six-day old infant in Shwe Pyi Tar said, “I really want to have meat sometimes, but it is not affordable for me.”, Loss of income is widespread, At the same time, workers in peri-urban Yangon are facing significantly reduced income.“None of my family members has a job now. My husband used to drive a sand truck before... We are not financially secure at the moment,” said a mother of a fifteen-month-old in Shwe Pyi Tar., Many of the factories that sustain peri-urban families have shut down due to reduced orders and supply chain issues; while others face significant cash flow issues. This has led to significant numbers of workers (primarily migrant women) losing their employment altogether with many factories refusing, or unable, to pay outstanding wages., Facing food shortages, loss of work, and increasing violence, many of the migrants previously employed in the industrial sector have left Yangon, affecting incomes of many smallholder urban vendors. For those who remain, there are further challenges to livelihoods as many are facing debt or have had their assets destroyed. For those who have managed to save money in bank accounts or who are reliant on social protection schemes, there are challenges in accessing cash, as most bank branches are closed. Khin is the head of a twelve person household (with 9 adults and 3 children), which relies on the salary of two adults. She said that although they can purchase food now, they cannot access their money, as banks are closed and ATMs are not reliable., Reductions in income coupled with movement restrictions further hinder people’s access to healthcare, medicine and other basic needs., Nutrition and health services are at standstill, In many parts of the city, health facilities are either not functioning or performing at reduced capacity. Difficulties crossing townships mean that health professionals cannot reach patients; this is a particular problem for midwives unable to provide safe and sanitary conditions for pregnant women to deliver their babies and HIV-positive individuals who face challenges accessing HIV services and antiretroviral medication. Even where facilities do function, lack of or reduced resources, military occupation of public hospitals, and restrictions in movement lead to limited or lack of access to routine and emergency nutrition and health services including pre and postnatal care, treatment of malnutrition, breastfeeding counseling, and immunizations, among other services., A mother of a six-month-old child reported that, “due to the political situation, we are afraid to go to clinics and hospitals now.”, Rise in violence against women, With many peri-urban townships under martial law, communities are facing aggression and random acts of violence on the streets, at workplaces, and increasingly in their homes. Women garment workers have taken a predominant position in demonstrations against the military. In addition to facing the violent crackdown of such demonstrations, there is an increase in incidents of gender-based violence and sexual harassment, which poses another threat to women and children’s nutrition security., Insecurity is causing spikes in psychosocial stress, Escalating violence affects women’s health and caregiving capacity. Moreover, children’s mental health and wellbeing is a major concern, as children have now been out of school for one year and are surrounded by an increasingly insecure context., A young mother in Yangon’s industrial zone said, “I feel depressed due to shortage of money. Adults are scared and my baby cries all the time because of the noise at night.”, Coordinated nutrition response is required for peri-urban Yangon, To prevent the sharp increase in hunger and malnutrition, the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) is engaging with partners to scope out immediate needs and respond in close coordination with the Access to Health Fund and the Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Programme Facility (HARP-F). Partners are mobilising to support a series of social protection interventions such as in-kind transfers, vouchers and/or cash transfers, nutrition counseling, breastfeeding support and treatment of severe acute malnutrition in the absence of functional public services. Response will also focus on ensuring widespread access to safe water and sanitation services and facilities to safeguard health and nutrition. Wherever possible, Social Behaviour Change Communication will continue to support the adoption of positive nutrition, health and hygiene behaviours. This will be combined with legal counseling, psychosocial support and child protection interventions, such as counseling services to women, children, youth and others who have been exposed to physical or emotional trauma. Where available, shelter accomodation will also be offered to the most vulnerable., [1] WFP. (2019).

The humanitarian situation in Myanmar has deteriorated starkly since the 1 February coup, with food insecurity and conflict-related displacement on the rise. The impact on the public health system is of grave concern, particularly given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic., “The fallout of the coup threatens to spark a wider regional crisis with thousands of people already fleeing across international borders in search of safety. CARE implores neighbouring countries to grant refuge to those escaping violence and refrain from pushing back people in need of protection., “The pre-monsoon cyclone season, which has just started in Myanmar, threatens to exacerbate the already desperate humanitarian situation. We know that women, girls and other vulnerable groups are often disproportionately affected during emergencies. CARE and other aid agencies must be granted access to any affected communities to avert a complete humanitarian catastrophe., “ASEAN member states must work together, with other countries in the region and the international community, to find a durable and peaceful solution to this crisis.

The National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) and the Palau Red Cross Society are currently conducting assessments., Over the weekend, Typhoon Surigae passed near the eastern seaboard of the Philippines and rapidly intensified from Category 2 to Category 5 in less than 36 hours. Local officials preemptively evacuated about 68,400 residents in the provinces of Catanduanes and Albay, both of which were heavily affected by Super Typhoon Goni in October 2020. Typhoon Surigae was last estimated at 475 km east of Infanta, Quezon with maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h and gustiness of up to 215 km/h. Surigae is not expected to make landfall as it continues to move northward, but strong winds and heavy rainfall over Eastern Visayas and Bicol regions are forecast until 20 April. Local governments have pre-positioned relief packs and are assisting the displaced residents. Over the past few days, OCHA liaised with anticipatory action partners for the possible activation of early response activities.¹, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, On 13 April, a landslide in the Waiya Ausa community in Lumusa local-level-government, Mul Baiyer Lumusa district in the Western Highlands province resulted in three deaths, three people injured, a number of destroyed homes and displacement of about 30 people (six families), according to the Baptist Union of PNG. The displaced families are currently hosted by relatives. The affected community is in need of temporary shelter materials, blankets, sleeping mats, clothing, water containers and kitchen sets. Hagen General Hospital is currently only providing limited services due to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers. Heavy rain has caused floods and landslides in several provinces over the last few weeks.², MYANMAR, Armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) continued and intensified in several townships in Kachin State resulting in civilian casualties and internal displacement. On 17 April, one man was injured by artillery shelling during intense fighting in Hpakant Township. Between 12 and 15 April, about 440 people were newly displaced, three civilians were reportedly killed, and a number of people were injured due to clashes in Momauk Township. The exact number of civilian casualties could not be confirmed due to access challenges. Since 1 February, almost 5,000 people have been displaced due to the resurgence of armed confrontations between the MAF and the KIA, of which 4,000 people remain displaced across several townships in Kachin as of 19 April. Humanitarian partners and local communities continue to respond to the needs of newly displaced people, and the needs of about 95,500 people who have been hosted in displacement camps since 2011.³, PAKISTAN, Several districts in the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh experience drought conditions which have resulted in increased food insecurity. Between October 2020 and March 2021, the impact of La Niña caused below normal rainfall in drought prone areas of Balochistan (-63.3 per cent rainfall) and Sindh (-77.3 per cent). According to the National Drought Monitoring Centre (NDMC), moderate drought conditions are prevailing across 18 districts in the two provinces. An estimated 1.8 million people are expected to experience acute food insecurity and 530,000 people emergency levels of food insecurity from March to June 2021 in 12 of the 18 drought-affected districts, according to the Food Security Sector. The Pakistan Meteorological Department warns that drought conditions may continue and worsen with adverse effects on agriculture and livestock. Food sector partners are supporting the Government of Balochistan in conducting a joint assessment in the ten drought-affected districts.4",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asia-and-pacific-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-13-april-19-april-2021
UN chief highlights key role of Asian regional bloc in ending Myanmar crisis,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,19 Apr 2021,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres called on Monday for leaders in Asia to bolster efforts towards finding a peaceful solution to the bloody crisis in Myanmar, sparked by the military coup in February., Speaking during a Security Council meeting on cooperation between the UN and regional and sub-regional organizations, he highlighted the relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), underlining the bloc's important role in diplomacy, conflict prevention and peacebuilding., Crucial role in urgent crisis, ""Today, ASEAN's role is more crucial than ever as the region faces an urgent crisis in Myanmar"", Mr. Guterres said.

"Myanmar Crisis: Stand with the people and protect them, urges UN rights expert",News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,19 Apr 2021,"The international community has a responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar, under attack from their own military, the UN independent human rights expert on the country argues, in the second part of our in-depth interview, calling also for refuge to be given to those who have fled for their lives to neighbouring countries., Over 700 people are reported to have been killed in the crackdown on peaceful protesters by security forces since the military takeover on 1 February. There are also reports that several hundred people have fled areas hit hard by violence, including many who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries., Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, highlights the need for neighbouring countries to protect and care for those who arrive on their borders., “The responsibility to protect means preparing for the refugee crisis, that if things continue the way they are, will be inevitable…we need to be sure that the bordering countries respect people’s fundamental right to enter their country those who are literally running for their lives from this brutality.”, “And I think the international community needs to support those countries in their care of the refugees. This is all part of the responsibility to protect approach”, he added., In part two of this extensive UN News interview, the Special Rapporteur addresses the responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar from violence, and his hopes for the country’s future., You can read part one, here., The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity., **UN News: There have been a lot of calls by the people of Myanmar for the responsibility to protect, what is your opinion regarding these calls … is R2P a possibility that should be explored under the current circumstances? Or is it too drastic or unrealistic? **, **Special Rapporteur: **No, I think It is very reasonable. First of all, responsibility to protect is very clear that governments, nations themselves have the responsibility to protect their people., But then it goes on and recognizes that sometimes those nations cannot always act to protect their people. Then there are instances in which countries will not act to protect their people. And in this instance, here is a country that is actually attacking its people., So, according to the responsibility to protect, the international community, therefore, has a responsibility to do what it can to protect the lives of innocent people in countries that are unable or unwilling to do so, or are in fact attacking them., I think that is definitely appropriate, this is exactly the situation in which we do have a responsibility to protect. And Chapter VII [of the UN Charter, by which the Council can use force]; using this is one of the reasons that the Security Council exists, to engage in just this kind of emergency., So, the question becomes, what to do, how to act, what is the best way to act? Some have the belief – it is an erroneous belief – that responsibility to protect or R2P means military engagement. It is not what it means. Military engagement is an option, but it is not what R2P is., R2P means going in to protect, in the best way possible. We need to look at options within certain parameters. Options that have the most potent impact on the junta, but also, that will have the minimum negative impact on the people. Protect the people of Myanmar., And I am afraid that any kind of military intervention would lead to a massive loss of life., Already the military has been making up stories about what it is facing. From the very outset, it said that it is using utmost restraint – its language – to contend with violent protests, but we saw nothing of the kind. We saw increasing violence and increasing brutality by the military. And we saw very peaceful, unarmed protesters., And that is also the reason why information has been cut off, the reason the junta is doing everything possible to cut off the flow of information is because it was finding that its appeals to the world to not believe our own but believe its propaganda – was not working., The junta, I think, are trained to deal with an enemy wielding weapons of war. That is their training. They have a significant arsenal of weapons, and a very large military force. But they are showing themselves unable to deal with an opposition wielding weapons of peace., With this incredible civil disobedience movement that we are seeing across the country, this powerful, creative, tenacious movement in which people are using a range of ingenious tactics, including civil disobedience, boycotts of businesses owned by the military., That is extremely powerful and it has generated great admiration and respect for the people [of Myanmar] from the world., So, it would be a mistake if, in fact, this became a full military confrontation. I think that the brutality unleashed would be even more horrific than what we are seeing now. It would be a significant increase in the loss of innocent lives, and that needs to be avoided., I understand, listen, if my wife, my child, my brother or sister were killed, murdered by this regime, I too, would want revenge. That would be my instinct. I totally understand where people are coming from, but it would be, in my view, a mistake, a very grave mistake, and I am hopeful that it will not come to that., UN News: So R2P yes, but military intervention no?, Special Rapporteur: Yes, that is correct., UN News: What other forms of R2P, then?, Special Rapporteur: What we are seeing right now, but in a much more focused, much more significant way. I would like to see there be a summit of countries who are willing to take action, in which they could work together to link up their actions, so that they are coherent, clear, and linked together. That would be extremely important., And the diplomatic initiatives, increasing the isolation of the junta, working more closely with the CRPH [the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, in effect, representatives and lawmakers exiled by the military], civil disobedience movement, others who are trying to truly protect and defend the country, rather than attacking it., There needs to be a significant increase in humanitarian aid, and it should not go through the junta certainly they will just steal it, but channelled through International NGOs and CSOs (Civil Society Organisations) on the ground., And R2P means preparing for the refugee crisis, which will be inevitable if things continue the way they are., We have already seen people heading to the border. I think we need to be sure that the neighbouring countries respect people’s fundamental right to enter their country, as they are literally running for their lives from this brutality. They need to protect them, care for them. And the international community needs to support those countries in caring for the refugees., That is all part of the responsibility to protect or R2P approach., UN News: What do you think will happen next for Myanmar, will the military regime take hold, will the people win the battle on the street, or will there be something in between?, Special Rapporteur: It is a very, very good question. It is a very good question., I must admit I am not good at predictions. My prediction was, when people ask me, would there be a coup, before the coup, I said, no, I said the generals wrote the constitution, they are not going to overthrow their own constitution, they have enormous control and power and wealth and so forth. So put what I am saying into that context., But the coup has failed. The junta has failed to wrestle control of the country. The thousands and thousands of civil servants are on strike. The economy has been devastated by the civil disobedience movement and strikes across the country. Opposition to the junta is deep and widespread. I have never seen anything like it, it is unified the country to a degree that I have never seen, people of all ages, all ethnicities, all social and economic groups, united in opposition., Then the leadership – the young people that are in the front lines of this movement have shown incredible, courage, tenacity and creativity, with their various approaches, in their efforts to save the country., So I think that the opposition will prevail. I predict it is going to be extremely challenging. I am afraid that there are going to be many dark days before there is light. But the military junta has no respect or credibility within the country., All the junta have, are the guns, that is all they have. And I think people recognize them as a criminal gang, a criminal enterprise that is robbing, murdering and terrorizing the people, hoping that this escalation of terror and murder will somehow subjugate the people eventually. But it is having just the opposite effect. It is making people even more resolved to not let this stand., So the important thing, I think, in terms of looking forward, is to do everything we can, working, supporting the people inside the country, the true patriots of Myanmar who are trying to defend the country, with the international community to support them in every way that we can and to stand with them., For, number one, stopping the violence and the killing. And number two, release the prisoners, including the hostages that were taken, elected leaders of the country, that they be released, and then, to stand down from this illegal act., And let me just say this, I am in awe at the people of Myanmar, the courage that they have displayed, and the resolve they have displayed, so I believe that they will prevail, it is going to be many dark days between now and when this is resolved., UN News: So you still have faith., Special Rapporteur: I do. I do. I do.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-crisis-stand-people-and-protect-them-urges-un-rights-expert
"Interview: Myanmar military increasing efforts to keep truth from getting out, UN expert says",News and Press Release,UN News,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Apr 2021,"The crackdown on journalists, cutting off the Internet and disrupting the flow of information across Myanmar, is “not working”, and the world is not buying the military leadership’s “propaganda” that it is exercising restraint against protesters, the UN independent human rights expert on the country has said, in an in-depth interview with UN News., Over 700 people are reported to have been killed in the brutal response by the security forces since the military overthrew the democratically elected Government on 1 February. Thousands more have been injured – many of them seriously, and over 3,000 people are in detention., That includes at least 71 journalists, more than half of whom are still detained, according to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) – UN’s media workers’ safety watchdog – which added that some two dozen people have been charged for “allegedly spreading fake news”., Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, told UN News in his extensive interview, that the military junta has been making “significant efforts, which have been increasing, to keep the truth inside the country, to not allow the world to see what is going on”., “Already the military has been making up stories about what it is facing. From the very outset, it said that it is using ‘utmost restraint’ – its language – to contend with ‘violent protests’, [but] we saw nothing of the kind.”, “We saw increasing violence and increasing brutality by the military. And we saw very peaceful, unarmed protesters … despite their efforts to block it, the truth is getting out, and it is a gruesome truth”, Mr. Andrews added., In the first of this two-part interview with the Special Rapporteur, UN News asked the rights expert how he characterized the current international response to the crisis in Myanmar and what countries can do to stop the bloodshed., We will be publishing part two over the weekend, in which he addresses the responsibility to protect citizens from violence, and his hopes for the country’s future., The interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity., UN News: It must be increasingly difficult to get information from Myanmar, but as far as you know, what is the situation on the ground?, Special Rapporteur: You are right. There have been great efforts by the junta to block information from getting out to the world. Not only the blocking of Internet but also now the interruption of broadband wireless service, and there have been at least 64 journalists, that I know of, who have been arrested and detained., So there has been a significant effort, which has been increasing, to keep truth inside the country and not allow the world to see what is happening., Nonetheless, we know that conditions are worsening in Myanmar. We know that at least 700 people are confirmed dead, at least 3,000 people arbitrarily detained, and at least 46 children killed., We know that the intensity of the brutality has been increasing and the tactics are increasingly gruesome, where you have weapons of war being unleashed on non-violent, unarmed people., Among the disturbing things we are tracking, is that not only has the junta directed their forces to shoot point blank at protesters, in fact, shooting for the head, they actually warned on State television that young people could be shot in the head., We know that [the soldiers] have been directed to unleash a reign of terror in neighbourhoods in Myanmar, to go through neighbourhoods, destroy property, arrest people, or shoot them at random, shoot into people's homes. We know that some of the children who have been killed were killed because of these terror tactics that have been used., So, things are bad and they are getting worse. The tactics that the junta is deploying have become increasingly brutal and ruthless. Despite their efforts to block it, the truth is getting out, and it's a gruesome truth., **UN News: How would you characterize the current state of the international response? **, Special Rapporteur: There is strong concern among the international community. I know that many people around the world, as they hear this news, are horrified at what is going on in Myanmar., We have seen the UN Security Council meet on three occasions and voice concerns. We know that the Human Rights Council had a special session, just on this crisis, which I addressed. The General Assembly met for a briefing on the situation. There has been engagement by the international community formally through the United Nations in various aspects., We also know that some nations have been taking action, not just expressing concern, actually taking action. And it has come in the form of sanctions. There are dozens of different forms of sanctions and arms embargo by countries around the world. Increasing numbers of countries have established sanctions, increasing levels of sanctions. And we know that more countries are considering actions, primarily through sanctions., People are horrified. But I believe that the action that has been taken so far has been inadequate, it has not met the challenge the world is facing in Myanmar, seeing the horror that continues every day., The international community can and should do more to respond., **UN News: Can you tell us about some of these sanctions? The military regime in Myanmar, are they gaining any ground in terms of recognition or acceptance? **, Special Rapporteur: No, that is for sure. I think that the brutality of this military has horrified everybody., It is hard to even consider this as a military. I used to serve on the Armed Services Committee in the United States Congress, and our responsibility was the military. A military is responsible for securing and defending a country and its people. That is their job., The Myanmar military is doing exactly the opposite. It is attacking the people, not defending them. It is hard to even call it a military, it is more of a criminal enterprise, that illegally abducted the leaders of a country, committed a coup -- an illegal coup, violated the very constitution that it drafted, and has been brutalizing the people ever since., The world has shown various degrees of responses, various degrees of expressions of concern. I know that China has expressed concern about developments inside the country. It has called for the release of all political prisoners, for example. It has made it clear that what is going on is not what China wants at all. There have been expressions of concern all over the region., Certainly the junta has been losing ground. With every act of brutality, it continues to lose ground, become increasingly illegitimate in the eyes of the world., There are a number sanctions. The European Union just passed a regimen of sanctions, they increased their level of sanctions. The US increased their sanctions on three different occasions., And sanctions come in various forms, they can be against individuals who are responsible for these atrocities, but the trend now is to include not just targeted individuals, but the businesses and the business interests, including the conglomerates of the junta, and so those sanctions are increasing., The United Kingdom has also increased its sanctions. And I know a number of countries are actively considering increasing sanctions., UN News: The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar said that the deputy commander of Myanmar's military told her directly that the military is not afraid of sanctions, that they have been sanctioned before and they are not afraid of isolation either. So what is left for the international community to do that will actually make a difference on the ground?, Special Rapporteur: Well, we can start by not believing them. The junta has always said that sanctions do not work. They have always said that they are not afraid of international isolation. And they probably will always say that. So, there is nothing new there., But we know that is not true., We know that the reforms -- which were overthrown in the coup -- did not come as a result of the military leaders waking up one day and saying, jeez, we have been making a big mistake, maybe we should be respecting human rights and giving people an opportunity to hold leaders accountable., No, that's not how it happened, [the reforms] happened precisely because of sanctions and we know that their leaders -- for a fact -- appealed to the world, to lift sanctions., We know it made a difference. We know that it had an impact on them and that reform happened following sanctions. The junta will always say that sanctions make no difference, and it should not be a surprise to anyone., So I think what is left for the international community is, first of all, to engage with one another. There needs to be continued diplomatic engagement to discuss the full array of options that are possible to try to achieve as unified a response as we possibly can. To understand that not all countries are going to want to act in the same way or follow the same path, even though every country that I know have grave concerns over what is going on in Myanmar., For those countries who believe that it is important to act in light of the horror in Myanmar, I believe they need to consider not only sanctions, but coordinated sanctions. The many and varied sanctions regimes should be united, that these countries should come together, discuss their options, and then to the extent that's possible, link up their sanctions regimes so that they will have a collective impact, that they will have the strongest possible impact working together., Same with (the) arms embargo, include dual use technologies, surveillance and other types of technology to do whatever is possible to stop the revenue flow, stop what is empowering the military's brutality, take away the means by which they can continue its reign of terror, through sanctions, through arms embargo, and to do this in a coordinated way., Now, ideally, the Security Council could do this. It could also refer those who are responsible for this atrocity to the International Criminal Court (ICC). I'm told that is not going to happen, people say that there is not a unified view of that in the Security Council, and that any measure of action like this would be vetoed., Maybe that is true but I do not know that it is true. Why? Because it has not been tried., No resolution has been put before the Security Council that has been discussed, debated, considered and voted. It has not happened. So an option would be for that to happen. And if there are nations who are opposed to that kind of action, for whatever reason, they can vote against it or veto it and explain why, lay their case out to the world., That is the job of the Security Council, to engage when there is a crisis that affects, in this case, not only the country, but also the region. This is a humanitarian crisis that is going to explode into the region. A great deal is at stake here. This is precisely why the Security Council was formed. So it seems to be reasonable that it would debate this and consider action., **UN News: A number of countries have said they do not support unilateral sanctions, and that such measures would only provoke the military into more violence and make things worse, would you like to make a comment? **, Special Rapporteur: Multilateral sanctions are more preferable to unilateral sanctions, so I'm urging countries that have sanctions to work together., The argument that sanctions would make things worse. First of all, as I mentioned, we know, from history, that sanctions have modified the behaviour of military leaders in Myanmar for the better. They have had a positive impact., We also know that expressions of concern and limited actions in the form of different sanctions or uncoordinated sanctions, have been followed by increasing violence and brutality by the regime., I think there is a very strong argument to be made, that employing strategies that we know have worked in the past, could work in the present. We know that the limited actions that has been taken by the world has not led to a reduction in the violence and the brutality against the people of Myanmar, So in my view, there is a strong argument for countries to consider coordinated sanctions regimes, strong and meaningful action, to try what we know has worked in the past, to try it in a more focused, coordinated way, through sanctions and through arms embargo., I believe that it is worth trying, it is worth making this attempt, because we know that things are bad and getting worse. So why not try something that we know that there is evidence of success in the past., Why not try that now? That's what I'm urging countries to consider.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/interview-myanmar-military-increasing-efforts-keep-truth-getting-out-un-expert-says
EU allocates an additional €9 million to support the most vulnerable in Myanmar following the coup d'état,News and Press Release,ECHO,"Contributions

Health
Protection and Human Rights",16 Apr 2021,"Today, the EU has stepped up its response to assist those in need in Myanmar in the context of the recent military coup, with the allocation of an additional €9 million in emergency humanitarian aid to support the most vulnerable., The critical reinforcement of the EU's response comes on top of a funding package of €11.5 million provided at the start of 2021, to support key humanitarian and disaster preparedness needs in the country, bringing EU humanitarian assistance in Myanmar to a total of €20.5 million in 2021 so far., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: ""The violent military junta that has overthrown the legitimate government in Myanmar has been merciless in killing innocent civilians, in egregious violations of International Humanitarian Law that exacerbates the already dire humanitarian crisis faced by displaced and conflict-affected populations. The EU condemns the despicable acts of violence by the coup d'état and meanwhile reaffirms its will to continue providing strong humanitarian support through its humanitarian partners directly to the most vulnerable population, who also face recurrent natural hazards that further increase their needs. At this crucial and pressing time, the EU is showing up for the people of Myanmar by significantly stepping up its support in humanitarian assistance.”, The funding will be used to respond to urgent humanitarian needs in the sectors of emergency health support, protection, food security, and multi-sector emergency assistance. Through this additional allocation, the EU is stepping up its response capacities in the conflict areas in which it is active, and also in urban settings, where indiscriminate violence has been used by the Myanmar security forces., The additional funding will also provide humanitarian assistance to those fleeing fighting between Ethnic Armed Groups and the Myanmar Armed Forces, with funds allocated to address the growing regional implications of the crisis, including in Thailand., All EU humanitarian funding is provided in line with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and is channelled directly through NGOs, UN Agencies, and the Red Cross. The EU does not provide any humanitarian aid funding to the illegitimate military authorities., Background, Conflict in Myanmar is marred by widespread violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, resulting in substantial humanitarian needs. More than 336,000 people in Myanmar have been internally displaced, a large majority of whom are in situations of protracted displacement in Rakhine, Kachin, Kayin and Shan states, with limited access to basic services., An estimated 600,000 Rohingya people remain in Rakhine State, of whom around 126,000 are effectively confined to camps or camp-like settings that were established in 2012, and so still cannot move freely. Restricted humanitarian access to several areas hampers the ability of international aid organisations to provide crucial assistance to people in need. Recurrent natural hazards also increase the vulnerability of people living in disaster-prone areas., Since 1994, the EU has provided €287 million in humanitarian aid to Myanmar, with €19 million allocated in 2020. The EU works with trusted and independent humanitarian partners to address the protection, food, nutrition and health needs of the most vulnerable people, particularly in Rakhine, Chin, Kachin and Shan states., Following the violence in August 2017, the EU has stepped up its humanitarian assistance in the form of food, nutritional care, healthcare, water and sanitation, coordination, and protection, including mine education., Humanitarian needs are increasing as a result of the 1 February 2021 coup d'état, as security forces use indiscriminate violence against civilians and fighting increases between Ethnic Armed Groups and the Myanmar Armed Forces. The EU will closely monitor the humanitarian situation in Myanmar, in light of the recent developments, to step up the humanitarian response further, if needed., For More Information, Myanmar Factsheet, Press contact, Balazs UJVARI Phone +32 2 295 45 78 Mail balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu, Gesine KNOLLE Phone +32 2 295 43 23 Mail gesine.knolle@ec.europa.eu",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/eu-allocates-additional-9-million-support-most-vulnerable-myanmar-following-coup-d
"Atrocity Alert No. 248: Myanmar (Burma), Ethiopia and Syria",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,14 Apr 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WARNS MYANMAR COULD BECOME THE NEXT SYRIA, On Friday, 9 April, at least 82 civilians were killed by Myanmar’s security forces in the city of Bago, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) northeast of Yangon. During their assault on anti-coup protesters in the city, the security forces used assault rifles, heavy machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and mortar fire. There were also reports that medical personnel were prevented from tending to the wounded., That same day Myanmar state television reported that 23 people, including captured protesters, had been sentenced to death following closed trials in a military court. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, at least 715 people have been killed by the security forces since 1 February and more than 3,070 are currently detained for resisting the military coup., On 13 April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, issued a chilling warning regarding the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, cautioning that “there are clear echoes of Syria in 2011. There too, we saw peaceful protests met with unnecessary and clearly disproportionate force… I fear the situation in Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict. States must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated.” Bachelet noted that “the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at the time [Navi Pillay] warned in 2011 that the failure of the international community to respond with united resolve could be disastrous for Syria and beyond. The past ten years have shown just how horrific the consequences have been for millions of civilians.”, As the massacre was unfolding in Bago, the UN Security Council (UNSC) held an informal “Arria formula” meeting on Myanmar. One of the briefers, Daw Zin Mar Aung, from the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, as well as Myanmar’s Ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, called on the Council to uphold its responsibility to protect and take decisive action in response to the violence in Myanmar. The UNSC has issued three statements since the military seized power on 1 February, but is yet to impose any measures in response to atrocities perpetrated by the junta., The UN Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, arrived in Thailand on 9 April for a regional visit. Special Envoy Burgener requested face-to-face meetings with Myanmar’s military officials but was refused entry to the country., Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “the time for the UN Security Council, ASEAN and other states to move from statements to action is long overdue. Myanmar needs a global arms embargo, internationally binding sanctions on senior military officials and businesses, and the situation should be referred to the International Criminal Court. Excuses and inaction in the face of these ongoing atrocities is unconscionable and inexcusable.”, HUNDREDS KILLED IN SURGE OF INTER-COMMUNAL VIOLENCE ACROSS ETHIOPIA, Ethnic violence and inter-communal conflict have sharply increased in Ethiopia, with more than 600 people killed in the Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s regions since September last year. Endale Haile, Ethiopia’s chief ombudsman, has publicly claimed that 300 people were also killed in the Amhara region over several days during March when Oromo and Amhara communities clashed in North Shewa and the Oromo Special Zone., Most of the victims of the March violence in the Amhara region were killed by gunfire, but some were attacked with machetes, sticks and stones. Ombudsman Endale reported that over 1,500 homes were also burned and destroyed. The violence reportedly began after an ethnic Oromo imam was killed outside a mosque in the Oromo Special Zone on 19 March. Ombudsman Endale lamented that the government’s response to this violence had been too slow and stated that “the government is responsible to protect and secure civilians.”, At least 100 civilians were also killed in the areas of Haruk and Gewane between Ethiopia’s Afar and Somali regions over 2-6 April. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated that special forces from Ethiopia’s eastern Somali region attacked the areas, which are formally part of Afar. During the violence, Somali regional forces and militias reportedly indiscriminately fired on Afar pastoralists and killed children and women. Ethnic tensions and recurring conflict between forces from the Afar and Somali regions partly originates from a 2014 redrawing of regional borders that resulted in the transfer of three towns to Afar., According to the Ethiopian government, an estimated 1.7 million people also remain displaced in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, where there have been widespread reports of war crimes and ethnic cleansing since armed hostilities broke out between the regional authorities and the federal government last November. Ethiopia is due to hold general elections on 5 June, but given the rise of ethnic conflict, regional disputes and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, there are growing fears for the safety and security of voters., OPCW CONFIRMS SYRIAN AIR FORCE DROPPED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON CIVILIANS, On 12 April 2021 the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) released its second report on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The report attributes responsibility to government forces for the use of chlorine gas on the night of 4 February 2018 in the city of Saraqib. According to the IIT, a military helicopter under the control of the “Tiger Forces” of the Syrian Arab Air Force dropped at least one cylinder containing chlorine on eastern Saraqib. The IIT confirmed that twelve individuals suffered symptoms of chemical poisoning as a consequence of the attack., The use of chemical weapons, including chlorine gas, is illegal under international law and constitutes a war crime. A spokesperson for UN Secretary General António Guterres said that he had received the IIT report and that the “Secretary-General strongly condemns the use of chemical weapons and reiterates his position that the use of chemical weapons anywhere, by anyone, and under any circumstances, is intolerable, and impunity for their use is equally unacceptable.”, The OPCW has documented the illegal use of chemical weapons in Syria for over seven years. In 2014 the OPCW created a Fact-Finding Mission, which confirmed that chlorine and mustard gas had been used against civilian populations. These findings supported the work of the UN Security Council-mandated OPCW-Joint Investigative Mechanism (OPCW-JIM), which determined that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on numerous occasions. In October and November 2017 Russia vetoed three Security Council resolutions aimed at renewing the mandate of the OPCW-JIM., The IIT focuses on incidents for which the OPCW-JIM did not reach a final conclusion and is mandated to identify specific perpetrators. The IIT’s first report, released on 8 April 2020, found that the Syrian Arab Air Force used chemical weapons – including chlorine and sarin – in three separate incidents in March 2017 in the town of Ltamenah., The prohibition of chemical weapons is one of the oldest and universally respected norms of the international community, codified by the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Syria became a signatory in 2013. The international community must hold those who have used chemical weapons in Syria accountable under international law, regardless of their position or affiliation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-248-myanmar-burma-ethiopia-and-syria
Time for a coordinated ASEAN–UN response to Myanmar’s coup,News and Press Release,Nanyang Technological Univ.,Protection and Human Rights,14 Apr 2021,"Author: Alistair DB Cook, RSIS, The international community needs new ways of working together to respond to the violence deployed against protesters in Myanmar, Since the military seized power on 1 February 2021, over 600 people have been killed. As of 10 April, over 2800 are in detention, have outstanding charges or are evading arrest. Communities across the country continue to protest, despite increasingly lethal violence., The international community continues to make statements denouncing the use of violence against protestors. They encourage regional efforts to support peaceful resolution and a return to the democratic transition. But protesters don’t want a return to the previous situation — they are calling for fundamental political change., The Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) has entrenched its position. More lethal force and violence is expected. It is time for ASEAN and the UN to collaborate on developing a joint mechanism to coordinate regional and international diplomatic efforts, and provide humanitarian assistance to respond to the deteriorating situation., ASEAN is constrained by its consensus-based approach to decision-making and limited investment in regional institutional architecture. The divergence of opinion over the situation in Myanmar between member states is well documented. This limits ASEAN from acting collectively., But treating ASEAN as an enforcement mechanism in the ways that some in the international community have suggested misses the point. ASEAN has evolved as a forum for dialogue at the regional level. Its successes have been in initiating and contributing to the sustainable development of its member states, while engaging extra-regional players., The UN has several constraints working in Southeast Asia, the most prominent being that many countries in the region prefer a localised approach to peace and security. The UN has strengthened its position in the region by partnering with ASEAN in several key areas, notably in disaster management and emergency response. A greater focus on these successes is needed to develop an ASEAN–UN partnership., A joint mechanism would build on past successes. There have been notable developments since the signing of the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response in 2008, suggesting that a more coordinated approach is possible between global and regional organisations. In October 2016, the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the ASEAN Secretary-General met alongside the UN General Assembly and the annual ASEAN–UN Secretariat-to-Secretariat Dialogue. They agreed to capture and institutionalise practical, experience-based arrangements., This notably took shape in the response to the 2018 Sulawesi Earthquake in Indonesia. The Indonesian government mandated that the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre) be the platform through which international partners and the private sector coordinate their humanitarian efforts. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs worked in the AHA Emergency Operations Centre to facilitate coordination between ASEAN and the UN. The experience was commended and pointed to as a new way of working between the two entities., There remains a lack of significant investment in regional institutions, limiting both their mandate and their capacity. The ASEAN Charter remains the lynchpin for upholding the ASEAN community and provides the foundation for action. But it lacks triggers to initiate substantive responses and relies on the convening of an ASEAN Leaders Summit to address member states that fall foul of their commitments. And the ASEAN Secretariat only has a few hundred employees — limiting its ability to implement its broad-based mandate effectively., Forging an ASEAN–UN partnership could help coordinate diplomatic efforts and deliver humanitarian assistance to people in Myanmar. It could draw on the expertise of the 6600 ASEAN citizens currently staffing the United Nations system to create a joint mechanism anchored in the ‘ASEAN way’ that combines the trust of ASEAN with the capacity of the United Nations., In response to the devastating impact of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, ASEAN established the ASEAN Humanitarian Taskforce. The taskforce was made up of the ASEAN member states chaired by the ASEAN Secretary-General and an advisory group made up of Myanmar’s neighbouring countries, the UN, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. It facilitated engagement between parties and provided a model for an ASEAN–UN mechanism., A partnership between ASEAN and the United Nations will provide a more coordinated international response to the increasingly fraught situation in Myanmar. If ASEAN leadership fails, it will fall upon the wider international community and individual ASEAN members — undermining the organisation’s regional centrality., A path that does not engage ASEAN faces numerous hurdles and diverging interests. It is time to move beyond broad commitments to region-led approaches. Actors must find innovative ways of collaborating if regional and international efforts are to support people in Myanmar., Alistair DB Cook is Coordinator of the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Programme and Senior Fellow at the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/time-coordinated-asean-un-response-myanmar-s-coup

Myanmar’s Neighbors Must Protect Those Seeking Refuge,News and Press Release,RI,Protection and Human Rights,13 Apr 2021,"Please see below statement from Refugees International President Eric Schwartz:, “Refugees International is deeply concerned about the failure of Myanmar’s neighbors to protect those seeking refuge from the Myanmar military’s February 2021 coup and ongoing attacks on civilians., As the Myanmar displacement crisis grows, governments in South and Southeast Asia must refrain from forced returns and work with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) to ensure access and assistance to those seeking asylum., The Myanmar military’s horrific actions have led to the deaths of more than 700 civilians and the displacement of tens of thousands in recent weeks. Many of those displaced remain within the country, but thousands have fled into Thailand and hundreds into India. We are alarmed by reports that Thai authorities have forced some 2,000 refugees back into Karen State in Myanmar and that India has detained more than 150 Rohingya refugees who may be forced back into Myanmar as well. In February, Malaysia returned at least 1,000 people from Myanmar despite concerns expressed by UNHCR. Such actions are in violation of the international principle of non-refoulement., Officials in Bangladesh, which is hosting nearly 900,000 Rohingya refugees, continue to push for repatriation despite the fact that those who led the genocidal campaign against the Rohingya are now in charge. Meanwhile, conditions in the Rohingya camps are deteriorating as Bangladesh continues to pursue negative measures including restriction of livelihoods and education opportunities and construction of barbed wire fencing around the camps. Bangladesh has also moved nearly 20,000 refugees to an isolated island despite serious questions about the safety, feasibility, and voluntariness of such moves., Some countries in the region have also continued to push back boats of asylum seekers, refusing them safe disembarkation. A boat that left Bangladesh carrying more than 80 Rohingya refugees in February has been stranded for weeks. The Indian navy and coast guard have provided assistance, but Indian officials refuse to allow the boat to reach shore., China, meanwhile, has closed its border with Myanmar, citing concerns with the spread of COVID-19. While such concerns justify carefully managed public health measures, they do not justify forcing people back into dangerous situations. Steps can be taken for testing, quarantining, and the provision of health assistance., The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is a member, is being directly impacted and must play a greater role in pressuring the Myanmar junta and assisting those displaced. ASEAN members should also adhere to previous stated commitments toward a framework for search-and-rescue and safe disembarkation of asylum seekers found at sea., The Myanmar military’s actions are at the center of this growing crisis and increased regional and international coordination will be required to reverse the dangerous path it has taken. In the meantime, countries must hold to their international obligations to assist those who seek refuge.”, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Refugees International Director of Communications Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org or +1 202 540 7029.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-s-neighbors-must-protect-those-seeking-refuge

In Hsipaw Township, around 900 people were displaced following clashes between the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). In Lashio Township, an additional 60 people were displaced by clashes between the same EAOs. Local communities and operational partners have been providing immediate humanitarian assistance to the newly displaced people, including food and non-food items as well as health care, mine risk awareness and child and gender-based violence protection services. These new displacements are in addition to about 4,100 people who remain displaced in Namtu and Kyaukme Townships since early January. A total of 10,600 people have been internally displaced in northern Shan since the start of the year, of which about 6,000 people have been displaced since February. The number of people displaced since the start of 2021 is nearly double the total for all of 2020. Northern Shan continues to host around 9,800 IDPs in protracted camps established since 2011.¹, INDONESIA, On 10 April, a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of East Java Province.

As the situation remains volatile, district and provincial authorities were not yet able to establish exact figures. Members of the Agaribe tribe, primarily women, children and elderly, have taken refuge in informal camps between Yonki and Kainantu, while men are camping along the border of their land.
The Kainantu District Hospital has temporarily closed. District and provincial authorities remain focused on stabilizing the situation.

On 8 April, the Government of Timor-Leste declared a state of calamity in Dili for a period of 30 days and requested for international assistance to the flood response. In support of Government efforts, UN agencies and humanitarian partners continue to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the lifesaving needs of the affected people in Dili municipality and other parts of the country.

"Intensifying widespread, systematic slaughter by Myanmar military must be halted – Bachelet [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,13 Apr 2021,"GENEVA (13 April 2021) -- UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday urged States to take immediate, decisive and impactful measures to push Myanmar's military leadership into halting its campaign of repression and slaughter of its people., ""We have witnessed yet another weekend of coordinated bloodshed in many parts of the country, including the reported mass killing of at least 82 people in Bago between Friday and Saturday. The military seems intent on intensifying its pitiless policy of violence against the people of Myanmar, using military-grade and indiscriminate weaponry,"" Bachelet said., ""There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011. There too, we saw peaceful protests met with unnecessary and clearly disproportionate force. The State's brutal, persistent repression of its own people led to some individuals taking up arms, followed by a downward and rapidly expanding spiral of violence all across the country. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at the time warned in 2011 that the failure of the international community to respond with united resolve could be disastrous for Syria and beyond. The past ten years have shown just how horrific the consequences have been for millions of civilians."", ""I fear the situation in Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict. States must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated."", Over the weekend, credible reports indicate that Tatmadaw forces opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades, fragmentation grenades and mortar fire in Bago in the south of the country. Security forces also reportedly prevented medical personnel from helping the wounded, as well as charging relatives a ""fine"" of roughly USD 90 to claim the bodies of those who were killed. Some individuals are also now resorting to the use of makeshift or primitive weapons in self-defence., Clashes between the military and ethnic armed groups have also intensified in several locations in Kachin, Shan and Kayin states, where the military have been employingairstrikes that have killed and displaced civilians., As arrests continue, with at least 3,080 people currently detained, there are reports that 23 people have been sentenced to death following secret trials -- including four protesters and 19 others who were accused of political and criminal offences., The mass arrests have forced hundreds of people to go into hiding, and reports suggest that many journalists, civil society activists, celebrities and other public figures are being sought, many simply because of the dissent they have been expressing on-line. Wireless broadband and mobile data services were cut indefinitely on 2 April, leaving the vast majority of people without access to vital sources of information and communication., Meanwhile, the country's economy, education and health infrastructure have been brought to the brink of collapse, leaving millions of Myanmar people without livelihood, basic services and, increasingly, food security. Thousands of internal migrants have left urban centres for their home communities -- which once relied on their income. COVID-19 measures have effectively been brought to a standstill., The High Commissioner called on the Myanmar military and neighbouring States to facilitate humanitarian access to populations in need. She urged neighbouring States to give temporary protection to people fleeing the violence, and to refrain from returning people fleeing Myanmar at this time, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement., ""Statements of condemnation, and limited targeted sanctions, are clearly not enough. States with influence need to urgently apply concerted pressure on the military in Myanmar to halt the commission of grave human rights violations and possible crimes against humanity against the people,"" Bachelet said., The High Commissioner made particular reference to the report of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, which contains clear recommendations for impactful action in relation to the military.* Bachelet stressed the need to cut off the supply of arms and finances to the military leadership that aid its commission of serious human rights violations., ENDS, *https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary.aspx, For more information and media requests, please contact:, Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / rshamdasani@ohchr.org or

Myanmar violence ‘must cease immediately’: UN agencies,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,12 Apr 2021,"The United Nations Country Team in Myanmar reiterated its call for an end to violence against civilians, amid reports of dozens of deaths in the latest crackdown on protests against the military takeover., More than 80 people lost their lives on Friday as security forces reportedly used heavy weapons against protesters in the town of Bago, located about 90 kilometres (56 miles) northeast of the commercial hub Yangon, according to media reports., “[We are] following events in Bago with reports of heavy artillery being used against civilians and medical treatment being denied to those injured”, the UN Country Team (UNCT) said in a post on Twitter., “The violence must cease immediately”, it stressed., Hundreds killed, Hundreds of civilians, including at least 44 children, have been killed in the crackdown across Myanmar since the military coup on 1 February. Countless more have been seriously injured and more than 2,600 are in detention, including many held incommunicado or forcibly disappeared., There are also reports that several hundred people have fled areas hit hard by violence, including many who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries., UN agencies have also reported sharp increases in food and fuel prices in many parts of the country, on the back of supply chain and market disruptions.

The battle for democracy in Myanmar,Analysis,EU,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",11 Apr 2021,"11/04/2021 - HR/VP Blog – The world is horrified by the bloody military coup in Myanmar, with reports of more than 80 people killed in Bago last Friday. We are pursuing a robust diplomatic initiative in close coordination with like-minded partners. However, geopolitical competition in Myanmar makes it difficult to find common ground, to halt the violence and ensure a return to democracy., Democracy is increasingly challenged these days, but in few places in such a dramatic and brutal fashion as in Myanmar. In the early morning of 1 February, the clock on Myanmar's democratic transition was turned back many years with a 1970s-style military coup. The army claimed that the November 2020 elections, which the National League for Democracy (NLD) had won with a landslide, had somehow been 'fraudulent', without offering any evidence. It declared a state of emergency and put State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint under arrest, together with other democratic leaders., Civilian resistance to the coup has been so widespread, creative and courageous that, I believe, it caught the military by surprise. They resorted to the only means they know and have used so often in the past: violence and repression. So far, at least 550 unarmed protesters, including 46 children, have been killed. Over 2,800 persons have been detained. The world watches in horror, as the army uses violence against its own people., Yet, even in the face of such brutality, geopolitics divides the international community and hampers a coordinated response. Myanmar borders the two largest countries in the world by population: China and India. Its location makes it a strategic point for China's Belt and Road Initiative (offering deep-sea access to the Indian Ocean), but also to India's own corridor to the South China Sea. Other countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore also have strong economic interests in Myanmar. And Russia is the country's second supplier of weapons, after China., Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Russia and China are blocking the attempts of the UN Security Council, for example to impose an arms embargo. China is keen to protect its strategic interests in the country and has called the coup 'a major government reshuffle', while Russia insists that it is a purely 'domestic matter'. Last week, Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy defence minister, was the highest-ranking foreign official to attend Myanmar's Armed Forces Day parade when others including Asian countries had downscaled their level of representation., The situation is complicated by Myanmar's highly diverse and complex ethnic fabric: there are 135 recognised ethnicities within its borders and some, like the Rohingya, are not even recognised. Conflict between ethnic minorities and the central government has been going on since independence., Vast swathes of land are not controlled by the government but ruled by 'ethnic armed organisations' or militias, which in some cases number in the tens of thousands. For decades, the wrong answer to this high degree of ethnic diversity was a centralised, military dictatorship, which meant violence between the central army and the ethnic groups plus the suppression of democratic rights for all., After 2010, a gradual process of democratisation led to free elections in 2015, won by the NLD of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The democratic transition was accompanied in the same year by ethnic peace. After decades of armed conflict, a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement was signed in October 2015 between the government and the armed ethnic groups. This was a milestone and demonstrated the strong political will to address long-standing grievances through dialogue and co-operation rather than violence. The EU was invited to sign the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement as an international witness., Just like the introduction of democracy favoured ethnic peace, its abolishment now risks re-creating ethnic violence. For the ethnic organisations are increasingly siding with the protesters and resuming fighting against the military. It may spiral out of control: at the end of March, airstrikes launched by the military in Kayin State killed several civilians and displaced around 10,000 people. The crackdown is becoming more violent, as also the killings in Bago show., The EU's economic presence in Myanmar is limited, but we are becoming a major export market for garments thanks to the Everything But Arms preferences which offer duty free, quota free access to the EU market for developing countries. Myanmar exported €2.4 billion in 2020, with a decline of 20% over 2019 due to the pandemic. In terms of foreign direct investment, the EU has a rather limited footprint ($ 700 million in 2019), compared to China's $19 billion., Yet, while recognising we have limited direct leverage, the EU can and should try to play an active role. We cannot accept that a democratically-elected government is overthrown and replaced by military rule. Despite setbacks, Myanmar was a rare example of transition towards democracy, in a region where we increasingly see backtracking from democracy. The EU has also invested significant capital (financial and political) into this transition, with Electoral Observation missions, increased development assistance (€688 million between 2014-2020) and favourable trade preferences (EBA)., Then there is the regional dimension. In December 2020, we agreed on a Strategic Partnership with ASEAN, to reinforce our links with one of the most dynamic regions in the world. This also gives us the opportunity to engage in more depth with ASEAN on Myanmar., The ASEAN Charter(link is external) cites 'adhering to the principles of democracy, the rule of law and good governance, respect for and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms' as a basic precept in its preamble. At the same time, ASEAN is a consensus-based organisation that 'moves at a pace comfortable to all' which limits the degree to which it can play a major role in this type of conflict. However, as EU we have an interest in promoting regionally-led attempts to mediate and address the crisis and we should support all forces inside ASEAN that make this case as well., We could reinforce this diplomatic track by offering to increase our economic ties if Myanmar returns to the path of democracy: in addition to more trade, we could offer good quality investments that could help the country with a sustainable development path through state-of-the-art technologies and sustainable business principles. Myanmar needs a more diversified set of external investors so the type that European companies typically offer is valuable. The need for sustainability is crucial given that Myanmar is one of three countries in the world most at risk from the impact of climate change(link is external)., Our response to the coup has been swift and closely coordinated with our partners. As EU27, we issued a strong statement on 2 February, condemning the coup, calling for the immediate release of all prisoners and for the restoration of the democratically-elected authorities., The EU immediately put on hold all development assistance payments that were paid into the government's coffers. Activities benefiting the authorities such as police training, where the EU assists with adherence to high standards for civilian policing, were also frozen. On 22 March, the EU adopted a first round of sanctions against 11 key individuals responsible for the coup, including the Commander-in-Chief and his Deputy. We are now working on a second package on additional individuals and targeting companies owned by the military. We want to signal the junta that their actions bear consequences., In our action, we are driven by the principle of 'do no harm': we only hit those who are responsible for the coup and their business interests, avoiding negative impact on the wider population. This is why our sanctions only target military-owned companies, and include a 'humanitarian clause' allowing the delivery of aid. In fact, ECHO has already allocated €11.5 million in emergency aid, and is ready to do more, if needed., In parallel, we have been pursuing a robust diplomatic initiative, reaching out to all key stakeholders (ASEAN, China, Japan, India), in close coordination with our like-minded partners, notably the US and UK. We advocate a domestic solution, supported by the region and the wider international community. This should begin with de-escalation and the release of detainees., Sanctions in itself are not a policy. We need to create a shared diplomatic platform to kick-start a process of dialogue aimed at restoring democracy in Myanmar, in accordance with the clear will of its brave people., While our action is relentless, our expectations need to be realistic. Geopolitical competition in Myanmar will make it very difficult to find common ground, as we have witnessed again and again at the UN Security Council. The Myanmar military is used to international isolation and has a decade-long record of ignoring the needs and the will of the country's citizens., But we have a duty to try. First, to make sure that the will of Myanmar's people, as expressed at the November 2020 elections, is respected. But also to defend the country's experiment in democracy, which - notwithstanding its limitations -- made it an important example, as we are increasingly facing challenges to fundamental freedoms and democracy across the world.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/battle-democracy-myanmar

The Tatmadaw and its affiliated Border Guard Force (BGF) increased their presence on the ground and stepped up operations in areas controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU) without prior permission, leading to skirmishes with the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). KHRG also documented several instances of indiscriminate shelling by the Tatmadaw in December and January 2021, resulting in displacement, property damage and injuries., In Doo Tha Htoo District, fighting between the BGF and the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) broke out in early January 2021 in Yo Klah village tract. Local communities and villagers from nearby village tracts are now afraid that fighting might resume in their area. Therefore, they readopted pre-ceasefire strategies to protect themselves from armed actors and organised demonstrations to call on the Tatmadaw to withdraw from the area and respect the NCA., Note: At the time of drafting, the security situation in Mu Traw, Kler Lwee Htoo and Doo Tha Htoo districts had become even more volatile. Tensions between the KNU and the Tatmadaw rose further in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup, resulting in renewed fighting and large-scale internal displacement in late March 2021. This News Bulletin focuses on fighting that took place prior to the military coup and its consequences on the communities affected.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/where-should-i-flee-next-fighting-and-displacement-doo-tha-htoo-kler-lwee-htoo-and-mu
"Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: Tatmadaw soldiers confiscate two motorbikes and threaten local villagers in Hsaw Htee Township, April 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,9 Apr 2021,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Hsaw Htee [Shwegyin] Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District on April 6th 2021. Tatmadaw[1] soldiers from an unidentified battalion confiscated two motorbikes belonging to two local villagers they suspected of attacking one of their trucks. They also fired several warning shots at one of them when he was trying to retrieve the ID card he had left in his motorbike’s under seat storage., On April 6th 2021, a roadside bomb exploded at the passage of a Tatmadaw truck travelling between W--- and M--- villages, Hsaw Htee Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District [the truck did not sustain any damage]. An unidentified number of Tatmadaw soldiers later arrived at the scene and saw two villagers from W--- village sitting on their motorbikes nearby. They suspected these two villagers of detonating the bomb and confiscated their motorbikes at about 4:45 pm. [The fact that the two villagers were not arrested despite being suspected of involvement in the attack suggests that the soldiers were only interested in stealing their motorbikes. This is a clear violation of section 9(d) of the NCA, which prevents signatories from engaging in “looting, theft, or the taking of property without permission”.], The two villagers then walked away, but one of them realised he had left his ID card in his motorbike’s under seat storage. He worried that the Tatmadaw might later try to search for him if they find his ID card, so he walked towards the soldiers in an attempt to retrieve it. However, the soldiers fired 10 warning shots at him, prompting the villager to flee the scene. The soldiers ultimately left, taking the two motorbikes with them. The two villagers do not know which Battalion they belong to. Based on the road they took, they assume they were going to Infantry Battalion[3] #2’s camp in Nyaunglebin town.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kler-lwee-htoo-district-short-update-tatmadaw-soldiers-confiscate-two-motorbikes-and
Myanmar on the Brink of State Failure,News and Press Release,ICG,Protection and Human Rights,9 Apr 2021,"In a briefing to the UN Security Council’s 9 April 2021 'Arria-Formula' Meeting on the situation in Myanmar, Crisis Group’s Myanmar expert Richard Horsey warned that the country stands on the brink of state failure, and argued that there is every justification for the Council to impose an arms embargo on the regime., Madam Chair, Members of the Council, Distinguished Speakers,, Thank you for this opportunity to speak today. You have heard a powerful presentation from a civil society leader and you will hear shortly from a senior representative of the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH). As an independent observer, I can perhaps best contribute to this discussion by situating the current crisis in the country’s broader context., To put it simply, Myanmar stands at the brink of state failure, of state collapse. This is not hyperbole or rhetoric. It is my sober assessment of a likely path forward., Since launching its coup on 1 February, the Myanmar military should have learned what voters also conveyed clearly at the ballot box in November: that the vast majority of the population does not want military rule and will do whatever it takes to prevent that outcome. Yet the military seems determined to impose its will, as shown by its use of ruthless violence against civilian protesters, medical first responders and the general urban population., The problem for the regime is that, unlike in 1988 or the 1990s or the 2007 suppression of the Saffron Revolution, the violence is not producing its desired results. Despite the bloodshed, people continue to demonstrate in the streets, a large proportion of public sector employees refuse to work for the regime, a general strike of key private sector staff continues. Army violence is not effective at convincing scared bank staff or truck drivers to return to work. Violence cannot restore business confidence. A military rampage on the streets and in the homes of Yangon and Mandalay and other towns appears a desperate attempt to terrorise the population into submission; instead, it has created chaos. Various forms of violent urban resistance to the regime are also emerging., ''The regime has not been able to gain effective control of the government bureaucracy, or of local administration in the country.'', The upshot is that the coup has not yet succeeded and the regime has not been able to gain effective control of the government bureaucracy, or of local administration in the country. It is able to deploy violence, but not provide any semblance of law and order. This has important policy implications: close engagement with the CRPH, with those who are protesting in the streets, and with other legitimate representatives of the people, is vital. The military regime is not constitutional or otherwise legal, and countries and organisations should not pre-empt the situation by recognising its de facto authority when the coup is not a fait accompli., But in the midst of all this horror, the transformative nature of the resistance against the military has to be acknowledged and applauded. A new generation of political action has emerged that has transcended old divisions and old prejudices, and gives great hope for a future Myanmar that embraces, and is at peace with, its diversity., The actions of the regime are not just morally reprehensible. They are also extremely dangerous. Not only has the military been unable to consolidate its attempted coup and effectively govern the country, but also its actions may be creating a situation where the country becomes ungovernable. That should be of grave concern to the region and to the broader international community., The precise contours of state failure are hard to predict, depending not only on what goes wrong, but also in what order. But the trajectory is alarming:, First, the banking system is at a virtual standstill, and has been for two months now. That means businesses can’t make and receive payments, individuals cannot access their cash, and payrolls aren’t being processed. The regime has been threatening private banks to get them to reopen branches, but many staff are unwilling to go to work, and with the military perpetrating random violence on the street, others are afraid to do so. Just last week, a local employee of a Korean bank in Yangon was fatally shot in the head by soldiers, while she was travelling home in a company vehicle. The attempted coup has resulted in a hard stop in economic activity, precipitating an economic crisis that will push millions into poverty., Second, supply chains are breaking down. Most imports and exports have come to a halt as customs staff and port workers have gone on strike and containers are backed up at the docks. Domestic haulage has mostly stopped, with truck drivers unwilling to take the risk of driving around the country. Imports of essential agricultural inputs have slowed. Markets are becoming dysfunctional, and many people are without income or access to cash, leaving them unable to buy what food is available. A hunger crisis looms., Third, the health system has collapsed. Many public hospitals are shuttered as medical staff refuse to work for the regime. Other hospitals in key city locations have been taken over by soldiers as forward operating bases, with patients evicted. Medical first responders have been targeted by troops when they attempt to render assistance to injured civilians. There is hardly any COVID-19 testing and treatment, and the vaccination program is far behind schedule. Regular childhood vaccinations are in jeopardy. Critical imported pharmaceuticals are in short supply. Public health experts are worried, for example, about Myanmar’s large caseload of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. A health crisis is coming., Fourth, armed conflict is rising. Myanmar is home to some twenty ethnic armed groups fighting for greater autonomy, as well as several hundred militias of various sizes that are loosely aligned with the Myanmar military. Some ethnic armed groups who have observed ceasefires for years are being drawn into renewed conflict with the army, as they try to protect their civilian populations from violence, give sanctuary to protest leaders and resist army aggression. Others are expanding their areas of control or pressing territorial claims against rival groups – taking advantage of a security vacuum while the military tries to assert its control over the main cities., And lastly, it needs to be acknowledged that much of Myanmar’s natural wealth is in the hands of unregulated actors. Over recent years, the civilian government has had little success in asserting its control over them. If the centre implodes as a result of the army’s misguided and heavy-handed response to the protests, criminal economic forces could be unleashed that would be impossible to contain., Collectively, these crises will trigger large population displacements, as people go on the move because they have lost their livelihoods, or are facing hunger, or are escaping violence in the cities or armed conflict in ethnic areas. It is already happening. Several hundred thousand migrant workers have fled Yangon in recent weeks due to joblessness and insecurity. Thousands of villagers in Kayin State have been displaced, some across the border to Thailand, following air raids on territory controlled by the Karen National Union armed group., Over the decades, Myanmar has faced many different challenges, including ongoing armed conflicts, banking and economic crises, refugee crises, anti-military protest movements and the brutal expulsion of the Rohingya in 2016-2017. These have come at great cost – to human rights, livelihoods and the economy. But throughout, successive governments have remained in power and the Myanmar state has continued to maintain basic order and provide public services, at least in the centre of the country. In short, Myanmar has somehow managed to muddle through., ''The glue that has long held the fractured country together is coming unstuck.'', It is no longer clear that it will be able to do so. The glue that has long held the fractured country together is coming unstuck. The world faces the prospect of chaotic state failure in a country with myriad armed groups, a large and well-equipped military that is unlikely to capitulate, and a huge illicit economy backed by transnational criminal organisations that will exploit the situation as they have done for years. All this will have immediate consequences for the region, and will have an impact on international peace and security., Madam Chair, if I may, I will end with two concrete suggestions for the Council:, First, the regime currently appears determined to try to consolidate its grip on the country, whatever the costs. It has shown no inclination toward dialogue or compromise. But this must be continuously tested. Unequivocal Council backing for the UN special envoy remains important, as does the role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regional actors who have access to the regime. The Council’s unity to date has been welcome, and important. These channels can be used to express clear opposition to the coup, condemn subsequent state violence and warn the military that the trajectory they are on risks catastrophic state collapse. These channels can also help outside actors to identify and pursue any future openings for diplomacy and mediation., Second, some Council members have voiced opposition to coercive measures. But it is hard to see a viable alternative path that can have any impact. In particular, there is every justification for the Council to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar. In the absence of a UN embargo, like-minded countries could agree to a coordinated list of prohibited items – not only arms, but also technologies for surveillance and repression – and share information on their efforts to block transfers on a voluntary basis. This would create a framework for other states to coordinate restrictions on Myanmar. Like-minded countries should also continue to coordinate the imposition of targeted economic sanctions. None of these are likely to have as much impact as either the regime’s own policy failures or the deliberate actions of the civil disobedience movement. But they have an important signalling effect – to the regime, as well as to those resisting its violent attempts to usurp state power., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-brink-state-failure
ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (27 March-2 April 2021),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,8 Apr 2021,"Last week in Southeast Asia, the violent crackdown by security forces on anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar turned even more deadly than preceding weeks amid increasing reports of battlefield tactics being used against demonstrators. Meanwhile, as support for the anti-coup movement by ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) continues to gain momentum, clashes between the military and EAOs intensified in both northern and southern Myanmar. Meanwhile, protest activity increased across the region last week: anti-government protesters in Thailand stepped up their calls for the release of detained protesters; protesters in Indonesia condemned violence against journalists; and government-aligned groups in the Philippines protested against the communist insurgency in the country. Lastly, violence by Islamist groups increased in Indonesia last week ahead of the Easter holiday., Two months after the military coup in Myanmar, the military junta intensified its crackdown on anti-coup demonstrators and civilians, as supporters of the anti-coup movement continue to resist military rule. Last week, security forces increasingly resorted to using heavy weaponry, with reports of hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades, in addition to heavy machine guns and snipers, being used against civilians (UN, 1 April 2021). A day before Armed Forces Day, which is commemorated annually on 27 March, the military declared on state-controlled television that they would shoot protesters in the head if they continued to protest. The ensuing violent crackdown by the military junta on 27 March culminated in the most lethal day of killings since 1 February, with over 100 demonstrators and civilians killed by security forces across two dozen towns and cities (Channel News Asia, 27 March 2021). This marks, by far, the highest death toll in a single day., Meanwhile, the military expanded their offensives against EAOs last week. In southeastern Myanmar, the conflict between the Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) and the military escalated, as the military launched its first air strike on the KNU/KNLA in more than 20 years, also on Armed Forces Day (Frontier Myanmar, 2 April 2021). The air strikes, which continued on a near-daily basis last week, have forced thousands of refugees to flee into the jungle or across the border into Thailand (RFA, 30 March 2021). Reports by local advocacy groups that Thai authorities forced the Kayin refugees to turn back sparked an outcry, but the Thai government insists that the refugees left voluntarily (The Straits Times, 30 March 2021). Elsewhere, in northern Shan and Kachin states, battles between the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) and state forces increased. Notably, the KIO/KIA launched simultaneous attacks on four police stations in Hpakant township on 28 March, which resulted in dozens of police officers being killed (Myanmar Now, 28 March 2021)., Meanwhile, more EAOs have publicly declared their support for the anti-coup movement to oppose the military junta (Eleven Media Group, 31 March 2021). During the week, the Brotherhood Alliance — an alliance of three EAOs — broke their silence and issued a statement pledging to fight alongside citizens if the Myanmar military does not stop killing civilians (Myanmar Now, 30 March 2021). The Brotherhood Alliance includes the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA), which the military junta removed from the Myanmar government’s list of designated terrorist organizations just two weeks ago. The alignment of more EAOs with the anti-coup movement comes amid greater calls by the Myanmar public for the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) — the civilian government formed by lawmakers ousted by the military coup — to work with EAOs to establish a federal army to overthrow the military junta (Guardian, 20 March 2021; Irrawaddy, 23 March 2021)., Other key political developments last week include the announcement by the CRPH that the military-drafted 2008 Constitution has been abolished. The CRPH also presented a new charter that outlines plans to set up a “national unity government” and to draft a new Constitution to establish federal democracy in Myanmar (The Straits Times, 1 April 2021). The announcements were well received by supporters of the anti-coup movement, who symbolically burned physical copies of the 2008 Constitution during demonstrations (Myanmar Now, 1 April 2021). Pundits remarked that while the latest moves by the CRPH are “more symbolic than practical,” they may serve to strengthen the anti-coup movement’s alliances with EAOs to resist the military junta (AP, 1 April 2021)., Separately, the ousted State Counsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, met with her legal team for the first time since she was detained on 1 February. Her chief lawyer later revealed that the military junta has brought a fifth charge against her under the official secrets law, which carries a maximum jail term of 14 years. This marks the most serious charge brought against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to date. Meanwhile, the military junta ordered all wireless broadband data services in Myanmar to be suspended starting from 2 April until further notice. In addition to the blockade of mobile internet services since 15 March, the new directive may edge the country towards a near-complete information blackout (AP, 2 April 2021)., Elsewhere, in Thailand, there was an uptick in anti-government protests last week following mass arrests of protesters. The arrests took place on 28 March, when more than 60 anti-government protesters who had been camping out at the Government House in Bangkok for over two weeks were dispersed and arrested. The protesters had previously marched for over 100km from Nakhon Ratchasima province to Bangkok to demand the release of arrested protesters, the resignation of the prime minister, as well as reforms to the constitution and the monarchy. After they regrouped later the same day to continue protesting, police arrested yet another 30 protesters, bringing the total number of arrests to almost 100 (Reuters, 29 March 2021). Protests later in the week condemned these arrests and called for the release of the detained protesters. As well, calls to release protest leaders being detained without bail have increased., Meanwhile, in Indonesia, protests condemning violence against journalists increased last week. This comes after a journalist was physically assaulted and held captive by security guards while on assignment to report on alleged corruption involving a former government official. The incident comes a couple of weeks after another journalist was also physically prevented from carrying out his assignment by a government official’s security detail, while yet another was beaten up by police (Tribun News, 17 March 2021; Kompas, 19 March 2021). Protesters, who were largely also journalists themselves, criticized the trend of increasing aggression towards journalists and expressed concern over the state of press freedom in the country., In the Philippines, there was a dramatic increase in protests opposing the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), on 29 March, the 52nd anniversary of the NPA’s founding. Many of these demonstrations were either sponsored and/or supported by the government. Military, police, and government officials also participated in some of these protests (Philippine News Agency, 30 March 2021)., Relatedly, following the particularly lethal clashes between the NPA and state forces the preceding week, there was no increase in fighting between the NPA and the government last week in the lead-up to and during the NPA anniversary. In fact, the number of fatalities decreased last week relative to the week prior., Similarly, violence linked to Islamist groups in the Philippines was also muted last week after a week of unusually heightened activity. In contrast, however, there was a spike in violence by Islamist militants in Indonesia as the Christian Holy Week began. On 28 March, a couple from the Islamic State-backed Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) carried out a suicide bombing at a church in Makassar city after a Palm Sunday mass. The attack left 20 people injured, with some in critical condition (Jakarta Post, 29 March 2021). JAD members have carried out similar attacks in the past, with the most notable being the series of coordinated attacks targeting three churches in Surabaya city in 2018. In response to last week’s bombing, authorities carried out coordinated raids and arrested dozens of alleged Islamist militants across the country (Kompas, 31 March 2021). Nonetheless, yet another attack was carried out just a few days later in Jakarta, when an Islamic State-inspired woman fired shots at Indonesian police headquarters. The assailant, who was allegedly a lone wolf, was killed by police during the incident.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-27-march-2-april-2021

The Future They Want – Turning Twenty in Myanmar today,News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2021,"Achim Steiner, Administrator United Nations Development Programme, Half of Myanmar’s population is under the age of thirty. Many of these young people have benefitted from the fragile and imperfect democratic transition their country has traversed over the past ten years. They know the latest developments could reverse the progress of a decade of hard-won gains in human development and fundamental freedoms. This is their future at stake., Armed Forces Day, a day in which General Min Aung Hlaing said the military’s role was to protect the people and promote democracy, turned into the bloodiest day since the military coup. A father clutching his dying son poignantly and tragically underlined on this day that both lives and futures are being lost. It is the prospects of a vanishing future that have brought thousands of young people out on the streets across Myanmar. They refuse to live without hope., The signs are already increasingly tangible. UNDP’s Household Vulnerability survey conducted late last year signaled that poor households are being pushed further below the poverty line, vulnerable households will now be moving even closer to it and previously financially secure households face massive shocks due to the temporary closure of their small businesses and loss of employment. These are the effects of compounded crises: COVID-19, poverty, learning, democracy, and freedoms. The World Bank regional report that came out recently forecasts Myanmar's 2021 GDP growth to be a negative 10 percent. This is a dramatic reduction from 6.8 percent growth in 2019 and 1.7 percent growth in 2020, a COVID-impacted year., While sharing of this evidence must continue knowledge of these trajectories and numbers do not bring sufficient relief to those being impacted daily. On the streets, they know and feel all this in very stark terms, as the personal tragedies rapidly unfold behind the data. The young are seeing jobs disappearing as investment falls away precipitously. International buyers and factory owners are questioning the viability of operations given worker safety and security of workplaces. The inability to guarantee reliable logistics and continued operations are halting businesses and industry. And with it, more young people will lose their jobs. Their threads of fragile livelihoods., The internet is the lifeblood of the young, but it has been restricted severely. The suppression of information, free speech and internet access threaten to push Myanmar back into isolation, information control, and limited engagement within the country and with the rest of the world. But this happens now, at times when a whole generation of young people have experienced better jobs, freedom of speech, access to information and improved education. These developments shaped the values and aspirations of this generation of young people, growing up to civic consciousness in an early democratic transition. Their dreams and aspirations have been shaped by seeing the possible ahead, the potential of a different future. And they refuse to let it be snatched away., History is a stark reminder of what the young may likely face. In 1950, per capita income in Myanmar was higher than that of Malaysia or Thailand. The following decades of a ‘closed door’ policy, under - investments in economic and social sectors had a corrosive effect on human capital and democratic institutions, turning Myanmar from one of the most promising economies in Asia to one of the worst performers. The parents and grandparents know what it was like, and their bitter experience has been recounted to their children – to a Young Myanmar that does not want the clock wound back., They will not be silenced., 19-year-old taekwondo champion and dancer Kyal Sin, who was known as Angel, was killed by security forces in Mandalay wearing an Everything will be ok shirt. Angel would have turned twenty this year. Her posture before she was shot was optimistic and so full of a defiant positivity, as she stood facing the military. Thousands of young people like her stand on the streets each day, courageously calling for the country they want. For the future they want. And they have every right to do so., The UN Secretary General has stated forcefully - the way forward is clear. The security forces must stop the violence, the country must return to its democratic path, the results of the election must be respected, and all political prisoners must be freed. There is an urgent need to ensure COVID-19 does not spread. Progress on reforms that embrace fair economic development, peace and human rights, including the freedom of movement, citizenship and the right of safe return for refugees, is a sign of a country investing in its human development, in its very humanity. It would be a society at peace with itself., Armed Forces Day should be a celebration of a commitment to protect the future of the young, not a day in which the world mourns that future being so violently snatched away.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/future-they-want-turning-twenty-myanmar-today
CARE statement on ongoing Myanmar violence,News and Press Release,CARE,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2021,"“Even before February 1st, over 1 million people in Myanmar needed humanitarian assistance, including 336,000 internally displaced people in Rakhine, Kachin, Kayin and Shan states. As the US orders the departure of non-emergency employees and their family members, the humanitarian situation in Myanmar grows even more concerning., Underscored by the recent shooting of a seven-year-old girl, the most recent of many innocent lives lost at the hands of security forces, CARE is concerned that the escalation and spread of violence will cause a rapid rise in conflict-related displacements and economic setbacks. Further, humanitarian agencies are extremely constrained in our ability to continue delivering principled humanitarian assistance., With that, CARE has previously expressed concern for the safety and well-being of the people of Myanmar and is now urgently renewing our call on security forces to immediately cease the use of force and respect all rights of civilians, including the right to humanitarian access and protection of all civilian populations under international humanitarian law.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/care-statement-ongoing-myanmar-violence

Myanmar in the streets: A nonviolent movement shows staying power,News and Press Release,USIP,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",31 Mar 2021,"In a historic uprising against a military coup, activists use tactics that have succeeded elsewhere — despite the generals’ escalating violence., BY: Zarchi Oo; Billy Ford; Jonathan Pinckney, The people of Myanmar have opposed military rule in the past but never like this: In the face of horrific brutality by a lawless regime, Burmese have risen up in an historic national movement of nonviolent resistance. Led by young women, the fractious country has united across ethnic, generational and class lines, weaponizing social norms and social media in a refusal to accept the generals’ February 1 seizure of power. The broad appeal and tactical creativity of the resisters have kept the movement in the streets — and the generals off balance — for more than eight weeks now despite intensifying repression. While no one can predict the course of events in Myanmar, the campaign displays hallmarks of past nonviolent movements around the world that ultimately achieved their goals., If coup leaders expected the population to fold after five liberating years of limited democracy and global integration, they were badly mistaken. Public protests have ballooned in virtually every township in Myanmar as the civil disobedience movement has continued to gain strength., Read the full story on USIP's website.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-streets-nonviolent-movement-shows-staying-power

Myanmar: Hundreds Forcibly Disappeared,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,2 Apr 2021,"Account for Missing Politicians, Activists, Others at Risk of Torture, Death, (Bangkok) – Myanmar’s military junta has forcibly disappeared hundreds of people since the February 1, 2021 coup, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities have taken into custody politicians, election officials, journalists, activists, and protesters and refused to confirm their location or allow access to lawyers or family members in violation of international law., The security forces have arrested many people suspected of participation in anti-coup demonstrations or in the opposition Civil Disobedience Movement during nighttime raids on homes throughout the country. The nongovernmental organization, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, told Human Rights Watch they could confirm the location of only a small fraction of the more than 2,500 recent detainees they have identified., “The military junta’s widespread use of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances appears designed to strike fear in the hearts of anti-coup protesters,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “Concerned governments should demand the release of everyone disappeared and impose targeted economic sanctions against junta leaders to finally hold this abusive military to account.”, Human Rights Watch spoke to family members, witnesses, and lawyers of 16 people feared to have been forcibly disappeared since the coup., On February 1 at about 5:30 a.m., four uniformed soldiers and a man in civilian attire arrived at the home of Mya Aye, 55, an outspoken activist and member of the National League for Democracy (NLD), in Mingalar Taung Nyunt township, Yangon. The men showed no arrest warrant and offered no basis for his arrest to family members, which was caught on a neighbor’s CCTV camera and later was posted on Twitter., Later that day, two plainclothes officers came to the residence to collect his medications but refused to provide additional information. In late March, Mya Aye’s family said that the authorities still had not told them where Mya Aye was being held and had not provided him access to a lawyer., On March 6, police arrived at the funeral in Mandalay of a protester shot dead by police, causing those attending to flee in panic. A prominent activist, Nyi Nyi Kyaw, fell and the police arrested him. A friend of Nyi Nyi Kyaw said that the authorities did not tell his family where he was, and that they went into hiding out of fear that they may be targeted as family members., The family received one communication from Nyi Nyi Kyaw – a short but chilling phone call to his eldest son from a blocked number – four days after his disappearance in which he sounded agitated and distressed, the friend said. The call was ended before the family could ascertain his whereabouts., On March 9, military trucks arrived around 1:30 p.m. and parked outside the office of Karmayut Media in Yangon, neighbors said. At about 3 p.m., they saw soldiers take away the media outlet’s co-founder, Han Thar Nyein, 40, and the editor-in-chief, Nathan Maung, 45. Their families still have not been informed of their whereabouts, a family member said., “We’re so anxious about where they are, and we’re worried for their well-being,” the family member of Han Thar Nyein said. “We want to see them with our own eyes, to accept that they are okay, that they are alive. And we want this to happen quickly, not to wait in this agonizing way.”, Many friends and family members of anti-coup protesters who have been arrested told Human Rights Watch they do not know exactly where the person was being held, heightening concerns about their safety and well-being., In many cases, families have only received information informally about the location of their family member, such as when newly released detainees notify family members or lawyers that they had seen a person who had been detained. Some families believe that because a prison accepts a package for their family member, it is most likely the place where their relative is being held. However, this is conjecture and does not relieve the authorities of their obligation to provide information on a detainee’s whereabouts, produce a detainee in court within 48 hours, and allow access to counsel and family members., Under international human rights law, a state commits an enforced disappearance when government authorities or their agents arrest or detain an individual followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealing the fate or whereabouts of the person, placing them outside the protection of the law. Forcibly disappeared people are commonly subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution. Families must live with the uncertainty of not knowing if their loved ones are dead or alive, and worrying about their treatment in captivity., Enforced disappearances are grave violations of international law, and when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, are crimes against humanity., “Enforced disappearances are a heinous crime, not least because of the anguish and suffering caused to family and friends,” Adams said. “Myanmar’s security forces have continually flouted any respect for human rights, but they should know that they will be held accountable for the disappearances of these individuals and for the safe return of everyone forcibly disappeared.”, **Examples of Enforced Disappearances, Mya Aye, Mya Aye is a vocal critic of the military and a veteran pro-democracy activist who has been arrested twice previously, in 1989 and again in 2007. He served lengthy sentences both times. His daughter said that both times, he was also forcibly disappeared for months before the family could locate him., Mya Aye was arrested on February 1 at his home in Yangon. On February 3, family members went to the Mingalar Taung Nyunt township police station to ask where he was being detained and the charges against him. The family said that police chief, Tin Maung Swe, said police were not responsible for Mya Aye’s detention and could not provide further details. On February 6, the family requested assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross to help locate him. On February 17, the family made a submission to the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances., Mya Aye’s family said that in the two months since he was disappeared the authorities have not informed the family of his whereabouts and failed to respond to the family’s numerous requests for an investigation into the circumstances of his arrest and disappearance. They said that he has had a quadruple bypass operation and requires daily medication. The family has sent packages that include food and medication to Yangon’s Insein prison with the hope that he is there, and that the medication reaches him, but they have no way to confirm if he has received them., Nyi Nyi Kyaw, On March 6, police arrested Nyi Nyi Kyaw in Mandalay as he attended the funeral of a protester shot dead by the police. When security forces arrived at the service, held on the corner of 62nd and 102nd streets, the funeral congregation ran in panic. Nyi Nyi Kyaw fell over as he was running and appeared to be immediately targeted for arrest by the police there, his friend said. While other civil society activists were at the funeral, only Nyi Nyi Kyaw was arrested., In attempts to locate Nyi Nyi Kyaw, his family on March 7 took packages to two prisons in Mandalay: Obo and then Lan Dwin. Both facilities denied that he was being held there., The family decided to go into hiding after Nyi Nyi Kyaw’s son received a distressing phone call from his father on March 10, four days after his arrest. The family is unsure whose phone Nyi Nyi Kyaw was using, but he repeatedly avoided answering questions about his whereabouts or his well-being. His son told the family friend that his father seemed disoriented and asked questions about another individual involved in the civil disobedience movement who was on the run. The call was cut from Nyi Nyi Kyaw’s end when his son could not answer questions about the key leaders of the anti-coup movement., “Maybe Nyi Nyi Kyaw called because he wanted to let his son know he was alive,” a family friend said. “His son is terrified for his father’s well-being but also worried that the family is being tracked so they have gone into hiding. This makes things even more desperate for Nyi Nyi Kyaw because he’s not receiving the packages from his family members that are so essential for the survival of prisoners in Myanmar jails.”, Nathan Maung and Han Thar Nyein, On March 9, the authorities arrested the Karmayut Media editor-in-chief, Nathan Maung, and co-founder, Han Thar Nyein, after security forces raided their office in Yangon. Two videos posted on Facebook on March 10, recorded from a neighboring building, show at least six army vehicles parked outside the office. Soldiers can be seen leaving the office building carrying bags and equipment and placing them in the vehicles. By matching the buildings visible in the videos with satellite imagery, Human Rights Watch confirmed it to be the location of Karmaryut Media in Kamayut township., “No one has been able to tell me where they are,” a family member of Han Thar Nyein said. The family member said that lawyers had not had access to the pair and that the authorities had not told them where they were holding them., On March 10, the families tried to send packages to Insein prison, but the next day prison officials told them to collect the packages as no one with those names was in the prison., Yan Paing Hein, On March 9, the authorities arrested Yan Paing Hein, 25, together with 22 other residents from 3rd St., Lanmadaw township in Yangon, after protesters detained seven police officers who had been involved in trying to quash protests., In a video livestreamed on Facebook on March 8 that Human Rights Watch could no longer locate but has access to an offline copy, Yan Paing Hein can be seen and heard attempting to prevent residents from beating the captive police officers. Soon after, the military arrives in a large convoy and shots can be heard. Yan Paing Hein can be seen running away. Human Rights Watch identified Yan Paing Hein in this video through interviews with family members. He later ran back to his home along with others who were not immediately arrested, a family member said., Around 12:30 a.m., police broke down the front door of Yan Paing Hein’s house. Soldiers entered the house and arrested Yan Paing Hein. The soldiers also arrested 22 other young men from the neighborhood., “They pointed guns at me and my father while they were searching our home, while they were questioning my dad and while they took Yan Paing Hein,” said his sister. “I didn’t see that my brother was beaten when they took him away, but I heard from another guy who was later released that Yan Paing Hein was beaten, that his nose was broken, and that he couldn’t breathe properly because the blood was clotting in his nose.”, The security forces took Yan Paing Hein to an interrogation facility in Shwe Pyi Thar township. Another man taken that night said that he saw 23 men there that night, including himself, but that when he and others were released at 5 p.m. the next day, he noticed that seven were missing, including Yan Paing Hein., The authorities have not told the family where Yan Paing Hein is but detainees who were subsequently released told the family they saw him inside Insein prison. The family has sent four packages to the prison, none of which have been returned. Neither the family nor the lawyer have managed to have direct contact with him., Sai Phyo Htike, On March 14, the authorities arrested Sai Phyo Htike, 23, an engineering student, on the corner of 81st and 21st streets in Mandalay. A friend of his now living abroad said that Sai Phyo Htike was riding home to Sein Pan Ward from an anti-coup protest when a group of armed men in civilian clothes ran in front of him and fired warning shots in the air. Sai Phyo Htike fell from his motorbike and was arrested in front of the No. 8 Police Station. The authorities have provided no details about why he was arrested and have repeatedly denied requests from his family and lawyer to see him.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-hundreds-forcibly-disappeared
Myanmar: Joint Statement by UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict & the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children,News and Press Release,OSRSG Children and Armed Conflict,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2021,"The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, and the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, Dr Najat Maalla M’jid condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing violence against civilians, including children, in Myanmar since the military coup on 1 February., The SRSGs are alarmed by the number of children who have lost their lives or have been injured as a result of the violence. As of 31 March, at least 44 children have been documented as killed according to UN funds and programs on the ground, including a 7-year-old girl shot while in her home. Countless other boys and girls have been seriously injured., The SRSGs also strongly condemn the widespread attacks on schools and hospitals and protected personnel, with 35 incidents documented including arrests and violence against teachers and health personnel, which prevent life-saving interventions from reaching civilians. They further condemn the military use of education and health facilities, with more than 120 incidents documented., Moreover, UN funds and programs on the ground have indicated that at least 900 children and young people have been arbitrarily detained. Although many of these have been released, many more are still held without access to legal counsel. This is in clear violation of international law which states that detention of children should only be used as a measure of last resort, for the shortest period possible and legal support should be provided to all children in contact with the justice system., “We remind the Tatmadaw and the police in Myanmar that any use of force must be necessary and proportionate and not in contravention of international humanitarian and human rights law. We further urge them to stop the detention of children as clearly stated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We call on the Tatmadaw to halt widespread violence against children in any manifestation, to refrain from forcefully using or detaining children, to hold perpetrators of violence against children accountable and to uphold and respect Myanmar’s Child Laws. The children of Myanmar deserve no less.”, The two Special Representatives further express their deep concern over the longer-term effects of the current events in Myanmar on the physical and mental wellbeing of children and their families. The longer the current situation of widespread violence continuous, the more it will contribute to a continuous state of distress and toxic stress for children, which can have a lifelong impact on their mental and physical health., Echoing the Secretary-General’s urgent appeal to the military in Myanmar to refrain from violence and repression and to hold those responsible for the serious human rights violations committed in the country accountable, SRSG Maalla M’jid and SRSG Gamba call on the Tatmadaw and defense and security forces in Myanmar to immediately cease excessive force and ensure the protection of civilians, particularly children from all such related violence., Fabienne Vinet, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, New York.

A special committee was formed to tackle the coronavirus chaired by the Union minister for international cooperation and the minister of health and sports to mitigate and control the COVDI-19 virus. This imposed stringent measures on the country including physical distancing, enhanced community quarantines (ECQ), and limitation of movement within the entire country. By flowing the protocol, MRCS volunteers carried out the activities with considering the COVID-19 pandemic situation and maintain social distance in all activities., This has had implications on MRCS implementation the other ongoing operations, including the Mandalay flood response (MDRMM015), with activities having to be rescheduled or redesigned to adapt to the current situation.

Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",1 Apr 2021,"Kuala Lumpur/Yangon/Geneva, 1 April 2021 - Two months following the military takeover in Myanmar, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is deeply concerned about the escalating violence and mounting casualties amongst the civilian population and is warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis., Alexander Matheou, IFRC’s Asia Pacific Regional Director, said:, “The levels of violence and the use of lethal force that have resulted in so many casualties and grave injuries amongst the population is deeply shocking. Myanmar Red Cross first aid teams working on the frontlines of this emergency have provided care to over 2,000 people, often at great personal risk.”, “In some instances, Myanmar Red Cross first aiders and medics have been wrongfully arrested, intimidated or injured and Red Cross property and ambulances have been damaged. This is unacceptable. Health workers should never be a target. They should be granted unrestricted humanitarian access to people in need.”, With major disruptions to emergency medical services, Myanmar Red Cross is one of a few organization’s currently able to help across the country, thanks to their nationwide network and levels of acceptance with local communities. Close to 2,000 Red Cross volunteers are working at 246 first aid posts set up in 175 townships across the country. The Red Cross also operates a fleet of 142 ambulances which have been used to treat and evacuate the seriously ill or wounded., On its part, the IFRC released funding from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to help the Myanmar Red Cross sustain nationwide reach of its emergency first aid and medical transport services to aid an estimated 22,500 people until June, 2021. Longer term plans are rapidly being developed in line with escalating humanitarian needs in the months ahead., The current state of unrest poses a significant threat to efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar where testing, tracing and treatment capacity has been markedly reduced in the past two months., “In the coming months we could be facing a perfect storm in Myanmar where another wave of COVID-19 infections collides with a deepening humanitarian crisis spreading across the entire country.”, “As basic services such as health care, banking, transportation and logistics suffer major disruption, we inevitably see rising prices, food insecurity, increased population movements and a range of acute medical needs emerging,” said Mr Matheou., The IFRC is also worried that the current political crisis could destabilise ongoing humanitarian programmes in Myanmar., “With significant disruptions to banking services we could soon be struggling to support Myanmar Red Cross programmes in several parts of the country. This includes planned cash assistance to help families recover from COVID-19. Vulnerable people already suffering terrible hardships face greater risks”, said Mr Matheou., Notes to Editors:, According to the World Health Organization, between 1 February and 24 March, 2021, there were 31 attacks on health-care facilities and staff, resulting in two deaths and six injuries.

"Atrocity Alert No. 246: Myanmar (Burma), Mozambique and Ethiopia",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE GROWS AS MYANMAR’S GENERALS COMMIT CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, On Saturday, 27 March, Myanmar’s military celebrated Armed Services Day while also killing at least 114 people – including six children – in the bloodiest day of violence since the 1 February coup. A day earlier, state-run television broadcast a message to protesters warning that, “you should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot in the head and back.” According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, at least 536 people have been killed by the security forces since 1 February and at least 2,729 remain in detention., In addition to violently suppressing protests and indiscriminately attacking civilians, the security forces have also launched fresh offensives against ethnic armed groups in some regions of the country. Military aircraft bombed villages in areas controlled by the Karen National Union, prompting thousands of civilians to seek refuge in Thailand., Since 1 February, civilians throughout Myanmar have been protesting and repeatedly calling on the international community to uphold the principle of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P). Such calls are being echoed by leading human rights figures around the world. On 28 March the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, and the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, issued a joint statement stressing that “the international community has a responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar from atrocity crimes.” The two UN leaders also called on the UN Security Council (UNSC) to take robust action., The same day, the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar – comprised of the former UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, and two former members of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, Marzuki Darusman and Chris Sidoti – issued a statement asserting that, “Myanmar people are calling for international action under the Responsibility to Protect. In response, we want to see three cuts imposed on the Myanmar military: cut the weapons, cut the cash, cut the impunity.”, Similarly, on Monday, 29 March, the influential Global Leadership Foundation – whose 45 members include a number of former Heads of State or Government and two Nobel Peace Prize winners – sent a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, reminding him that R2P’s third pillar “makes it the responsibility of the international community to protect when a State is manifestly failing to protect its own population. If ever there was a case for R2P to be invoked, this is it.” The letter called on the Secretary-General to use Article 99 of the UN Charter and formally recommend the UNSC take action to end atrocities in Myanmar., Today the UNSC meets again to discuss the situation in Myanmar. It is time for the UNSC, regional organizations and all governments to implement measures in response to the deteriorating situation. A global arms embargo, sanctions on senior military officials and businesses, and a referral to the International Criminal Court, are long overdue. Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “there should be no ‘business as usual,’ with a military junta that is waging war on their own people and committing crimes against humanity. Now is the time for action and accountability.”, ARMED EXTREMISTS SEIZE PALMA, MOZAMBIQUE, Hundreds of militants from an Islamic State-affiliated armed group, known locally as Al-Shabaab, raided Palma, Mozambique, on 24 March, taking control of the town. Thousands of civilians, including foreigners working for energy companies, fled the violence. An unknown number of civilians have been killed, with witnesses claiming that decapitated bodies have been left in the streets. At the time of publication, government security forces and a private military company, Dyck Advisory Group, were still battling to retake Palma., Dewa Mavhinga, Southern Africa Director at Human Rights Watch, said that, “Al-Shabaab fired on civilians in their homes and on the streets in Palma as they tried to flee for their lives.” Armed men also ambushed a civilian convoy of vehicles attempting to flee and besieged the Amarula Palma hotel, where an estimated 200 people had been sheltering., On Monday, 29 March, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack on Palma, saying they now controlled the town and had killed more than 55 people, including Mozambican soldiers, Christians and foreigners. Earlier this month the United States designated Al-Shabaab as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization” due to their association with ISIL., Al-Shabaab has engaged in a violent insurgency in Cabo Delgado, a northern province of Mozambique that includes Palma, since October 2017. Since that time more than 2,000 civilians have been killed and over 670,000 displaced. Al-Shabaab has perpetrated indiscriminate attacks against civilians, including extrajudicial killings, sexual and gender-based violence, abductions and recruitment of children. These atrocities may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes under international law. Meanwhile, military forces engaged in fighting Al-Shabaab – including the Mozambican security forces and the Dyck Advisory Group – have been implicated in extrajudicial executions and other violations of International Humanitarian Law., Jaclyn Streitfeld-Hall, Research Director at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “the attack on Palma marks a terrible escalation of the conflict in Cabo Delgado. Al-Shabaab pose a deadly threat to all civilians, but the security forces who are fighting to retake the town must also ensure that civilians and displaced persons are protected and that their human rights are upheld. You can’t defeat armed extremism by committing war crimes.”, RAPE USED AS A WEAPON OF WAR IN TIGRAY, ETHIOPIA, Last Thursday, 25 March, the UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator for Ethiopia, Wafaa Said, briefed UN member states on the situation in Tigray, corroborating reports of targeted killings, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced displacement. Said reported that five medical facilities in Tigray recorded 516 rape cases in mid-March and that “women say they have been raped by armed actors, they also told stories of gang rape, rape in front of family members and men being forced to rape their own family members under the threat of violence.”, The UN estimates that the actual number of women raped is likely much higher given that the stigma surrounding rape prevents self-reporting and approximately 82 percent of the 229 health centers in Tigray are not functioning. Physicians treating refugees in Sudan have stated rape was being used as a weapon of war against the population of Tigray., A communications blackout and other restrictions have hampered efforts to investigate allegations of atrocities that have taken place in Tigray since November. However, on 26 March the UN confirmed it had finally gained access to two Eritrean refugee camps, Hitsats and Shimelba, which satellite image analysis from January indicated had been systematically destroyed. According to the UN Refugee Agency, most shelters in the Hitsats camp, as well as the UN offices, had been burnt to the ground and all humanitarian facilities were looted and vandalized. Of the 20,000 Eritrean refugees who previously resided in the camps, an estimated 11,000 remain unaccounted for., Attacks on refugee camps and humanitarian workers are prohibited under international law and may constitute war crimes., On 25 March the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights agreed to conduct joint investigations into abuses allegedly committed by all parties to the conflict in Tigray. The joint investigation must ensure that all atrocity crimes – including sexual violence and attacks on refugees – are investigated, regardless of the rank, national origin or affiliation of the alleged perpetrator.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-246-myanmar-burma-mozambique-and-ethiopia
Myanmar: 43 children killed by armed forces in just two months since the coup began,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2021,"1 April 2021 – At least 43 children have reportedly been killed by armed forces in Myanmar in the two months since the military coup on 1 February. The death toll of children has more than doubled in the past 12 days, demonstrating the utter disrespect of armed forces for the lives of children., The total number of people killed now stands at 521, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP)., The youngest victim was a girl, who was just six years old. A total of 15 children under the age of 16 are among the casualties, including children aged 9 and 11. Among those killed were a 13-year-old boy who was reportedly shot in the head whilst trying to run away from armed forces, and a 14-year-old Mandalay boy was reportedly shot dead whilst he was inside or around his home., The number of children who have been physically injured as a result of the post-coup violence is unknown, but it is likely to be significant. Among those injured was a one-year-old baby who was reportedly shot in the eye with a rubber bullet., The fear, stress and grief caused by the ongoing violence is having a deep impact on the mental health of millions of children in Myanmar, Save the Children said., The organisation is also alarmed by the reported bombing of a school in Kayin State on March 29, during a series of airstrikes in the area that caused thousands of people to flee. Images show the school, reportedly empty at the time, completely destroyed by the attack. Attacks against schools constitute a grave violation of children’s rights and cannot be justified under any circumstances., Save the Children said:, “We are shocked that children continue to be among the targets of these fatal attacks, despite repeated calls to protect children from harm. It is especially horrifying that several of these children were reportedly killed at home, where they should have been safe from harm., “This is a nightmare scenario unfolding. Innocent children have had their futures brutally and needlessly snatched away from them. Grieving families – among them young children who have seen siblings die – are suffering unimaginable loss and pain. Children have witnessed violence and horror. It is clear that Myanmar is no longer a safe place for children., “We once again call on the armed forces to end these deadly attacks against protesters immediately. Time and time again we see that children are the innocent victims of any crisis. The only way to protect children in Myanmar is to stop all lethal violence immediately., Save the Children and its partners are providing support to children who have been harmed and their families, providing front line emotional support to children who have witnessed violence, and referring children with severe mental health needs to specialists. Due to insecurity and ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, a lot of this work is being done remotely, and many children are still not able to receive the support they so desperately need., ENDS, NOTES TO EDITORS, [i] Data on child fatalities/detentions compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) – last updated on 31 March, 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-43-children-killed-armed-forces-just-two-months-coup-began
Myanmar: ‘Significant action’ needed by Security Council to prevent ‘bloodbath’,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2021,"Widespread, systemic attacks on civilians in Myanmar orchestrated by leaders of the military coup, demand a “firm, unified and resolute international response”, UN Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener said on Wednesday., As the world watches in horror as Myanmar's military continues to defy calls, including by UN Security Council, to end fundamental human rights violations and “return to the path of democracy”, she told a closed session of the Council that more than 520 people have been killed since the coup began, adding that “the urgency for a solution to this crisis could not be clearer”., On 1 February, following a general election in which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide, the military seized full control of the country, imprisoning elected leaders, and declared a year-long state of emergency, which triggered massive protests., On Saturday, Armed Forces Day, security forces turned against their own citizens, brutally killing 100 people, including children, both on the streets and in their homes, said the Special Envoy., Devastating repercussions, Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, she had warned ambassadors in a briefing earlier this month, that the crisis was rapidly unravelling an already fragile public health sector and risking multiple emergencies., The UN envoy explained that lives that could be saved under normal circumstances were being lost, a banking collapse “appears imminent”, and shockwaves to businesses have “toppled the supply chain while fundamentally impacting the labour force”., “Hard-won gains of the democratic transition and peace process are slipping away”, she added., Moreover, the military’s cruelty has prompted ethnic armed groups in Kayin and Kachin states, to denounce the coup, “increasing the possibility of civil war at an unprecedented scale”., And while vulnerable groups, including the Rohingya, will suffer most, “inevitably, the whole country is on the verge of spiralling into a failed State”, she cautioned., “Consider all available tools to take collective action and do what is right, what the people of Myanmar deserve and prevent a multi-dimensional catastrophe in the heart of Asia”, the UN envoy appealed to the Council., Military shuts down dialogue, Noting that the most serious crimes and violations of international law appear to be “happening in plain sight”, Ms. Schraner Burgener raised concerns that they would become even bloodier., While mediation requires dialogue, she said that “Myanmar’s military has shut its doors to most of the world” and would only engage when they can contain the situation “through repression and terror”., “Military leaders have clearly shown they are not capable of managing the country”, the UN envoy, urging the Council to help restore civilian rule under the elected government, headed by President Win Myint and State Counsellor Suu Kyi., Prevent bloodbath, Though she remains open to dialogue, the UN official acknowledged that by waiting until they are ready to talk, “the ground situation will only worsen”, meaning “a bloodbath is imminent”., “We have stood by too long as patterns of human rights violations and most serious international crimes committed by the Myanmar military have reoccurred”, she said. “This Council must consider potentially significant action that can reverse the course of events in Myanmar”., Ms. Schraner Burgener concluded by reminding the Ambassadors that history will judge their inaction and urged them to overcome “caution and disagreement” while there is “still time to avoid the worst outcome”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-significant-action-needed-security-council-prevent-bloodbath

They must not be returned to a place where their lives or freedom may be at risk. This principle of non-refoulement is a cornerstone of international law and is binding on all states., Myanmar’s neighbours have a decades-long history of providing protection and assistance to refugees.

Strengthening the capacity of ASEAN Member States to design and implement risk-informed and shock responsive social protection systems for resilience - Regional Synthesis Report,Analysis,WFP,Disaster Management,31 Mar 2021,"Executive summary, The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprises 10 Member States (AMS) with very diverse economies: two are high income (Brunei Darussalam and Singapore), two are upper-middle income (Malaysia and Thailand), and the remaining six are lower-middle income (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Philippines, and Viet Nam).
ASEAN is the most disaster-prone region of the world. More than 200 million people in AMS have been affected by disasters from 2000 to 2015 and there have been US$8 trillion total economic losses in the region in those 15 years.
Addressing the root cause of disaster vulnerability in the ASEAN region and building long-term resilience to climate extremes is vital to breaking the cycle of recurrent humanitarian crises and the remaining high levels of poverty in the region. However, climate change is causing an increase in the frequency and severity of hazards and will lead to more disasters.
The complementarity of social protection and disaster risk management (DRM) is increasingly acknowledged by ASEAN. Accordingly, this study, the overarching research question of which is:, This research defines social protection as the set of public actions that address both the absolute deprivation and vulnerabilities of the poorest, as well as the need of the currently non-poor for security in the face of shocks and lifecycle events. The rationale for shock-responsive social protection being given a front-line role in disaster response include efficiency gains from faster responses, pooling of financial and programmatic resources, and speeding up decision making. Shock-responsive social protection also implies better preparedness for disaster response by improving the resilience of households facing shocks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/strengthening-capacity-asean-member-states-design-and-implement-risk-informed-and

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Mar 2021,"Highlights, • The crisis following the military takeover on 1 February is likely to have a severe impact on the physical and mental wellbeing of children and will exacerbate existing humanitarian needs of 450,000 children., • Peaceful protests and a civil disobedience movement (CDM) against the military takeover continue across the country despite violent and arbitrary crackdowns by security forces. Military occupation of hospitals and universities has been reported in almost all states and regions, limiting access to critical life-saving services, with particularly serious implications for vulnerable populations., • There are continued disruptions to communication, transportation and supply chains, and shortages of cash for operations due to limitations on banking services. Despite these challenges UNICEF continues to provide a package of interventions in Health, Nutrition, Child Protection, Education, WASH and Social Protection., • The current situation calls for emergency assistance outside the current Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) locations., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF is currently appealing for US $61.7 million to support 424,000 people, including 224,000 children, to access essential basic services in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition, health, education, child protection and social protection and improved hygiene practices to prevent COVID-19 infection. However, these reflect pre-February needs, given the increasingly deteriorating situation across the country with loss of access to basic services due to the protests and CDM, and agencies turning to costly alternatives in programme implementation outside national systems, we expect these needs to increase., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Humanitarian needs in Myanmar are driven by multiple factors including armed conflict, inter-communal violence, and vulnerability to natural hazards (HNO 2020). Even before 1 February 2021, nearly one million people in five states, including 336,000 IDPs, were in need of humanitarian assistance. Fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces and Arakan Army in 2020 had displaced 81,245 people to 185 informal settlements in Rakhine and 236 in Chin, adding to the needs of 130,000 people already displaced since 2012 and in deteriorating and overcrowded camps. UNICEF’s appeal aligns with the sectoral needs of the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan in five states: Rakhine, Chin, Kachin,
Shan and Kayin., The political situation has deteriorated in the country since 1 February 2021, with continuous demonstrations across most of the country and the imposition of martial law. As the crisis escalates, there is an urgent need to ensure the continuity and functionality of services and thereby enable a rapid scale up of emergency assistance outside current HRP locations. Challenges are being faced in the movement of humanitarian supplies sparking fears of potential supply shortages due transportation and supply chains, and shortages of cash for operations due to limitations on banking services., Children are being killed, wounded, detained, exposed to tear gas and stun grenades and are witnessing terrifying scenes of violence. The continuing use of force against children by security forces, including the use of live ammunition, is taking a devastating toll on children in Myanmar., Since the crisis began on 1 February, at least 35 children have been killed and many more seriously injured. Arbitrary detentions of children are also continuing to occur – indeed almost half of all persons detained are children or young people. UNICEF estimate that almost 1,000 children and young people have been arbitrarily detained. And while many of those detained have subsequently been released, many are still being held without access to legal counsel, in violation of their human rights. In some areas, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, cutting off tens of thousands of children from their relatives, friends, communities and traditional means of support., On 14 March, martial law was imposed in 11 townships across the country. The establishment of complete military control in those areas poses significant risk for children given the risk that standard legal safeguards provided for under the Child Rights Law (CRL) may be suspended. This is of concern since the military justice system, unlike the civilian justice system, does not include any special measures or considerations for children., Life-saving humanitarian services such as maternal, newborn and child health, emergency care and emergency obstetrics and neo-natal care have been disrupted nationwide for a number of reasons, including the participation in the CDM by civil servants and other service providers. Disruption of provision of essential services such as communication, banking, logistics and transportation are observed., Learning has been disrupted for almost 12 million children in Myanmar due to widespread school closures since March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of alternative learning programmes. This lost learning opportunity has affected not only school-aged children who would normally be enrolled in government formal schools, but also those children seeking continuous learning opportunities in non-formal education centres, which have been closed. Prolonged disruptions to learning not only keep children out of school but also serve to create more out-of-school children after schools eventually reopen., As of 19 March, security forces have reportedly occupied more than 60 schools and university campuses in 13 states and regions. In at least one incident, security forces reportedly beat two teachers while entering premises, and left several others injured. Other public institutions including hospitals have also been occupied., Since 1 February, COVID-19 testing has been very limited in Myanmar, with the result that the true burden of COVID19 cases is not known. It is likely that the mass gatherings associated with demonstrations will have led to an increase in incidence. Prior to February 2021 an average of around 20,000 tests were being conducted on a daily basis. In February and March, the rate has dropped to fewer than 2,000 tests per day.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-office-humanitarian-situation-report-no-1-reporting-period-1-february

The support is aimed at addressing their most pressing needs such as medical expenses while reducing the risk of resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as borrowing money or taking on debt, or reducing expenditure on key items including water, food, education and healthcare., UNHCR continues to provide targeted non-food items (NFI) to meet the needs of displaced persons. In January and February, UNHCR distributed NFI items including blankets, mosquito nets, plastic mats, kitchen sets, tarpaulins, and jerry cans to 393 households (1,522 individuals) in Kachin State., During January, UNHCR and partners completed several community-based projects (or quick impact projects, QIPs) in several return locations in southern Kachin and northern Shan states, aimed at improving conditions in areas of return and strengthen social cohesion among communities. These projects, benefitting 3,427 individuals, include the construction of a new school building and the renovation of an old one, the construction of three gravity flow water systems, road construction, and construction of one small dam to secure water for livelihood activities., Rakhine & southern Chin, In contrast to mass protests in other parts of the country against the military takeover, there has been more limited response from communities in Rakhine, with limited protests taking place and the security situation remaining relatively stable., As of 15 March, it is estimated that more than 103,000 newly displaced persons reside in 182 displacement sites in Rakhine and Chin states., Support to displacement sites and IDP camps continue despite limitations imposed by the current political and COVID-19 context. During January and February, 4,036 families (17,439 individuals) in central Rakhine benefitted from NFI support, items included mosquito nets, sleeping mats, blankets, kitchen sets, while 1,345 families (6,725 individuals) in northern townships of Rakhine received such support. A further 686 families (3,430 individuals) received shelter support, including bamboo poles, tarpaulins and myaw posts., Field activities within the framework of creating conditions for sustainable solutions for displaced persons from Rakhine State remain ongoing. During the first two months of the year, a number of community-based projects (quick impact projects, or QIPs) have been progressing; renovation of two access roads was initiated while renovation of another access road is near completion, the drilling of one borehole was completed and five more are planned, and 50 solar light installation points have been confirmed. Other support for schools, persons with specific needs, etc. are also planned. Furthermore, UNHCR is also supporting the improvement of facilities in market areas, with five water collection points, 20 handwashing stations and two firefighting points currently being installed., South-east, The current political situation has resulted in the suspension of many activities in the southeast, both of UNHCR’s and partners. Despite this,
UNHCR maintains its work in Kayin and Kayah states to support reintegration efforts through the implementation of community-based projects (also known as QIPs, or quick impact projects) to improve community infrastructure while promoting coexistence and benefitting both the existing host communities and returning refugees who participated in the facilitated voluntary return movements in 2016-2019., A protection hotline for the southeast operation was activated in Hpa-An and Loikaw Offices to ensure effective and continuous lines of two-way communication with people of concern. The early warning system in the southeast, a joint endeavor with UNHCR and several partners, draws from existing networks and communications with communities’ efforts to monitor the rapidly evolving situation on the ground and potential impacts on people of concern., In February, the implementation of community-based projects in Kayin State progressed with an aim of supporting peaceful co-existence among communities. The construction of a primary school and health centre stand at around one third complete, while the initial works for solar light installation has commenced.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-myanmar-operational-update-january-february-2021
Update on the Situation in Myanmar,News and Press Release,WW,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2021,"Statement from the Asia Program's Lucas Myers., ""On Sunday, March 28th 2021, the United Nations reported that over 107 people were killed the day before by Myanmar’s military in their ongoing, brutal efforts to crack down on a widespread and committed opposition movement. A non-profit monitoring organization, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, reported on the 28th that over 2500 are currently in detention and 459 have been killed., Protests have continued since the first week after the coup launched on February 1st, and the military leadership—despite targeted sanctions from the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, among others—has consistently escalated its level of violence to intimidate and suppress the pro-democracy movement., The continuation of the protests despite the violence inflicted against the people of Myanmar is a testament to the widespread support for democracy in the country. Furthermore, the anti-coup opposition has united diverse factions across Myanmar, including ethnic armed organizations such as the Karen National Union., Looking ahead, the outlook for Myanmar and its people is grim, and the sheer scale of the violence leaves little doubt as to the coup leadership’s intentions of holding onto power. The economy has been devastated and the country is facing looming international isolation, while the coup appears to have triggered renewed violence between the military and the ethnic armed organizations, thereby undoing progress in the already stalled peace process. A regional refugee crisis is now a distinct possibility. Furthermore, many NLD leaders have been arrested, and the continued rollout of criminal charges against ousted State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi demonstrates the military’s desire to eliminate the NLD as a political competitor., Whether this new regime led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing could ever rehabilitate its international image in the West in the manner of the Thai military is seriously in doubt. Regardless, Min Aung Hlaing appears set on weathering the current crisis without compromise and inflicting whatever instability, violence, and economic devastation is necessary for his and the military’s political aggrandizement.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/update-situation-myanmar

At least ten of the 114 killed during the annual Armed Forces Day on 27th March are minors. Almost 1000 children are estimated2 to have been arbitrarily detained to date., The violence against children in Myanmar must stop., Children continue to be hurt or killed by the very forces meant to protect them, within homes and communities, where they should be safe. The brutality and traumatizing scenes unfolding in their lives will leave deep psychological, physical and emotional scars which a lifetime may not heal. The use of intimidation, force, tear gas, rubber bullets and firepower by security forces against children and civilians is unacceptable., World Vision is deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of children. The violence which they face is unacceptable. World Vision is present in the communities we serve, and will continue to stand with children to ensure that they receive the best possible level of support, within a limited INGO operating context. We are distributing food rations and basic necessities to meet survival needs within disrupted communities. We are also supporting livelihoods by providing families that are facing hardship with livestock, animal feed and vegetable seeds., World Vision is witnessing a rise in cases of early marriage, sexual and physical violence against children who are at home and in households that are under financial, physical and mental strain from the current unrest, as well as the aftershocks of COVID-193 . Protracted instability will lead to generational psychological and socio-economic harm. A year of school closures and business disruption due to COVID-19 are set to worsen existing and create new vulnerabilities, increase hardship and poverty across the nation., World Vision stands with fellow signatories of an INGO joint declaration4 which makes clear our humanitarian position, and our clarion “call-to-action"" for all local and international leaders to take concrete and immediate measures to protect children during these challenging times.

On 27 March, airstrikes launched in Hpa-pun District in Kayin State led to the displacement of an unconfirmed number of people from and near the Day Bpoo Noh Village, which is located 20 km away from the border with Thailand. The hostilities and insecurity have also raised fears of further armed clashes among the local population in Ei Thu Hta Village in Hpa-pun Township in Kayin State and more than 2,400 people have fled the area across the border to Thailand on 28 March to seek shelter. Humanitarian partners continue to advocate to be granted access to this group and for them to be transferred to a location where their physical security and essential needs can be addressed., Meanwhile, over 7,100 people remain displaced in Kayin State and Bago region due to armed clashes and insecurity since late December 2020, with many of the displaced families hiding in the jungles in Kayin State. Humanitarian partners continue to face severe challenges in accessing the displaced families, who are in need of emergency assistance, including food and basic household materials.

"Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: COVID-19, access to civil documents and livelihood difficulties, August and September 2020",Situation Report,KHRG,"Agriculture
Protection and Human Rights",26 Feb 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Lenya Bokpyin Special Area [Township], MerguiTavoy District in August and September 2020. In Chaung Mon and Kaw Baw areas, local villagers were barred from operating COVID-19 screening checkpoints by the Myanmar government; and local communities did not receive enough support to cope with the consequences of the pandemic. Ethnic villagers from several localities also experienced challenges in getting their ID cards because they were either discriminated against by Myanmar government staff or unable to obtain the necessary supporting document. Floods and the destruction of farmland by wildlife also resulted in difficulties for local communities., COVID-19, The Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)3 provided some materials for two COVID-19 screening checkpoint in Lenya Bokpyin Special Area. Those COVID-19 screening checkpoints are in A--- village, Kaw Baw area (village tract) and B--- village, Chaung Mon area [village tract]. Those screening checkpoints were established twice: the first time during the first wave of infections [second quarter of 2020] and the second time during the second wave [from mid-August 2020 onwards]. Even though the local population built those two screening checkpoints, they could not do anything [the Myanmar government did not give them permission to run these checkpoints]. [In the absence of functioning screening checkpoints,] local villagers now worry that outsiders might travel to the area [and spread the virus]., On September 6th 2020 local leaders and villagers held a meeting in B--- village to talk about setting up a screening checkpoint. I [KHRG researcher] attended the meeting myself. Although the screening checkpoint was eventually set up, the Myanmar government did not give us [local villagers, local village leaders and local KDHW representatives] permission to do any activities at the checkpoint. In addition, local villagers did not receive any prevention material or support such as money, food, masks or hand sanitizer; and they were not allowed to go to the screening checkpoint either. The Myanmar government village administrator did not do anything for the villagers, and he did not provide any help regarding COVID-19 prevention., U4 Ngway Soe is the [Myanmar government] A--- village administrator. He is a 34-year-old man.
He did not take any responsibility or help the KNU when it comes to the screening checkpoints, but he distributed the support provided by the Myanmar government to the local villagers. Some villagers got 20,000 kyats [USD 14.19] 5 from the Myanmar government. However; most of the villagers had to give him 5,000 kyats [USD 3.55] back to cover the transportation fees. Only 30 households that really needed help got some COVID-19 financial support from the Myanmar government., Access to civil documentation, In September 2020, local villagers from C--- village and D--- village, Nan Ka Plaung village tract, Lenya Bokpyin Special Area [Township] went to E--- village to process their ID cards. They had to sleep there for three to four days but they were not able to get their ID cards. The Myanmar government staff in Pyi Gyi Ma Naing Township said they would not issue ID cards to these villagers because they are not from Pyi Gyi Ma Naing area. They [Myanmar government staff] added that villagers from Htee Hkee area, Lenya Bokpyin Special Area [Township] were rebels, and that they regard this area as a black area [because the Karen National Liberation Army6 is operating there]., Local villagers from C--- and D--- villages are still in the process of trying to obtain ID cards. One villager from D--- village said: “I have lived here for over ten years and I have five children already, but they could not issue ID cards for us yet. I did not get birth certificates for my children either.” Most of the local villagers do not have household registration documents, so they cannot process their ID cards. They do not get birth certificates for their children either., Only a very few households [one or two] have been able to get birth certificates for their children. Birth certificates are usually provided to pregnant women who get their vaccines regularly. Women from these [remote] areas cannot go [to the nearest healthcare facilities] and get vaccines when they are pregnant [as the journey can take up to one day]. Because of the distance, there is no one to notify them about the right time to and get these vaccines either., The Myanmar government staff asked the local villagers originally from other areas but living in C--- and D--- villages to bring recommendation letters [issued by the authorities of their village of origin] with them to be able to process their ID cards. However, the same local villager told KHRG: “My village of origin is very far from here so I cannot go back just to get a recommendation letter.” Local children cannot attend Myanmar government high schools because they do not have ID cards and household registration documents. They can only attend KECD schools. The parents worry for their children’s future as they cannot go to high school to continue with their education., Karen people from H--- village, Kaw Baw village tract can get ID cards easily from the Township [authorities] but they have to pay for it. They have to pay 10,000 kyats [USD 7.10] per person for their ID cards. Although the responsible leaders [Myanmar government township authorities] who issue ID cards said they would be issued for free, the villagers have to pay for them anyway. Some villagers cannot afford this expense [and had to borrow money to be able to afford their ID card]. I [KHRG researcher] could not interview villagers regarding this problem because they are afraid to share this information. I could not take photos either. However, I have been to H--- village myself and I have met with these villagers., Villages such as D---, F---, G--- and C--- are facing the same issues. The villagers from those areas used to flee from the fighting quite often before the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)7 was signed. [Although the security situation has improved], they have to stay on alert and still be careful. Whenever the local villagers hear about any conflicts, they are ready to pack and flee. A local villager interviewed by KHRG said: “We are just ‘runners’. We had to flee whenever the fighting happened in the past, and even now we have to be careful all the time. We are not in peace yet; we still cannot sleep and live peacefully like people from other areas.”, Paddy fields destroyed by elephants, In August and September 2020, wild elephants destroyed many hill paddy farms belonging to local villagers from 15 villages in Chaung Mon and S’Tain areas, Lenya Bokpyin Special Area [Township]. The villagers affected could not prevent their paddies from being destroyed, nor harvest enough rice due to the extent of the damage. They did not get any help from the local leaders. These villagers are now facing livelihood problems, so they need immediate support., Floods, On September 19th and 20th 2020, many villages in Taung Ngae, Chaung Mon and S’Tain areas and in some other plains areas close to the river were hit by floods. The villagers had to move to other places such as highlands or mountain areas. They did not receive any kind of support so they had to arrange everything by themselves. In my [KHRG researcher] perspective, the village heads and the local leaders have many shortcomings because they do not provide any kind of help to the villagers. Almost 300 households were affected by the floods. I witnessed it myself in some areas. Floods happen every year during the rainy season. Therefore, local villagers have to leave their village every rainy season and come back to their area during the summer., Perspective of the researcher, There are many problems in Lenya Bokpyin Special Area. The Myanmar government does not give permission to set up COVID-19 screening checkpoints. Karen people are at risk of ethnic discrimination. Karen people get much less support and the administrators from the Myanmar government do not prioritise and respect Karen communities. I experienced it as well.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mergui-tavoy-district-situation-update-covid-19-access-civil-documents-and-livelihood

They are already at risk of suffering profound physical, psychological, emotional, educational and economic impacts, potentially denying them a healthy, prosperous future., “Security forces must immediately refrain from perpetrating abuses of child rights and ensure the security and safety of children at all times. Security forces should cease the occupation of education facilities. They must also protect all essential workers – including health workers and teachers – providing vital services for children and families., “UNICEF’s commitment to children in Myanmar remains unwavering.

Children are no longer safe in Myanmar, now that girls and boys as young as 7-years old are being shot and killed in their own homes. A one-year old baby was reportedly shot in the eye with a rubber bullet today. Children in Myanmar have a right to grow up free from violence.

Law enforcement officials may only use force when this is absolutely necessary and when all feasible precautions have been taken to ensure respect for human life. The lethal use of firearms must be avoided - unless this is strictly necessary to protect people against an imminent threat to life and when all other less extreme measures are insufficient., The ICRC also recalls that people injured must have unimpeded access to prompt and adequate medical care, without further threats to their safety.

Thousands of people have also been arbitrarily arrested – many subjected to enforced disappearance. Saturday witnessed the bloodiest day since the demonstrations against the coup began, with security forces killing at least 107 individuals – including 7 children – according to multiple credible reports, with the number of deaths expected to rise as reports are confirmed.

Protection and Human Rights",26 Mar 2021,"The escalating violence and imposition of martial law in six Yangon townships has deeply affected LIFT’s peri-urban programmes and is constraining the delivery of essential support and services., Unprecedented economic hardships drive thousands of workers to despair …, The situation in Yangon has taken a dramatic turn for the worse as thousands of families face growing insecurity and are subject to erratic and random violence. At the same time the impact of protracted income cuts, surging food prices, halted health services and lack of remittances take their toll., Many garment factories, a critical source of urban livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of women, have ceased operations with major markets cancelling orders and disruptions being experienced in raw material supply chains. Several of the largest brands sourcing from Myanmar have announced that they will stop all further orders., Furthermore, several factories have been burned and vandalized leaving thousands of people with no income prospects., There are also increasing reports of poor treatment of workers in factories, including locking workers inside factories to prevent from protesting and refusal to pay full wages., Deadly crackdowns on 13 March left 21 persons dead in just one day. With unprecedented economic hardships and growing insecurity, thousands of workers are leaving the city or remain to face chaos and socio-economic misery. Food shortages and food price spikes have already been reported across many townships of Yangon, particularly those under martial law. Coupled with market closures and hindered access to healthcare facilities, this is expected to lead to sharp increases in acute malnutrition among the most vulnerable groups of population., … while key service providers are disabled, Most of LIFT’s essential support and services in Yangon is delivered through non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations (CSOs). Following the military takeover, many of these organizations have paused or limited their activities while they assess the risks, ensure the safety of their personnel and adjust the programmes to the changing context. This has disrupted critical work that was actively improving working conditions and nutrition of individuals living in these areas of Yangon., Meanwhile, disruptions in the banking sector have resulted in a liquidity crisis for organizations’ operations and the intermittent communication connectivity - telephone and internet - has hindered the remote management of activities., While the majority of LIFT’s partners have shifted their activities to provide and expand humanitarian support, psychosocial and legal counselling to migrants and workers, the de facto authorities are taking measures to restrain some of these organizations, including issuing warrants for staff arrest and instructing banks to submit details of the financial transactions of NGO bank accounts since 1 April 2016., LIFT-supported labour organizations, who have been at the vanguard of decent work efforts, are forced to suspend nearly all their activities., While thousands of people are in desperate need of assistance, LIFT’s partners are under distinct pressure., What’s next?, LIFT and partners are mobilizing to provide humanitarian support, including food assistance and cash transfers to workers experiencing a loss of livelihood in Yangon. This should be combined with psychosocial counselling services to workers and emergency medical treatment to CSO staff and others traumatized during the recent crackdowns. LIFT will also support dialogue with international brands to get their suppliers to act responsibly, while increasing legal assistance services for affected workers.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/livelihoods-and-food-security-fund-lift-alarmed-worsening-humanitarian-situation
Myanmar’s deadly coup and the responsibility to protect,News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,25 Mar 2021,"On Friday, 5 March, as the UN Security Council was meeting in its solemn chamber in New York, people across Myanmar held peaceful vigils to protest against the bloody reimposition of military rule in their country. Despite a strict night-time curfew, protesters came into the streets of Yangon and Mandalay to write “We Need R2P” and “R2P – Save Myanmar” in candlelight., As large daily protests continued over the following weeks, thousands more protesters were photographed carrying placards with similar R2P – or “responsibility to protect” – messages. In Tamu town, in the far north-west near the border with India, lines of people marched in white t-shirts with “R2P” printed across them. In Hpa Kant, in Kachin State, people peacefully protested carrying roses and R2P signs. In Kon Chan Kone, young protesters used stencils to spray-paint, “We Need R2P, We Want Democracy” in the streets. Even the waterways have been converted into improvised protest sites, with one photograph showing a pro-R2P message floating near serene rural fields., In short, people all across Myanmar have mobilized to resist the 1 February coup and are calling on the international community to not just condemn what is happening in their country, but to act. The fact that their messages are about R2P and are in English – a language that is only spoken by about 5 percent of Myanmar’s population – points to the fact that they are pleading their case to a global audience., The principle of R2P was adopted by the UN in 2005 and stipulates that the international community has a responsibility to protect people from crimes against humanity, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and genocide. It was an idea that sought to overcome the shame and ignominy after the failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda and at Srebrenica during the 1990s. R2P was a collective commitment to end the politics of indifference and inaction once and for all., In its 15 years of existence, R2P has appeared in more than 90 UN Security Council resolutions, leading to peacekeeping missions being deployed to protect civilians in places like the Central African Republic or South Sudan. It also led to the controversial 2011 military intervention to halt atrocities in Libya and the far less controversial and more successful intervention in Côte d’Ivoire. The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, has also described the ICC as “the legal arm of R2P.” Over the past two decades the ICC has played a crucial role in upholding the international community’s responsibility to protect by bringing notorious perpetrators of atrocity crimes to justice., Contrary to popular misperceptionR2P is not primarily about military intervention. R2P focuses on a range of measures – some consensual, some coercive – aimed at preventing or halting atrocities. And like all human rights norms, R2P is dependent upon political will for meaningful implementation., There is no doubt that since the coup, people in Myanmar are facing potential crimes against humanity and that they deserve protection. The security forces continue to use deadly force against unarmed protesters, killing over 320 people. According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, more than 2,900 people have been arrested and at least four political detainees have died in police custody, with their bodies displaying visible signs of torture., The current crisis in Myanmar has its origins in the past failure of the international community to hold the military, or Tatmadaw, accountable for their crimes. Despite the beginning of a transition from military dictatorship to civilian-led government in 2011, the Tatmadaw continued to wield tremendous power. They also continued to perpetrate atrocities., Most notable in this regard was the 2017 genocide against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State. In 2018 the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded that senior members of the military, including General Min Aung Hlaing – the leader of the 1 February coup – should be prosecuted for genocide as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states., China defended Myanmar’s Generals at the UN Security Council and privately threatened to veto any resolution authorizing international action. As a result, the Council’s only formal response to the Rohingya genocide was the adoption of a tepid Presidential Statement in November 2017. In response to the coup, on 10 March the Council adopted another Presidential Statement that “stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.” But diplomatic statements of concern will not be enough to end the current crisis. That will require decisive action., Some states have already implemented punitive measures. Australia, Canada, United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) all imposed targeted sanctions on senior military officials in response to the Rohingya genocide and some of these have been expanded since the coup. The UK and US have also placed new restrictions on military exports. The European Union has imposed sanctions on 11 senior military officers – including General Min Aung Hlaing – and suspended all development aid. South Korea has suspended defense exchanges. New Zealand has cut all political and military ties and Norway has ended development assistance. The World Bank also halted all withdrawal requests by Myanmar’s new military rulers., A number of major international corporations, including Woodside Energy, Maersk Shipping, H&M and Benneton, are also suspending operations or divesting from Myanmar. The Woodside decision is especially significant as the energy industry provides US$900 million a year to Myanmar – revenue that can fund the military’s repression. Other foreign companies and governments should follow the lead of the US and completely sever ties with any businesses linked to the massive military-controlled conglomerates Myanmar Economic Holdings and Myanmar Economic Corporation. In addition to being an instrument of repression, the Tatmadaw is also a massive economic enterprise that enriches and corrupts its senior officers., The day after the coup, the military were blocked from an attempt to withdraw US$1 billion from a New York bank account. Such actions won’t end the crisis in Myanmar, but they send an important signal to the coup leaders that there will be no “business as usual.” Depriving the generals of access to domestic profits and foreign assets hurts them more than any elegantly worded press statement., Ultimately, halting atrocities in Myanmar will also require action by regional powers. On 2 March ASEAN – Southeast Asia’s regional organization – called on “all parties to refrain from violence,” a statement that seems appallingly at odds with the reality that Myanmar’s security forces are gunning down unarmed protesters in the streets. General Min Aung Hlaing is relying on ASEAN’s traditional “non-interference” doctrine to enable him to normalize relations, but ASEAN should absolutely refuse to trade with, or recognize, the illegitimate military regime. Diplomatic pressure and targeted sanctions by key states like Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia could still have a major impact., It is also worth noting the nonchalance of India, the other regional superpower that shares a border with Myanmar and is currently serving on the UN Security Council. The neighboring Indian state of Mizoram has welcomed recent defectors from Myanmar’s security forces, but New Delhi’s response to the coup has been surprisingly muted., Without determined Asian leadership it is unclear what, if anything, the UN Security Council will do. Russia is content to ignore both the coup and the crackdown. But China’s predicament is more difficult than it appears. Above all else, China desires peace and prosperity on its borders and the coup offers neither. The ongoing strikes and country-wide protests have made Myanmar ungovernable for the military. This is precisely why Myanmar’s neighbors need to force Beijing to choose between protecting murderous generals who are endangering its interests, or play the role of global powerbroker and help negotiate an end to military rule in Myanmar., Regardless, the other members of the UN Security Council should immediately put forward a draft resolution to establish an arms embargo and sanction General Min Aung Hlaing and his acolytes. The Council should also refer the situation in Myanmar to the ICC. If China threatens to veto such action, they should be forced to do so in front of the eyes of the world and not permitted to privately defend Myanmar’s generals without facing opprobrium themselves., Almost two months since the coup, the bravery and resilience of the civil disobedience movement, combined with the proliferation of R2P messages, has sent a powerful signal to the rest of the world. The Global Centre’s Jaclyn Streitfeld-Hall wrote on Twitter that, “for anyone who has ever thought that R2P was just an abstract term reserved for the UN in NY with no practical meaning for the people it’s meant to protect, the signs, shirts, etcetera, emblazoned with R2P in Myanmar this month show otherwise. They know states have a responsibility.”, It’s time to listen to those who are crying out for protection and finally hold Myanmar’s generals accountable for their crimes. Or to quote one Myanmar protester who recently wrote to me, “Sir, I know that you all are doing your best, but please keep on pushing. I humbly request. Our lives are at stake.”, SOURCE

Myanmar: UN expert urges emergency summit to head off deepening crisis,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Mar 2021,"GENEVA (25 March 2021) – The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, today warned that the pace and scope of the international response to the military coup in Myanmar is falling short of what is required to head off a deepening crisis., Andrews called on UN Member States, including those in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union, the United States and China, to hold an emergency summit of all stakeholders, including the duly elected illegally deposed parliamentarians who make up the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH)., “Conditions in Myanmar are deteriorating,” he said, “but they will likely get much worse without an immediate robust, international response in support of those under siege., “It is imperative that the international community heed the recent call of UN Secretary-General António Guterres for a ‘firm, unified international response’,” Andrews said. “To date, however, the limited sanctions imposed by Member States do not cut the junta’s access to revenue that help sustain its illegal activities, and the slow pace of diplomacy is out of step with the scale of the crisis., “The incremental approach to sanctions has left the most lucrative business assets of the junta unscathed. It needs to be replaced by robust action that includes a diplomatic offensive designed to meet the moment.”, Andrews stressed that he is receiving reports indicating that the situation in Myanmar is in danger of spiralling further out of control and warned of a dramatic increase in loss of life., “Without a focused, diplomatic solution, including the hosting of an emergency summit that brings together Myanmar’s neighbours and those countries with great influence in the region, I fear the situation of human rights in Myanmar will further deteriorate as the junta increases the rate of murders, enforced disappearances and torture,” he said., “It is critical that the people of Myanmar, the CRPH, and opposition leaders and activists see that the international community is working towards a diplomatic solution in support of the peaceful Civil Disobedience Movement. This combined course of action — domestic peaceful resistance, sustained pressure, and international diplomatic momentum — will have a greater chance for success than taking up arms and will save untold numbers of lives., “Member States have an opportunity to demonstrate this alternative, but the window in which this can be achieved is closing rapidly. I fear that the international community has only a short time remaining to act.”, ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

Myanmar: Elected lawmaker group declared illegal,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,25 Mar 2021,"Use of Unlawful Associations Act Expands Risks for Activists, Journalists, (Bangkok) – The Myanmar military junta’s designation of the group representing Myanmar’s elected government as an “unlawful association” raises the risks of arrest for anti-coup activists and journalists reporting on the group, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling State Administration Council should immediately repeal the abusive 1957 Unlawful Associations Act., On March 21, 2021, the State Administration Council issued an order declaring the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and “its affiliated committees” to be an unlawful association under the country’s Unlawful Associations Act. Under the colonial-era law, Myanmar’s president can declare illegal any association he believes “has as its object interference with the administration of the law or with the maintenance of law and order,” or “constitutes a danger to the public peace.” Once a group has been designated unlawful, the law criminalizes almost any contact with or support of the group., “The Unlawful Associations Act has an unsavory history of being used to prosecute political activists and journalists reporting on opposition groups,” said Linda Lakhdhir, Asia legal advisor at Human Rights Watch. “By making the CRPH illegal, Myanmar’s junta is raising the stakes not only for its members, but for anyone supporting, writing on, or even just contacting the group.”, Under section 17(1) of the Unlawful Associations Act, anyone who “is a member of an unlawful association, or takes part in meetings of any such association, or contributes or receives or solicits any contribution for the purpose of any such association, or in any way assists the operations of any such association” faces a minimum of two years and a maximum of three years in prison., Under section 17(2), anyone who “manages or assists in the management of an unlawful association, or promotes or assists in promoting a meeting of any such association, or of any members thereof” faces a minimum of three years and a maximum of five years in prison., The Unlawful Associations Act was frequently used in the 1990s to arbitrarily detain political activists. It has also been used to arrest and detain ethnic minority civilians in conflict-affected areas. After the Arakan Army was designated an unlawful association in March 2020, the law was used to arrest and prosecute dozens of people in Rakhine State for allegedly supporting the ethnic armed group., The law has also been used to arrest and prosecute people for mere contact with an ethnic armed group, including two interfaith activists who were sentenced to two years at hard labor for allegedly visiting the Kachin Independence Army, and three reporters who traveled to cover and report on a drug burning ceremony held by the Ta’ang National Liberation Army., Aung Marm Oo, the chief editor of the Development Media Group, has been in hiding since learning, in May 2019, that police filed charges against him under the Unlawful Associations Act. Although the police never provided him with any written notice detailing the grounds for the charges, he believes the charges are linked to the media group’s reporting on the conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army. Past practice indicates a high likelihood that the law will be used against journalists and others reporting on CRPH activities, Human Rights Watch said., Journalists in Myanmar are already under serious threat from the military junta. Since the February 1 coup, the State Administration Council has banned five media outlets and arrested and detained nearly 40 journalists. Ten journalists have been charged with violating section 505A of the Penal Code, a broad new provision adopted by the junta. Under section 505A, anyone who makes comments that “cause fear,” spreads “false news,” or “agitates directly or indirectly a criminal offense against a Government employee” faces up to three years in prison., “The Unlawful Associations Act is an abusive colonial relic that should have been consigned to the dustbin years ago,” Lakhdhir said. “The junta should repeal the law and drop all charges under it that are currently pending.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-elected-lawmaker-group-declared-illegal

ETAN Calls for End to Military Coup and Repression in Myanmar,News and Press Release,ETAN,Protection and Human Rights,22 Mar 2021,"As the death toll continues to climb and resistance to military rule in Myanmar continues, the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) strongly condemns the February 1 military coup d’état in Myanmar (formerly Burma) and the ongoing violence being perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the people. We call for an immediate end to military rule and repression., ETAN stands in solidarity with the people of Myanmar as they once again are called on to resist military oppression. Our hearts and encouragement are with them, and ETAN activists around the world are working to get our own governments to support their rights. We applaud the resilience of the people of Myanmar and join with people across Southeast Asia, including in Timor-Leste and Indonesia, who stand in solidarity with them., Since ETAN’s inception nearly 30 years ago, we have campaigned against U.S. government military and diplomatic support for authoritarian regimes and their human rights violations. We come together with people of conscience everywhere to urge corporations and governments to be on the right side of history., We call on the U.S. government to immediately end all financial, economic and political support to the Myanmar military regime. We urge all U.S. and transnational corporations not to support the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) through natural resource extraction, online services, or other economic activities., We urge all governments, especially Myanmar’s ASEAN and other neighbors, to similarly sever ties with Myanmar’s security forces by ending any weapons sales to, joint exercises with, and training of its military and police. As the world learned from the victorious struggle of the people of Timor-Leste against Indonesia’s illegal occupation, determined resistance can overcome even the most brutal military force. Such regimes lose their last shreds of legitimacy when they declare martial law, censor the media, imprison peaceful advocates, and attack and murder public protesters. Reprehensible acts like these strengthen the resolve of the people to reclaim their rights, and of people everywhere to act in solidarity., The military in Myanmar must immediately end its assault on its people, free any political prisoners, and step aside to allow the elected government to resume its work by respecting democracy and ensuring the human rights of everyone in the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/etan-calls-end-military-coup-and-repression-myanmar

"Dooplaya District Short Update: Skirmish between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA in Kaw T’Ree Township, February 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,19 Mar 2021,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Yay Kyaw Gyi village tract, Kaw T’Ree [Kawkareik] Township, Dooplaya District on February 26th 2021. On that day, Tatmadaw soldiers entered a Karen National Union (KNU) restricted area, resulting in a skirmish with the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Tatmadaw soldiers eventually stayed in the area until March 1st 2021, which raised security concerns among the local population. According to the KNLA, the Tatmadaw tried to enter KNU territory in order to arrest people involved in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and anti-coup protests., On February 26th 2021, at 11:40 am, fighting between the KNLA Brigade #6, Battalion #18, Company #3 and the Tatmadaw Infantry Battalion (IB) #230 and IB #231, Military Operations Command (MOC) #12 broke out in the area between Ywar Thit Kone village and Thar Yar Kone village, Yay Kyaw Gyi village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District [these two villages are located at a 15 to 20-minute motorbike drive from Kawkareik Town]. The two armed groups first fired at each other with small arms. Later on, local villagers heard the sound of artillery [mortars]. The fighting lasted for around 16 minutes., The skirmish broke out after Tatmadaw soldiers entered a KNU-restricted area[10] without permission from the KNLA. According to the KNLA Brigade #6 operations commander, the Tatmadaw called the KNU township administrator and told him that they would patrol KNU-controlled areas to look for and arrest teachers and doctors [mainly from Kawkareik Town and nearby areas] who joined the CDM and anti-coup protests [some of them sought refuge in KNU-controlled areas to avoid arrest]. The township administrator informed the commander of KNLA Battalion #18 about the Tatmadaw’s request. The battalion commander denied them permission and even told the Tatmadaw not to enter the restricted area three or four times before the incident, warning them that fighting would break out if they do. However, the Tatmadaw ignored the warning., On the day of the incident, a three-truck Tatmadaw convoy entered the restricted area through Ywar Thit Kone Road. According to a local villager, there are usually not many soldiers manning the KNLA checkpoint along this road – only four or five. However, there were around 25 to 30 soldiers [an entire platoon] on that day, as the KNLA had decided to deploy more troops in the area because of the recent anti-coup protests. These KNLA soldiers fired at the truck heading the convoy, prompting the Tatmadaw soldiers to return fire. The two other trucks were not involved in the skirmish., There were around 30 Tatmadaw soldiers in the trucks. One of the trucks was covered, so eyewitnesses could not see what was inside. However, local villagers said that it was transporting metal barrels. The Tatmadaw soldiers retreated after the skirmish. According to a local villager, three Tatmadaw soldiers died and four of them were injured in the fighting. An ambulance and four Tatmadaw trucks arrived at the incident place later that day. Local villagers were afraid so they stayed in their houses and did not dare to go to the incident place to check on the situation., Later that day, Tatmadaw soldiers arrived at Ywar Thit Kone and Thar Yar Kone villages and spent the night there without asking permission from anyone. Around 25 soldiers stayed in each village, and some soldiers stayed between the two villages. They stayed near the Asian Highway and stood clear of the restricted area to avoid further skirmishes with the KNLA. It seems that the soldiers still planned to find and arrest the public servants who joined the CDM., Local villagers were in fear throughout the night because of the presence of Tatmadaw soldiers. Some of them gathered and slept together. Male villagers from both villages went into hiding every night as they were afraid of being arrested and forced to serve as porters. This also happened in other nearby villages. More Tatmadaw soldiers were sent to Kawkareik Town after the incident. On February 27th 2021, a Tatmadaw truck brought rations to the soldiers stationed in Ywar Thit Kone and Thar Yar Kone villages. The Tatmadaw soldiers eventually left the area on March 1st 2021 [without arresting anyone].",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-short-update-skirmish-between-tatmadaw-and-knla-kaw-t-ree-township

"Myanmar: UN experts raise alarm over forced evictions, escalation of rights violations",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2021,"GENEVA (18 March 2021) – UN human rights experts* today deplored allegations of forced evictions, arbitrary detention and killings of pro-democracy protesters in Myanmar, saying States should consider applying the principle of universal jurisdiction to prosecute those responsible for acts that may amount to crimes against humanity., Since last Friday at least 121 people have been killed by security forces. More than 2,400 people have been detained and the whereabouts of hundreds are unknown, since the military rulers ousted the democratically elected Government on 1 February 2021., Among the actions reported to UN experts was a police and military raid last week lasting several hours in the Mingalar Taung Nyunt neighbourhood of Yangon, a compound housing around 960 employees of Myanmar Railways and their families. Many of the railway staff and their families were forcibly evicted at gunpoint as punishment for their participation in a nation-wide general strike., “Forced evictions constitute a gross violation of the right to adequate housing and several other human rights. These actions must stop immediately,” the experts said. “Those affected must be allowed to return to their homes and property, and those responsible brought to justice.”, There have also been reports of forced evictions in other parts of the country, including in Chin State (Hakka and Falam), Sagaing State (Homalin) and Shan State (Taungyyi)., The experts deplored the persecution and intimidation of pro-democracy protesters, including alleged arbitrary detentions, summary executions and killings of protesters. Live rounds have also been fired randomly at private homes., “The response of the security forces to the protests is getting more and more violent. We are very troubled by the excessive and deadly use of force and the imposition of martial law in parts of Myanmar. We call on the security forces to cease all violence against peaceful protests, and respect their right to peaceful protest,” the experts said., “These incidents form part of a disturbing emerging pattern of systematic and widespread attacks against the civilian population of Myanmar, and those responsible should be held criminally responsible under international law. States may therefore investigate and prosecute any commander or perpetrator responsible for these acts, including under the principle of universal jurisdiction.”, The UN human rights experts have previously raised their concerns with Myanmar., ENDS, The experts: Mr. Balakrishnan Rajagopal, Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living; Ms. Agnes Callamard, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution; Mr. Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the right to peaceful assembly and association; Ms. Leigh Toomey (Chair-Rapporteur), Ms. Elina Steinerte (Vice-Chair), Ms. Miriam Estrada-Castillo, Mr. Mumba Malila and Mr. Seong-Phil Hong, Working Group on Arbitrary Detention., The Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Safety and Security",17 Mar 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MASS KILLINGS BY MYANMAR’S MILITARY MAY AMOUNT TO CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, More than 50 people were killed on Sunday, 14 March, marking the bloodiest day since Myanmar’s military overthrew the civilian-led government on 1 February. Security forces were filmed firing into crowds with live ammunition, destroying civilian property and attacking medical volunteers. Since then, Myanmar’s military has imposed martial law in several townships in and around the country’s largest cities – Yangon and Mandalay. Under martial law, civilian protesters can be tried in military courts with no right of appeal. The military has also shut down internet access in an attempt to stop activists communicating with each other and the outside world., According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), at least 149 people have been killed by the security forces since 1 February, although credible reports from inside Myanmar suggest that the death toll may possibly be as high as 200 people. OHCHR also confirmed that at least five people have died while in the custody of the security forces, with at least two bodies showing signs of torture. According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, at least 2,181 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced since the coup., In his address to the UN Human Rights Council on 11 March, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said that abuses committed by the military since the coup may amount to crimes against humanity. The security forces have repeatedly and recklessly used tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, stun grenades and live ammunition against unarmed protesters., On 15 March UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was “appalled by the escalating violence in Myanmar at the hands of the country’s military” and urged the international community to “work collectively and bilaterally to help bring an end to the repression.”, At mass protests across Myanmar, people continue to call on the international community to uphold its Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and stop the deadly violence of the security forces. “The concept of R2P emerged in response to the failure of the international community to adequately respond to atrocities committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s,” stressed Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. “It is essential that the UN Security Council, as well Myanmar’s neighbors and all governments around the world, heed the pleas of the people in Myanmar and address the threat of further crimes against humanity. Only decisive collective diplomatic action can prevent a further loss of life in Myanmar.”, FAMINE AND FOOD INSECURITY LEAVE MILLIONS AT RISK IN SOUTH SUDAN, Seven million people – roughly sixty percent of the population – are acutely food insecure in South Sudan as a result of endemic conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. These are the highest levels of food insecurity and malnutrition recorded since South Sudan’s independence in July 2011. Robert Mardini, Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross, noted that despite facing “one of the most complex humanitarian crises anywhere,” South Sudan is now a “forgotten conflict.”, On Monday, 15 March, the Human Rights Division of the UN Mission in South Sudan reported that violence by community-based militias has significantly increased and that these groups have been responsible for the majority of conflict-related civilian casualties since the signing of the country’s 2018 peace agreement. The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS) has also reported that levels of localized violence are possibly higher than during the country’s 2013-2018 civil war and are often fueled and exploited by government and military officials. The CHRSS noted that many structural risk factors that facilitated the commission of atrocities in the past, remain present today., During the civil war both government troops and opposition forces deliberately used the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. In his remarks to a UN Security Council thematic debate on 11 March, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, “if you don’t feed people, you feed conflict. Conflict drives hunger and famine, and hunger and famine drive conflict.”, President Salva Kiir and the transitional government should urgently address the high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in their country. The government must ensure rapid, unhindered and sustained access to vital humanitarian aid for all people in South Sudan, regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation. The international community should continue to support essential life-saving humanitarian programs., In keeping with the terms of the 2018 peace agreement, the government must also help break the cycle of impunity by establishing the Hybrid Court for South Sudan and other transitional justice mechanisms. Until these mechanisms are fully operational, the CHRSS needs to be enabled to continue its crucial work. Next week, members of the UN Human Rights Council should support the renewal of the Commission, including its current mandate to investigate, collect and preserve evidence of atrocity crimes., AFGHAN CIVILIANS CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED DESPITE PEACE TALKS, Despite the ongoing negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan, deadly attacks on civilians continue across the country. On 12 March a car bomb attack in western Herat province killed or maimed more than 60 people. The previous week seven factory workers from the minority Hazara community were shot and killed. Four women – one doctor and three media workers – were also targeted and assassinated in Jalalabad during the first week of March., These killings are part of a growing pattern of attacks on civilians that have dramatically increased since the Taliban and the Afghan government began intra-Afghan negotiations in September 2020. According to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 2,792 civilians were killed or wounded between September and December alone., Recent gun and bomb attacks have targeted civil servants, members of the judiciary, media personnel, healthcare workers, politicians, human rights defenders and humanitarian workers. Many of these attacks have targeted professional women as well as members of ethnic and religious minority communities. These attacks are potential war crimes and have also included the use of indiscriminate improvised explosive devices in civilian populated areas. Some journalists and civil servants have been forced to flee the country, while others live in constant fear., The Afghan government has blamed the Taliban for most recent attacks on civilians, although the group denies responsibility. Armed extremists from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan group have claimed responsibility for some attacks., Jahaan Pittalwala, Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “all parties in Afghanistan must cease targeted attacks on civilians and uphold their obligations under international law. Those involved in intra-Afghan negotiations must respect the human rights of all Afghans and commit to a lasting negotiated settlement of the armed conflict.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-244-myanmar-burma-south-sudan-and-afghanistan

It is estimated that one in four Myanmar people are migrants either internally or internationally. Migrants are among the most impacted by the ongoing political crisis. Most recently, violent crackdowns reached Yangon's western industrial Hlaing Thar Yar township, which hosts the largest population of internal migrants in Myanmar., The fear of insecurity triggered the desperate return of hundreds of thousands of migrants to their communities of origin in search of safety and security. IOM expresses profound concern over the escalating use of force by military and security forces against peaceful protestors and reaffirms its longstanding and firm commitment to support migrants and the vulnerable, and ensure that humanitarian and life-saving assistance reaches those most in need., Recognizing the critical linkages between a strengthened civil society, community resilience and the preservation of the democratic space, IOM highly values partnerships with civil society organizations. We work together to ensure that support interventions are tailored to the needs of migrants and vulnerable communities. The views and safety of civil society organizations are at the heart of IOM's response to this crisis, and they remain an essential foundation for encouraging a return to the democratic transition., IOM and its partners will continue doing their utmost to ensure that essential support reaches migrants and migrant-sending communities across Myanmar despite the challenging circumstances., We call for the immediate cessation of violence, as well as for the protection and recognition of the fundamental rights and aspirations of migrants, of the vulnerable, and of all the people of Myanmar., For more information, please contact Itayi Viriri at the IOM Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok, Tel: +63 916 237 0574, Email: iviriri@iom.int or Paul Dillon, IOM Geneva, Tel: +41 79 636 9874, Email: pdillon@iom.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/full-support-democracy-peace-rule-law-myanmar-iom-statement

A separate incident of shelling on 11 March in Kamaing Township reportedly injured four people, including two children. Kachin State, which has not seen major hostilities since 2018, already hosts around 96,000 people in protracted displacement camps established in 2011.
Meanwhile, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned that rising food and fuel prices since 1 February have impacted local supply chains and markets. Many parts of the country have experienced an increase in the cost of rice and fuel, with significant increase in prices for these commodities in conflict-affected areas, including in Kachin and Rakhine. WFP is building a contingency food stock to ensure continuation of life-saving monthly cash and food distributions to over 360,000 vulnerable people living in conflict-affected areas., TIMOR-LESTE, In Timor-Leste’s remote Fatumean sub-district, an estimated 980 households remain in lockdown after reporting a cluster of COVID-19 cases.

Furthermore, an estimated 120,000 people will be affected by flood from March to June 2021. Spring is also expected to see a volatile and unpredictable pattern of conflict. Approximately 250,000 people are projected to be displaced from March to June, which represents 50 per cent of those projected for all of 2021.

Deeply distressing reports of torture in custody have also emerged. Hundreds of people who have been unlawfully detained remain unaccounted for and have not been acknowledged by the military authorities, and this amounts to enforced disappearances., Confirming information is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly with the imposition of martial law in a number of townships in and around Yangon and in Mandalay, but also because many of the working class neighbourhoods where people have been killed and displaced are easier to cut off through State-imposed communication blackouts., We have, however, managed to confirm that at least 149 people have been arbitrarily deprived of their lives since 1 February, as a result of unlawful use of lethal force against peaceful protestors in Myanmar. Of these, at least 11 were killed on Monday, and 57 over the weekend. There are many more reports of further killings that we have been not been able to corroborate yet., These figures include people killed during a violent crackdown in the Hlaing Tharyar, a township in Yangon, by security forces after unknown actors set fire to Chinese-operated or invested factories. The military authorities also declared martial law in a number of townships in and around Yangon and Mandalay. Under these terms, military law would apply to civilians with both stricter curfews and subjecting offenders to military tribunals with no right of appeal., Arrests and detentions have continued throughout the country, with more than 2,084 people remaining arbitrarily detained. At least 37 journalists have been arrested, of whom 19 remain in arbitrary detention. At least five deaths in custody have occurred in recent weeks, and at least two victims' bodies have shown signs of severe physical abuse indicating that they were tortured., We are deeply disturbed that the crackdown continues to intensify, and we again call on the military to stop killing and detaining protestors.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 Mar 2021,"NAYPYITAW, MYANMAR – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today warned of rising food and fuel prices as the current political unrest starts to impact supply chains and markets., WFP’s food price monitoring shows that food prices are trending upwards in some urban areas with the retail price of palm oil up 20 percent since the start of February in the peri-urban areas of the main city Yangon, and rice prices in the peri-urban areas of Yangon and Mandalay also up 4 percent since the last week of February., Across the country, the cost of rice showed an average increase of 3 percent on monitored markets from mid-January to mid-February. However, in a few townships in Kachin state, such as Bhamo and Putao, the increases are 20-35 percent., “These initial signs are troubling, especially for the most vulnerable people who were already living meal-to-meal,” said WFP Myanmar Country Director Stephen Anderson. “Coming on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, if these price trends continue they will severely undermine the ability of the poorest and most vulnerable to put enough food on the family table.”, Steep spikes in oil prices have been observed in northern Rakhine where the average retail price of cooking oil increased by 27 percent from January to February, and in Maungdaw township the price of pulses jumped 15 percent. Increases in the price of cooking oil have also been observed in central Rakhine State (11 percent) and in Tanintharyi Region (14 percent)., WFP has also noted an increase of 15 percent in the cost of fuel countrywide since 1 February, raising concerns about further food price hikes. In northern Rakhine, the price of petrol has increased by 33 percent and diesel by 29 percent., These rising food and fuel prices are compounded by the near paralysis of the banking sector, slowdowns in remittances, and widespread limits on cash availability., In order to ensure life-saving monthly cash and food distributions continue to over 360,000 people – mainly internally displaced and living in camps – WFP is building a contingency food stock, which would allow a switch from cash to in-kind food assistance in case cash availability continues to be limited, or market supply is constrained., “WFP reiterates the call of the United Nations Secretary-General for the will of the Myanmar people expressed in recent elections to be respected,” said Anderson. “At WFP we know all too well how hunger can quickly follow when peace and dialogue are sidelined.”, WFP’s food price data were collected from more than 70 townships, across 100 markets and 250 plus separate traders and shops. While monitoring the new trends closely, WFP’s first priority is to ensure its monthly life-saving food assistance continues to reach those in need., For details on price changes, please visit WFP’s Market Monitoring Dashboard., The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.

Myanmar Junta Expands Crackdown Following Bloodbath,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,15 Mar 2021,"Internet, Mobile Shutdowns Violate Rights, Hinder Access to Information, Richard Weir
Researcher, Crisis and Conflict Division, Streets throughout Myanmar were stained again on Sunday with the blood of dozens of protesters gunned down by government security forces. Local media reports indicate it was the deadliest day since the February 1 coup, with many of the killings taking place in Hlaing Tharyar, a township dominated by garment factories on the outskirts of Yangon, the country’s most populous city., But the details of the violence and other abuses have been increasingly hard to document., As night fell on March 14, the junta imposed martial law in several townships across Yangon and began to enforce additional restrictions. At 1 a.m., as has been the case for the past month, the junta blocked access to the internet nationwide. But this time, instead of lifting restrictions in the morning, authorities continued to block mobile networks, which most people in Myanmar rely on for internet access., It is not surprising these restrictions come after many scenes of horrific violence by security forces were documented and shared via mobile devices. The junta’s unlawful attempt to block access to this information and avoid scrutiny for continued rights violations against protesters should be condemned and the restrictions lifted., Under international human rights standards, internet-based restrictions must be according to law, necessary, and proportionate. Blanket internet shutdowns are a form of collective punishment. They hinder access to information and communications needed for daily life, which is particularly vital during times of crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Shutdowns can also endanger lives in humanitarian crises, an acute concern in Myanmar where over one million people require some form of humanitarian assistance., As security forces intensify their brutal response against people taking to the streets, the need for international coordinated action against the junta also intensifies., Carefully worded statements by the United Nations Security Council mean little if not backed by resolutions imposing real costs on the junta. The Security Council should impose targeted sanctions on the junta leaders and military-owned companies providing direct revenue to the military and its leaders. It should immediately implement a global arms embargo on Myanmar’s military and police that includes any security assistance. Failing to do so will only embolden the military’s intent on maintaining power through the barrel of a gun.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-junta-expands-crackdown-following-bloodbath

Statement by Thomas H. Andrews UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar United Nations Human Rights Council,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2021,"11 March 2021, Madam President, Distinguished members of the United Nations Human Rights Council,, One month ago, I addressed this body in a special session on the crisis in Myanmar. At that time, ten days after the illegal military coup d’état had begun, I reported that the junta had murdered one individual and arbitrarily detained over 200. In the written report that I filed last week, I documented a total of 23 murders. Credible reports indicate that, as of today, Myanmar security forces have murdered at least 70 people., Madame President, those murdered were fathers, sons, mothers, daughters, husbands, and wives. They were educators, they were engineers; they were students, they were many ages, but more than half of those murdered were members of Generation Z, or young people under the age of 25., It is a horrible truth that as soon as I issue a report, the number of murders and arbitrary detentions in Myanmar become outdated. The junta is detaining dozens, sometimes hundreds, every day. As of last night, the total number of arbitrary arrests and detentions since 1 February had risen beyond 2,000, and the violence against protesters, including violence against people sitting peacefully in their homes, is steadily increasing., In addition to the murders and detentions, there is extensive video evidence of security forces viciously beating protesters, medics, and bystanders. There is video of soldiers and police systematically moving through neighborhoods, destroying property, looting shops, arbitrarily arresting protesters and passersby, and firing indiscriminately into people’s homes. There is shocking video of the aftermath of attacks, including fatal gunshot wounds to the heads of protesters, and video of soldiers dragging or carrying away the dead bodies of their victims., As I documented in my report, the junta has systematically destroyed legal protections, from freedom of expression, assembly and association, to the right to privacy. It has given itself the authority to invade people’s homes without warning; removed habeas corpus, or the right to appear before a judge to determine whether an arrest is lawful; criminalized any criticism of the junta (even making it illegal to call the junta a “junta”); enabled sweeping surveillance authorities; decimated the free press; banned most trade unions; instituted nightly, countrywide Internet outages; and banned gatherings of more than five people., Madam President, the country of Myanmar is being controlled by a murderous, illegal regime. Its current leadership perpetrated the atrocity crimes that are the focus of the charge of genocide before the International Court of Justice. And as I document in the annex to my report, the crimes against Rohingya people have continued. Throughout 2020, Myanmar security forces engaged in torture, murder, and enforced disappearances of Rohingya, killing at least 33, in violation of the International Court of Justice’s Provisional Measures Order., Since the coup, the Myanmar military has attacked and forcibly displaced several thousand members of ethnic nationalities from their homes., It should come as little surprise that there is growing evidence that this same Myanmar military, led by the same senior leadership, is now likely engaging in crimes against humanity, including the acts of murder, enforced disappearance, persecution, torture, and imprisonment in violation of fundamental rules of international law., Of course, a full investigation and a trial before a court of law are required to formally find crimes against humanity. And I know that the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar is collecting evidence on this point right now, but I implore all of you to look at the facts currently available, in light of international legal precedent finding crimes against humanity., Crimes against humanity require one or more prohibited criminal acts “committed as a part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.”, A growing body of reporting is making it increasingly clear that these murders, imprisonments, enforced disappearances, and other acts against the people of Myanmar are:, part of a coordinated campaign rather than a series of isolated events;, directed against the civilian population rather than combatants;, widespread in their frequency—with over 2,000 people arbitrarily detained—and with people murdered in at least 28 townships throughout the county;, well organized, with coordinated efforts by police and military pointing to higher-level command and control. In other words, this attack on the people is “systematic” rather than accidental; and,, being carried out with the knowledge of senior leadership. Indeed, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the junta, has repeatedly commented on the attacks and the junta issued a warning on state media of the “loss of life” if protests continue. Protests indeed continued, and more peaceful protesters lost their lives., Madame President, if we accept that there is a strong likelihood that the Myanmar junta is engaged in atrocity crimes against its own people right now, as we sit here, what do we do about it?, Knowing, as we do, the price of international inaction, what action must be taken immediately?, Yesterday, the UN Security Council released a statement expressing their deep concern about developments in Myanmar. They condemned the violence against peaceful protesters and expressed continued support for a democratic transition., These words are welcome. But, they are wholly insufficient., Madame President, the people of Myanmar are desperate. They are upholding and defending the highest principles of this body and the United Nations, including their commitment to non-violence. But these principles, and their very lives, are under vicious attack., The people of Myanmar need not only words of support but supportive ACTION. They need the help of the international community, now., I realize that not every nation is prepared to act. But, the reluctance of a few nations to act should not prohibit the coordinated action of those that are. The coordinated actions of nations working together will be the most effective actions. Various governments have imposed various sanctions against the military junta in Myanmar. This is welcome, but sanctions will only be truly effective if they are unified and coordinated., Today, I am therefore urging member states to commit to taking strong, decisive, and coordinated action as a coalition of nations - an emergency Coalition for the People of Myanmar., Upon forming, I urge this coalition of member states to consider five immediate steps:, One and a half years ago, the Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded that no business “should enter into an economic or financial relationship with the security forces of Myanmar, in particular the military, or any enterprise owned or controlled by them or their individual members, until and unless they are restructured and transformed…”, Since the coup, some businesses stepped forward and cut ties with the junta, and they are highlighted in my written report. However, many continue to engage in business with military owned enterprises. If companies won’t willingly disengage, member states should compel them through sanctions., Myanmar’s natural gas projects will generate an estimated $1 billion in revenue this year. Without sanctions, the illegal military junta in Myanmar will be able to use these funds to support their criminal enterprise and their attacks on innocent people. More than 400 civil society organizations in Myanmar share my concern as reflected in a joint statement calling on the international community to ensure that oil and gas revenues are used only for humanitarian purposes or held until the legal control of the resources of the Government of Myanmar can be established. The emergency Coalition for the People of Myanmar should enact sanctions that include the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise to ensure that oil and gas revenues do not flow to the junta., 3.Member states that have universal jurisdiction laws should initiate investigations of these ongoing crimes and make preparations to file charges against Myanmar’s senior security officials., Stop the flow of humanitarian and development aid through the junta. Work directly with local civil society and aid organizations whenever possible., Finally, I urge Member states to deny recognition of the military junta as the legitimate government representing the people of Myanmar precisely because they are not., These are but some of the actions that nations, working together, can take to fulfill our collective responsibility. Others can be considered. But what is critically important is that Member states coordinate their actions and work together in a coalition committed to standing with and for a people under attack., Despite the widespread and systematic atrocities that the Myanmar military and Police Force are committing daily, the people of Myanmar continue to rise up from every corner of the nation as a diverse yet powerfully unified whole. They are doing so to demand democracy, human rights, an immediate end to the violence and an end to the illegitimate junta. The nonviolent civil disobedience movement, or CDM, is effective and growing, drawing its organic power from the unflinching commitment of the Myanmar people. Myanmar has never appeared to be more unified., But, they need our help and they need it now., Madame President, I sincerely hope that the international community will rise to the occasion of this historic moment by following the lead and inspiration of the people of Myanmar, by coming to their aid as a coordinated and committed whole., They deserve no less., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-thomas-h-andrews-un-special-rapporteur-situation-human-rights-myanmar

More than 60 people have been killed since the 1 February military coup ousted the civilian-led government. At least three protesters were shot dead on Monday, 8 March, in Myitkyina and Pyapon. A local National League for Democracy (NLD) official from Yangon, Khin Maung Latt, died on Sunday, 7 March, after being detained by police. His body reportedly displayed signs of torture. Since then two other NLD officials have also died in custody., According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, at least 2,008 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced since the coup took place. Despite the deadly crackdown, daily demonstrations continue in defiance of the military’s state of emergency, and strikes have brought much of Myanmar’s economy to a halt., On Sunday, 7 March, soldiers occupied and established operation centers in at least 20 universities, schools and hospitals around the country, including in Yangon, Mandalay, Magway, Monywa and Ayeyarwady. The military also continues to block media coverage of the protests and on Monday the junta stripped licenses from five independent media outlets – Myanmar Now, Mizzima, DVB, 7 Days and Khitthit media., The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, briefed the UN Security Council (UNSC) during a closed meeting on Friday, 5 March. Special Envoy Burgener called for a “robust and timely” response to stop the violence and said that “there is an urgency for collective action. How much more can we allow the Myanmar military to get away with?”, Meanwhile, protesters across Myanmar continue to call for the international community to uphold its responsibility to protect (R2P) and urgently respond to violence by the security forces. Photos continue to emerge on social media showing “We need R2P” and similar messages on protest placards and written in candlelight on city streets. On 4 March the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, a group of parliamentarians elected during November 2020, sent a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres calling on the UNSC to uphold its responsibility to protect, impose robust sanctions on military leaders, enterprises and assets, establish an arms embargo, and bring perpetrators of atrocities to justice., On Wednesday, 10 March, the UNSC agreed to a Presidential Statement that “stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.” Despite this call, the UNSC has yet to authorize any practical measures in response to the coup and the deadly violence of Myanmar’s security forces. China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Council and traditional ally of Myanmar’s Generals, continues to block diplomacy aimed at holding the coup leaders accountable. “The Security Council cannot keep failing the people of Myanmar,” said Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. “There is an imminent risk of further atrocities. Now is the time for decisive action.”, CANADA TAKES STEPS TO HOLD SYRIA LEGALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR TORTURE, On 4 March the government of Canada initiated proceedings under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT), in an attempt to hold the Syrian government accountable for its widespread and systematic use of torture. The Canadian government formally requested negotiations regarding evidence of the Syrian government’s crimes and reminded Syria of its obligations under the CAT. Should these negotiations prove unsuccessful, it could potentially lead to proceedings against Syria at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as Article 30(1) of the CAT provides for dispute settlement between parties under ICJ jurisdiction. Similar steps were initiated by the Netherlands against Syria in September 2020., The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, Marc Garneau, explained that, “for the last decade, the Syrian regime has inflicted brutal and shocking attacks on its own people. It is our hope that today’s action serves to bring us closer to truth, justice and accountability. The people of Syria deserve nothing less.” The Minister added that, “Syria must answer for its grave breaches of international law.”, According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, more than 14,500 people have died due to torture since March 2011. The UN Human Rights Council-mandated Commission of Inquiry has also reported on the widespread use of torture in government-run detention facilities, as well as other potential crimes against humanity perpetrated as a matter of state policy, including enforced disappearance, murder and sexual violence., Despite a decade of atrocities in Syria, UN Security Council vetoes by Russia and China have consistently obstructed efforts to hold perpetrators accountable via a referral to the International Criminal Court. Nevertheless, last month the first criminal trial of a Syrian government intelligence officer was held in Germany, utilizing the legal principle of universal jurisdiction. The historic trial in Koblenz ended with Eyad al-Gharib being sentenced to four years and six months in prison for aiding and abetting 30 cases of crimes against humanity in Syria., Ten years after the popular uprising against the government first began, the battle to end impunity for torture and other atrocities in Syria continues., THREAT OF VIOLENCE AHEAD OF VOTING IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, On Sunday, 14 March, people in the Central African Republic (CAR) will return to the polls following an inconclusive and disrupted election in December 2020. Last year an alliance of armed groups, known as the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC), launched attacks across the country in order to disrupt voting. The CPC took control of a number of towns, forcing 40 percent of polling places to close due to insecurity. CPC fighters also destroyed ballots, tortured or threatened voters, and attacked troops from the UN peacekeeping mission in CAR (MINUSCA)., Many fear that this Sunday’s vote may spark further violence. Attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers, as well as conflict-related sexual violence, extrajudicial executions and incitement of violence against MINUSCA, have all increased over the past month. The use of child soldiers is also becoming more widespread. Armed groups have recruited almost 3,000 children into their ranks since January., While government forces have recently recaptured several towns from the CPC and other armed groups, many displaced civilians have not returned due to fear of further fighting. During military offensives against the CPC and other armed groups, the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and their allies have reportedly perpetrated arbitrary killings, torture and ill-treatment, and arbitrary arrests. The UN Panel of Experts on CAR also documented evidence of FACA perpetrating “systemic violations” against civilians between September-December 2020., Ahead of Sunday’s vote, Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, emphasized that, “we remind the authorities that security forces must protect civilians, prevent violence and act in conformity with international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Any allegations of violations must be thoroughly, impartially, and effectively investigated, and those responsible must be held accountable. Victims and their families have the right to justice, truth and reparations.”, As pervasive insecurity continues, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has recommended an urgent increase to the number of uniformed peacekeepers in CAR. The UN Security Council should heed this call and strengthen MINUSCA’s capacity to protect civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-243-myanmar-burma-syria-and-central-african-republic

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Mar 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Moo [Mone] Township, Kler Lwee Htoo [Nyaunglebin] District between August 2020 and October 2020. Gold mining activities along the Klaw Myaw, Puh Loh Kloh and Kaw Ka Loh Kloh rivers have caused water pollution and now threaten the livelihood of entire villages. In government-defined Kyaukkyi Township, vulnerable households received financial support from the Myanmar government to cope with the difficulties caused by the COVID-19[1] pandemic, but local authorities diverted some of the support money. In H--- village tract,[2] local villagers were required to pay for the installation of electric posts even though they cannot afford this expense.[3], Introduction, This situation update was written between August and October 2020. It is based on information from Moo (Mone) Township. It includes topics such as gold mining; financial support by the Myanmar government and other COVID-19 updates; and access to electricity., Gold mining activities, Since 2015, businessmen have been conducting gold mining activities along the Klaw Myaw and Puh Loh Kloh rivers, O--- village tract, Moo Township. They received permission from the Karen National Union (KNU)[4] Moo Township authorities to mine gold in the area. [In June 2020,] the H--- and E--- village tract administrators reported about the damages caused by the gold mining activities to the KNU Township authorities. They stressed that the local villagers’ farmland needed to be protected from the environmental damage caused by the gold mining activities. The village tract administrators told KHRG that that their initial report had remained unanswered., Local villagers now face difficulties, as the gold mining activities have polluted rivers and resulted in the destruction of paddies [rice crops]. The villagers have been complaining about these issues since September 2020. Water pollution also resulted in the extinction of the local aquatic fauna. Saw[5] P---, the E--- village tract administrator, explained that he used to catch fish in the river and that to sell them for his livelihood. Since 2019, it has been difficult for him to catch enough fish for a single meal., As local villagers were facing an increase in water pollution as a result of the gold mining activities, the H---, W---, A--- and E--- village tract administrators decided to form a special committee called the Nee Htaw Thaw Committee. The committee held a meeting in W--- village tract on October 19th 2020. During the meeting, they [local leaders] discussed about the difficulties the villagers were facing because of the water pollution. They agreed to write a complaint letter to the KNU Moo Township authorities. The complaint letter was sent on October 25th 2020. It was signed by over 700 villagers. [On October 28th, the KNU Moo Township office sent a response letter to the local village tract authorities, informing them that they had already ordered the gold mining activities to stop on October 5th. However, the gold mining activities continued after October 5th 2020. According to a KHRG researcher, the businessmen were later granted permission to continue their gold mining activities until May 2021.], There is also a new gold mining operation along the Kaw Ka Loh Kloh river (Khar Khar Doe Chaung), K--- village tract, Moo Township. This new gold mining operation started on August 30th 2020. It is currently on-going. The businessmen involved in these gold mining activities are:, More businessmen are involved in the gold mining activities, but KHRG was not able to obtain their names. The businessmen are working together with local Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] and KNU authorities [notably Commander Kyaw Kyaw from KNLA Brigade #3, Battalion #8, Company #3]. They received permission from the Moo Township KNU authorities to conduct their gold mining activities., These new gold mining activities have resulted in water pollution, which created difficulties for the villagers. Villagers who live along the Traw Loh Kloh river [which is connected to the Kaw Ka Loh Kloh river] rely on its water to raise their livestock, so the current situation threatens their livelihoods. These villagers also worry for their health, and they told KHRG that fish were disappearing from the river. They explained that thousands of acres of betel nut and other plantations located near the river will be damaged if the gold mining activity continues., Local villagers and village leaders sent a complaint letter to the Myanmar government Kyaukkyi Township authorities on September 17th 2020 to report about the situation they are facing. They also sent a complaint letter to the Sit Tuang Than Sin Network Group [a local community-based organisation] on September 28th 2020. Both letters were signed by 679 villagers., [According to a KHRG researcher, gold mining operations in the wider area now cover a surface of over 1,000 acres.], Financial support from the Myanmar government, [Between August and October 2020,] the Myanmar government provided financial support to the civilians living under government control in the Plaw area, Moo Township to help them cope with the economic difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This government support came from [was distributed by] the township [authorities]. The government support for Kyaukkyi Township, Bago Region [the Myanmar government administrative division in which the Plaw area is included] was given to [and distributed by] U[7] Kyaw Thu, the administrator of Kyaukkyi Township’s General Administration Department. This financial support was only provided to households in real need. [According to the government policy,] if there are 100 households, only 35 need to be chosen [only 35% of all households will receive financial support]. [It seems that villagers need to apply for financial support with the local leaders, who then decide which households will benefit from it. Local leaders then take the list of beneficiaries to the Myanmar government authorities to receive the support money. Only villagers with household registration documents are eligible for support.], Villagers from M--- village, T--- village tract, Plaw area, Moo Township told KHRG that the village tract administrator, U Myo Win and the village leaders did not explain well about the financial support [they did not tell the villagers how much they would receive]. […] They also collected money from the villagers who received financial support [households eligible for support were supposed to receive 20,000 kyats [USD 14.19],[8] but they only received 5,000 kyats [USD 3.55]. The local leaders kept the rest of the money]. Villagers were dissatisfied about it so they looked for a solution to this problem. Daw[9] Y--- from M--- village contacted KHRG to document this case., On October 2nd 2020, a KHRG researcher interviewed [local villagers] and [took the matter to the village leaders]. On October 8th 2020, U Myo Win asked local villagers to meet with him at the village tract office. He explained about the situation and [apologised to the] villagers who were not satisfied. Village leaders said to the villagers that they had kept some of the money to cover the fees associated with transportation, printing travel letters and food [they are referring to the costs of travelling to the township office to pick up the support money]. Some villagers were satisfied by this explanation, but some were not [but they could not do anything to try and get the rest of the money]. The local village head also explained that not all civilians were eligible to benefit from the government financial support. This situation has created problems [misunderstandings] between villagers and village leaders., This did not only happen in M--- village, but in other locations of [government-defined] Kyaukky Township. Some village leaders do not manage the financial support fairly. In H--- village tract, however, local leaders collected the support money and distributed it in full to every eligible household., COVID-19 update, The number of COVID-19 infections increased from September to October 2020. Because of the increase in cases, both the Myanmar government and the KNU formed COVID-19 prevention committees and decided to implement more rules [restrictions]. On October 17th 2020, the KNU COVID-19 prevention committee decided to ban meetings, events, worshipping services, visits to monasteries and wedding ceremonies in all the districts., The Myanmar government set up a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am and instructed the civilians to wear a mask whenever they go out. Villagers in Moo Township are not allowed to go to other townships. If villagers really need to go [to other township], they have to get a travel letter from the village administrator. Guests [outsiders] are not allowed to visit local villages. Buying and selling activities were also banned in the villages [outsiders cannot enter the villages and villagers cannot leave to buy and sell things]., Because of the COVID-19 restrictions, villagers from K’Hser Klah and Plaw Poo areas, Moo Township, are facing difficulties. Travel restrictions have translated into livelihood challenges, and they are now banned from celebrating cultural events and engaging in worshipping activities. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, both the Myanmar government and the KNU set up screening checkpoint in the following locations:, 1. Mah Lah Daw village, Maw Ker Tha Per Hkoh village tract.
2. Myaw Oo village, Kwee Doh Hkoh village.
3. Maw Lay place, Kwee Doh Hkoh village tract.
4. Between Muh Theh and Hsaw Mee Loo, Ler Htoo Loo place., They [Myanmar government] also arranged quarantine centres in Moo Township, Hsaw Htee and Ler Doh townships [near the Myanmar government township office]., [Because of the restrictions,] it is really difficulty for local villagers to travel for work. The rules and restrictions also created misunderstandings and tensions between the villagers and the local village leaders [notably because the level of implementation of these rules can vary from one area to the next]., Access to electricity, The Myanmar government has plans to provide electricity to H--- and N--- villages, H--- village tract, Moo Township in 2021. [The government will install electric posts over a distance of around 300 miles along the main road from Z--- village, Ler Doh Township to H--- village.] The [H--- and N---] village leaders were told that electric posts would only be installed along the main road. The government will not take responsibility for installing the electric posts along the roads inside the villages. The villagers themselves will have to pay for all the expenses related to the installation of electric posts and cables inside their villages., The village leaders from H--- village and Z--- village formed an electricity committee in September 2020. From September 25th to 26th 2020, the electricity committee held a meeting with villagers from each section. [Village leaders] informed the villagers that the government will only take responsibility [for the installation of electric posts along] the main road; [and told the villagers they] will have to pay for the electric posts and cables [inside the village]. The villagers who attended the meeting did not want to agree to it, but they were afraid to speak out [they feared the village leaders would scold them]. A few villagers were interested in this plan, but a lot of people were not interested as they could not afford to pay., Villagers in H--- village have to pay over 56,000,000 kyats [USD 39,719.5]. The electricity committee and local village leaders divided the villagers into three categories [based on their income]. Villagers in the first category have to give 200,000 kyats [USD 141.86]. Villagers in the second category have to give 150,000 kyats [USD 106.39] and people in difficulty [in the third category] have to give 100,000 kyats [USD 70.93]. [The obligation to pay for the installation of electric posts] became a burden and resulted in difficulties for the villagers. [According to an update provided by KHRG researchers, the local leaders tried to collect the money on three occasions, but there are still villagers who could not pay., Footnotes:, [1] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Guideline On Integrating Climate Change Projection Into Landslide Risk Assessments and Mapping – At The River Basin Level,Manual and Guideline,ASEAN,"Climate Change and Environment
Disaster Management",8 Mar 2021,"1. INTRODUCTION, 1.1. Landslide risk management in ASEAN Member States, Landslides are a geological process common across ASEAN Member States (AMS). They are often triggered by earthquakes, unstable geological conditions, and/or rainfall. Human development activities on fragile slopes are also responsible for landslides. Landslide numbers are on the rise mainly due to increasing rainfall intensity. Landslides can co-occur at the same time as floods during, or in the aftermath, of heavy or prolonged rainfall events. Seven out of ten ASEAN Member States (excepting Brunei, Cambodia, and Singapore) were affected by flood and landslides during the 2015-2016 El Nino, with impact and severity highest in Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Increasing widespread landslide incidences are a new challenge to AMS, as in 2018 when the majority of Lao PDR, as well as Myanmar, experienced heavy flooding and landslides that exceeded country response capacity. Another example is the devastating floods and landslides in June-August 2015 in Myanmar. Many parts of the country, and in particular its mountainous regions such as Chin State, were affected by devastating landslides, cyclones and floods. These calamities significantly damaged lives and property, especially in the Chin State capital of Hakha., Climate change is considered a key factor behind the changing intensity, frequency and timing of rainfall events. A worldwide review of global rainfall data by Westra, Alexander, and Zwiers (2012), concludes “rainfall extremes are increasing on average globally.” At both the global and Asia and the Pacific regional scale, extreme hydro-meteorological events are the dominant cause of disasters (UNESCAP 2017). Extreme hydrometeorological disasters accounted for 72 percent of the frequency of extreme natural disasters recorded during 1971– 2010 in Asia and the Pacific and accounted for more than half of the increase in frequency of intense hydrometeorological disasters recorded globally from 1971–1980 and 2001–2010 (Thomas et al., 2013). This rise in extreme hydrological events in turn compounds landslide risk levels., Human induced factors such as dense settlements, deforestation, and migration to, and poorly planned development in, high exposure areas also contribute to disaster risks. When human and climate change induced risks combine, the consequences are often very severe. Existing approaches to landslide risk management therefore need to be revisited to account for these climate and human induced changes and weak disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) capacity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/guideline-integrating-climate-change-projection-landslide-risk-assessments-and
"The Displaced and Stateless of Myanmar in the Asia-Pacific Region - An overview of the current situation for Rohingya and other persons of concern from Myanmar and UNHCR’s response across the region, January 2021",Situation Report,UNHCR,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",9 Mar 2021,"Situation Overview, By mid-year 2020, there were an estimated 1.9 million persons of concern to UNHCR from Myanmar in the Asia-Pacific region. The vast majority—about 1.6 million—were Rohingya, a minority group from Myanmar who have been forcibly displaced across the region. Myanmar’s discriminatory citizenship laws have stripped nearly all Rohingya of their citizenship, making them the largest identified stateless community in the world. UNHCR has registered almost one million Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly in Bangladesh (860,000), Malaysia (101,000) and India (18,000), as well as smaller numbers in Indonesia,
Nepal, Thailand, and other countries. An estimated 600,000 Rohingya continue to remain in Rakhine State,
Myanmar, of whom 142,000 are internally displaced., Despite an expressed desire to return to Myanmar, Rohingya refugees say they are not yet confident that the environment in Rakhine State has improved to the point that they could return in safety and dignity, and none have so far returned under bilateral arrangements on voluntary repatriation between Bangladesh and Myanmar (detailed below). To advance solutions for the Rohingya, avoid an even more protracted displacement, and ensure that they can meanwhile live in dignity wherever they are, UNHCR and its partners are focusing their efforts on four areas:, ▪ **Addressing the root causes: **The solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in Myanmar, through Myanmar’s full implementation of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which would pave the way for peace for and between all communities in Rakhine State and enable the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of Rohingya refugees., ▪ Maintaining humanitarian assistance: Significant material support will be needed to maintain lifesaving assistance and uphold basic standards of living for Rohingya refugees in host countries and those internally displaced and stateless in Myanmar., ▪ Expanding opportunities: Rohingya children and youth need to have hope for a life with dignity.
Education, skills development, and livelihoods are vital to preparing them for full, productive roles in society and empowering them to envision a future of personal growth and self-reliance, which in turn will make them less vulnerable to exploitation, including smuggling and trafficking., ▪ Investing in host communities: Development investments are needed in host communities to help them mitigate the socioeconomic pressures of hosting refugees, particularly in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. As solutions are found for Rohingya refugees, host communities need support to make them more resilient, not less, than when the refugees first arrived.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/displaced-and-stateless-myanmar-asia-pacific-region-overview-current-situation

ICRC statement on latest developments in Myanmar [EN/MY],News and Press Release,ICRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2021,"4 March 2021 — The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been closely monitoring the recent developments across Myanmar and is seriously concerned about the increasingly violent incidents observed during the recent days and their related humanitarian consequences., At times when demonstrations remain frequent and widespread, and when numbers of people killed or seriously injured are rising, the ICRC is calling on all for restraint in Myanmar., The ICRC would like to recall that when tensions rise during demonstrations, police and military forces involved in law enforcement operations must use first negotiation and mediation and that force must not be used unless this is strictly necessary. When the use of force is unavoidable, it should be proportional to the threat and all feasible precautions must be taken to prevent or minimize risks for the life or physical integrity of the population., The ICRC also calls for the full respect and protection of healthcare personnel, vehicles and facilities, as it is vital that the injured have access to medical assistance. Healthcare personnel and ambulances must be respected by all sides, so that they can safely reach and assist those injured. When assisting injured persons, they must neither be threatened, nor hindered in their activities., The ICRC would like to recall that those arrested or detained must be treated humanely. Their life, physical integrity and dignity must be respected and protected in all circumstances., The ICRC will continue to monitor the developments on the ground and address its humanitarian concerns to the relevant authorities. It will also continue supporting – together with its partners of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement - the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS). The MRCS has mobilized during the past four weeks, over 1.500 volunteers and 120 ambulances in all states and regions, to provide first aid and emergency medical transfers to all those in need, often in challenging safety circumstances. To date, the MRCS has provided first aid or emergency medical transfer to 509 people., For further information, please contact:

Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2021,"(Excerpt), Myanmar, And moving on to Myanmar, where the UN team there said that women across the country are once again demonstrating their leadership and agency following more than one month of political instability and violence., The team there says that, across Myanmar, they see women — young and old — leading the call for peace, justice and democracy. They do so with courage, braving bullets and beatings, death and detention, challenging patriarchy and social norms in the process., Our colleagues on the ground in Myanmar reiterated the Secretary-General’s call for Myanmar’s military and police to ensure that the right of peaceful assembly is fully respected and that demonstrators are not subjected to reprisals. It also echoed the Secretary-General’s strong condemnation of the violent crackdown and the use of lethal force., They are deeply concerned over the reported occupation by security forces of a number of public hospitals in Myanmar, calling this completely unacceptable. The team says that hospitals are, and must remain, places of sanctuary and unequivocal neutrality — to ensure that patients undergoing medical care are safe. This is particularly essential during a global pandemic., And on that, I just want add that the Secretary-General himself, as you have been asking me, is following the developments in Myanmar very closely, notably in the Sanchaung district of Yangon, where hundreds of peaceful protestors have been barricaded inside residential apartment complexes for hours. He calls for maximum restraint and urges for the safe release of all without violence or arrests., Many of those trapped are women, who were peacefully marching in commemoration of International Women’s Day., We again call for respect of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression of the people of Myanmar as they demonstrate peacefully and express their hopes and desires for the future of their country., Last one on Myanmar: Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that the situation in the country remains dire and that aid operations have been disrupted by the coup. More than 1 million people — identified at the beginning of the year as needing assistance, including more than 350,000 internally displaced people — still need help., Our humanitarian partners across the country are making all efforts to resume life-saving activities but the operating environment remains difficult., There are continued disruptions to communication, transportation and supply chains, as well as shortages of cash for operations due to limitations. Banking services and market prices in some areas are rising as a result., Our humanitarian colleagues warn that COVID-19 testing capacities and vaccination planning have also been severely impacted.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/daily-press-briefing-office-spokesperson-secretary-general-8-march-2021-myanmar
Myanmar: Maintaining medical services and tending to new needs,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
HIV/Aids
Protection and Human Rights",5 Mar 2021,"Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Myanmar are working hard to maintain access to some of the country’s most vulnerable people and ensure the provision of medical care to those in need. At the onset of the crisis we prepared an emergency team to act as soon as the need arose and when the medical demands on the ground overwhelmed the hospitals’ capacity to respond., February 28 was one of the most violent days in Myanmar since the start of the recent military coup earlier that month, with at least 18 reported deaths. On the same day, and the next, MSF’s Emergency Preparation Team started responding in Yangon to assess the needs at protest sites and donate medical supplies to hospitals in Yangon and in other MSF project locations. This team, comprising medical staff and counselors, aims to provide support to medical facilities., Since then, the violence has increased: it was reported that 38 people were killed in the protests on March 4., Donations of medical supplies to a number of hospitals have already begun. Meanwhile, MSF clinics in Lashio received and treated four people who sustained minor injuries during the protests. Dawei, in south eastern Myanmar, has also seen violent confrontations and casualties in recent days. Our teams aim to support community initiatives with donations of medical supplies and first aid kits, and are also reinforcing capacity to manage injuries. At the same time, MSF teams are working to ensure continuity of care for our HIV patients., Growing numbers of HIV-positive patients from the National AIDS Program (NAP) of the Ministry of Health and Sports (MoHS) are returning to MSF clinics—where they were originally treated before the program was handed over to the MoHs last year—for medical consultations and medication refills. With the NAP not functioning in the wake of the coup we also have new patients arriving in our clinics. As many of Myanmar’s public hospitals are closed, we are finding it difficult to refer patients to larger facilities for specialized treatment., We are mindful of the effects of the coup on both our staff and patients and are doing what we can to minimize the risks and access issues that have arisen as a result. While our activities in Rakhine state are running, the Rohingya population—especially those living in displacement sites—remain particularly vulnerable to disruptions to medical services having suffered decades of neglect, discrimination, violence, and persecution., In all circumstances, and regardless of age, religion, or political affiliation, MSF’s priority is the provision of care for our patients. We will continue to deliver impartial medical care to the most vulnerable people to the best of our ability and while access and circumstances allow.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-maintaining-medical-services-and-tending-new-needs
Myanmar Military Must Cease Occupation of Hospitals and Excessive Force Against Civilians: PHR,News and Press Release,Physicians for Human Rights,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Mar 2021,"In response to reports that Myanmar security services have engaged in a new round of violent night raids on March 7 and have occupied public hospitals by force, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) issued the following statement:, “Physicians for Human Rights is appalled by this latest wave of violence by the Myanmar military, including the invasion and occupation of public hospitals and wanton excessive force against civilians. If it was not obvious before, it is absolutely clear now: the Myanmar military will not stop violating the rights of the people of Myanmar until the international community acts decisively to prevent and account for these outrageous acts., Recent images and footage that appear to show Myanmar military forces conducting night raids – shining flood lights into apartments, arbitrarily arresting and detaining people, and beating and firing at protestors – are terrifying. The military also appears to be occupying public hospitals by force – a violation of international law – which only serves to further undermine a health care system already embattled by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the military’s recent coup d’état.”, One eyewitness account detailed armed security forces entering and seeking to occupy West Yangon General Hospital by force. Beyond West Yangon General Hospital, Physicians for Human Rights partners can confirm from reliable sources that other hospitals are being occupied by the Myanmar military, including: Yangon General Hospital; North Okkalapa Waibagi Specialist Hospital; South Okkalapa Women and Children’s Hospital; East Yangon General Hospital; and Central Women’s Hospital. Reports of similar sieges – attempted or otherwise – have been received from elsewhere in Myanmar, including Mandalay, Monywa, and Taunggyi., In addition to seeking to occupy hospitals by force, media footage appears to show government security personnel conducting a new round of night raids in Yangon that include arbitrary arrests, detentions, shootings, and beatings of townspeople and the use of sonic bombs, guns, and other weaponry., “Even though medical personnel vacated their government posts to initiate the Civil Disobedience Movement, many returned to government hospitals in response to escalating violence against peaceful protestors,” said Sandra Mon, MSPH, junior epidemiologist, Center for Public Health and Human Rights, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “This widespread siege of hospitals follows several days of prominent civilian injuries and casualties, and can be interpreted as a direct attempt to impede access to care for civilians. It is also a threat to attending medics to warn them against further treating injured protestors. The Myanmar military has impunity despite their intentional acts of nighttime terror. We may be seeing a nationwide upsurge in military retaliation against peaceful protestors and medics in the days to come.”, Under international human rights law, states are obligated to ensure effective protection for health workers at all times, and to provide unencumbered access to emergency health care for all. These obligations remain in force regardless of any context of conflict, civil unrest, or state of emergency. The Myanmar military appears to be violating these foundational principles and interfering in the provision of health care to all without discrimination., “Actions taken by the international community thus far are clearly insufficient to stop these egregious human rights violations,” said Raha Wala, JD, advocacy director at PHR “If anything, the Myanmar military appears to be emboldened and is expanding its abusive tactics to hospitals and additional residential areas. Hospitals and clinics should always be protected, safe for staff and patients alike, and the medical care of patients should never be impeded. This is an urgent, emergency situation that must be treated as such by the international community. Governments must exert concerted pressure on the Myanmar military, including additional targeted sanctions to impose real costs on the units and commanders in the Myanmar military responsible for these offenses. Any corporation with operations in Myanmar that provides funds, products, or services to the Myanmar military that is engaging in these violations is complicit in this brutal crackdown, and must immediately cease such engagements and operations.”, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

Myanmar: Red Cross urges protection for first aiders amid recent violence,News and Press Release,IFRC,Safety and Security,5 Mar 2021,"Kuala Lumpur/Yangon/Geneva, 5 March 2021 – The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is deeply saddened by recent loss of life in Myanmar and is urging immediate protection for all Red Cross volunteers and health workers., Alexander Matheou, IFRC’s Asia Pacific Regional Director, said:, “Amid the spiralling violence, the Myanmar Red Cross has confirmed that over recent days, there have been very serious incidents where Red Cross volunteers were injured and wrongfully arrested. Red Cross ambulances have also been damaged., “We express profound sadness that Myanmar Red Cross volunteers have been injured while on duty providing lifesaving first aid treatment to wounded people, in line with fundamental principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. Red Cross volunteers should never be targeted.”, The Myanmar Red Cross has mounted one of its largest ever first aid and patient transfer humanitarian operations with more than 1,500 volunteers and 120 ambulances in action across the whole country. In the past four weeks, the Myanmar Red Cross has provided first aid services, including some lifesaving interventions, as well as emergency ambulance transfers. In all, the Red Cross has helped more than 1,000 people., Mr Matheou said: “There is escalating violence and the number of people killed or injured is rising each day. The IFRC urges restraint and a halt to violence across Myanmar.”, Amid the mass gatherings and violence over recent weeks, the IFRC is also very concerned about the risk that COVID-19 may be spreading unabated in areas of Myanmar., “The IFRC is alarmed about the risks of another deadly wave of COVID-19 in Myanmar as testing and access to hospitals or other health services is very limited,” said Mr Matheou., IFRC and other International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners continue to support Myanmar Red Cross in all its humanitarian endeavours at this critical time., **IFor more information, please contact:**I, In Kuala Lumpur: Antony Balmain, +60 12 230 8451, antony.balmain@ifrc.org, In Geneva: Matthew Cochrane, +41 79 251 80 39, matthew.cochrane@ifrc.org, About IFRC, IFRC is the world’s largest humanitarian network, comprising 192 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies working to save lives and promote dignity around the world.www.ifrc.org-Facebook-Twitter-YouTube",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-red-cross-urges-protection-first-aiders-amid-recent-violence

"Myanmar: UN human rights expert issues report and urges decisive, unified action to put an end to brutality",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,5 Mar 2021,"GENEVA (4 March 2021) – The UN’s human rights expert on Myanmar said in a report published today the military junta in the country is illegal, illegitimate and responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations against nonviolent, peaceful protesters, and should be held accountable., In the report to the Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, details how the Myanmar military illegally overthrew the civilian government and proceeded to attack the people of Myanmar by committing the crimes of murder, assault and arbitrary detention., The junta also systematically and illegitimately dismantled the people of Myanmar’s legal protections, installing new laws that remove basic protections of freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and privacy. Additionally, the report describes how the military has forcibly displaced several thousand members of ethnic nationalities from their homes since the coup., The most recent crackdown on protesters by the Myanmar military and police, including yesterday’s murder of 38 peaceful demonstrators, requires strong international action, Andrews said., “Every day the military junta in Myanmar unleashes more brutality on peaceful protesters who are standing up for justice, human rights and democracy, defending their nation against this illegal military coup,” he said., “While the future of Myanmar will be determined by its people, the international community must act urgently and decisively to support them., “The UN Security Council is meeting on Friday to discuss the situation in Myanmar. I urge the members of the Council to consider the unrelenting brutality that we are witnessing in Myanmar. I urge the Council to take decisive and unified action against the military junta, including targeted sanctions, an arms embargo, and a referral to the International Criminal Court to investigate and prosecute atrocities committed since the coup on 1 February and those committed against ethnic groups in years prior.”, The Special Rapporteur also details human rights violations preceding the coup in an annex to the report, which will be presented to the Council on March 11. He demonstrates that throughout 2020, the military violated the International Court of Justice’s order to protect the Rohingya from further killings, assaults, torture and other crimes. The report shows that despite the order, Myanmar security forces continued to murder, torture, and fire indiscriminately on Rohingya civilians, while continuing to deny them equal access to citizenship rights., UN Member States can stop the flow of arms and security and surveillance equipment to the generals of Myanmar, Andrews said. Forty-one countries have already imposed some form of arms embargo against the Myanmar military. These numbers must grow and governments should coordinate to stop the sale of weapons, as well the transfer of dual-use technology to Myanmar, he said., Andrews also urged humanitarian and development donors to work directly with local Myanmar civil society and aid organisations whenever possible to directly support populations rather than through centralised mechanisms that are now controlled by the junta., “Finally, I am urging Member states to deny recognition of the military junta as the legitimate government representing the people of Myanmar precisely because they are not,” Andrews added., “Many have seen the gruesome photos and videos of people being killed or beaten or brutally arrested by police and army personnel on the streets of Myanmar,” Andrews said. “Despite these attacks, and the grave danger that they face, the people of Myanmar continue to rise up as a diverse yet powerfully unified whole. They are doing so to demand democracy, human rights and an immediate end to the junta. The nonviolent civil disobedience movement, or CDM, is effective and growing, drawing its organic power from the unflinching and democratic desires of the Myanmar people. Myanmar has never appeared to be more unified., “I sincerely hope that the international community will rise to the occasion of this moment of history by following the lead and the inspiration of the people of Myanmar. And, that justice, dignity and human rights will finally prevail for all.”, ENDS, *Mr. Thomas Andrews* (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

Protection and Human Rights",5 Mar 2021,"On January 8th 2021, a 12-year-old boy stepped on a landmine in Ta Maw Daw village tract,[1] Thaton Township, Doo Tha Htoo [Thaton] District. His left foot was blown off in the explosion, and he sustained injuries to his right thigh. The victim spent three weeks at a local clinic for treatment, after which he was sent back to his village. This particular landmine was planted by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[2] in response to an increase in Tatmadaw[3] activities in the area.[4], Part 2 - Information Quality, 1. Explain in detail how you collected this information., This information was provided by the Karen Women Organisation’s (KWO) secretary for Thaton Township., 2. Explain how the source verified this information., The source provided assistance to the family of the victim after the incident and helped arrange his transportation to the clinic., Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail., On January 8th 2021 at around 8 am, Saw B---, a 12-year-old boy from A--- village, Ta Maw Daw village tract, Thaton Township, Doo Tha Htoo District stepped on a landmine while collecting Thay T’way [Grewia Polygama] bark[5] in a forest three miles [4.83 km] away from his village with a group of older villagers. His left foot was blown off in the explosion. He also sustained injuries to his right thigh., After the incident, the older villagers carried him back to the village. Later that day, he was sent to the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)[6] clinic in the Karen National Union (KNU)[7] Thaton District office for treatment. He was discharged from the clinic after three weeks and sent back to his village. Saw B--- is an orphan [his mother died and his father left him]. He now lives with his widowed aunt, but she is struggling with livelihood challenges. The victim did not need to pay any medical fees. He also received financial support from local villagers, township leaders and the KWO. He got 350,000 kyats [USD 248.25][8] in total., As it is difficult for his aunt to send Saw B--- back to the clinic, KNU medics have been visiting him in A--- village regularly to monitor his condition. As of March 4th 2021, he was recovering well without further complications., The landmine that caused the incident was planted by the KNLA Brigade #1, Battalion #2 or the affiliated Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO).[9] On January 1st 2021, the KNLA informed local villagers that they would plant landmines in the forest. KNLA soldiers warned the villagers again on the evening of January 7th and the morning of January 8th 2021. According to the KWO secretary for Thaton Township, a group of villagers saw KNLA soldiers in the forest while collecting Thay T’way bark the day before the incident., In late December 2020, the Tatmadaw sent more troops to and increased its patrolling activities in the region following several rounds of fighting with the KNLA in Mu Traw District.[10] This amounts to a violation of Section 5(c) of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA),[11] which states that the signatories must “avoid troop reinforcements in the ceasefire areas other than the provision of administrative support.”, This increased Tatmadaw activity led KNLA Brigade #1, Battalion #2 to plant landmines in order to prevent the Tatmadaw from operating in some areas. [According to a KHRG researcher, Tatmadaw troops are particularly active in the forest where the incident took place.] The planting of new landmines is a violation of sections 5(a) of the NCA and 8(A) of its corresponding Code of Conduct., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information? Explain how that permission was provided., The victim’s aunt allowed KHRG to use this information., Footnotes:, [1] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [2] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [3] Tatmadaw refers to the Myanmar military., [4] The present document is based on information received in March 2021. It was provided by a community member in Doo Tha Htoo District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [5] Grewia Polygama bark is used by local villagers to make traditional shampoo. It can be sold for 300 kyats [USD 0.21] per viss [1.6 kg]., [6] The Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) is the health department of the Karen National Union. It was established in 1956 to address the lack of public healthcare resources in rural Southeast Myanmar. It currently operates a network of community-based clinics in the region, but its capabilities remain limited due to funding constraints., [7] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [8] All conversion estimates for the kyat in this report are based on the March 4th 2021 official market rate., [9] The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) was formed in 1947 by the Karen National Union and is the precursor to the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Today the KNDO refers to a militia force of local volunteers trained and equipped by the KNLA and incorporated into its battalion and command structure; its members wear uniforms and typically commit to two-year terms of service., [10] For more information see KHRG, “Southeast Myanmar Field Report: COVID-19, armed conflict, killings and sexual violence, July to December 2020”, February 2021., [11] On October 15th 2015, after a negotiation process marred with controversy over the notable non-inclusion of several ethnic armed groups, a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between the Burma/Myanmar government and eight of the fifteen ethnic armed groups originally invited to the negotiation table, including the Karen National Union. It was followed by the adoption of a Code of Conduct by the signatories in November 2015. In February 2018, two additional ethnic armed groups signed the NCA under pressure from the Burma/Myanmar government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/doo-tha-htoo-district-incident-report-child-seriously-injured-landmine-explosion
UNICEF condemns killings and arbitrary detentions of children by security forces during ongoing crisis in Myanmar,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2021,"At least five children reportedly killed, four severely wounded and 500 arbitrarily detained since protests began last month, BANGKOK, 4 March 2021 – As the crisis in Myanmar escalates, the number of children killed, wounded or arbitrarily detained by security forces continues to grow. As of 3 March, at least five children and multiple young people and adults have reportedly been killed; at least four children have been severely wounded., In addition to those killed or seriously wounded, many children are being exposed to harm from tear gas and stun grenades, and are witnessing horrific scenes of violence, in some cases directed against parents or family members, putting them at risk of severe psychosocial distress., Arbitrary arrests and detentions of protestors, including children, are continuing to occur. UNICEF’s partners estimate that more than 500 children have been arbitrarily detained. Many of those arrested or detained are being held incommunicado, without access to legal counsel, in violation of their human rights., UNICEF condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of force against children, including the use of live ammunition, and the arbitrary detention of children, and calls on security forces to immediately refrain from violence and to keep children and young people out of harm’s way., UNICEF calls on all actors to uphold the best interests of the child, one of the core principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), as a primary consideration. UNICEF reminds all actors of the obligation to uphold all children’s rights as enshrined in the CRC, and the Myanmar Child Rights Law enacted in 2019., Our thoughts go to the families of the victims and to all children impacted by the current crisis., At all times, children and young people should feel safe. Together with its partners, UNICEF is providing psychosocial support to children, parents, caregivers, and service providers to children through a counselling helpline, that operates in different local languages, and legal aid services for children arbitrarily detained by security forces., **For inquiries, please contact: Shima Islam, Regional Communication Specialist, **ssislam@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-condemns-killings-and-arbitrary-detentions-children-security-forces-during
"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Thomas H. Andrews (A/HRC/46/56)",UN Document,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2021,"Summary, The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 43/26. In the report, the Special Rapporteur reflects on the human rights situation before and after the military coup and makes recommendations to protect and promote human rights in Myanmar., I. Introduction, The military coup, initiated by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and senior military officers, had an immediate impact on the political, social, and economic landscape in Myanmar and on fundamental human rights issues. Given the gravity of the human rights violations associated with the military takeover and Resolution S-29/1, adopted by the Human Rights Council at the 29th Special Session on 12 February 2021, the main body of this report will primarily focus on events in Myanmar following the 1 February 2021 coup., This document reports on the human rights situation in Myanmar as of 1 March 2021. Annex I describes the human rights situation throughout 2020 and up to the coup. If not for the coup, Annex I would have formed the substantial body of this report., The Special Rapporteur’s meetings in Myanmar have been, by necessity, virtual. He formally requested a visit to Myanmar by letter to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi on his first day and was informed that, due to the pandemic, a country visit would not be possible. He has subsequently reiterated that request. While unable to undertake a country visit, he conducted extensive research on the human rights situation in Myanmar both preand post-coup, meeting virtually with a wide variety of sources, including members of civil society, journalists, human rights defenders, activists, members of parliament, international organizations, members of the diplomatic community, international human rights mechanisms and the business community. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the valuable information and analysis provided by all interlocutors and stresses that this report would not be possible without their support.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/report-special-rapporteur-situation-human-rights-myanmar-thomas-h-andrews-ahrc4656

Myanmar: End Lethal Force Against Protesters,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2021,"UN Security Council Should Impose Targeted Sanctions, Arms Embargo, (Bangkok) - Myanmar's military junta should order its security forces to end the use of excessive and lethal force against largely peaceful protesters, Human Rights Watch said today. On March 3, 2021, security forces fired live rounds at protesters, killing at least 38 and wounding more than 100 at demonstrations across the country, the United Nations reported., One of the deadliest incidents took place in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, where security forces opened fire on largely peaceful protesters. Security forces fired on some protesters as they attempted to rescue an injured man. Earlier in the day, police detained and brutally beat medical workers. Human Rights Watch reviewed an incident in which a man in custody appears to be shot in the back., ""Myanmar's security forces now seem intent on breaking the back of the anti-coup movement through wanton violence and sheer brutality,"" said Richard Weir, crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The use of lethal force against protesters rescuing others demonstrates how little the security forces fear being held to account for their actions."", At a March 3 briefing, the United Nations special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, reported that 38 people had been killed during the day's violence, bringing the tally of those killed since the protests began a month ago to more than 50. At least four of those killed were children, according to Save the Children., Through the analysis of 12 videos and 15 photographs, Human Rights Watch documented three incidents in which security forces apparently used live fire against protesters along the Thudhamma Road in Yangon on March 3., In a Facebook live video posted on March 3, Human Rights Watch identified a line of at least five military vehicles positioned on the overpass road that merges into the Airport Road near Okkala Thiri Park on Thudhamma Road. The video shows hundreds of protesters shielding and taking shelter from ongoing gunfire coming from the direction of the overpass., Gunshots, consistent with semi-automatic and automatic weapons fire, can be heard frequently for the first five minutes of the video. At 1:35 minutes into the video, several protesters shield themselves while running toward a makeshift barrier to move an injured or deceased protester, while shots are fired at them. The video later shows an orange trash can with multiple apparent exit holes near where one of the protesters was killed. These exit holes and the direction in which people are shielding indicates that the shooting originated from the direction of stationed military vehicles., In the videos and photographs reviewed by Human Rights Watch, no security forces were visible. In the videos, there is no indication that the protesters being fired upon are engaged in violent acts. The video does show one man at 2:05 launch a slingshot with an unknown projectile towards the center of the road., Human Rights Watch also analyzed videos taken approximately two kilometers south of the incident described above on the Thudhamma Road of a makeshift barrier that had been set on fire. Protesters can be seen trying to extinguish the fire with water. In a Facebook live post, three people can be seen carrying a motionless man away from the direction of the blockade. Gunfire can be clearly heard in the previous minutes., In another incident, Human Rights Watch confirmed the location of the shooting of a man in the custody of security forces on the Thudhamma Road. Filming from an apartment window, the video shows a group of at least 15 security force personnel gather on the Thudhamma Road as at least 10 other security force personnel lead a man in a white shirt toward them., They move the man ahead of the larger group and at close range, no more than a few feet, one of the officers can be seen lowering his weapon in line with the man's back. A shot can be heard in the video and the man instantly falls to the ground. Two security force members kick him, and getting no response, they drag him into the center of the road., In CCTV footage released online, police officers can be seen removing three workers from an ambulance of Mon Myat Seik Htar Charity group (MMSH), then beating the workers with their guns and batons and kicking them. At least six police were involved in the attack. One of the MMSH volunteers died from their injuries, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) reported., The nongovernmental group confirmed that its members had been providing medical assistance to injured protesters in North Okkalapa. Photographs and a video of the ambulance with bullet holes and broken windows were later shared on social media. These photographs and videos match the location of the CCTV footage., In addition to the Yangon attacks, security force killings took place over the course of the day in Monywa, Sagaing Region; Myingyan and Mandalay, Mandalay Region; Salin, Magway Region; and Mawlamyine, Mon State, based on media reports and local analysts., The killings on March 3 followed extreme violence on February 28, in which the UN said that 18 people were killed by security forces. Witnesses described to Human Rights Watch a pattern of violence used by security forces in Yangon on March 1 and 2, including charging protesters and makeshift barricades without warning, the use of sound and stun grenades, teargas, and arbitrary detention., Since the February 1 coup, millions of people have taken to the streets across Myanmar in largely peaceful protests to call for the military to relinquish power. In response, security forces have beaten protesters and deployed teargas, water cannons, kinetic impact projectiles, such as rubber balls, and live ammunition to disperse protesters. The use of force has been accompanied by widespread arbitrary arrests and detentions., The authorities have detained over 1,100 government officials, activists, journalists, civil servants, and others since February 1, according to AAPP. The group reported that as many as 800 people were detained nationwide on March 3, including about 400 protesters held in Kyaikkasan Race Ground in Yangon., The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms provide that law enforcement officials should ""apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms."" The UN Human Rights Committee in its General Comment No. 37 stated that ""[f]irearms are not an appropriate tool for the policing of assemblies, and must never be used simply to disperse an assembly.... [A]ny use of firearms by law enforcement officials in the context of assemblies must be limited to targeted individuals in circumstances in which it is strictly necessary to confront an imminent threat of death or serious injury."", The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold a closed-door consultation on Myanmar on March 5., ""The UN Security Council should take the dramatically deteriorating situation in Myanmar as a clarion call for coordinated action to end to this cascading human rights disaster,"" Weir said. ""Concern and outrage aren't enough. What is needed is action to hold the junta accountable, including through the use of targeted sanctions and a global arms embargo.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-end-lethal-force-against-protesters
Myanmar military must stop murdering and jailing protestors – Bachelet,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2021,"GENEVA (4 March 2021) – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Thursday said security forces in Myanmar must “halt their vicious crackdown on peaceful protestors,” following another day of deadly violence across the country on Wednesday., “Myanmar’s military must stop murdering and jailing protestors,” High Commissioner Bachelet said. “It is utterly abhorrent that security forces are firing live ammunition against peaceful protesters across the country. I am also appalled at the documented attacks against emergency medical staff and ambulances attempting to provide care to those who have been injured.”, The UN Human Rights Office has corroborated information that at least 54 people have been killed by police and military officers since the 1 February coup. The actual death toll, however, could be much higher as these are the figures the Office has been able to verify., Of the 54 cases documented by the UN Human Rights Office, at least 30 people were killed in Yangon, Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway and Mon by security forces on Wednesday. Another person was documented to have been killed on Tuesday, 18 people on Sunday and five prior to that. It is difficult to establish how many people have suffered injuries, but credible information indicates, at a minimum, hundreds have been wounded during protests., Since 1 February, over 1,700 people have been arbitrarily arrested and detained in relation to their participation in protests or engagement in political activity, including members of parliament, political activists and election officials, authors, human rights defenders, teachers, healthcare workers, civil servants, journalists, monks, and celebrities. However, the actual number of those detained is likely to be much higher, given that demonstrations are reported to have taken place in 537 locations throughout the country where monitoring developments has not always been possible., Reports also indicate that a handful of individuals have already been convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from seven days to two years. Others are known to have been charged and are awaiting trial. Another 61 people who are being sought by the military authorities are in hiding., The number of arbitrary arrests and detentions have escalated in recent days – on Wednesday alone, at least 700 people were detained. In many instances, soldiers and police are reported to be conducting door-to-door searches and detaining people. While some are eventually released, in many cases relatives have informed the UN Human Rights Office that they have received no information about where their loved ones are being held. The family of one community leader in Yangon said that he had not been heard from since he was taken by soldiers from his home in the middle of the night on 1 February. UN human rights staff have received numerous similar accounts., “Many of the arbitrary arrests and detentions that have been carried out since 1 February may constitute enforced disappearances,” Bachelet said, calling for the immediate release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained., According to the Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances, an enforced disappearance occurs where an individual is detained by, or with the acquiescence of, State actors and there is no official acknowledgement or information about the individuals’ wellbeing and whereabouts., The High Commissioner also expressed concern at the targeting of journalists: at least 29 journalists have reportedly been arrested in recent days, at least eight of whom have been charged with crimes, including incitement to opposition, or hatred of the Government, or attending an unlawful assembly., “I urge all those with information and influence – including Myanmar officials who are now joining the civil disobedience movement – to support international efforts to hold military leaders accountable for the serious human rights violations that have been committed both now and in the past,” Bachelet said, citing the work of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar and proceedings before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice., “This is the moment to turn the tables towards justice and end the military’s stranglehold over democracy in Myanmar.”, END, For more information and media requests, please contact: Rupert Colville + 41 22 917 9767 / rcolville@ohchr.org or Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / rshamdasani@ohchr.orgor Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / ethrossell@ohchr.org or Marta Hurtado - + 41 22 917 9466 / mhurtado@ohchr.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-must-stop-murdering-and-jailing-protestors-bachelet

Protection and Human Rights",3 Mar 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., BLOODIEST DAY YET IN MYANMAR AS MILITARY KILLS 38 PROTESTERS, On Sunday, 28 February, at least 18 people were killed by security forces firing live ammunition into crowds of peaceful protesters in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku. In addition to firing live ammunition, security forces used tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, and stun grenades against protesters in a widespread and systematic attempt to crush demonstrations. According to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, at least 1,498 people have been arrested since 1 February. At least 38 more people were killed by security forces in protests across the country earlier today, 3 March. The killings marked the bloodiest day in Myanmar since the country’s 1 February military coup., On 1 March the Head of the UN’s Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, Nicholas Koumjian, condemned the military’s actions, saying that, “these acts, including the alleged use of excessive force against peaceful protestors resulting in killings and injuries, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances, may amount to serious human rights violations as well as crimes against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.”, Prior to this weekend’s violence, the UN General Assembly held an informal meeting on the crisis in Myanmar. During the 26 February meeting Myanmar’s Ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, denounced the coup and called on UN member states to take the “strongest possible measures to stop the violent and brutal acts committed by the security forces.” Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun appealed to the UN to deny diplomatic recognition to the military regime., The UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, also called on the international community to “not lend legitimacy or recognition” to the leaders of the military coup and stressed that “we must continue to call for the reversal of this impermissible situation, exhausting all collective and bilateral channels to restore Myanmar’s path on democratic reform.”, “The international community has a responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar from these potential crimes against humanity,” said Dr. Simon Adams, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, in response to the mounting death toll. “All UN member states should immediately impose an arms embargo and targeted sanctions on senior military officials, and refuse diplomatic recognition to the illegitimate leaders of this coup. Statements of concern are not enough, the world must act before the situation deteriorates further.”, POTENTIAL ‘ETHNIC CLEANSING’ IN ETHIOPIA AS TIGRAY CONFLICT CONTINUES, As armed conflict continues in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, new evidence has emerged of Eritrean forces [reportedly allied to the Ethiopian federal government] allegedly massacring civilians and razing villages. On 27 February VICE World News utilized eyewitness testimony and satellite imagery analyzed by DX Open Network, a UK-based research organization, to report on attacks against civilians and the destruction of multiple villages, including Debre Harmaz and Adi Mendi., According to a witness account of the 10 January attack on Debre Harmaz, Eritrean troops attacked the village and “shot at everyone. They even killed priests who were hiding in the church.” Satellite images analyzed by DX Open Network show that 478 structures had been set on fire following a separate attack on Adi Mendi on 19 January. The imagery revealed that homes in the area had been systematically burnt in a pattern consistent with intentional destruction. According to VICE’s reporting, some civilians were still inside the structures and were burnt alive., DX Open Network also analyzed images that revealed that at least 500 structures were razed in the town of Gijet between 21 and 23 February. Eyewitness reports also continue to emerge of massacres in the town of Aksum, at Maryam Dengelat church and elsewhere in Tigray., The current conflict has also exacerbated long-standing land disputes between the ethnic Tigrayan and Amhara populations. An internal United States’ (US) government report obtained by The New York Times documents a systematic campaign of “ethnic cleansing” against the Tigrayan population by federal government-allied Amhara militias. The US government report stated that the campaign was “deliberately and efficiently rendering Western Tigray ethnically homogeneous through the organized use of force and intimidation.”, The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect’s Communications and Digital Media Officer, Sarah Hunter, said that, “the commission of atrocities in Tigray must end. The UN Security Council must start responding to the Ethiopia crisis with the urgency the situation demands. The Human Rights Council should also hold an urgent debate on Ethiopia and establish an independent, impartial mechanism to investigate these shocking abuses.”, MASS KIDNAPPING OF GIRLS AND ONGOING VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN IN NIGERIA, Gunmen attacked the Girls Science Secondary School in the town of Jangebe, in Nigeria’s north-western Zamfara State, and kidnapped 279 students on Friday, 26 February. A group of men on motorcycles raided the school around 1:00 am and abducted the girls from their hostels. Following a joint operation by state police and the national army, on Tuesday, 2 March, the Nigerian authorities announced that the girls had been released., Peter Hawkins, the UN Children’s Fund representative in Nigeria, said that the mass kidnapping was “a gross violation of children’s rights and a horrific experience for children to go through – one which could have long-lasting effects on their mental health and well-being.” North-western Nigeria has endured a recent spate of kidnappings of schoolchildren, including an estimated 333 boys kidnapped from a secondary school in Kankara, Katsina State, on 11 December. In February an armed group also abducted 27 students, 3 staff and 12 family members from a secondary school in the Kagara district of Niger State. Almost all of those kidnapped have since been rescued and released., Although no group has claimed responsibility for the mass kidnapping at Jangebe, the armed extremist group Boko Haram has been responsible for similar incidents in north-eastern Nigeria, including the notorious mass abduction of more than 270 school girls in the town of Chibok in 2014. However, recent attacks took place further west in Niger, Zamfara and Katsina states, where criminal armed groups, known locally as “bandits,” are active. This has raised fears about the possible expansion of Boko Haram’s operations or increased collaboration with local bandits., Armed banditry resulted in more than 1,600 people being killed during the first half of 2020 and has displaced more than 300,000 civilians in Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Niger and Kebbi states since June 2020. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has also warned of a recent surge of violence in the north-west. According to UNHCR spokesperson Boris Cheshirkov, “refugees describe gruesome murders, kidnappings for ransom, and looted villages. Many have also been caught up in clashes between farmers and herders as well as vigilantism, as self-defense groups are being set up in most villages.”, Attacks on schools are a grave violation of the universal rights of children. In keeping with its 2014 commitment to the Safe Schools Initiative, the Nigerian federal government should work with local communities to enhance public security and bring an end to mass kidnappings and ongoing violence against children., HISTORIC SYRIAN TORTURE VERDICT, On 22 February the Koblenz Higher Regional Court in Germany sentenced Eyad al-Gharib to four years and six months in prison for aiding and abetting 30 cases of crimes against humanity in Syria. This historic trial, carried out under the principle of universal jurisdiction, was the world’s first criminal trial addressing atrocities, specifically torture, perpetrated by the Syrian state during the country’s ongoing conflict. Al-Gharib, a former intelligence agent, was found guilty of aiding and abetting the torture of detainees at the al-Khatib detention facility in Damascus between April 2011 and September 2012. Testimony in the historic case was provided by some torture survivors. The trial of al-Gharib’s co-accused, former Syrian Intelligence Directorate Colonel Anwar Raslan, remains ongoing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-242-myanmar-burma-ethiopia-nigeria-and-syria
"‘Stability of the region’ hangs on Myanmar, UN Special Envoy says",News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2021,"UN Special Envoy for Myanmar Christine Schraner Burgener warned on Wednesday that the situation in the country challenges “the stability of the region” and could lead to a “real war”., Speaking at a virtual press conference, Ms. Burgener said the news out of Myanmar was shocking and, with the death of 38 people, marked the bloodiest day since the start of the coup on 1 Februray., More than 1,200 people are under detention and many families do not know where their loved ones are or what condition they are in., Ms. Schraner Burgener said that in discussions with the army, she warned that UN Member States and the Security Council might take “strong measures”, to which they responded: “We are used to sanctions and we survived the sanctions time in the past”., She continued, “I also warned they will go in an isolation”, to which they said, “we have to learn to walk with only few friends”., Chaos continues, Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power and detained elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her National League for Democracy (NLD) leadership, who won a November election in a landslide, which the military said was fraudulent., However, the election commission said the vote was fair., The UN envoy said she remained in contact with the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), which represents the elected parliamentarians, and with all regional stakeholders, including leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)., She noted that the Secretary-General condemned the coup and urged an end to the violence., Stressing that every tool available was now needed to end the situation, she spelled out that the unity of the international community was essential., Under discussion, While the Special Representative continues to keep dialogue open, she urged Member States to “take very strong measures”., “I think we can only stop this in a dialogue”, she said, adding that if not, judging from the past the army “unfortunately” uses its own roadmap., The Special Envoy said that the Myanmar army’s Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win told her the military had a five-point roadmap which would be implemented by the recently established State Administration Council, to include the reconstitution of the Union Election Commission, COVID-19 prevention and restoring the peace., Ms. Schraner Burgener observed that COVID-19 prevention would be a disaster with regional implications, given that the country has no tests or vaccines, and restoring peace would be very difficult with 10 of the 21 ethnic armed organizations making strong statements against the coup and threatening violence if the army attacks civilians., Textbook plays, The Special Envoy expressed her observation that the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadow, wanted to imprison NLD members for election fraud and treason, and eventually ban the party prior to the proposed elections., She noted that the army’s “textbook” actions would not work, saying that while they were successful in 1988, 2007 and 2008, “today, we have young people who lived in freedom for 10 years”., “They have social media, and…[are] well organized and very determined. They don't want to go back in a dictatorship and in isolation. So, I think the army is surprised, and maybe we have to help them to come out of this situation”, detailed Ms. Schraner Burgener., Preemptive warning, Ms. Burgener said that she had always warned of a possible coup as the Tatmadow had the real power in the country, adding that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi wanted to make real reforms for a true federal democracy but was unable to do so., The Special Envoy said she had agreed to support Suu Kyi in her efforts to make reforms after the November elections, in which the NLD had won more than 82 per cent of the seats., Working together, The Security Council had also voiced concern over the state of emergency but Russia and China prevented it from condemning the coup viewing it as a sovereign affair., Ms. Burgener expressed her hope that these countries recognize this as a situation that “hits the stability of the region…so, I hope that China will realize that it will be important to work together, but also for Russia”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/stability-region-hangs-myanmar-un-special-envoy-says
Appalled after at least four children have been killed in Myanmar by security forces since Sunday,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",3 Mar 2021,"At least 15 people have reportedly been killed by the security forces on Wednesday March 3, in addition to the 23 people killed since the coup began on February 1st., In a statement, Save the Children said: “We are appalled and angered by these fatal shootings of demonstrators by security forces across Myanmar – these are atrocious and represent an unjustifiable escalation in the use of lethal violence. Save the Children particularly condemns the deaths and injuries of children and young people, and calls on the security forces to end these deadly attacks immediately.”, “The brutal scenes of violence and death are reminiscent of a battlefield, with security forces using live ammunition to shoot at unarmed protestors, many of whom are young adults. A significant number of children have been wounded, and children are also suffering from the effects of teargas that is leaking into their homes., “Save the Children and its partners are providing support to children who have been harmed and their families where possible, through referrals, child protection case management, and psychosocial support. Due to the insecurity and the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, a lot of this work has to be done remotely. Despite our best efforts, we know that many children are not receiving the support they so desperately need right now.”, “For several children, it is unfortunately already too late:, On Sunday February 28, a 17-year old boy, was shot in the head and died in Bago., On Tuesday March 2, a 16-year old boy died of a gunshot wound at Taung Twin Gyi, Magway. According to witness reports, he was shot dead by a soldier on a passing convoy of three military trucks, after which the soldiers took his body and drove away., On Wednesday March 3, a 14-year old boy in Myin Gyan was shot dead according to local sources., Also on Wednesday, a 17-year old boy was reportedly killed in Monywa., “The psychosocial effects on children of the recent violence are alarming. Many more children are suffering from the fear, stress and loss that the violent crackdowns are causing. Parents are reporting that their children are having nightmares after hearing flashbang grenades and shooting. These long-term effects of this crisis situation must not be underestimated: many children and families will have difficulties in coping with the violence they have witnessed, which may lead children to be traumatized in the longer term., “We therefore renew our call to immediately cease all violence against children and respect their rights, before even more children are injured.”, For any questions please contact, Emily Wight, Emily.wight@savethechildren.org;, Out of hours: Media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44 7831 650 409",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/appalled-after-least-four-children-have-been-killed-myanmar-security-forces-sunday
Myanmar: Post-Coup Legal Changes Erode Human Rights,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2021,"Reverse Junta’s Revisions to Penal Code, Other Laws, (Bangkok) – Myanmar’s military government should reverse its post-coup d’etat revisions of legal protections for human rights in the country, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and Human Rights Watch said today., Myanmar’s State Administration Council (SAC), appointed by the country’s military after it overthrew the elected civilian government on February 1, 2021, has dictated key revisions to the country’s legal system that criminalize even peaceful protests, and enable violations of the right to privacy and arbitrary arrests and detention. The changes were made through orders signed by the Commander-in-Chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, on behalf of the SAC, and outside the parliamentary process., “As Myanmar’s military increasingly relies on excessive force and intimidation to quell peaceful protests against its coup, it is trying to give a veneer of legality to its actions by subverting existing protections in the legal system,” said Ian Seiderman, ICJ’s Director of Law and Policy. “These revisions, which violate the principle of legality and Myanmar’s international obligations, in no way excuse or legitimate the widespread violations of human rights now taking place in Myanmar.”, Since the coup on February 1, the military junta has:, Under international legal standards, any restrictions on human rights must be strictly necessary to protect a legitimate interest and proportionate to the interest being protected, even in times of public emergency or for legitimate national security purposes (conditions that do not apply in Myanmar currently). The orders issued by the SAC fail to meet that standard, as they will arbitrarily interfere with the exercise of rights protected under international law, including freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, the right to liberty, and the right to privacy. Certain rights, such as the rights to bodily integrity and nondiscrimination, are not subject to restriction., “By stripping the people of Myanmar of their basic rights, the military is once again demonstrating its disdain for international human rights protections,” said Linda Lakhdhir, Asia legal advisor at Human Rights Watch. “The junta cannot justify the oppression of Myanmar’s inhabitants through the unilateral creation of arbitrary new laws.”, For an analysis of the junta’s changes in the law, please see below., Analysis of Legal Code Changes, Law Protecting the Privacy and Security of Citizens (2017)
On February 13, the State Administration Council arbitrarily suspended sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Law Protecting the Privacy and Security of Citizens, eroding basic protections for individuals., Section 5 required the presence of two witnesses whenever the police enter a residence for the purposes of search or seizure “to ensure that there is no damage to the privacy or security of the citizen.” The suspension of that protection significantly raises the risk of abuses during searches and arrests., Section 7 required a court order for any detention of more than 24 hours. Suspension of the provision will facilitate violations of international law, which provides that any person detained on a criminal charge be promptly taken before a judge., Section 8 provided protections of an individual’s right to privacy by prohibiting search and seizure, surveillance, spying, or any investigation affecting the privacy, security, and dignity of the individual without a court order, protections that the junta has removed. Under international law, no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence., Penal Code Amendments
On February 14, the SAC announced amendments to the Penal Code that could lead to criminal liability for thousands of demonstrators exercising their rights to free expression of their views, and anyone publicly criticizing the military coup d’etat through any means., The SAC inserted a new provision, section 505A, that could be used to punish comments regarding the illegitimacy of the coup or the military government, among others. The new section would criminalize comments that “cause fear,” spread “false news, [or] agitates directly or indirectly a criminal offense against a Government employee.” Violation of the section is punishable by up to three years in prison., Section 505(a) previously made it a crime to publish or circulate any “statement, rumor or report” “with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, any officer, soldier, sailor or airman, in the Army, Navy or Air Force to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty.” It has been replaced with much broader language clearly designed to penalize those encouraging members of the civil service of the security services to join the Civil Disobedience Movement., Under the revised provision, any attempt to “hinder, disturb, damage the motivation, discipline, health and conduct” of the military personnel and government employees and cause their hatred, disobedience or disloyalty toward the military and the government is punishable by up to three years in prison., The SAC also significantly broadened the “treason” provisions in section 124 of the Penal Code. Section124A, which already criminalized comments that “bring into hatred or contempt” or “excite disaffection against” the government, was expanded to include comments relating to the defense services and defense services personnel, effectively criminalizing any criticism of the military or military personnel. Violation of the section is punishable by up to 20 years in prison., The newly added section 124C imposes a prison term of up to 20 years on anyone who intends to “sabotage or hinder the performance of the Defense Services and law enforcement organizations who are engaged in preserving the stability of the state.” This provision would criminalize efforts to encourage security forces to join the Civil Disobedience Movement or permit unauthorized protests., Finally, under section 124D, a person can be sentenced up to seven years in prison if they hinder a government employee from carrying out their duties. This provision is so broad that any actions of protesters could be interpreted as preventing security personnel or defense service officers from performing their duty., Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Law
On February 14, the junta amended the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Law to make offenses under sections 505A, 124C, and 124D non-bailable and subject to arrest without a warrant., Ward or Village Tract Administration Law (13/2/21)
The amendments to the Ward or Village Tract Administration Law (13/2/21) further increase the military’s ability to conduct surveillance on people’s movements, in particular on human rights defenders seeking shelter away from their own homes. Amendments to section 17 of the Act require all overnight guests from other wards or villages to be reported to the ward or village tract administrator, who are authorized by section 13 to “take action” against any who “failed to inform the guest list.” Section 27 reintroduces criminal sanctions for failing to report overnight guests. Such provisions existed under previous military governments and were deeply resented., Electronic Transactions Law (Law No 7/2021)
On February 15, the junta also amended the Electronic Transactions Law to include, among others, provisions that had been proposed in the draft Cybersecurity Law., As was true under that much-criticized draft law, the amended Electronics Transactions Law permits government agencies, investigators, or law enforcement to access personal data in relation to “cyber-crimes,” “cyber misuse,” or any criminal investigation., The amendments also include several provisions (articles 38(d) and (e)) that provide criminal penalties for “unauthorized” access to online material and that could be used to prosecute whistle blowers, investigative journalists, or activists who use leaked material for their work., Section 38B criminalizes “obtaining, disclosing, using, destroying, modifying, disseminating, or sending someone’s personal data to anyone else without approval,” with one to three years in prison. While the protection of the right to privacy online is important, this provision goes well beyond legitimate protections on privacy and imposes arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression., In particular, “personal data” is defined in a manner so broad as to include virtually any information associated with a person. The law is therefore impermissibly vague and overbroad, as it would likely prevent even the disclosure of information about anyone involved in alleged human rights violations, including by human rights defenders and journalists., Section 38C criminalizes the creation of “misinformation or disinformation with the intent of causing public panic, loss of trust or social division on cyberspace,” and provides for imprisonment of one to three years in addition to fines. These provisions are similarly vague and overbroad and unnecessarily and disproportionately limit the exercise of expression online, including criticism of the coup and the military junta.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-post-coup-legal-changes-erode-human-rights

The new section would criminalize comments that “cause fear,” spread “false news, [or] agitates directly or indirectly a criminal offense against a Government employee.” Violation of the section is punishable by up to three years in prison., Section 505(a) previously made it a crime to publish or circulate any “statement, rumor or report” “with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, any officer, soldier, sailor or airman, in the Army, Navy or Air Force to mutiny or otherwise disregard or fail in his duty.” It has been replaced with much broader language clearly designed to penalize those encouraging members of the civil service of the security services to join the Civil Disobedience Movement., Under the revised provision, any attempt to “hinder, disturb, damage the motivation, discipline, health and conduct” of the military personnel and government employees and cause their hatred, disobedience or disloyalty toward the military and the government is punishable by up to three years in prison., The SAC also significantly broadened the “treason” provisions in section 124 of the Penal Code. Section124A, which already criminalized comments that “bring into hatred or contempt” or “excite disaffection against” the government, was expanded to include comments relating to the defense services and defense services personnel, effectively criminalizing any criticism of the military or military personnel. Violation of the section is punishable by up to 20 years in prison., The newly added section 124C imposes a prison term of up to 20 years on anyone who intends to “sabotage or hinder the performance of the Defense Services and law enforcement organizations who are engaged in preserving the stability of the state.” This provision would criminalize efforts to encourage security forces to join the Civil Disobedience Movement or permit unauthorized protests., Finally, under section 124D, a person can be sentenced up to seven years in prison if they hinder a government employee from carrying out their duties. This provision is so broad that any actions of protesters could be interpreted as preventing security personnel or defense service officers from performing their duty., Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Law
On February 14, the junta amended the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Law to make offenses under sections 505A, 124C, and 124D non-bailable and subject to arrest without a warrant., Ward or Village Tract Administration Law (13/2/21)
The amendments to the Ward or Village Tract Administration Law (13/2/21) further increase the military’s ability to conduct surveillance on people’s movements, in particular on human rights defenders seeking shelter away from their own homes. Amendments to section 17 of the Act require all overnight guests from other wards or villages to be reported to the ward or village tract administrator, who are authorized by section 13 to “take action” against any who “failed to inform the guest list.” Section 27 reintroduces criminal sanctions for failing to report overnight guests. Such provisions existed under previous military governments and were deeply resented., Electronic Transactions Law (Law No 7/2021)
On February 15, the junta also amended the Electronic Transactions Law to include, among others, provisions that had been proposed in the draft Cybersecurity Law., As was true under that much-criticized draft law, the amended Electronics Transactions Law permits government agencies, investigators, or law enforcement to access personal data in relation to “cyber-crimes,” “cyber misuse,” or any criminal investigation., The amendments also include several provisions (articles 38(d) and (e)) that provide criminal penalties for “unauthorized” access to online material and that could be used to prosecute whistle blowers, investigative journalists, or activists who use leaked material for their work., Section 38B criminalizes “obtaining, disclosing, using, destroying, modifying, disseminating, or sending someone’s personal data to anyone else without approval,” with one to three years in prison. While the protection of the right to privacy online is important, this provision goes well beyond legitimate protections on privacy and imposes arbitrary restrictions on freedom of expression., In particular, “personal data” is defined in a manner so broad as to include virtually any information associated with a person. The law is therefore impermissibly vague and overbroad, as it would likely prevent even the disclosure of information about anyone involved in alleged human rights violations, including by human rights defenders and journalists., Section 38C criminalizes the creation of “misinformation or disinformation with the intent of causing public panic, loss of trust or social division on cyberspace,” and provides for imprisonment of one to three years in addition to fines. These provisions are similarly vague and overbroad and unnecessarily and disproportionately limit the exercise of expression online, including criticism of the coup and the military junta.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-post-coup-legal-changes-erode-human-rights

"Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar - Bulletin Issue 3, March 2021 [EN/MY]",Situation Report,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2021,"Message from the Head of the Mechanism, Geneva, 28 February 2021 - I am deeply concerned by the statement of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting that they have received credible information that today, 28 February 2021, at least 18 persons were killed and over 30 wounded when police and military personnel used force, including firing live ammunition into crowds of protestors. This follows reports that hundreds of protestors, journalists, elected officials and political activists have been detained with no apparent legal basis and often with no information about their detention made available by authorities., These acts, including the alleged use of excessive force against peaceful protestors resulting in killings and injuries, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances, may amount to serious human rights violations as well as crimes against humanity when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population. As required by our mandate, the Mechanism will be collecting and analysing evidence of what happened and building case files that could facilitate criminal prosecutions. These attacks on the people of Myanmar must stop., Last month, the Human Rights Council conducted a special session on ""the human rights implications of the crisis in Myanmar"". Member States adopted a resolution ""expressing deep concern at the declaration of the state of emergency imposed in Myanmar by the military on 1 February"", but also ""taking note of the ongoing processes to ensure justice and accountability in respect of alleged crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar."" These issues are inextricably linked and the events of the last several weeks clearly illustrate the crucial role of institutions like the Mechanism, which is working to ensure accountability for the past and deter the most serious international crimes from being committed in the future., During the special session, several Member States and civil society organisations raised concerns about the continuing impunity in Myanmar, and emphasised the need to pursue justice and accountability. They also called on Myanmar to fully cooperate with and allow the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Mechanism to have access to Myanmar., The mandate of the Mechanism is to collect evidence of ""the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011."" The Terms of Reference for the Mechanism make it explicit that the reference to violations of international law includes serious human rights violations. The Mechanism is further mandated to prepare case files that would facilitate criminal proceedings in national, regional or international courts to hold to account those persons individually responsible for such crimes. The temporal mandate of the Mechanism is ongoing and continues to cover all such crimes and violations of international law committed in the territory of Myanmar., The Myanmar Mechanism is committed to doing our part to ensure that those who committed serious international crimes in Myanmar are held to account. We appreciate the assistance and support of all those who share our aim to end impunity for such crimes in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-bulletin-issue-3-march-2021-enmy
