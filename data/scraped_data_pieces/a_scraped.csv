Humanitarian action in an evolving Russia–Ukraine conflict,Analysis,ODI - HPG,Protection and Human Rights,2 Jan 2023,"This note summarises the discussion points of a private online roundtable held by the Humanitarian Policy Group at ODI with support from the British Red Cross on 15 September 2022. Participants comprised senior staff from key donor governments, multilateral development banks and international and national humanitarian organisations operating in Ukraine., The discussion sought to understand how donors and operational agencies should prioritise resources to reach those most in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, in accordance with humanitarian principles, and how the humanitarian sector can best aid recovery efforts., Key messages, Ukraine is comprised of several humanitarian contexts, each with different needs and challenges. This requires different types of response to occur in parallel. There is also the chance for recovery in areas no longer directly affected by conflict., Winter will bring greater humanitarian demand and there are concerns that preparations to date have been insufficient. The dynamic conflict requires collective action to press for cross-line access. Upholding humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence is key in negotiating this access, but has proved challenging., Now is the time to start planning for the medium and long term. The Ukrainian government and civil society should be better supported to meet needs themselves wherever possible. Humanitarian funding from donor governments needs to be more flexible, multi-year and more directly accessible to Ukrainian organisations. Strong coordination will be required between humanitarian and recovery and state-building actors – including multilateral development banks., Funding to local actors remains unacceptably low and the relationship between international and national/local organisations in the response is strained. Policy commitments to localisation face an important test in Ukraine: if meaningful support for locally led humanitarian action does not happen in Ukraine, where local aid groups have high levels of capacity and long-standing interconnections, there is no reason to suggest it will be done at scale in any other response., Read the full report here",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-action-evolving-russia-ukraine-conflict

Snow has fallen and temperatures have dropped below zero degrees Celsius., Six-year-old Melaniia woke up early to find a winter wonderland outside her bedroom window – a carpet of fluffy white snow as far as the eye could see. She quickly rose, dressed in warm winter clothes and with her pink sledge under her arm, excitedly joined friends outside to make a snowman and to sledge on their street., The group of children playing in the snow is much smaller than it was this time last year. That’s because in March and April, this normally quiet neighbourhood was shaken to its very core. For over 30 days, it was targeted by intense shelling- missiles and rockets – leaving behind death, devastation and destruction. Terrified residents fled for cover in underground bunkers or quickly packed some essential belongings and fled further away in search of safety., Melaniia’s family left their home in late February, and only returned home in the summer months, when they felt it was safe to do so., “Melaniia’s father – my son-in-law, took his wife and children to another village further away from here on 25 February,” says 65-year-old retired factory worker and grandmother, Tamara., Despite heavy shelling, Tamara never left the home in which she grew up. Looking over a white fence, she points to a neighbouring house “My 85-year-old mother, Kateryna, and my brother live here. My brother has a disability, and my mother has difficulty walking. I couldn’t leave them behind”., Staying above ground was far too dangerous as missiles and rockets rained down on their village. “I made improvised beds in our cellar where we hid during the hostilities, says Tamara. “The cellar steps were too steep for my mother, so I put a coat down and used it as a sledge to bring her down. We stayed there for two long weeks,” recalls Tamara., Every day the family heard loud shelling and explosions around them. The days passed slowly and with unbearable uncertainty as the cold, the dark and damp set in around them. Tamara’s mother’s leg became badly infected, and the infection started to spread to other parts of her body. “My mother became very sick, and we had no choice but to go to a local hospital amid all the shelling. It was the only way to save her life.”, At the hospital, her mother received the urgent care she so badly needed, and she has since made a full recovery., When hostilities subsided, Tamara and her family were able to finally assess the damage to their home and to their street. Miraculously, the two homes belonging to their families remained standing but significantly damaged., This autumn, the family were enrolled in UNHCR’ s shelter programme, through the local authorities. Soon after, both houses were repaired –receiving new windows, roofs and doors – to help keep the heat in this winter., Sitting in her warm kitchen beside a fridge adorned with colourful children’s drawings, Tamara talks about what the repairs mean for her: “Having older people and people with disabilities in our family, this would be very difficult to do these repairs on our own,” she says.”, Next door, her mother, who also survived WWII, sits down to a dinner in her warm kitchen., Despite unimaginable hardship and suffering, this family are slowly healing from the pain of loss and destruction. Tamara keeps herself busy caring for her grandchildren, late evenings she is reading books., Against all odds, she finds some solace in their experience. “I feel that were not left alone to deal with our tragedy. It gives me strength and hope in humanity’ she says, smiling wistfully., UNHCR Representative Karolina Lindholm Billing met with Tamara and little Melaniia in Chernihiv city together with UNHCR’s longstanding Nordic partners, including the Ambassadors of Denmark and Sweden to Ukraine, and the Charge d’Affairs of the Embassy of Finland., “More than 150,000 people fled Chernihiv region at the beginning of the war in search of safety.

Working together to include people with disabilities,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,27 Dec 2022,"Author Tarryn Ritannia Brown, UNHCR | 27 Dec 2022, It is estimated that 15% of the world’s population have a disability, including people with intellectual disabilities, Deaf people, autistic people and women with disabilities, reminding us that disability is diverse and often invisible., In Ukraine and many other humanitarian situations, this figure is likely to be higher. The war means that previously available services for people with disabilities are disrupted while many other people will acquire new long-term injuries. To ensure that the needs of people with disability are mainstreamed across the humanitarian response, extra steps need to be taken to ensure that assistance is accessible and inclusive. For example, ensuring information on available assistance is available in accessible formats, facilities are physically accessible and collaborating with organizations of people with disabilities – OPDs – who are representative groups of people with disabilities., In Ukraine, there are many examples of leaders with disabilities directly responding to the needs of people with disabilities since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite the challenging situation, OPDs, have mobilized support through their network across Ukraine. The National Assembly of Persons with Disabilities – an umbrella group with some 100 member organizations – reports that around 40 percent of their member organizations are displaced. Whilst this creates significant challenges, it also enables OPDs to be a source of robust qualitative and quantitative information for humanitarian actors on current barriers experienced by persons with disabilities in Ukraine., Ukrainian disability rights activists also play a key role. One such activist is Tetiana Barantsova. Tetiana, the founder of Ami-Skhid, a regional network of NGOs that helps Ukrainians with disabilities, has been helping people with disabilities escape conflict areas and restart their lives in safety since 2014. She herself has personal experience of displacement; she was forced to flee with her family from the city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. For her commitment to people with disabilities, she was chosen as the regional winner for Europe of the 2020 UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award, a prestigious annual prize that recognizes those who have gone to extraordinary lengths to support forcibly displaced or stateless people. The government also named her its Commissioner for the Rights of People with Disabilities., Since February 2022, Tetiana has helped to arrange transport for people with disabilities to flee to safer locations. Tetiana uses her many contacts with local authorities, NGOs and volunteers across Ukraine to help evacuate people with disabilities who call her. Tetiana explains; “We call local authorities and ask for their help … They respond [over SMS] with simple words: ‘On it’ and then send a ‘+’, and I know the person was assisted.”, Organizing accessible and inclusive evacuations is only the first step in helping people with disabilities displaced by the war. Once they have made it to safer areas, they need further support to find suitable accommodation, medical care and other services. Tetiana does her best to arrange for volunteers to meet those arriving to train stations and take them to shelters but many such buildings lack the accessible facilities and inclusive support. Many people with disabilities, including older people with disabilities, are not able to evacuate. Other persons with disabilities choose not to evacuate, with many sharing that they intend to stay in their own homes for the winter despite limited access to cash, food and heating sources., UNHCR is intensifying efforts to reduce the barriers experienced by people with disabilities to the assistance we provide. We will collaborate with OPDs and disability rights advocates to identify solutions to common barriers to accessing our legal aid, psycho-social support and multi-purpose cash assistance programmes, and work to ensure that our shelter interventions are inclusive and adapted to the needs of people with disabilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/working-together-include-people-disabilities
"IOM and EU Will Support Over 700,000 Ukrainians Through Winter in Wartime [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,IOM,"Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items",27 Dec 2022,"As temperatures across Ukraine have plummeted below zero and are expected to drop even more, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Mission in Ukraine, is stepping up efforts to help displaced and war-affected people cope with cold weather conditions. With humanitarian funding from the European Union, IOM will support over 700,000 Ukrainians with multi-sectoral assistance during the winter months, which will be the most challenging season yet for the country., IOM's winterization support, made possible with funding from the EU, includes the refurbishment of collective centres hosting displaced people, the improvement of water supply, wastewater and heating systems, the repair of damaged homes, as well as the distribution of high-thermal blankets, bedding kits, mattresses, and hygiene items. It also includes the provision of solid fuel, and cash assistance enabling people to have flexible means for supporting themselves during winter. With this funding, IOM will stock critical items ensuring war-affected people in Ukraine continue to be reached, and that will serve as well to support partners responding to the urgent needs on the ground., In total, mobile teams will conduct repair works in 375 collective sites and social institutions, improving insulation, fixing leaking roofs, replacing broken windows, non-functioning radiators, and installing additional showers. IOM will refurbish 5,800 private homes and distribute emergency shelter kits to enable people to make necessary improvements themselves. Solid fuel will be provided to help families stay warm during the cold period. IOM will also support municipalities in areas recently retaken by the Government of Ukraine with construction materials and generators., ""Displaced and war-affected people will face new and growing challenges as the war drags on and winter grips Ukraine. Our key priority is to support warm, safe, and dignified conditions to help people get through the next few months,"" said Anh Nguyen, IOM Ukraine Chief of Mission., ""The vulnerable people in Ukraine are going through the most difficult winter. As attacks continue leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating, and water, our humanitarian partners like IOM continue working to meet the most pressing needs,"" said Claudia Amaral, Head of EU Humanitarian Aid in Ukraine., Around 18 million Ukrainians, or 40 per cent of the country's population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates. Continuous attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure have multiplied the devastating impact of the war and risks for the most affected people., IOM's latest survey shows that despite multiple attacks on the country's power supply and heating infrastructure, Ukrainians plan to spend the winter at their current locations: only seven per cent of respondents nationwide are actively considering leaving. At the same time, private resources for survival are becoming scarce, as 43 per cent of all families in Ukraine have completely exhausted their savings., For more information, please contact Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, +38 067 447 97 92.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-and-eu-will-support-over-700000-ukrainians-through-winter-wartime-enuk

Undocumented and Displaced: Living in Legal Limbo During Wartime,News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,27 Dec 2022,"Ivano-Frankivsk, 27 December 2022 – “Legally, it’s like I don’t exist. It’s as though I have just fallen from the sky,” says 31-year-old Ievhen, sitting with his partner and two children in a tiny dormitory room in Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine, where they recently moved., Born in the Russian Federation, Ievhen grew up in several orphanages across Ukraine because his mother had been deprived of parental rights and his father had died at an early age. The birth certificates of his children, Milana and Ievhen Junior, are the only official documents where his name is mentioned., Due to his complicated upbringing, Ievhen has never been able to get a passport or access many of his rights: to have an education, get a decent job, officially marry his partner Marharyta, open a bank account, or receive state benefits – which he should now be entitled to as an internally displaced person., While living in this legal limbo was already difficult enough for Ievhen before the war started, the current situation has made it even worse., In mid-March, Ievhen with his then-pregnant partner and two-year-old Milana were forced to flee the city of Izium in the Kharkiv region, after taking shelter in a cold basement for several weeks. The family was lucky to reach safety in a village near Kharkiv and did not plan to travel further at first, but a house fire left them with no choice but to accept an acquaintance’s offer to go to western Ukraine., “We gave him all the money we had when we arrived – about UAH 10,000 (USD 270) – and he just took it and disappeared. Three days later, a woman came and told us that we had to leave because the rent had only been covered for a couple of days. We haven’t been able to get in touch with that man ever since; he just disappeared, leaving us homeless yet again,” Ievhen recalls., With no savings, Ievhen and Marharyta had to eventually take shelter in a school nearby which served as a collective centre for those displaced. To ensure their well-being, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) plans to support them with cash assistance to cover the next months’ rent in a dormitory., With a growing family to provide for, Ievhen started to look for a job, accepting any offer that came his way. Without documents to prove his identity, he was not able to find permanent employment or register as an internally displaced person and access social aid., Seeking legal advice, he reached out to IOM’s partner NGO Caritas who referred the family to IOM’s tailored protection services. Through it, Ievhen’s family has been able to access support to cover medical expenses at the local maternity, clothes, baby items, a heater, and pay utility debts., During discussions with IOM staff, it came to light that Ievhen used to work in construction and was hoping to make use of his skills again. Receiving construction tools from IOM has been a game changer, he says, as he is now able to secure better jobs. With the money he earns, he has been able to buy winter clothes for his family, including their newborn baby, Ievhen Junior., “We are grateful for all help that we have received. I have two children and a wife to support, so I cannot afford to give up. I am happy that I am able to work and can build a better future for us,” he says., For now, the couple is planning to stay in Ivano-Frankivsk until the situation improves. As millions of other Ukrainians, they are now faced with severe power outages and lack hot water, electricity, and heating, which further exacerbates their needs. “We hope for the war to be over soon and for my husband to finally receive his first ID, so we can officially get married,” Marharyta says., After everything they have been through, Marharyta feels that she can rely on her partner during their happy times but also when things get rough. “Ievhen always tells me not to worry, that behind the clouds, the sun is always shining.”, Legal identity is central to enabling regular migration and to protecting the rights of migrants throughout their migration journeys. IOM is committed to facilitating access to legal identity for all, in support of the 2030 Agenda and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration., The need for protection services in Ukraine is now greater than ever. According to an IOM-led survey, due to war-related shocks, the vulnerability of Ukrainians has doubled since last year, with every other Ukrainian being exposed to human trafficking risks or other forms of exploitation. Since the beginning of the war in February, IOM has provided tailored protection assistance to over 500 people., This story was written by Iryna Tymchyshyn, Communications Specialist with IOM Ukraine, itymchyshyn@iom.int.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undocumented-and-displaced-living-legal-limbo-during-wartime

Switzerland continues winter aid deliveries to Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. Switzerland,"Contributions
Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Dec 2022,"The harsh winter is posing a severe threat to millions of Ukrainians. Many are without electricity and heating due to targeted attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. Switzerland is organising its next consignment of humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian population, with 40 heaters and an equal number of generators. The lorries loaded with this equipment left for Ukraine today., The winter is worsening the plight of millions of Ukrainians who have already been suffering because of the war for ten months. The recurring targeted attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure have left many households without electricity, water or other basic services. Many fear that they will have no heating this winter., After having delivered thirty generators last week, Switzerland is now sending Ukraine forty heaters and the same number of generators. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) obtained the supplies in Switzerland and organised their transport. They will be delivered to the Ukrainian civil defence authorities and used in tents or large spaces where residents can come to warm up. The Swiss authorities are currently looking into the possibility of sending additional relief supplies., These deliveries are part of a broader action plan to help the Ukrainian population make it through this winter. The plan, officially announced by President of the Swiss Confederation Ignazio Cassis at the Paris conference of 13 December, foresees funding for projects aimed at swiftly building back energy infrastructure and housing in Ukraine. In addition, several SDC-supported projects have been adapted to meet winter needs. In November, Switzerland allocated CHF 100 million, which Parliament approved in December, to support all these measures., Address for enquiries:

Water Sanitation Hygiene",23 Dec 2022,"Context and Methodology, To inform humanitarian actors, REACH has been conducting monthly Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM) since March 2022 across Ukraine, covering: (i) accessible or government-controlled areas (GCAs), including both conflict-affected1 , newly accessible areas2 , and IDP-hosting settlements3 , and (ii) hard-to-reach areas, including non-government controlled areas (NGCAs)4 and/or territories of active conflict5 , and conflict-affected areas with no phone coverage., The sixth round of HSM specifically intended to inform strategic decision-making processes in alignment with the Humanitarian Response Planning timeline, as well as to allow humanitarian actors to get a better overview of how humanitarian needs have changed over time and receive indicative information on the areas where a higher level of need or service access concerns have been registered., Data collection for the sixth round was conducted between 5th and 16th September 2022 by adopting the ‘Area of Knowledge‘ (AoK) methodology in both urban and rural NGCAs. The current briefing note provides key indicative findings on the assessed settlements in Kharkisvka and Donetska oblasts. 46 settlements in Kharkivska oblast and 77 settlements in Donetska oblast were assessed through a total of 260 interviews with key informants (KIs)7 . Out of these, 40 settlements in Kharkivska oblast and 58 settlements in Donetska oblast were within newly accessible areas in these oblasts or located within 30 km zone from the line of contact (LoC) or the state border with Russia as of November 2022. These areas have been identified as areas of interest for the current analysis in terms of direct affectedness by hostilities, and in line with programming framework of multiple humanitarian actors. The remaining 25 settlements among those assessed were either located in the rest of GCAs or were categorised as NGCAs as of November 2022. The briefing note focuses on the mentioned areas of interest aiming to inform and support programmatic and operational response in these areas. The findings should be interpreted as indicative of the humanitarian situation in the assessed settlements as of September 2022, when the data collection was completed., Interpretation of findings, For the sixth round, the Data Aggregation Plan used the average approach to aggregate the settlement response by using a severity scale in cases of single-choice questions. All KI responses from the same settlement were aggregated to have one data point for each variable per settlement. The findings are presented at the settlement and/or oblast level. In case of multiple-choice questions, the rule was to select all responses that have been reported/cited by at least one respondent if the number of respondents was smaller than 5, otherwise 2 out of 5 and more respondents., In this brief, the data represents a percentage of settlements (towns or villages) for which KIs reported a specific answer to a survey question. These statistics cannot be extrapolated to represent a proportion (%) of the population, and thus should be interpreted as indicative rather than representative. Given the small and purposive sample, these results only provide a basic understanding of the situation in the assessed regions., Furthermore, given that the KIs were selected based on whether they fulfilled the selection criteria, there was no minimum number of KIs set per settlement. Therefore, findings on individual settlements should be interpreted with caution as they are considered indicative., Key highlights, At the time of data collection (in September 2022), the overall humanitarian situation in settlements within the areas of interest in Kharkivska oblast was reportedly ‘severe‘ in about a quarter of assessed settlements., In almost half of the assessed settlements in the areas of interest in Kharkivska oblast, the level of need had not changed over the preceding month., In more than half of the assessed settlements in the areas of interest in Donetska oblast, the level of need was ‘extreme’ or ‘severe’., About two-thirds of the settlements of interest in Donetska oblast reported that the humanitarian situation had deteriorated over the preceding month., Medicine, food, and financial resources appeared to be the top priority needs in the assessed settlements in the areas of interest both in Kharkivska and Donetska oblasts. Additionally, access to medicines, financial resources, as well as disruptions to telecommunications were identified as the main concerns.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-september-2022-briefing-note-focus-settlements-kharkivska-and-donetska-oblasts

Update 137 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (23 Dec 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,23 Dec 2022,"Diplomatic efforts to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are making headway, with the aim to agree and implement the much-needed measure soon, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said today after a new round of talks on his proposal., Director General Grossi spoke after meeting senior Russian government officials in Moscow yesterday, including Alexey Likhachev, Director General of Russian state nuclear company Rosatom. He has earlier on several occasions discussed the proposed zone with senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv. The consultations with both sides will continue in the near future., The hours-long meeting in the Russian capital yesterday was “another round of necessary discussions on the creation of a protection zone for the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,” Director General Grossi said. “It’s key that the zone focuses solely on preventing a nuclear accident. I am continuing my efforts towards this goal with a sense of utmost urgency.”, The plan will help prevent a nuclear accident by stopping shelling to and from a zone around the plant, Europe’s largest. Although the plant itself has been relatively quiet in recent weeks after it came under intense shelling about a month ago, the clear sound of military activity can still be heard in the vicinity of the facility, underlining persistent nuclear safety and security risks., “As we have experienced several times before during the war in Ukraine, the situation can take a sudden – and dramatic – turn for the worse at any moment. The plant is located on an active frontline in the middle of a large-scale war. The situation remains extremely precarious and potentially dangerous, and the protection zone remains urgently needed,” Director General Grossi said., At the ZNPP, the 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power line to the electricity grid was re-connected on 14 December, a day after the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) team reported it had been disconnected. The ZNPP now receives the electricity it needs for essential nuclear safety and security functions from both a 750 kV main external power line and the back-up power line., On 16 December, ZNPP’s on-site power grid fluctuated for some two hours as a result of shelling on the northern side of the Dnipro River, but there was no loss of off-site power, no impact to plant equipment and all systems remained in operation., As previously reported by the ISAMZ team, staffing at the ZNPP remains at reduced levels. The ISAMZ team have been informed that ZNPP staff, as well as the residents of the nearby city of Enerhodar, are under psychological stress caused by the on-going military conflict in the region. The staff’s workload has increased due to the reduced staffing and the need to repair damage caused by shelling and to ensure the plant’s nuclear safety and security. Director General Grossi has repeatedly expressed serious concern about the pressure that ZNPP staff are facing, with potential consequences for nuclear safety and security., Nine mobile diesel-fuelled boilers with power in the range of 1-6.5 megawatts (MW) have been delivered to the ZNPP and are being installed, with four already operating. The nine boilers will provide about 34 MW of heating to the ZNPP site and to Enerhodar. In addition, up to 70 MW heating capacity will be provided by such boilers to be installed in Enerhodar., ZNPP has 20 fixed emergency diesel electrical power generators in stand-by mode that are ready to provide electricity if off-site electrical power is not available. To provide further redundancy and back-up capability, seven 1 MW mobile diesel electrical power generators are currently being tested and installed. Two of them are already connected to one reactor unit and are in stand-by mode. The remaining five mobile generators will be connected to other reactor units., On 20 December, the IAEA reviewed the impact freezing temperatures may have on the external components of the reactors’ cooling system. The team concluded that the current low-to-freezing temperatures do not have a significant effect on the site’s nuclear safety and security at this time., The team did not observe any ice near the inlet channels that direct cooling water from the reservoir to the reactor units, but a thin layer of frozen water was seen in the area near the cooling outlet. The cooling water reservoir’s bulk water temperature on 20 December was above freezing at approximately 6oC., The IAEA mission also reported that the Russian Federation’s nuclear regulator Rostekhnadzor, the Federal Service for the Supervision of Environment, Technology and Nuclear Management, plans to maintain a rotating team at the ZNPP., The IAEA is preparing to deploy IAEA teams on a continual basis to four other Ukrainian nuclear facilities, the Khmelnitsky, Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants (NPPs), as well as the Chornobyl site, as agreed last week by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and IAEA Director General Grossi. These missions aim to provide technical support and assistance as needed in order to help maintain a high level of nuclear safety and security and reduce the risk of a nuclear incident or accident., On 16 December, significant shelling was experienced throughout Ukraine. This resulted in the Khmelnitsky and Rivne NPPs reducing power and the South Ukraine NPP disconnecting from the electrical grid. None of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine experienced a loss of off-site power. Now, all nine reactors are operating once again at these three NPPs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-137-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-23-dec-2022

Despite the efforts to ensure that needs are met, imminent risks of GBV remain high. Mainstreaming GBV services within other sectors play a key role in assessing the risks and prioritized needs of the affected population., Safety Audit, Through risk mitigation measures, the safety audit was conducted by UNHCR’s CCCM partners Rokada, NEEMIA, NEEKA, Tenth of April (TTA), ACTED and Right to Protection (R2P). As a pilot implementation, the safety audit is presented as a risk mitigation exercise conducted by both GBV and non-GBV actors such as CCCM seeking to inform programming on the identified needs to mitigate risk of GBV in CCCM sector. Furthermore, the safety audit informs the GBV related concerns for immediate response interventions at the coordination level., UNHCR CCCM with technical assistance from protection (GBV) conducted Safety Audits in 47 IDP Collective centers across 10 oblasts between 12th and 23rd September 2022.

Recovery and Reconstruction",22 Dec 2022,"Together with the government of Ukraine, partners, and with the support of the European Union, UNOPS will carry out emergency repairs of over 40 schools across the country., The ongoing conflict has led to the destruction of much of the country’s infrastructure. This includes public buildings and schools, putting the rights of millions of children to a quality education at risk., As part of the European Commission’s wider allocation of €100 million to rehabilitate schools across Ukraine, UNOPS has partnered with the EU to implement a €20 million project that aims to provide safe and accessible learning environments to more than 20,000 students., “By waging its war against Ukraine, Russia is stealing the right of Ukrainian children to learn, to thrive and to reach for their dreams,” said EU Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič., “Schools can offer a sense of normalcy, both to children and teachers. With our humanitarian funding to school repairs, we hope to once again provide a safe learning space to children. Because every child deserves access to education, even in war zones,” he added., UNOPS has already started damage assessments of the schools to be rehabilitated across the Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. The goal is to repair the majority of facilities by September 2023, in time for the new school term., As the Secretary-General recently said, the scale of destruction across Ukraine requires strong support from the international community that goes far beyond humanitarian aid. That same community must invest smartly to accelerate reconstruction and use it as a pathway to sustainable development for Ukraine., Jens Wandel - UNOPS Acting Executive Director, As well as providing safe and accessible learning environments for students in primary and secondary schools, the project will also contribute to improving the working conditions of teachers and school personnel., “While safety and access to electricity remain a priority, we must not forget that many of the country's children are being denied an education right now,” said Tim Lardner, UNOPS Country Director in Ukraine., “This will have far reaching effects on the country’s future.

The Netherlands provides equipment and parts to Ukraine to help repair its energy infrastructure,News and Press Release,Govt. Netherlands,"Contributions
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Dec 2022,"This winter the Netherlands is supporting Ukraine by providing a shipment of materials so the country can repair crucial energy infrastructure. It includes transformers, switch components and cables needed to repair the electricity grid. The contribution is part of the €180 million the Dutch government has set aside to help Ukraine make it through the winter, of which €18 million is for helping the country repair its infrastructure. Recent Russian bombing has further increased the damage done to the electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. As a result, a portion of the Ukrainian population is regularly without electricity, heating and/or water., Equipment and parts for making repairs, Since October, Russia has carried out countless attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid. Despite Ukrainians’ best efforts, a shortage of equipment and parts is among the factors making repairs increasingly difficult. Various talks with Ukraine and the European Commission have recently taken place to establish what equipment and parts Ukraine needs most. The Netherlands’ contribution worth some €6 million includes materials that can be used to help Ukraine repair its electricity grid. For security reasons, the details of the shipment – including the final destination – will not be made public., The Netherlands is working with the European Commission on the logistical side of the operation, and transport to Ukraine will be covered by the EU’s humanitarian aid organisation.

Today, in their 12th meeting this year, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, again condemned in the strongest possible terms Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and expressed their full solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes. They underscored their steadfast commitment to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognised borders., 2. Recalling previous G7 Foreign Ministers’ statements, they reiterated their strong condemnation of Russia’s illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, which will never be recognized; atrocities committed by Russian armed forces, including those involving the killing of civilians, torture, reported executions, sexual violence, and deportations, including of children, to Russia. G7 members underlined there can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities. They will hold President Putin and those responsible to account in accordance with international law. G7 members reiterated that Russia’s weaponization of energy and food especially impacts the world’s most vulnerable and that Russia’s spreading of disinformation and false accusations, Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and Russia’s seizure and militarization of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are unacceptable. G7 members again underlined their full support for the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish a nuclear safety and security zone at the ZNPP., 3. G7 members continue to call on Belarusian authorities to stop enabling the Russian war of aggression by permitting Russian armed forces to use Belarusian territory and by providing support to the Russian military. Any further active participation in the Russian illegal war of aggression would run counter to the will and aspirations of the Belarusian people. If the Belarusian authorities more directly involve Belarus in Russia’s war, the G7 will impose overwhelming additional costs on the regime., 4. Russia’s massive and deliberate attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, in particular energy, heating and water facilities, using missiles and Iranian drones, have left millions of Ukrainians in the dark and cold of winter. Through these barbaric attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. G7 members recalled that indiscriminate attacks, as well as attacks on the civilian population or civilian objects constitute a war crime. They underscored increased efforts to assist the Ukrainian people throughout this winter, including following the international conference held in Paris on 13 December, which furthered G7+ efforts to respond to the humanitarian emergency. Resolved to support Ukraine’s repair, recovery and reconstruction, G7 members recalled the importance of coordinating on further international support, including in the fields of critical infrastructure and of Ukraine’s recovery, and welcomed the recent agreement by G7 Leaders to establish a multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform., 5. G7 members committed to enhance and closely coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements for military and defense equipment, especially air defense. They underlined this is essential to save lives and prevent additional civilian suffering., 6. The G7 members also reiterated their full resolve to continue coordinating financial, material, humanitarian, defense, political, technical and legal assistance to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. They remained committed to the unprecedented coordinated sanctions measures in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. G7 members will maintain and intensify economic pressure on Russia and those who evade and undermine the restrictive measures. They encouraged third countries to join G7 efforts, including the coordinated action to reduce Russian revenues from the export of oil by leveraging the maximum price per barrel for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil set by the Price Cap Coalition. They reiterated their commitment to shielding vulnerable countries that are severely impacted by the repercussions of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and Russia’s weaponization of energy and food., 7. G7 members commended the bravery of the Ukrainian people in their fight for their country. The G7 firmly supported efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial stability and support its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous future, and encouraged Ukraine’s reform agenda. They remained committed to fully supporting Ukraine in securing its free and democratic future in line with its European path. They highlighted shared values of freedom and democracy, and are committed to upholding the rules-based multilateral order and international cooperation., 8. G7 members welcomed and supported President Zelenskyy’s efforts to promote a just and lasting peace. Russia can end this war immediately by ceasing its attacks against Ukraine and completely and unconditionally withdrawing its forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders. G7 members again called on Russia to do so immediately., Afghanistan, 9. The G7 members strongly condemned the Taliban’s recent decision to ban women from universities, to continue to bar girls from secondary schools, and to impose other harsh restrictions on the ability of women and girls in Afghanistan to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms. They urged the Taliban to abandon the ban on university education for women and to reverse without delay the existing decision to prohibit girls’ access to secondary school. The recent measures by the Taliban, in conjunction with previous cumulative measures restricting the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls in Afghanistan, are extremely concerning and seem to be a systematic policy. Gender persecution may amount to a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute, to which Afghanistan is a State Party. The G7 members stand with all Afghans in their demand to exercise their human rights consistent with Afghanistan’s obligations under international law. Taliban policies designed to erase women from public life will have consequences for how our countries engage with the Taliban., Handover of the G7 Presidency to Japan, 10. Under the German Presidency in 2022, G7 members, together with their international partners, have demonstrated unity and resolve in supporting Ukraine, building on their shared values and commitment to the rules-based international order, with the UN Charter at its core. G7 members will continue to work with others to mitigate the global consequences of the war that Russia has unleashed on Ukraine, harming Ukraine and the world’s most vulnerable. The G7 stands ready to continue and further strengthen this commitment under the upcoming Japanese G7 Presidency in 2023., Media enquiries, Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk, Telephone 020 7008 3100, Contact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/g7-foreign-ministers-virtual-meeting-december-2022-chairs-statement-23-december-2022

Today, in their 12th meeting this year, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, again condemned in the strongest possible terms Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and expressed their full solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes. They underscored their steadfast commitment to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognised borders., 2. Recalling previous G7 Foreign Ministers’ statements, they reiterated their strong condemnation of Russia’s illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, which will never be recognized; atrocities committed by Russian armed forces, including those involving the killing of civilians, torture, reported executions, sexual violence, and deportations, including of children, to Russia. G7 members underlined there can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities. They will hold President Putin and those responsible to account in accordance with international law. G7 members reiterated that Russia’s weaponization of energy and food especially impacts the world’s most vulnerable and that Russia’s spreading of disinformation and false accusations, Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and Russia’s seizure and militarization of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) are unacceptable. G7 members again underlined their full support for the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish a nuclear safety and security zone at the ZNPP., 3. G7 members continue to call on Belarusian authorities to stop enabling the Russian war of aggression by permitting Russian armed forces to use Belarusian territory and by providing support to the Russian military. Any further active participation in the Russian illegal war of aggression would run counter to the will and aspirations of the Belarusian people. If the Belarusian authorities more directly involve Belarus in Russia’s war, the G7 will impose overwhelming additional costs on the regime., 4. Russia’s massive and deliberate attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, in particular energy, heating and water facilities, using missiles and Iranian drones, have left millions of Ukrainians in the dark and cold of winter. Through these barbaric attacks, Russia is trying to terrorize the civilian population. G7 members recalled that indiscriminate attacks, as well as attacks on the civilian population or civilian objects constitute a war crime. They underscored increased efforts to assist the Ukrainian people throughout this winter, including following the international conference held in Paris on 13 December, which furthered G7+ efforts to respond to the humanitarian emergency. Resolved to support Ukraine’s repair, recovery and reconstruction, G7 members recalled the importance of coordinating on further international support, including in the fields of critical infrastructure and of Ukraine’s recovery, and welcomed the recent agreement by G7 Leaders to establish a multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform., 5. G7 members committed to enhance and closely coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements for military and defense equipment, especially air defense. They underlined this is essential to save lives and prevent additional civilian suffering., 6. The G7 members also reiterated their full resolve to continue coordinating financial, material, humanitarian, defense, political, technical and legal assistance to support Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. They remained committed to the unprecedented coordinated sanctions measures in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. G7 members will maintain and intensify economic pressure on Russia and those who evade and undermine the restrictive measures. They encouraged third countries to join G7 efforts, including the coordinated action to reduce Russian revenues from the export of oil by leveraging the maximum price per barrel for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil set by the Price Cap Coalition. They reiterated their commitment to shielding vulnerable countries that are severely impacted by the repercussions of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and Russia’s weaponization of energy and food., 7. G7 members commended the bravery of the Ukrainian people in their fight for their country. The G7 firmly supported efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial stability and support its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous future, and encouraged Ukraine’s reform agenda. They remained committed to fully supporting Ukraine in securing its free and democratic future in line with its European path. They highlighted shared values of freedom and democracy, and are committed to upholding the rules-based multilateral order and international cooperation., 8. G7 members welcomed and supported President Zelenskyy’s efforts to promote a just and lasting peace. Russia can end this war immediately by ceasing its attacks against Ukraine and completely and unconditionally withdrawing its forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders. G7 members again called on Russia to do so immediately., Afghanistan, 9. The G7 members strongly condemned the Taliban’s recent decision to ban women from universities, to continue to bar girls from secondary schools, and to impose other harsh restrictions on the ability of women and girls in Afghanistan to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms. They urged the Taliban to abandon the ban on university education for women and to reverse without delay the existing decision to prohibit girls’ access to secondary school. The recent measures by the Taliban, in conjunction with previous cumulative measures restricting the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls in Afghanistan, are extremely concerning and seem to be a systematic policy. Gender persecution may amount to a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute, to which Afghanistan is a State Party. The G7 members stand with all Afghans in their demand to exercise their human rights consistent with Afghanistan’s obligations under international law. Taliban policies designed to erase women from public life will have consequences for how our countries engage with the Taliban., Handover of the G7 Presidency to Japan, 10. Under the German Presidency in 2022, G7 members, together with their international partners, have demonstrated unity and resolve in supporting Ukraine, building on their shared values and commitment to the rules-based international order, with the UN Charter at its core. G7 members will continue to work with others to mitigate the global consequences of the war that Russia has unleashed on Ukraine, harming Ukraine and the world’s most vulnerable.

Zelensky visit to U.S. | Cluster munitions have no place in war,News and Press Release,HI,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",21 Dec 2022,"As President Zelensky arrives in the U.S., Humanity & Inclusion is deeply concerned by any potential transfer of cluster munitions from the U.S. to Ukraine, as previously reported by CNN., Cluster munitions are banned by the Oslo Convention, which counts 123 States Parties. Russian forces have intensively used cluster munitions in Ukraine since February 2022, while alleged use by Ukrainian forces has been reported at least three times. Experience has consistently shown that almost all the victims of this weapon are civilians. Russia, Ukraine, and the United States are not parties to the Oslo Convention., The devastations caused to civilian populations in Ukraine by repeated bombing and shelling of towns and cities, and by the recent strikes on critical civilian infrastructures by Russian forces are unacceptable and should be unanimously condemned., “A U.S. transfer of cluster munitions to Ukraine would be counterintuitive on many levels,” says Jeff Meer, U.S. Executive Director of Humanity & Inclusion. “Any additional use of cluster munitions will aggravate not just a civilian toll, but also an economic one. As the world’s largest mine action donor, America will inevitably bear at least some of the cost of clearance.”, Humanity & Inclusion, a leading member of the International Campaign to Ban Cluster Munitions, will continue to denounce any use by any parties of this barbaric weapon. We call on Ukraine to abandon its alleged request to the U.S. to be provided with cluster munitions. We also call on the U.S. to block transfer of this devastating weapon. The U.S. should urgently review its policy on producing, selling and transferring cluster munitions., “If Ukraine was also to use cluster munitions, it would only add devastation and despair to civilians and aggravate the already extended contamination of Ukraine by explosive remnants of war,” Meer adds. “Cluster munitions have been phased out of service in the world. There is a global trend to abandon the use of this banned weapon due to its indiscriminate impact.”, Press reports that Ukrainian officials and lawmakers have in recent months urged the Biden administration and members of Congress to provide the Ukrainian military with cluster munition warheads., Why cluster munitions are banned, Cluster munitions are group of weapons designed to drop several hundred bomblets called submunitions, which are released from a canister mid-air and scattered. Designed to be dispersed over areas as large as a football field, submunitions inevitably affect civilian areas: killing and maiming civilian populations but also destroying and damaging vital civilian infrastructure., Up to 40% of the bomblets fail, and do not explode on impact. The result is decades of explosive contamination. Like landmines, munitions can be triggered at the slightest contact, killing and maiming people during and long after conflicts., Civilians account for the vast majority of casualties. In 2021, civilians accounted for 97% of all casualties whose status was recorded (Cluster Munitions Monitor 2022). More than 60% of those people killed and injured were children., The use of cluster munitions triggers long-term needs for affected populations: the clearance of the land contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war, the reconstruction of damaged or destroyed civilian infrastructures and the access to vital services for persons injured, families of those killed and injured and affected communities., By making no distinction between military targets and civilian areas, cluster munitions violate the rules of international humanitarian law., Recent use in Ukraine, In the first half of 2022, according to preliminary reports by the Cluster Munition Monitor 2022, new uses of cluster munitions were reported in Ukraine, where Russian forces conducted hundreds of attacks. Ukrainian forces appeared to have used cluster munitions in at least three locations that were under the control of Russia’s armed force or affiliated armed groups at the time., Since February 2022, at least 689 civilians were killed (215) or injured (474) during cluster munition attacks in Ukraine. The actual casualty total is likely greater due to challenges with casualty recording., Cluster munition use in Ukraine mostly occurred in populated areas. Besides killing and injuring civilians, cluster munitions also damaged civilian infrastructure: homes, hospitals, schools, plants, playgrounds, etc. Cluster munition attacks also threatened internally displaced persons and those seeking humanitarian aid., Extended consequences and contamination in Ukraine, Ukraine is currently affected by systematic attacks, using cluster munitions but also other type of explosive weapons, against critical civilian infrastructure, causing devastating consequences for access to essential services for civilian population, in addition to deaths and injuries., Relentless artillery bombardment and aerial bombing, as well as the use of illegal weapons such as landmine and cluster munitions, has left behind heavy contamination by unexploded ordnance. Ukraine is supposedly becoming one of the most contaminated countries in the world., Official estimates say that up to 300,000km2 of the country require some form of Humanitarian Mine Action interventions. If correct, Ukraine has become the most contaminated country on Earth., US stockpiles, The exact size of the U.S. stockpile today is unknown, however, the U.S. appears to have made significant progress in recent years to remove cluster munitions from its active inventory and place them in its demilitarization inventory for destruction. In April 2022, the U.S. awarded the company Expal USA with a contract for the demilitarization and disposal of U.S. cluster munition stocks., Humanity & Inclusion calls the United States to review of its cluster munition policy, which currently allows for transfer of cluster munitions (so long as they have a failure rate below 1 percent). The last U.S. manufacturer of cluster munitions, Textron, ceased production in 2016., A recent report from the Congressional Research Service can be found here (March 2022). The latest Cluster Munition Monitor update on the U.S. is found here., Oslo Convention, Cluster bombs are weapons containing several hundred mini-bombs called cluster munitions. Designed to be scattered over large areas, they inevitably fall in civilian neighborhoods. Up to 40% do not explode on impact. Like anti-personnel mines, they can be triggered by the slightest contact, killing and maiming people during and after conflicts. As they make no distinction between civilians, civilian property and military targets, cluster bombs violate the rules of international humanitarian law. The Oslo Convention, which bans the use, storage, transfer, production and sale of cluster munitions, was opened for signature in December 2008. Currently, 123 countries are parties to this convention., About Humanity & Inclusion, Humanity & Inclusion is an independent international aid organization. It has been working in situations of poverty and exclusion, conflict and disaster for 40 years. Working alongside people with disabilities and other groups experiencing extreme vulnerability, our action and testimony are focused on responding to their essential needs, improving their living conditions and promoting respect for their dignity and basic rights. Since it was founded in 1982, Humanity & Inclusion (formerly Handicap International) has set up development programs in more than 60 countries and intervenes in numerous emergency situations. There are eight national associations within the network (Germany, Belgium, Canada, United States, France, Luxembourg, UK and Switzerland), working tirelessly to mobilize resources, co-manage projects and increase the impact of the organization’s principles and actions. Humanity & Inclusion is one of six founding organizations of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, and winner of the 2011 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize. Humanity & Inclusion takes action and campaigns in places where “living in dignity” is no easy task.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/zelensky-visit-us-cluster-munitions-have-no-place-war

press@usaid.gov, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, President Joe Biden announced today following his meeting with President Zelenskyy that the United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), has provided more than $374 million in additional humanitarian assistance in response to ongoing needs caused by Putin’s war against Ukraine. This additional life-saving assistance comes at a crucial moment as continued Russian attacks on civilian housing and critical infrastructure have left many communities without access to safe shelter, food, clean water and sanitation, and other basic services during the harsh winter., With this additional funding, USAID partners the UN Children’s Fund, the UN World Food Program, the UN World Health Organization, and a non-governmental organization will provide multi-sector humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of millions of people in the worst-affected areas of the country, including people displaced by fighting. The funding will help partners provide urgently needed food and cash assistance to more than 1.5 million people, as well as health care, humanitarian protection, safe drinking water and sanitation services, trauma support, and winterization relief items and shelter repairs to support more than 2.5 million people., The United States remains the largest donor to the humanitarian response for Ukraine. Since the start of Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, the U.S. government has provided more than $1.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to support people in Ukraine and those fleeing to neighboring countries, including more than $1.4 billion in USAID humanitarian assistance., Since Russia’s attack on February 24, USAID has been coordinating with humanitarian partners in the country and region to provide Ukrainians with life-saving humanitarian assistance while ramping up critical development assistance to respond to cyber-attacks and threats to the energy sector, countering disinformation, supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector, documenting human rights violations, meeting essential health needs, and bolstering the continued functioning of local, regional, and national government entities.

Following the immediate response to react to the needs generated by mass displacement and the immediate impact of the conflict, operations continue to scale up, while adapting to the changing context and new scenarios, such as the energy crisis, inflation, new influx of displaced people from Ukraine, as well as gearing up for sustained, targeted and impactful long-term programs. Winterization efforts are being scaled up to support affected populations and host families, prioritizing those with extreme vulnerabilities, with cash and voucher assistance as principal modality of assistance, as well as essential household items distribution and reinforcing safe spaces provision in close coordination with national authorities., Sectoral strategies are now available for eight of the sectors/enablers in the response. The comprehensive technical documents can be found in the documents section of the GO page for the emergency (under Resource Mobilization and Communications Products). Three-page promotional documents can be found in the IFRC.org page for the operation."", The IFRC Network’s response continues to expand geographically and in programmatic scope, with the overall focus of the network primarily revolving around providing scalable and adaptable cash assistance as well as cash preparedness; health programming with special emphasis on mental health and psychosocial support; assistance to cover needs in shelter with current focus on winterization preparedness and host family support; addressing humanitarian concerns in protection and education., While continuing to respond with and increased impact, the operation has been fostering innovative approaches, especially in the field of multi-purpose cash distributions. With support from the IFRC, digitalized, data and user-centred, quickly scalable solutions were piloted in multiple countries, leading to exponential growth in our capacities to reach people in need. Building digital solutions also enhanced our abilities to continuously monitor, respond and be accountable toward feedback from the communities we serve., Scaling up humanitarian operations and preparing for sustained programming is paired with strengthening the capacities of responding National Societies in their human resources and management capacities, logistics, digitalization and information management, as well as strengthening local branches embedded in communities. To ensure a harmonized approach focusing on needs, maximizing impact and complementarity with other humanitarian actors, the IFRC Secretariat coordinated the mobilization of an unprecedented scale of personnel from across the globe, guided operations and strategies, and established mechanisms for coordinating support from its Membership across all levels. A Federation-wide approach ensures that all responding and supporting National Societies are represented and integrated.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-and-impacted-countries-crisis-emergency-appeal-ndeg-mgr65002-operation-update-report-ndeg-4

Risks and impacts from attacks on energy infrastructure in Ukraine - Environment and Conflict Alert Ukraine,Analysis,PAX,"Climate Change and Environment
Health",22 Dec 2022,"Russia bombing Ukraine into a cold and dark Christmas, As many people in the world are celebrating Christmas season, the traditional festival of lights, Ukraine is faced with a brutal winter. The destructive Russian invasion and subsequent air campaign with drones and cruise missiles targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure is plunging the country into darkness, with widespread humanitarian and environmental consequences. A new PAX Environment and Conflict Alert (ECA) on Ukraine has documented how continues bombing of critical infrastructure has damaged over 213 amount of powerplants and more than 63 substations, resulting in widespread health and environmental risks. Millions of Ukrainians are relying on electricity for heating, cooking and transportation, which is particularly needed in the harsh cold winter months., The deliberate strikes against these facilities and subsequent lack of access to energy is causing wide-ranging humanitarian impacts, and massive displacement of civilians. Absence of heating, access to water and functioning sewage systems can cause serious public health risks. Lack of electricity also impacts healthcare, education and livelihoods of Ukrainian civilians. Understandable, civilians will resort to alternative forms of fuels, including unstainable coping strategies by using more indoor heating from fuel or wood burners, that is exposing them to more indoor air pollution, while on the long-term contributing to deforestation of protected areas., Apart from the humanitarian impacts, there are also serious environmental risks from targeting energy infrastructure, ranging from a severe risk to a nuclear melt-down at the Zaphorizhnya nuclear power plant, as its power supplies were damaged, to release of hazardous substances at bombed facilities, localized water, soil and air pollution and flooding of coal mines as water pumping is halted., In collaboration with the Centre of Information Resilience, PAX is using open-source investigation methods, combined with a range of satellites for earth observations to document the environmental dimensions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. An first ECA on Ukraine was released in March 2022 outlining the broader environmental impacts in the first months of the Russian invasion. Since then, PAX, with funding from UN Environment Program (UNEP) and Stichting Samenwerkende Hulp Organisaties (SHO) / Giro 55 is working to engage with humanitarian and environmental organisations to highlight these dimensions and engage in relevant multilateral forums to ensure rapid response and inclusion of environmental impacts in assessment and reconstruction programs., Previous Environment and Conflict Alerts had a focus on conflict linked oil spills and wildfires in Syria, Iraq and environmental impacts of the Israeli campaign in Gaza., Read the full report.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/risks-and-impacts-attacks-energy-infrastructure-ukraine-environment-and-conflict-alert-ukraine

Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Dec 2022,"Context & Methodology, Since the start of the escalation of hostilities in February 2022, an estimated 5,914,000 persons remain internally displaced in Ukraine, and an additional 5,236,000 are estimated to have been displaced and returned to their place of habitual residence, as of 5 December 2022. Following an increase in hostilities since the escalation of hostilities in February 2022, waves of attacks on critical infrastructure across the country caused disruptions to power and water supplies. Concerns for the winter season has presented additional challenges for households (HHs) that are aiming to meet their basic needs, thereby further impacting displacement. To inform the humanitarian response to the ongoing displacement in Ukraine, REACH conducted Round 5 of the Arrival and Transit Monitoring (ATM) household survey between 20 October and 3 November 2022. REACH enumerators interviewed households that have recently arrived and transited through eight settlements across Ukraine: Lviv, Kyiv, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv. Interviews with internally displaced people (IDPs) were conducted at transit centres, collective sites, administrative and humanitarian centres. In total, 1,667 household interviews were completed. In Kryvyi Rih, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, REACH also conducted six key informant (KI) interviews with representatives of local authorities, transit centres and humanitarian aid distribution centres to triangulate displacement trends derived from the household level. Due to the purposive sample, findings are not generalisable with a known level of precision and should be considered as indicative only.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-arrival-and-transit-monitoring-december-2022

EBRD supports alternative grain export routes in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,EBRD,Agriculture,19 Dec 2022,"By Vanora Bennett, EBRD lends €10 million to Ukraine grain producer to increase resilience in wartime Loan will support Grain Alliance Group’s grain exports from Ukraine via Slovak hub Company’s hub storage and transshipment capacity to be expanded The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is lending €10 million to the Ukrainian grain producer Grain Alliance Group to improve and expand its overland export capacity, sidestepping Russian disruption of exports via the Ukrainian ports which traditionally moved over 90 per cent of the country’s grain and oilseeds to foreign markets., Ukraine is a leading food producer and interruptions in supply are detrimental both to Ukrainian agribusiness and for world food security., Russia’s war on Ukraine, which began in February, has forced producers to seek road and rail routes to international markets rather than via ports, which have been blocked. Congestion on existing overland routes has limited exports, with investment needed to address border crossing bottlenecks., The Grain Alliance Group’s response has been to develop the resilience of its own business and the agribusiness sector as a whole by developing alternative logistics routes from Ukraine. In the spring of 2022, the group acquired a grain logistics hub just over Ukraine’s border with Slovakia, in the city of Cierna nad Tisou., The EBRD’s loan will finance an expansion of the Slovak hub to provide transshipment capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year. It will support the Grain Alliance Group to increase storage capacity, upgrade and automate infrastructure, and buy grain hoppers, locomotives and trucks for secure transport of grains from its Ukrainian elevators to the Slovak hub and onwards to final customers., This investment will be also crucial for continued revenue generation, preserving more than 1,000 jobs and securing access to livelihoods for people affected by Russia’s war on Ukraine., The Grain Alliance Group is a Swedish-owned mid-sized agri-holding in Ukraine., The loan is in line with the Solidarity Lanes package, a programme established by the European Commission and EU-bordering countries to safeguard global food security and aid Ukraine’s economy, in which the EBRD is investing €300 million., The five-year loan will be supported by the donor-funded EBRD Crisis Response Special Fund via partial guarantee within the EBRD’s resilience package in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. It is also supported by the EBRD’s Shareholder Special Fund (SSF) and Japan-EBRD Cooperation Fund., The EBRD is Ukraine’s biggest institutional investor. Since February, the Bank has committed more than €1 billion, and aims to triple that figure by the end of 2023. The EBRD’s primary focus is to support the ‘real’ economy – maintaining energy and food security, restoring rail infrastructure, and supporting trade and the private sector. The EBRD was swift to condemn the Russian invasion and has closed its offices in Russia and Belarus.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ebrd-supports-alternative-grain-export-routes-ukraine-enuk

Ukraine: Devastating power cuts undermining civilian life as Christmas approaches,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,21 Dec 2022,"The Russian armed forces’ continued attacks against Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure, are a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and are endangering the lives of civilians with freezing temperatures setting in, Amnesty International said today, as it calls for Russia to end its unlawful targeted assaults on civilian infrastructure., “As many countries across the world enter the festive period, their streets covered in Christmas lights, the world must remember Ukraine, which continues to be mercilessly plunged into darkness by Russia’s sustained, deliberate and unlawful attacks on its energy infrastructure,” said Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia., “Ukrainian civilians are not only having to endure the tragic loss of life inflicted by Russia’s war of aggression, but they are also suffering from the consequences of Russia’s criminal tactics, which are specifically designed to increase human suffering.”, Russia’s attacks against Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure, which have been ongoing for months, are preventing Ukrainian civilians from accessing education, healthcare, and food while also forcing people to endure freezing conditions in their own homes., Amnesty International spoke to people across Ukraine, who detailed the impact of Russia’s attacks on their daily lives., Power outages exacerbating healthcare crisis, Olena* told Amnesty International: “We have constant air raids. Right now there is one going on. When there is an air raid, no institutions that provide healthcare services such as clinics, private hospitals, other institutions, shops, public transport — can work.”, On the day of one Russian air raid, Olena had an appointment with her son for a general check-up and vaccinations, but the clinic called her, telling her not to come. It took over a day to reach her appointment, which also caused further backlogs and delays for others waiting for medical care., Alongside limiting access to routine healthcare checks, surgical procedures are being performed in life-threatening conditions. Kateryna* told Amnesty International she feared power outages would affect her surgery appointment: “I went for a scheduled surgery and they had to use a laser machine. The doctor said they would try and do it quickly. I was nervous then.”, Disrupted schooling undermining children’s education, Missing just one day of school can have a lasting impact on a child’s academic progress. Ongoing power cuts in Ukraine mean many children cannot attend school, whether in-person or online. Those who can make it to school face what can be life-threatening journeys in total darkness,, “Because traffic and streetlights do not work during blackouts, it can be chaos, with everyone driving in different directions. When you go to class with your child and come back when it’s dark, you have to worry, because you can walk right through the crossing. The death rate of pedestrians on the roads has increased,” Kateryna said., “Education is the foundation of a functioning society, yet in Ukraine, Russia is deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, including schools. Children cannot even study remotely due to a lack of electricity and heating. Russia is undermining the country’s present — and its future,” said Denis Krivosheev., Health and wellbeing at risk, Children are not only suffering from a loss of education due to Russian aggression, they are also enduring freezing temperatures amid food shortages, as the blackouts cause food to perish., “There are few options for cooking. Feeding a child sausages every day is a bad situation but you can’t cook normal food as it takes an hour and a half to cook anything, so I steam couscous and sausages,” says Olena., “It’s all very stressful. Charging everything, finding time to make food. When the lights are on you have to do everything at once, you don’t relax, you really never relax. And because of that, you are constantly in tension, it has a bad effect.”, Additional pressure on marginalized groups, People with disabilities, older people and those on lower incomes are facing additional pressures due to the power cuts., People with limited mobility are struggling to leave their apartment blocks while some residents have set up emergency packs in elevators which include chairs, water and food, in case someone is trapped during a black out., The impact on mental health, as well as physical health, can also be devastating. Tetyana* told Amnesty International: “I know people who do not go outside because they cannot climb the stairs without an elevator.”, Many on lower incomes are struggling to cover the cost of heating their individual homes amid the power cuts with the cost of generators, gas tanks and gas heaters causing added financial pressures., Background, Despite attempts to repair damaged civilian infrastructure, the Ukrainian authorities have been forced to introduce planned power outages to prevent the country’s remaining energy infrastructure from being overloaded. By October 2022, at least 40% of the country’s energy facilities had been seriously damaged. In December, the Ukrainian authorities said over 50% of energy users in the country had seen their electricity supply cut off., Amnesty International is calling for an end to Russian aggression in Ukraine and for the international community to both remember and support Ukrainian civilians as winter sets in., *Name changed to protect identity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-devastating-power-cuts-undermining-civilian-life-christmas-approaches
Convention to Safeguard Grain Flow and Secure Stable Peace in the Black Sea,News and Press Release,Stimson,"Food and Nutrition
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding",16 Dec 2022,"Exploring the potential of a Black Sea International Grain Export Convention, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reminded the international community of an indisputable fact: The world depends on grain and other crops grown in Ukraine and Russia, and on the ability of those nations to export them through the Black Sea. Blocking these exports leads directly to shortages that threaten millions with starvation. Negotiations to settle the Ukraine-Russia war will take place eventually. Regardless of where negotiators draw lines on the ground, they must address this humanitarian threat on the sea. One result should be a “Black Sea International Grain Export Convention.” It would enshrine food security in international law on an equal footing with political and military considerations., The current agreement between Russia and Ukraine, brokered by Türkiye, suggest something like a Convention could well be within reach. All parties involved, most obviously Russia, must have seen a net benefit in it. Russia’s brief “suspension” of its participation (29 October – 2 November) drew sweeping condemnation and highly public actions by Türkiye and the U.N. to see the suspension reversed. It also revealed the severe limitations under which Russia’s blockade operates., It is politically impossible for Russia to shoot at or sink a grain-laden merchantman in international waters on a humanitarian voyage to feed starving people in developing countries. Its veiled threats to do so are not credible. Russia’s freedom of action is bound by this enduring constraint., The situation suggests that agreement for a Convention could be quite possible. It should not be simply a component of a narrow bi-national agreement. It should be a broader, multinational treaty reflecting a global perspective. Major non-Black Sea states, including the United States would, under U.N. aegis, be signatories. It would be comparable to the Montreux Convention that has long governed passage through the Turkish Straits and helped stabilize the balance of naval forces in the Black Sea. Negotiations to end the heinous war in Ukraine would offer an opportunity to frame the Black Sea’s security architecture and address food security. A grain Convention need not await a peace treaty, however, but could be raised today either as a stand-alone agreement or as a desirable component of the peace agreement., Under a grain Convention, all Black Sea states would agree not to interfere with the seaborne export of the region’s grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers. The United States and its allies would strongly support the concept, as would the U.N. It’s hard to imagine any state that wouldn’t., Both warring parties would benefit. Russia’s blockade would be removed as a source of leverage in war settlement negotiations. The Convention would not impinge on Ukraine’s war aims in Crimea and the Sea of Azov. Russia’s own agricultural exports would be protected in the future., A grain export Convention would contribute an element of a genuinely “magnanimous” character to the war’s settlement. As Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis points out (https://hdiplo.org/to/E417), magnanimous settlements have produced enduring results — nearly a century in the case of the settlement that ended the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and nearly fifty years for the treaties that ended the Second World War. On the other hand, what might be called “punitive” settlements, like the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the “settlement” following the fall of the Soviet Union, which effectively excluded Russia and saw NATO’s expansion to that nation’s borders, had much shorter lives (on the order of twenty years)., War settlement in the 2020s must be informed by magnanimous-punitive alternatives. A grain Convention would seem to fall in the range of the doable middle. It punishes no one, rewards all parties, and requires them to do nothing except engage in peaceful commerce., When in force, the Convention would discourage military action at or from the sea. Not blockading grain-carrying ships in the Black Sea would make it difficult to selectively blockade ships carrying other kinds of cargo. Similarly, mounting amphibious operations of any scale while avoiding blockading the adversary’s grain ships would be problematic, if not impossible., A grain Convention would carry powerful incentives for self-enforcement. Nonetheless, it might break down. If Russia tried to reimpose a blockade on Ukraine, NATO could defeat the attempt through military actions solely at sea, by establishing and defending a protected corridor in territorial waters running from Odesa (at a minimum) to the Bosporus. Continuing grain flow would serve Türkiye’s interests, as well as Ukraine’s and other states.’, These conditions mean that if the war moves toward settlement and warships of non-Black Sea NATO navies reenter the Black Sea (none has been there for the last nine months), relatively few, smaller ships would be needed. Initial NATO deployments would express in the language of action confidence in the importance of the Convention. Unless unforeseen events dictate, this confidence, backed by NATO’s latent threat of enforcement, should provide ample stability and security., Putting the Convention idea forward would cost and risk nothing. It would provide political support for Ukraine and push Russia onto its back foot. It would be welcomed by the international community, especially in the developing world. A boost to the West there alone would justify the effort. But a Convention is also a serious policy initiative to help settle the war, help produce an enduring peace, and solve an ongoing humanitarian problem., At the highest levels of government, the United States should immediately propose a “Black Sea International Grain Export Convention,” putting America and its allies, including Ukraine, in a position of unassailable moral and political authority and allow the President to give concrete expression to America’s conception of a peaceful and rules-based world order. Uniquely, it would make food security the centerpiece of new international law., Bradford Dismukes, a retired naval reserve officer, is a strategist and expert on maritime security issues. Barry M. Blechman is co-founder of the Stimson Center.

Clinically speaking, art can help reduce tension and anxiety, setting a strong foundation for the process of healing or coping with lifelong disabilities. Art can also provide relief for PTSD and other issues stemming from exposure to extreme violence., UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Christophoros Politis said it is increasingly important in Ukraine to invest in rehabilitating social infrastructure to ensure the non-interrupted provision of basic services. ""The art school reopening today reconfirms the importance of investing in the psycho-social well-being of children, and more broadly of the communities, to address the diverse impacts of war,"" he said.

Education is key to a sense of normalcy as we stand with Ukraine."", For many people living in a crisis, art and music are much more than aesthetics and entertainment -- they are lifelines to healing and well-being. Clinically speaking, art can help reduce tension and anxiety, setting a strong foundation for the process of healing or coping with lifelong disabilities. Art can also provide relief for PTSD and other issues stemming from exposure to extreme violence., UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Christophoros Politis said it is increasingly important in Ukraine to invest in rehabilitating social infrastructure to ensure the non-interrupted provision of basic services. ""The art school reopening today reconfirms the importance of investing in the psycho-social well-being of children, and more broadly of the communities, to address the diverse impacts of war,"" he said. ""We need to sustain investments in resilience to ensure Ukraine's development achievements and gains remain on track."", Background: The renovation of the arts school in Poltava Oblast is supported as part of the EIB's Ukraine Early Recovery Programme. Ukraine Early Recovery Programme is a EUR 200 million multi-sectoral framework loan from the European Investment Bank to local authorities to rehabilitate social infrastructure and improve living conditions for internally displaced persons and their host communities in nine oblasts of Ukraine: the Ukrainian government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Odesa, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts. The Program is implemented by the Ministry of Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine jointly with the local self-government bodies under the technical support of the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine (UNDP).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/children-turn-towards-art-and-music-war-continues-enuk

Ukraine: Russians Pillage Kherson Cultural Institutions,Analysis,HRW,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,20 Dec 2022,"Belkis Wille
Associate Director, Crisis and Conflict Division
belkiswille, (Kyiv, December 20, 2022) –Russian military forces and civilians operating under their orders pillaged thousands of valuable artifacts and artworks from two museums, a cathedral, and a national archive in Kherson, before withdrawing after an 8-month occupation of the city, Human Rights Watch said today. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, its forces have reportedly looted at least five other cultural institutions in southern Ukraine – cases that amount to war crimes., “In the final days of occupying Kherson, Russian forces loaded paintings, gold, silver, ancient Greek artifacts, religious icons, and historical documents onto trucks bound for Russian-controlled territories,” said Belkis Wille, crisis and conflict associate director at Human Rights Watch. “This systematic looting was an organized operation to rob Ukrainians of their national heritage and amounts to a war crime for which the pillagers should be held to account.”, Russian forces occupied Kherson from March 2 to November 11. During this period, and particularly over the final three weeks, Russian soldiers and other state agents working with them pillaged the Kherson Regional Art Museum, the Kherson Regional Museum, St. Catherine’s Cathedral, and the Kherson Region National Archives., Human Rights Watch visited these four institutions in Kherson in late November 2022 and interviewed eight representatives of the institutions, witnesses to the looting, and others knowledgeable about the museums, cathedral, and archives. In the two museums, the signs of looting were clear, including empty walls and frames, broken cases and emptied shelves where art and artifacts had been stored or displayed, and packing materials. The final destination of all the looted art and artifacts remains unclear, but images posted on social media that Human Rights Watch verified indicate that at least some of the items were taken to Russian-occupied Crimea., The deputy director of the Kherson Regional Art Museum, Hanna Skrypka, said that Russian forces installed a new museum director in July and then, from October 31 to November 4, 10 apparent Russian art specialists, with the support of at least 30 other people, stole about 10,000 items from the museum’s collection of about 13,500 artworks, mostly paintings by renowned Ukrainian, Russian, and other 19th and 20th century European artists. They hauled the looted art away in two trucks, she said., Human Rights Watch visited the museum on November 20 and saw the vacant spaces that had held the paintings, dozens of empty frames, cardboard and other packing materials that Skrypka said the looters had used to haul away the art., At the Kherson Regional Museum, which specializes in local history and natural history, the museum’s director, secretary, and a security guard all said that from October 24 to 26 about 70 people, most in civilian clothes or apparently part of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), looted the museum. They left the flora and fauna collection untouched but pillaged almost everything else, including silver, Scythian gold, imperial Russian medals, ancient Greek vases, and World War II relics., On October 26, Russian forces stole the bone fragments of Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin, the imperial founder of Kherson, who oversaw the building of St. Catherine’s Cathedral in the 18 century, the cathedral’s main priest, Father Vitaliy, said. Potemkin is also known for playing a key role in the annexation of the Crimean khanate in 1783., On several occasions, and particularly just before they left the city, Russian forces looted important historical documents from the Kherson Region National Archives, the archive’s director, Iryna Lopushinska, said. This included most of the archive’s documents of historical value from the 18th and 19th centuries, valuable regional maps and urban plans, a large collection of pre-war newspapers, and almost everything related to the pre-revolutionary period., In each of the four locations, various individuals asked the looters why they were taking the objects and were told either that it was to protect them from Ukrainian shelling or looting by Ukrainian forces. Skrypka, the deputy director of the Regional Art Museum, said that when she asked the art specialists why they were taking the paintings away they told her to save the collection “from looting or destruction by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.”, Human Rights Watch verified one photograph of paintings being carried into the entry hall of the Central Taurida Museum in Simferopol, Crimea, and another of a painting entitled ‘Ivan Kushchin Tower’ painted in 1989 by the artist Georgy Petrov, lying on the floor of the museum. The painting is cataloged in an archived page from the Kherson Regional Art Museum from 2021., Another painting claimed, based on social media images, to be among those taken to the Central Taurida Museum is ‘The Storm Subsides’ by Ivan Aivazovsky completed in the 1870s. An Instagram post from the account of the Kherson Regional Art Museum shows this painting hanging in the museum in July 2020. Aivazovsky is considered one of the masters of marine art., The looting in Kherson is apparently not the first case in Ukraine during the past 10 months. On April 28, Russian forces reportedly pillaged valuable paintings, religious relics, and other items from three museums in Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine: the Mariupol Museum of Local Lore and History, the Museum of Folk Life, and the Kuindzhi Art Museum. The Mariupol city council reported that over 2,000 items were stolen from these museums and loaded onto Russian trucks., On April 30, Russian forces reportedly looted the Museum of Local History in Melitopol in the Zaporizka hzhia region, which included rare Scythian gold artifacts. On November 24, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces had looted the history museum in Nova Kakhovka in the Khersonska region., Russian forces have also damaged or destroyed dozens of cultural institutions during attacks on Ukrainian territory since the full-scale invasion began on February 24., International humanitarian law prohibits pillage, also sometimes referred to as looting, plunder, sacking, or spoliation. Pillage is the unlawful appropriation of any property during an armed conflict against the will of the rightful owner and is a war crime. International humanitarian law also prohibits, as a ‘grave breach’ of the Geneva Conventions, and a war crime under the statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the “extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.” Similarly, “destroying or seizing the enemy’s property unless such destruction or seizure is imperatively demanded by the necessities of war” is a war crime and prosecutable before the ICC., All pillage, appropriation, or seizure of property from museums and cultural institutions in Ukraine by Russia is a war crime. All individuals responsible, both civilian and military, should be held to account., “Kherson residents had already suffered months of torture and other abuses during the Russian occupation, and then watched their cultural and historical heritage get packed up and taken away,” Wille said. “The people of Ukraine are entitled to have all the stolen objects returned, and to justice for their theft.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russians-pillage-kherson-cultural-institutions
World Bank Approves Financing Package Totaling $610 Million to Address Urgent Needs in Ukraine,News and Press Release,World Bank,Health,20 Dec 2022,"Package Includes Additional Financing to Sustain Essential Services; New Project Supports Health Care Services, WASHINGTON, Dec. 20, 2022—The World Bank Group today announced a new financing package that includes projects to boost relief and recovery efforts for Ukraine amid the ongoing war. The World Bank will provide additional financing of $500 million through an IBRD loan that is supported by a guarantee from the United Kingdom for the same amount and mobilized under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance (PEACE) Project. The World Bank will also support Ukraine with a new project to restore and improve access to health care and address new and urgent needs for health services due to the war., “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to have devastating economic and humanitarian consequences, impacting the health sector, critical energy infrastructure, and transport networks,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “We welcome today’s financing support by our partners. The World Bank has mobilized $18 billion in emergency financing in support of the people of Ukraine since the beginning of the war, including commitments and pledges from donors, of which $15 billion has been disbursed.”, The additional $500 million in IBRD lending for the PEACE Project will help the Government of Ukraine with expenditures related to child and family benefits, salaries of public employees, and utility payments. Maintaining these critical public services is essential to limiting the loss of human capital and rebuilding the country and its economy after the war. To date, we estimate that 12 million people in Ukraine have benefitted from the PEACE project., The Health Enhancement and Life-saving (HEAL Ukraine) Project will improve and strengthen primary health care, address increased demand for mental health and rehabilitation services due to the war, restore and strengthen service delivery in hospitals that are facing capacity constraints, and support capacity building for key health institutions. The initial funding for the project includes a EUR 100 million IBRD loan, backed by a guarantee from the Government of Spain, and a $10 million grant from the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children, and Adolescents (GFF). Additional funds for the project are expected to grow to a total of $500 million, starting with an upcoming $10 million grant through the Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF)., As of December 6, 2022, 507 healthcare facilities, equivalent to 5.5 percent of public providers, have been destroyed or damaged. Utilization of health services also significantly decreased during the first months of the war. In March 2022, the number of childhood vaccinations fell by 40 percent compared to the previous year and has not recovered. In September 2022, almost a third of people living in Ukraine reported that they could not afford to buy necessary medicines. In addition, the war has had a direct negative impact on the population’s mental health, exacerbating pre-existing issues that disproportionately affect women, including gender-based violence. War-related injuries have led to a significant increase in the need for rehabilitation services., The new financing package adds to several previously announced packages for the PEACE project, including the $1.49 billion Investment Project Financing (IPF) in June, the $4.5 billion in grant financing approved in August, the $530 million in loan guarantees in September 2022, and another $4.5 billion in grant financing approved in November 2022.

"Winter in Ukraine: over 25% of internally displaced people interviewed lack access to sufficient heating, more than 60% houses damaged, IRC initial analysis shows",News and Press Release,IRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",20 Dec 2022,"Kyiv, Ukraine, December 20, 2022 — As the IRC continues its winter needs assessment in five oblasts, the initial results show that 25% of respondents did not have access to sufficient heating at time of interview, while 61.3% reported that their houses were in need of repair. The renewed waves of shelling last week severely impacted energy infrastructure and knocked out power in major cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, home to some of IRC’s teams, plunging vast parts of the country into darkness.**, The power, electricity, heating and water outages caused by ongoing attacks on civilian infrastructure are continuing to impact millions of people across Ukraine and severely impede humanitarian activities on the ground. With no internet or phone network, humanitarian workers are unable to communicate with local partners, suppliers and clients for long hours, which further hinders delivery of life-saving assistance., Michael Despines, IRC’s Regional Director for the Ukraine Crisis, said:, “Our teams are determined to stay and deliver, amidst blackouts and freezing winter temperatures.To date,thousands of people in Ukraine have received IRC’s emergency kits of basic essential items, including sleeping bags and warm blankets. One client told us the blankets distributed by the IRC are very useful to the families when they need to seek refuge inthe bomb shelters, ‘because it’s cold there, especially when there’s no electricity.’, “Our clients repeatedly tell us they are worried about making it through the winter months. People's capacity to cope with cold is further impaired by the destruction and failure of critical infrastructure, lack of heating and electricity, and the trauma of living under constant shelling. We are seriously concerned that these compounded factors will lead to a serious deterioration of the humanitarian situation and spark further displacement - and increase vulnerabilities of those who are forced to stay., “On top of conflict-related destruction, low temperatures can cause damage to power lines and failure of heating systems, putting the entire population at even more risk. 25% of people we have spoken to do not have access to sufficient heating. Over 60% reported their houses have been damaged, as the current weather conditions and ongoing shelling make it impossible to repair both individual homes and collective shelters for the displaced people., “Robust international support has prevented the worst case scenario from occurring in Ukraine, but that will only remain true as long as donors continue to adequately support the humanitarian response. We are in a race against the clock as the temperatures plummet across Ukraine - people are freezing and we need to do more.”, Notes to editors:, The IRC is distributing winter essentials in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, including in some of the newly accessible areas., We are currently conducting arapid multi-sector needs assessmentmonitoring the winter needs in six oblasts of operations: Dnipro, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia. To date, we have spoken to over 350 clients., Over the next few weeks, we will deliver additional winter kits to almost 22,500 people, equip 500 homes with solid fuel stoves and solid fuel, provide materials for almost 4500 homes requiring emergency repairs in Mykolaiv and beyond, supply 1,400 individuals with warm clothes and equip 4,500 people with heaters., We have already distributed - among others - over 15,000 blankets, 15,000 quilts, 15,000 sleeping bags, 10,000 thermos flasks, and 1,000 heaters in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Odesa., Our mobile clinic in Kharkiv is providing people with much needed medical help as the temperatures plummet., As of 30 November 2022, the IRC has reached over 400,000 individuals in Ukraine with humanitarian assistance. 62,022 individuals received emergency kits of basic essential items, including sleeping bags and blankets. 83,349 people have been supported with cash assistance to cover their basic needs, while 28,808 people received emergency protection services. We have supported 49 health facilities with urgently needed medical items, equipment, and pharmaceutical supplies., The IRC launched an emergency response to the war in Ukraine in February 2022, working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. In Ukraine, we are focusing our response in the conflict-affected areas in the east and southeast. We are distributing essential non-food items, providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households, improving access to health care, and providing a variety of tailor-made protection services, including safe spaces for women and children. Our emergency programmes are also active on the ground in Poland and Moldova. Responding along the entire arc of the crisis, we are running activities targeting Ukrainian refugees in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia and Bulgaria, as well as in Germany, Italy, Greece and the UK.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/winter-ukraine-over-25-internally-displaced-people-interviewed-lack-access-sufficient-heating-more-60-houses-damaged-irc-initial-analysis-shows

Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Dec 2022,"(Kyiv, 20 December 2022): The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, today announced the release of an additional US$20 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) to support more than 300 civil society organizations, community-based organizations and volunteer groups that have been working around the clock, to support millions of people impacted by the war in Ukraine., “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February. They are in the front line, taking risks to make sure people whose lives have been torn apart by months of war receive support for their daily needs: water, food, medicines, shelter when their houses have been damaged,” explained Denise Brown., The humanitarian community in Ukraine has had several meetings with these groups in different parts of the country. “The work they are doing is impressive. However, 10 months later, their resources are being exhausted, and they need support to sustain their vital assistance to the people of Ukraine,” said Denise Brown., With this new disbursement, OCHA-managed humanitarian funds will have allocated over $252 million for life-saving operations in Ukraine since the Russian Federation’s invasion started on 24 February, including $192 million from the UHF and $60 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). More than $55 million has been channelled to projects and organizations supporting hospitals, displacement centres and other critical facilities with generators and people with winter supplies as Ukraine faces a severe energy crisis in the middle of the winter. “This wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible support of our donors. We thank them on behalf of the humanitarian community and the people of Ukraine,” concluded Denise Brown., ***, Note to editors:, The OCHA-managed Ukraine Humanitarian Fund is the largest of the world’s 20 active Country-Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs), which are established when a new emergency occurs or when an existing humanitarian situation deteriorates., Between 2019 and February 2022, the UHF allocated $24 million to 26 partners implementing 64 projects in the east of Ukraine to support at least 1.25 million people in need of humanitarian assistance., Since February, and with this new announcement, the fund has allocated nearly $192 million to support 109 projects of 56 partners, including 30 international NGOs, 18 national NGOs and 8 UN agencies. Some $44 million of the total allocations were channelled directly to national organizations., Also, since February, the UHF has expanded its partners’ base, increasing the number of eligible partners from 51 pre-war to 93 today, including 35 national NGOs., For further information, please contact OCHA Ukraine: Saviano Abreu, +380 50 422 3943, deabreuisidoro@un.org Nataliia Pushkaruk, +380 50 442 8374, nataliia.pushkaruk@un.org OCHA press releases are available at www.unocha.org or www.reliefweb.int.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-coordinator-allocates-20-million-support-local-organizations-and-volunteer-groups-forefront-humanitarian-response-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Dec 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, ANALYSIS, Humanitarian situation overview, Regular waves of attacks on energy infrastructure continue to cause destruction and leave millions of people across Ukraine with no electricity, disrupting water supply and heating systems, while temperatures have fallen below zero in most parts of the country. The attacks have also damaged other civilian infrastructure, including homes, as well as killed and injured civilians across Ukraine over the past couple of weeks., The most recent attack in the early hours of 19 December, reportedly hit infrastructure in at least 6 of Ukrainian’s 24 oblasts – mainly in the centre and south of the country, injuring at least two civilians, and damaging several buildings in Kyivska oblast, according to the authorities. The authorities have implemented emergency power outages in 10 oblasts and in Kyiv. Earlier on 16 December, as another series of attacks swept over Ukraine, a baby and the mother were killed as a building was hit in Krivyi Rih, central Dnipropetrovska oblast. The strikes also damaged homes and other civilian infrastructure in several parts of the country, including during three reported explosions in Kyiv. Large-scale disruptions of water, power, heating, railway connections and mobile communications were reported all over the country. On 5 December, attacks resulted in power outages in 40 per cent of the capital Kyiv and disconnected the Internet due to the lack of power. Water in Odesa was cut as the main water pipe station was without power; damages also led to a full blackout across the city. Other parts of the country were also affected., Hostilities and heavy fighting in the country’s east and south continued to impact civilians and humanitarian workers in Khersonska oblast and on both sides of the front line in Donetska oblast. In Kherson, attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, and on 15 December, an aid distribution centre was hit, killing at least two people, including a humanitarian worker in the line of duty. Across the oblast, damages to schools, sports and community centres, medical facilities, residential buildings and energy systems have been reported. Attacks on humanitarian aid distribution points have also been reported in all Khersonska oblast rayons, according to humanitarian security reports. While the authorities have restored parts of the energy infrastructure in the city, continued attacks slow down the process and leave thousands without power, heating and water. The humanitarian situation for almost 183,000 people in Kherson and other parts recently retaken by Ukraine remains critical. Many houses require urgent repairs, which is especially dangerous as winter temperatures are keeping low. People need food, warm clothes, basic household and personal items, beds, mattresses and heating solutions. Access to safe water and hygiene is limited, which leads to an elevated risk of associated diseases., In Donetsk, in the areas under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation, the offices of two humanitarian NGOs were damaged during attacks on 5 and 6 December. The attacks not only caused damages to the premises, normally used for aid distribution but also vehicles belonging to the organizations. There were no casualties inside the buildings, civilians nearby were reportedly injured. Attacks are also regularly reported in Luhanska oblast, signifying the intensification of hostilities along the front line, as well as in Kharkivska and Zaporizka oblasts, with civilian casualties and damaged infrastructure reported., Mines and other explosive ordnance risks, Incidents involving mine accidents are increasingly being reported across the areas of Kharkivska, Khersonska and Mykolaivska oblasts. At least 15 incidents were reported in Khersonska and Mykolaivska oblasts since the middle of November, killing 8 people and injuring another 16. Almost all of the areas retaken by Ukraine in Khersonska oblast are considered at extremely high risk of contamination by explosives, according to oblast authorities. De-mining is crucial to allow agricultural activities to resume., Displacement, According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there are 5.9 Ukrainians internally displaced in Ukraine as of 5 December, a reduction from 6.5 million recorded at the end of October. Yet, in the past month some 680,000 people have been forced from their homes, 40 per cent of them fleeing from the east and 25 per cent from the south of the country. According to the IOM’s latest estimates, there is no evidence of a new massive wave of displacement due to low temperatures and energy crisis across most-affected oblasts as had been projected. Only 7 per cent of the people questioned during the latest General Population Survey are considering moving from their place of residence, while over 785,000 of those displaced are planning to remain and assimilate into their new communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-19-dec-2022-enruuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items",20 Dec 2022,"Starting on 24 February 2022, a large-scale armed conflict in Ukraine triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across the country, characterised, among other elements, by the displacement of a significant proportion of the Ukrainian population., As early as April 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began observing significant return movements. Conditions of return vary widely, as returnees arrive back to areas not directly affected by the war, but which have experienced a significant influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as to conflict-affected and recently de-occupied areas which have sustained severe damage. Due to the volatility of the current situation, it is impossible to determine what proportion of the returns observed at present are permanent or temporary. Existing data shows, however, that the returnee population in Ukraine is characterized by a unique set of needs and vulnerabilities which set it apart from those who had never been displaced and from the population of IDPs., To support partners in providing targeted, evidence-based assistance to those returning to their areas of habitual residence following a period of forced displacement, IOM presents the Ukraine Returns Report. This publication will strive to analyze IOM’s latest data on the situation and needs of the returnee population and on the conditions of return, collected through the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessments conducted in the country., This December 2022 edition of the Ukraine Returns Report presents a detailed analysis of data collected through the eleventh round of IOM’s General Population Survey (GPS), conducted 25 November and 5 December 2022 among the adult population in Ukraine. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula and the non-government-controlled-areas of Ukraine (NGCA). The general population survey was conducted using a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,002 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-returns-report-3-25-november-5-december-2022-enuk

Trafficking in Persons [EN/UK],News and Press Release,USAID,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",16 Dec 2022,"THE CHALLENGE, Ukraine has been a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking since the early 1990s. Men, women, and children are trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and begging and sexual and other forms of exploitation. The main countries of destination for trafficked Ukrainians have been the Russian Federation, Poland, and Turkey, as well as internal human trafficking within Ukraine. The problem has been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022., Even before Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was already facing an increase in the scale of human trafficking caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing displacement from conflict-affected eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. The population is extremely vulnerable, an issue severely exacerbated by Russia’s invasion and the need for millions of people to leave their homes for safety in Ukraine and abroad. Fraudulent labor intermediaries/recruiters may take advantage of the war to exploit at-risk people., Prior to Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine[1] estimated that more than 300,000 Ukrainians had suffered from human trafficking since 1991. An estimated 46,000 Ukrainians were trafficked during 2019-2021; 29,000 abroad and 17,000 in Ukraine., OUR PROGRAMMING To fight this form of modern-day slavery, USAID is working in partnership with the IOM, the Government of Ukraine, and local civil society organizations (CSOs) to counter trafficking in persons. USAID’s Countering Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) Activity, implemented by the IOM, works with key stakeholders to increase their capacity to identify, assist, advocate for, and raise awareness about victims of trafficking (VOTs)., Advocacy: USAID, IOM, and our civil society partners are working closely with the Ministry of Social Policy and National Social Service of Ukraine to provide expert analysis and input into Ukraine’s Law on Counter-Trafficking in Persons, the National CTIP Referral Mechanism, and the draft State CTIP Program for 2021-2025. USAID’s partners are actively engaged in advocacy to ensure that policies, regulations, and legislation adhere to the CTIP principles of prevention, protection, and partnership., Awareness Raising: USAID’s partners raise awareness about the risks of trafficking through creative and innovative campaigns at the grassroots and national levels, using peer-to-peer approaches, art, and media. In recent years, USAID-supported outreach efforts have reached an annual audience of more than 15 million Ukrainians. In 2021, the EVEN YOU large-scale national information campaign used metro station billboards to reach an additional 80,000 people with trafficking prevention messages., Prevention: Responding to the prevalence of young adult victims, USAID’s trafficking prevention efforts focus on outreach to younger audiences. USAID continues supporting targeted prevention projects among vulnerable Ukrainians, reaching more than 34,000 people in 17 oblasts with information about safe migration and employment., USAID continues to support a toll-free National Counter-Trafficking and Migrant Advice Hotline 527, which provides advice and referrals to more than 22,000 callers annually. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the hotline played a critical role providing thousands of Ukrainians each week with information about safe migration., Capacity Building: USAID works in 12 regions of Ukraine to build local capacity to implement Ukraine’s National Referral Mechanism. This assistance has helped more than 6,000 representatives of local governments, CSOs, and other stakeholders to learn to identify, refer, and assist VOTs. USAID also supports the 31-member strong Ukrainian NGO Coalition against Human Trafficking to empower it to advocate for improved prevention, prosecution, and protection of VOTs., Reintegration: Since 2004, USAID has assisted more than 6,000 VOTs to reintegrate into their communities and economies. In 2021, USAID directly supported 658 VOTs (of them 203 women and 455 men) with psychological and legal assistance, family support, education, vocational training, and income-generating equipment. Since 2006, almost 600 VOTs have taken advantage of self-employment and micro-enterprise opportunities offered by the CTIP activity. USAID also supports the operation of the Medical Rehabilitation Centre for trafficking survivors, which is a unique facility in Ukraine providing free-of-charge medical and psychological consultations to VOTs and addressing their complex health issues in a safe and confidential manner., Partnerships: New public-private partnerships fostered by IOM strengthened CTIP efforts in the country, empowering former VOTs to start their own businesses and access networking opportunities. USAID bolsters pilot activities focusing on community development and support to returning migrants as a means of targeted prevention at the community level. The main objective of this activity is to support newly amalgamated communities (NACs) formed in the framework of Ukraine’s robust decentralization reforms through hands-on, community-driven development projects aimed at socio-economic revitalization. A total of six NACs received support to build or renovate socially oriented infrastructure such as kindergarten, youth development centers, and community hubs that provide local residents with high-quality services., [1] https://ukraine.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1861/files/documents/omnibus_survey_results_eng.pdf",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/trafficking-persons-enuk

Assistant Researcher, On November 22, missiles hit the maternity ward of the Vilniansk district’s central hospital, in the Zaporizka region of southern Ukraine., Along with nurses, administrative assistants, and other personnel, two doctors were on duty that night: 37-year-old emergency room resident Andriy Kozin and an intensive care unit doctor. Both were injured., Andriy was in the maternity ward staff room when he heard the first missile hit at around 2 a.m. “The explosion was so loud that it shook the windows,” he told me., Andriy was about to call and check on his family when a second missile hit. When the blast wave hit him, he immediately felt intense heat all over his body., “I was buried under rubble. My arms, legs, my head were all pressed down, so I couldn’t move. The dust around my body was still hot, so I could feel my burns even more. If one can imagine hell, this was what it would feel like,” he said., It took emergency workers almost two hours to extract Andriy from the ruins of what had been a two-story wing of the hospital buildings. He shouted as loud as he could to let rescuers know where he was., Ukrainian authorities stated that Russian forces launched an S-300 type surface-to-air missile during this attack. While under the rubble, Andriy could smell the odor of fuel., More than 50 patients were also in the hospital when the missiles struck. Mariia Kamianetska and her 2-day-old son, Serhii, were patients in the maternity ward. Media reported that rescue workers evacuated Mariia through the window but that the attack killed Serhii, making him one of the youngest casualties of this war., Today, Andriy is still in the hospital. He sustained burns to 37 percent of his body, among other injuries. He said he wakes up every night at 2 a.m. and relives the attack., In nearly 10 months of war, attacks have hit many other hospitals in Ukraine, including a maternity hospital in Mariupol in March. Since February 24, the World Health Organization reported more than 715 attacks on health care, killing and injuring more than 229 people., Despite the risks of war, healthcare workers like Andriy are there for their patients. Attacks on healthcare institutions jeopardize vital, timely and quality services, endangering patients’ lives and health. All attacks on healthcare personnel, patients, and healthcare facilities should stop and their protected status should be respected.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/doctor-describes-toll-attack-hospital-southern-ukraine
UNICEF supports Ukraine Ministry of Social Policy and Ukrainian Railways holiday season campaign for war-affected children and vulnerable families,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Coordination

Health",19 Dec 2022,"KYIV, 19 December 2022 – As families in Ukraine mark St. Nicholas Day, UNICEF is stepping up support through new initiatives and activities, ensuring vulnerable children and families across the country receive financial, educational, and moral support over the holiday period., UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Social Policy to provide a total of US$102 million of additional cash assistance to 123,000 vulnerable families in Ukraine, including families with four or more children and families that have a child with a disability, benefitting nearly half a million people, including children., UNICEF is also supporting a Ukraine Ministry of Social Policy and Ukrzaliznytsia – the Ukrainian Railway - initiative this holiday season to ensure educational entertainment gifts reach war-affected children in eastern Ukraine, particularly children in newly accessible areas such as Kharkiv and Kherson. UNICEF has contributed some 30,000 UNICEF schoolbags and stationery kits towards this initiative, supporting the education and mental health of children., “The holiday season has brought little cheer for families in Ukraine, but we hope that, by providing some of the most vulnerable families with critical cash assistance and education supplies, we can bring a little hope to parents and children in the midst of an especially difficult winter,” said UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin., As winter deepens and attacks on energy infrastructure leave electricity and heating in short supply, most families are struggling to stay warm. To provide families with access to warm spaces across Ukraine, UNICEF runs over 140 ‘Spilno’ – Ukrainian for ‘Together’ - spots that provide a warm child-friendly space for children to play, receive psychosocial support, and connect with peers, while also providing medical checks for children and referrals for other social services., “At a time when families look back at the experiences of the year past and ahead to the new year, providing this small sense of normalcy and hope for the future, amid the most uncertain times, is critical,” said Sahin. “As we have done throughout 2022, UNICEF will do everything we can to support Ukraine’s children and families as we move into a new year.”, UNICEF launched the humanitarian cash transfer programme on 31 March 2022 with the Ministry of Social Policy to help address the needs of families with children in Ukraine, who are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the war. As of 30 November 2022, a total of 196,435 families in Ukraine have received a total of US$191 million of cash assistance., UNICEF continues to work with the Ministry of Social Policy to ensure the efficient and timely distribution of cash assistance to the most vulnerable families in Ukraine. UNICEF’s cash assistance programme is funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund, the European Union, the Governments of Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and UNICEF’s flexible humanitarian resources., #####, Media contacts, Damian Rance

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Dec 2022,"Executive Summary, Conflict, In November, Ukrainian forces continued recapturing areas of southern and eastern oblasts, notably Kherson, city from which the Russian forces retreated on November 11. This has led to the liberation of approximately 4,300 square kilometres of territory since September 2022. Shelling and missile strikes continue to cause the majority of casualties with 688 civilian casualties registered by OHCHR in November, which is less than in October (over 1,000). Heavy shelling along with missile and drone strikes was experienced throughout November, targeting energy infrastructure and civilian facilities, and leading to widespread disruption of energy supply with millions of citizens being deprived from electricity and water at times during the month., Displacement, Displacement figures have continued to mostly follow a downward trend since August with a decrease of 626,000 IDPs in October compared to the previous month. Among the almost six million IDPs, 680,000 individuals have been newly displaced within the last 30 days. The number of returnees has also reduced by 700,000 compared to last month. Across Ukraine, est. 785,000 IDPs currently plan to integrate in their current location.
Conflict and safety remain the biggest push/pull factor, although family reunification, access to employment and services and accommodation are also commonly cited. The majority of IDPs continue to originate from, and reside in, the eastern part of Ukraine. The number of refugees from Ukraine is static in Europe with over 7.8 million individuals having fled the country., Humanitarian Access, Insecurity in eastern and southern Ukraine continues to hamper humanitarian access in some conflict-affected areas. It is notably the case of Zaporizhzhia and Vovchansk which have been hard to impossible to reach in November. Physical constraints such as damage to roads and contamination with Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) further degrades the ability of partners to assist people in need, this is particularly the case in Kharkiv. In addition, persons with disabilities and older people seem to face particular challenges when trying to access assistance, due to lack of mobility and a lack of sufficient aid. However, on a positive note, newly accessible areas have been able to receive assistance, notably cash and winter items., Humanitarian Conditions, Livelihoods: Lack of employment and low incomes are still driving humanitarian need within Ukraine as households struggle to manage. High inflation, displacement, and additional costs due to the conflict are putting stress on household incomes. The October IOM GPS (round 10) found that 29% of non-displaced households and 24% of the displaced households report incomes of UAH 5,000 or less, this is around UAH 1700 less than the national minimum wage per month. Older persons reliant on state benefits, particularly older women (who may have made less contributions) are of particular concern as the statutory minimum payment level is unlikely to cover even basic needs. Some households report cutting back on food expenditure or borrowing money to buy basic necessities., Food Security: According to the latest WFP online dashboard, 10.4 million people are living with insufficient food consumption in Ukraine (an increase of 1.73 million people since last month). This ties in with data from the IOM GPS (round 10) found that 29% of assessed IDP households, 21% of non-IDP households and 18% of returnee households reported a need for food assistance. The situation seems particularly acute in newly accessible areas with recent survey’s from Khersonska oblast indicating that many families have had limited access to food for several weeks, (echoing findings from NAAs in Kharkivska). Older people are particularly at risk, especially with the onset of winter and continued high inflation driving up costs whilst they have limited low income. Many older persons report relying on negative coping mechanisms such reducing the quality of food consumed or cutting back on their overall food intake., Health: Health facilities continue to be damaged by the conflict, reducing the quality of available care, with the worst affected oblasts being in the east and south. Overall, 715 attacks were verified by WHO on health care in Ukraine in 2022, representing more than 70% of all attacks on health-care infrastructure reported worldwide this year. With the start of the winter, the rise of contagious diseases and the worsening of chronic illnesses threaten the health of the population, especially for those living conflictaffected areas and attacks on energy infrastructure may drive up the use of solid fuel increasing the risk of respiratory diseases. Lack of medicines and access to health services continue to be of concern with the situation in newly accessible areas such as Kherson oblast particularly difficult. Older people are continuously flagged as more at risk in terms of health issues, being more prone to chronic illnesses and facing reduced mobility and thus more difficult access to healthcare., Protection: In OHCHR’s most recent sobering report, HRMMU reported documenting 86 cases of Conflict Related Sexual Violence (CRSV) against women, men, and girls, (since 24 February 2022). Cases included rape, gang rape, forced nudity and forced public stripping, sexual torture, and sexual abuse. OHCHR also stated that human rights violations and war crimes remain among the main tolls of the war with widespread concern over forced deportations. Protection monitoring has identified the most frequently reported protection risks as exposure to shelling and armed violence, mine contamination, family separation, restrictions on freedom of movement, lack of identity documents and lack of access to education. However, protection services have been disrupted since the beginning of the conflict, resulting in some civilians not being able to access adequate protection responses., Shelter: Damage to residential property continued during the month of November with widespread destruction also reported throughout newly accessible areas of Khersonska oblast. The October IOM GPS (round 10) found that close to half (45%) of IDP respondents reported their habitual residence was damaged in the conflict, and out of these almost all (94%) cited lack of financial resources as a major reason for not going ahead with repairs. Attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in the last month continues to disrupt lives in Ukraine and put many at risk. With 64% of respondents to a recent survey of older people and persons with disabilities reporting that their pensions/social benefits are inadequate to meet their basic needs, the concern is many older persons will not be able to properly heat their homes or repair any damage. The need for heating appliances and solid fuels remains prominent and extremely crucial throughout Ukraine as energy facilities sustain significant damage, forcing households to rely on alterative heating systems., WASH: Continuing missile strikes against power infrastructure combined with widespread destruction in settlements close to the frontline (Including newly accessible areas) is resulting in millions of people losing access to water. In some newly accessible areas, there are reports of households using wells and, in some cases, collecting water from puddles. There continues to be a widespread need amongst IDP populations for hygiene items and across all population groups for menstrual hygiene products.
Finally at collective sites there are still some problems such as a lack of sufficient bathing facilities and gender segregated facilities., Education: Destruction of education infrastructure continues with 2790 education institutions have suffered bombing and shelling with 337 of them having been completely destroyed since the beginning of the Russian incursion. However, the recent missile attacks are taking a significant toll on education provision. Where students are reliant on online learning (43% of schools are running exclusively distance education programmes) the resultant blackouts and loss of internet services are preventing many from studying. Data from an assessment of tertiary institutions also highlights the impact on budgets with many institutions requiring funds to repair damage as well as having to host IDPs or devote facilities for other humanitarian purposes. In addition, some colleges and universities lack the equipment and technical capacity to provide online education to all, with students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) students particularly affected.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-19-dec-2022

The true figure is likely to be much higher., The war in Ukraine has triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. As a result, millions of children from Ukraine will be spending this Christmas far from home, familiarity and loved ones., Almost 8 million people from Ukraine have fled to European countries, an estimated 40% of whom are children. For those who have stayed in the country, an estimated 6.5 million people have fled their homes due to the conflict and are now internally displaced. Many now face a winter of hardship and suffering, enduring freezing temperatures, blackouts and lack of shelter., Krhystyna*, 8, from Bucha in Kyiv, spent 5-6 hours at a time in a freezing basement taking shelter with her family during the height of the conflict whilst missiles and bombs rained down on their community. Her mother Oksana* says her daughter's hair has started to turn grey from the stress of what she endured, and cries when she braids it., ""Look at my elder daughter, she is only 8, and she' has grey hair. I do not tell her, but when I braid her hair, I burst into tears, because she is a little child, and they saw such things,"" said Oksana.""It was very scary sitting in the basement, knowing that if God forbid the house was hit, you would be buried. You're not worried about yourself at that point, you're scared for your children."", Kryshtyna knows this Christmas will be very different from previous years as they try to recover from the trauma of what happened in their community., *""When Santa arrives, we're already asleep and New Year begins at 12 o'clock. We wake up in the morning and go to open the presents. Last New Year we woke up in the night and went to open the presents anyway,"" said *Kryshtyna., The photo series captures the heartbreak of leaving family and friends behind in Ukraine and the challenge of starting life in a new country, but also the hope, support and generosity of the public in refugee hosting countries., Karina*, 12, and her family have been driven from their homes twice during the conflict, fleeing to escape the fighting in Donetsk in 2014 and this year when missiles struck close to their home in Odessa. They found sanctuary in northern Romania, where they receive counselling and other support from Save the Children’s support centre for refugees from Ukraine., “I have met all my friends there, they organise trips, they give away coupons, they help with food, water, clothes. They really want to help very much, and they really help,” said Karina. “On some of their (counselling) classes I was crying, they could really get into your soul...there's support and compassion.”, When asked about Christmas she says: “There's going to be something lacking. you know, the atmosphere of Ukrainian Christmas.”, Nine-year-old Masha* fled with her family from Kyiv in June when the city was attacked and now lives in a seaside town in UK. She left her father in Kyiv and has not seen him for over six months. They say this is the biggest challenge facing the family, that they are apart., ""I would like my dad to come here, or at least to talk to him over the phone,"" said Masha. ""He said everything I draw may come true. So, I drew for us to be together, for us to be at the seaside next summer... And when I was drawing him, I felt happy."", When asked what she wants for Christmas, Masha said ""I want peace""., Sonia Khush, Country Director for Save the Children in Ukraine, said:, ""For nearly 10 months, children have watched their homes and schools come under attack, and been torn apart from their families and friends as they flee fighting. The psychological toll of living through war cannot be underestimated. Children can be incredibly resilient, and, with the right support to talk about and deal with their fears, they can learn to cope and start to recover from the consequences of war., *""Every month that this war goes on comes new, previously unimaginable depths of violence against children. *This must be the last Christmas that children from Ukraine experience living under attack or in host countries, away from home."", ENDS, Notes to editors, Photographers:, Our work in Ukraine:, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. Save the Children and local partners are providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, and baby and hygiene kits to displaced families. The aid organisation is supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to access education and other critical services., Our work in Romania:, Save the Children Romania is responding to the protection and psychosocial well-being needs of children in the affected population by working through integrated counselling hubs and mobile teams that provide initial information, psychosocial support, and connection with local authorities through referrals. At the moment, Save the Children Romania runs eight counselling hubs that provide the same services with additional capacity for more in-depth intervention including focused individual and group interventions by trained specialists (e.g. clinical psychologist). Through the hubs, Save the Children Romania is meeting the immediate needs of children and families by providing cash and voucher assistance, hygiene items, and more. There are specialist teams delivering social and recreational services and basic emotional and practical support for refugee children and their families. In addition, Save the Children Romania is helping children to access safe, inclusive, quality education., Our work in the UK:, Save the Children UK has developed and delivered training in child-protection and safeguarding for front-line workers and host families. This online training focuses on the situational context, cultural biases and assumptions, communication with and supporting children and mental health. , Save the Children UK is working in partnership with Barnardo's, the NSPCC, and Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health (RCPCH) to share guidance for families hosting Ukrainian refugees. , We have created a Welcome Pack specifically for families fleeing Ukraine. The pack aims to support parents and help children escaping war feel safe. It includes safeguarding advice, games and activities, wellbeing support, and welcome messages from young people in the UK., Save the Children UK has also provided cash and voucher assistance for families in Wales and Northern Ireland. , For further enquiries please contact:, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/i-want-peace-ukraine-and-christmas-war

""Many people outside Ukraine can hardly imagine our everyday life,"" says Pavlo Titko. The psychological burden on people is high. Relatives live in embattled territories or had to leave their homes. Nobody knows when the war will end. About 30 percent of the country's territory is covered with mines: The life-threatening explosive are installed on gas pipes, in wardrobes, even in toys. The whole situation puts a lot of pressure on the people., Pavlo Titko reports that many Ukrainians need psychosocial support. ""Many people are already traumatised. We expect that after the war millions of people will still need therapeutic support."" Since February, Malteser International has supported almost 20,000 people in Ukraine with psychosocial services such as group or individual talks with psychologists or special services for children. Children in particular are suffering from the current situation. According to UN figures, 1.5 million children are affected., People are dependent on electricity. ""We can check what time we will have power. Many people don't sleep well at night anyway and use the power to get some things done."", says Pavlo Titko. When the power is gone, the heating doesn't work either. Temperatures are below zero. When the power comes back, people quickly turn on the heating to get at least some warmth. This week, Titko visited Cologne and met staff of Malteser in Germany and the Order of Malta Relief Organizations of countries bordering Ukraine to discuss the current situation and future aid deliveries., In the last few weeks, Malteser International sent further aid transport from Germany, among them medication, generators, food packages and blankets.

press@usaid.gov, Thursday, December 15, 2022, Today, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) delivered 5,000 laptops donated by HP Inc. to support education for internally displaced Ukrainians. USAID/Ukraine Mission Director James Hope joined Deputy Minister of Youth and Sports Maryna Popatenko for the handover of the devices in Kyiv., The devices were donated as part of HP’s Digital Equity for Ukraine initiative, a $30 million partnership with the Global Business Coalition for Education that will bring more than 74,000 laptop devices to internally displaced Ukrainians and Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries. Microsoft has also donated software for the laptops. The donation is a result of USAID’s active engagement with the private sector to support Ukraine, including to help fill a critical need for laptops so that Ukrainian youth can continue learning during wartime., Putin’s brutal war against Ukraine has created tremendous challenges for educators and students across the country. Thousands of schools have been damaged or destroyed and according to UNICEF’s Humanitarian Action for Children, up to 2.8 million children have been displaced from their homes. Although distance learning resumed two weeks after the full-scale invasion began, many young people struggle to access remote education options due to a shortage of devices and, increasingly, Russia’s strikes against civilian infrastructure. According to the Ukraine’s Ministry of Education & Science, as of October 25th, there was a national shortage of 175,000 laptops and 202,000 tablets., HP’s donation of laptops and Microsoft’s donation of software for the devices will enable more Ukrainian students to connect with teachers and continue their education remotely. The laptops will be distributed by USAID’s Ukraine National Identity through Youth (UNITY) program in partnership with SpivDiia. SpivDiia is a leading Ukrainian youth organization that has united volunteers, government, and businesses to provide humanitarian aid and support services to civilians affected by the war through its online platform and network of 24 youth centers and youth-serving organizations, matching people in need with resources and institutions that can help.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/usaid-hp-inc-microsoft-and-global-business-coalition-education-deliver-laptops-ukrainian-students

Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Dec 2022,"Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is causing severe damage to municipal infrastructure related to water supply, wastewater management, heating, electricity, housing, schools and health facilities. In response to the war, the European Union (EU) has mobilised billions of euros to support Ukraine's overall economic, social and financial resilience in the form of macro-financial assistance, budgetary support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid., As part of this, the EU has reached an agreement with Nefco, the Nordic Green Bank owned by the five Nordic countries, to allocate funds worth EUR 50 million for critical municipal infrastructure as part of Nefco's green recovery activities in Ukraine. The funds will be used for the repair and reconstruction of damaged critical infrastructure in liberated cities in the Kyiv region., To increase the resilience of critical infrastructure and communities, the funds will be used for basic municipal services for heating, water and electricity supply, wastewater discharge and waste management. The activities aim to improve living conditions for people in Ukraine who are returning to their homes and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from occupied areas seeking shelter in other communities., During the last decade, Nefco has partnered with over a hundred Ukrainian municipalities and successfully financed and implemented environmentally sound projects in energy efficiency, district heating and other municipal services., ""The EU continues to provide emergency support to Ukraine in response to Russia's strikes against its critical civilian infrastructure which constitute a war crime. We are looking forward to tapping into Nefco's broad experience with municipal projects. Factoring in green recovery from the outset will support Ukraine's overall rebuilding as well as European integration,"" said Ambassador Matti Maasikas, Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine., The activities supported by the EU are in line with the Green Recovery for Ukraine programme that Nefco launched in July 2022. The objective of the programme is to undertake rebuilding work in an environmentally sound way, incorporating modern European standards, increasing energy sustainability and strengthening energy security, and to further catalyse green reconstruction and accelerate sustainable societal development in Ukraine., Nefco strongly condemns the brutal, illegal and unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine that continues to cause suffering beyond belief. Nefco commits to work towards a green recovery in Ukraine together with the EU and Nordic contributors and institutions to ensure that Ukraine is built back greener and better. It will work directly with municipalities and help them to plan and finance a sustainable long-term recovery from the damage caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.

Support will reach Ukraine through the EU's humanitarian partners and partly as budget support to the Government of Ukraine., The European Commission has allocated around €14 million from an ongoing contract with the Polish Development Bank “Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego” to purchase school buses and bring Ukrainian children safely to school. The Commission has also launched an EU-wide solidarity campaign to donate school buses for Ukraine, channelled through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Overall, around 240 buses are now on the way from the EU and its member states. More are coming., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Russia's targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure, especially as winter grips the country, are a deliberate crime against millions of innocent people. And they are a gross violation of international law. The EU's top priority is to bring back as soon as possible Ukrainian children back to school. Today we are delivering on our promise to support the rehabilitation of schools damaged and destroyed by Russia's brutal war. And by early 2023, we will also deliver school buses for Ukraine so children can actually travel to school in the best possible conditions. The future of Ukraine begins with its children back in schools.”, First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska said: “I am grateful to the European Commission, and President Ursula von der Leyen in particular, for supporting the restoration of Ukrainian schools. Today, less than a third of children in Ukraine have possibility to regularly attend a school. The rest have to study online or in a hybrid format.

Many simply do not have a classroom to go to. Online education does not always work, with limited power nor access to appropriate IT equipment. To ensure continuity of education, the rehabilitation of school buildings and the provision of school buses have become a top priority for the EU. The Commission acted very quickly to ensure funding so that these children have the possibility to return to in-person education as soon as possible in the best possible conditions., Support to education in emergencies, The EU has been providing humanitarian support to Ukraine in emergency education since the beginning of the war. This support aims to prevent and reduce disruption in education of crisis-affected children by promoting access to safe quality education. Through our humanitarian partners, we provide needed materials, supplies and capacity building of teachers, offering psycho-social support and life-saving messages to children and education staff. EU humanitarian aid also supports the light and medium rehabilitation of educational facilities and the establishment of digital learning centres.

Scaling-up mental health and psychosocial services in war-affected regions: best practices from Ukraine,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,16 Dec 2022,"In her address to the 75th World Health Assembly, the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, highlighted the mental stress experienced by Ukrainians because of the war in Ukraine. She spoke of residents of Kharkiv – who had been living underground in the subway for three months while the city was being shelled – who could not “psychologically bring themselves to rise up,” leave the shelter and return to their homes., Ukraine’s current mental health situation is mirrored across other regions affected by protracted conflicts and war. One in five (22%) people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, will have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. In applying these estimates to Ukraine, WHO expects that approximately 9.6 million people in Ukraine may have a mental health condition., Ensuring appropriate services are immediately available in complex emergencies will help to address a wide range of peoples' pre-existing and emerging mental health and psychosocial needs, as well as support the healing and rebuilding of affected communities., Transforming mental health systems in war-affected regions, The war in Ukraine has placed additional pressure on an already strained mental health system, disrupting much needed mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services for people in need. However, vital work is already ongoing to strengthen the emergency response system and build up primary and community mental health care provision., Streamlining MHPSS emergency-response systems: Given the massive scale of Ukraine’s humanitarian response that drew support from over 270 organizations in the region, WHO worked to streamline MHPSS efforts. To ensure that the MHPSS response in Ukraine is evidence-based, equitable and makes effective use of limited resources WHO supported the development of a roadmap prioritizing actions that are urgently needed to address current MHPSS needs. Launched on 9 December 2022 by the First Lady and Ukraine’s Prime Minister, Denys Shmyhal, the operational roadmap will facilitate a humanitarian response built on existing structures, resources and innovations., “Alignment with this roadmap will ensure that the provision of mental health services for populations in Ukraine, as well as the development of the mental health system, will be conducted in line with the best global practices and will also contribute to the effective planning and distribution of all available resources in this regard. WHO is here to stay in Ukraine and will continue working with all our partners on strengthening mental health service provision,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine., The roadmap draws on a new innovative tool: the MHPSS Minimum Service Packagewhich outlines the basic MHPSS activities that should be implemented in emergency settings across health, protection, education and other sectors.These activities include disseminating information to raise mental health literacy; providing early childhood development activities; supporting community initiatives that promote mental health; and supporting caregivers to promote children’s mental health., Strengthening primary mental health service provision: Recognizing that primary healthcare workers are the first point of contact in Ukraine’s health system, and as one of WHO's Special Initiative for Mental Health countries, WHO and the Ministry of Health mobilized the efforts of 14 partners to scale up Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) activities across the country. These activities are a valuable tool in increasing services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders, and their families., Since 2019, WHO and partners have trained more than 700 primary healthcare workers using WHO’s mhGAP Intervention Guide and its humanitarian emergencies edition to be able to recognize and respond to common mental health conditions. To further scale up capacity building efforts, WHO trained approximately 120 health care workers to provide training, enabling greater outreach. As a result of these efforts over 10% of Ukraine’s primary healthcare staff is due to receive mhGAP training by the end of 2023. WHO is also working with local stakeholders to launch an online, self-paced, adapted version of the training, aiming to reach up to 50,000 primary health workers across the country., Expanding community-based mental health services: Originally launched in 2016 to respond to the mental health needs of internally displaced people in the east of Ukraine, Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) were rolled out nationally in 2021 through the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health. Today 90 CMHTs provide person-centered and recovery-oriented care to people with severe mental disorders, particularly for people living in remote-regions with limited access to mental health services. Oleksii Kostiuchenkov, a member of one of the CMHT said, “99% of those who reach out to us have been directly affected by the ongoing military conflict.” Since the start of the war in Ukraine, CMHTs supported by WHO have provided 23,000 consultations for 1,400 people with severe mental health disorders since the start of the war., “The work happening now during the acute response phase of the war will contribute towards strengthening Ukraine’s mental health system during the recovery phase,” said Dr Fahmy Hanna, a WHO technical officer for mental health. Efforts in Ukraine have already bolstered the capacity of health personnel and community mechanisms to provide quality MHPSS, and streamlined humanitarian responses in the country. This will ensure a stronger and more sustainable mental health system in Ukraine, and lead to better mental health for all Ukrainians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/scaling-mental-health-and-psychosocial-services-war-affected-regions-best-practices-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",16 Dec 2022,"Context, Escalation of hostilities in Ukraine have caused massive displacement, widespread damage to infrastructure, significant disruption to basic services, and many civilians killed or wounded. Being one of the regions most affected by the conflict, Kharkiv oblast accounts for up to 18% of the infrastructure damages1 across the country after Donetsk oblast (25%), according to official figures.2 Kharkiv region’s deputy prosecutor indicated that, as of August 2022, at least 1,019 civilians had been killed in the region, including 52 children.3, Kharkiv city, the capital of the oblast – Ukraine’s second largest city, and major industrial, educational and cultural hub4 – has been a primary target due to its proximity to the Russian border and its strategic significance. Heavily impacted by shellings, the city suffered numerous infrastructure damages, most of which were observed on the northern and eastern part of the city.5 The highly volatile security context led to an outflow of civilians towards western Ukraine and abroad in the earliest months of the escalation. Oblast authorities estimated that only 700 to 800 thousand people remained in the city as of July 20226 , compared to an estimated 1.4 million at the same period in 2021.7, The situation changed early September when the counteroffensive launched by the Ukrainian armed forces pushed Russian troops to the border north of Kharkiv city, and to the eastern bank of the Oskil river, shrinking the non-government controlled areas from 32% to 6% in the oblast.8 However, it did not lead to a complete interruption of shellings in the city, as Kharkiv remains vulnerable to long-range missiles and drones.9 In addition, an increasing number of strikes targeting critical infrastructures is still an acute threat for civilian areas in Kharkiv, and hampers access to energy and water provision ahead of winter. In the meantime, however, many have returned to the city, partly repealed by costs of living and lack of employment opportunities in the west of Ukraine.10 Similarly, Kharkiv city remains a major hub for IDPs fleeing surrounding conflict-affected areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/area-based-assessment-conflict-affected-area-ukraine-briefing-note-basic-service-provision-women-and-children-kharkiv-city-ukraine-november-2022
"Ukraine: ICRC president meets authorities, families of prisoners of war, and communities affected by the international armed conflict",News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,16 Dec 2022,"The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross has completed a four-day visit to Ukraine, during which she traveled to Odesa, Mykolaiv, the Kherson region and Kyiv to meet with authorities, families of prisoners of war and communities affected by the armed conflict., “I’ve seen a trail of destruction,” said ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric. “I’ve seen destroyed houses, uprooted families. Power cuts have become the norm, and this is particularly problematic now that the winter sets in. This is why I continue to insist on the relevance and importance of international humanitarian law.”, Valeriy, local resident of Posad Pokrovskiy in the Kherson region, explains the level of destruction inflicted on his home in hostilities: “Our house has been heavily damaged. Everything has been destroyed. Everything we cared about, everything we earned through hard work – all of it has been destroyed."", In recent weeks ICRC teams have visited more prisoners of war held by Russia and Ukraine, allowing delegates to check their conditions and treatment, share news with their families, and provide personal items like blankets, warm clothes, hygiene products and books., “I continue to insist that we have to be given access to all prisoners of war and to all civilian detainees wherever they are,” said President Spoljaric. “We have to carve out space for humanity, where it is most difficult to preserve humanity. This is precisely the reason why impartial and neutral humanitarian assistance was designed.”, During her visit, President Spoljaric met with Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine; Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs; the Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights; the heads of Kherson and Mykolaiv Regional Administrations; and the leadership of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. Ms Spoljaric’s visit ended Sunday., “I’m concluding my first visit to Ukraine as the new president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,” said President Spoljaric. “I am very thankful for the conversations and meetings I’ve had with authorities but also with the communities. I’ve met with families who are looking for their relatives or trying to reach them where they are detained. I’ve spoken with a young man who is desperately trying to find his brother.”, The ICRC, together with its partners of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, remains committed to helping those most affected by the international armed conflict in 2023. This includes working to urge respect of international humanitarian law and other applicable norms, including the protection of civilians and essential services., For more information please contact:, Oleksandr Vlasenko, ICRC Kyiv (Ukrainian, English), +380 95 262 80 23, ovlasenko@icrc.org

New Multi-Donor Trust Fund Established to Channel Donor Support to Ukraine,News and Press Release,World Bank,"Humanitarian Financing
Recovery and Reconstruction",16 Dec 2022,"**WASHINGTON, December 16, 2022—**The World Bank announced today that it has established a multi-donor trust fund aimed at supporting the Government of Ukraine as it addresses the relief and the subsequent recovery of the country, driven by critical needs from the ongoing war. The Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF), managed by the World Bank, will provide a coordinated financing and support mechanism to assist the Government of Ukraine to sustain its administrative and service delivery capacity, conduct relief efforts, as well as plan and implement Ukraine’s reconstruction and reform agenda. The Fund will also provide resources for critical advisory and analytical work for relief and reconstruction efforts., Led by a founding pledge from Switzerland, contributors to the URTF include Austria, Iceland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden for an initial total of $250 million. Canada and Japan have also pledged support to the URTF and other partners are expected to join., “The devastating human and economic losses caused by this war are mounting every day,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia*. “Efficient and coordinated donor support for the Government and the people of Ukraine are critical for Ukraine’s recovery, reconstruction, and reform efforts. The URTF will bring together development partner financing, World Bank expertise, and other key support to meet the massive needs ahead, while also leveraging the Bank’s value add and broad range of financing instruments*.”, The uncertainty resulting from the war requires Ukraine’s development partners to take a long-term approach for supporting recovery and reconstruction efforts. Additional potential shocks, such as climate-related disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, pandemics, among other possible hazards, could drive further needs over different time horizons. Therefore, the Fund is structured as a flexible platform to swiftly respond to Ukraine’s evolving context and needs over an initial 10-year period, facilitating the overallresponsiveness to new crises and shocks., The URTF will operate under the overarching Multi-Donor Resources for Institutions and Infrastructure (MRII - МРІЇ) for Ukraine Facility, which is part of broader international support to Ukraine and is coordinated through the World Bank Group., To date, the World Bank has mobilized $18 billion in emergency financing in support of the people of Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors: more than $13 billion of this financing has been disbursed. This vital support has helped address the devastating human and economic impacts of the on-going war., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/46, Contacts

Ukrainian grain alleviates the global hunger crisis,News and Press Release,Govt. Sweden,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",15 Dec 2022,"Sweden supports the export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea Grain Initiative and Grain from Ukraine. These initiatives aim to alleviate the global hunger crisis and the risk of famine that have been exacerbated by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and to support the Ukrainian economy and agricultural sector., Besides the widespread human suffering and material destruction in Ukraine, Russia’s aggression has had major humanitarian consequences for vulnerable people around the world. Prior to the invasion, Ukraine was one of the world’s major grain exporters. However, as a result of the Russian blockade on Ukrainian grain exports, the global availability of grain has decreased, and prices have increased., “Russia’s actions have exacerbated an already acute global hunger crisis, with the risk of famine. The Government supports several initiatives to combat acute hunger among the world’s most vulnerable and at the same time support the Ukrainian agricultural sector through grain deliveries from Ukrainian ports,” says Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade Johan Forssell., Black Sea grain exports, In September, Sweden decided to support Ukrainian food exports by contributing SEK 400 million for the purchase and transport of 50 000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat for humanitarian purposes. The purchase and transport are being done under the UN World Food Programme (WFP). The wheat will be distributed to the people in need in Yemen, where there is an acute risk of famine. This has been possible thanks to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, an agreement brokered by the UN and Turkey in July 2022. As a result of this agreement, ships carrying Ukrainian grain, agricultural products and fertiliser can safely leave Ukraine and sail through the Black Sea to reach global markets. A total of 15 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain and food products have been exported under the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This has helped support the Ukrainian agricultural sector, combat global hunger and stabilise global food prices., The Government welcomed the agreement reached on 17 November by the parties concerned to extend the deal for four months., The Government of Sweden welcomes the renewal of the Black Sea grain Initiative, Ukraine donates wheat to the most needy, The Grain from Ukraine initiative, launched by the Ukrainian Government, aims to help those most affected by the impact of Russia’s invasion on the global food supply. Ukraine has donated at least 125 000 tonnes of grain to vulnerable people in Africa and Asia., “The leadership Ukraine has shown by helping to solve the global food crisis, at the same time as Ukrainians are defending their country against Russia’s devastating war, is admirable,” says Mr Forssell., Sweden is contributing to the Ukrainian initiative by donating SEK 100 million to the WFP, which is tasked with transporting the grain to the people who need it most. In conjunction with the launch of Grain from Ukraine, three ships carrying Ukrainian wheat set off for Sudan and Yemen.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-grain-alleviates-global-hunger-crisis
WHO-supported emergency medical teams begin work in newly regained areas in Ukraine [EN/RU/DE],News and Press Release,WHO,Health,16 Dec 2022,"Health services and facilities in Ukraine have been severely disrupted and damaged due to attacks following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine 9 months ago., WHO-supported emergency medical teams (EMTs), working under the auspices of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Center for Disaster Medicine, have been deployed to provide acute trauma care and primary health care to populations in newly regained regions including Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv., The EMTs include a doctor, 2 nurses, a traumatologist and a driver, and have been fully trained and equipped with medications, consumables and armoured vehicles to respond to health needs., Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, said, “National EMTs working in newly regained areas ensure that access to critical health care can continue amid the war. Seven EMTs have been deployed to various regions throughout the country, and the goal is to prepare up to 25 EMTs so that they can respond to acute health needs within a 12- to 24-hour period as needs emerge. In this regard, WHO is providing trainings, medicines, ambulances and other supplies to assist with the response. We are grateful to our national and international partners for their ongoing support.” In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, WHO prepared the design of the national EMT project in line with WHO global guidelines and standards, including for the development of operational procedures., Six coordination hubs will also be established throughout Ukraine to ensure an optimal referral system for patients and to facilitate medical evacuations outside the country for those with severe health needs., Financial support for the EMT project has been received from the Germany Federal Ministry of Health. Her Excellency Ms Anka Feldhusen, Ambassador of Germany to Ukraine, said, “Germany is one of the largest donors among Member States, both in terms of compulsory and voluntary contributions to WHO. We greatly appreciate the commitment and expertise of the WHO experts here in Ukraine, especially during wartime. I am very pleased that the Federal Ministry of Health supports emergency medical teams in newly regained regions, responding to acute and primary health needs of the people and thus helping them to cope with the personal aftermath of occupation and continuing Russian attacks.” Ms Feldhusen added, “In 2022, the German Government provided WHO with funding in the amount of 17 million euros for the implementation of the project ‘Health emergency response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries’, aimed among other things at ensuring access of Ukrainians to basic medical services and restoration of hospitals.”, ENDS, For further information or to arrange an interviewe kindly contact Rayyan Sabet-Parry (rsabetparry@who.int)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-supported-emergency-medical-teams-begin-work-newly-regained-areas-ukraine-enrude

Stellar Blockchain Technology Powers International Rescue Committee’s Cash-Based Humanitarian Assistance for Conflict Affected People in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IRC,Coordination,15 Dec 2022,"The International Rescue Committee teams up with the Stellar Development Foundation to pilot digital cash disbursement system powered by the Stellar network, with Circle’s USDC, Vibrant, and MoneyGram International, to reach people in need with speed, agility, and on-chain traceability and accountability, ‍San Francisco, CA – December 15, 2022 – Today, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), a nonprofit that supports the growth and development of the public Stellar blockchain network, announced the pilot of a first-of-its-kind blockchain-powered aid disbursement system in Ukraine. The pilot is one of the first implementations of a novel end-to-end cash assistance system built on the Stellar blockchain, Stellar Aid Assist, that delivers relief funds quickly, affordably, and with transparency to individuals in crisis., Stellar Aid Assist enhances the IRC's existing cash assistance efforts by leveraging a digital dollar backed by fully reserved assets — in this instance, the USD Coin (USDC) issued by Circle Internet Financial — and distributes them almost instantly to a digital wallet on a client’s smartphone — in this instance, Vibrant. It allows individuals to remotely receive digital dollars, hold them as a store of value to hedge against inflation, and transport them more securely across borders as needed, instead of providing individuals with physical cash that may be difficult or dangerous to store and move. It also allows clients in Ukraine to receive their cash assistance even if they do not have a bank account or credit or debit card, as they can store it on a digital wallet on their phones and convert the digital dollars to real currency almost anywhere in the world through MoneyGram’s 400K+ agent locations in 175 countries., The IRC and partners are responding to the conflict-driven humanitarian emergency in Ukraine by providing unrestricted multipurpose cash assistance to almost 83,500 people affected by the crisis to date. So far this month, the IRC and SDF have provided USDC to 33 people, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100 people across southeastern Ukraine under this pilot., Thanks to the use of the Stellar blockchain, this innovative solution has the potential to enhance the speed, efficiency, flexibility of traditional cash-based inventions, as well as provides greater transparency for IRC and its donors through the traceability of funds. It has the potential to lay the groundwork for future financial innovation for cash assistance and donation programs, with the opportunity to grow a global ecosystem of digital wallets and cash on/off ramps serving different contexts and geographies., The IRC is committed to finding innovative solutions to the challenges faced by people in humanitarian disasters. With more people displaced globally than ever before and more than 6.5 million IDPs in Ukraine alone, funding for humanitarian responses is proportionally at the lowest point in years. Finding faster, cheaper, and more effective aid distribution methods builds on the IRC’s commitment to a ‘cash first’ approach, and its leadership in using cash assistance in the humanitarian sector. With this collaboration, the IRC and SDF are advancing an innovative form of cash assistance to test the impact of stablecoins and measure the effectiveness of stablecoin distributions in humanitarian settings., ‍Quote from David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), said: ""The IRC is committed to finding innovative solutions to the challenges faced by people impacted by humanitarian disasters. Our partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation enables the IRC to offer a new way for clients in Ukraine to receive much needed cash assistance, including the option to receive assistance in USD, which is essential in helping to rebuild their lives. This partnership will help the IRC better leverage new technologies to continue improving the effectiveness and efficiencies of our multipurpose cash programming."", ‍Quote from Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director, Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), said: “For vulnerable populations, cash-based interventions are a lifeline, helping to access essential goods and giving recipients freedom, power, and dignity. Our mission at SDF - creating equitable access to the global financial system - is about using technology to reach people where they are and when they need it most.

UNHCR launches pilot Cash-Based Intervention Using Blockchain Technology for Humanitarian Payments to People Displaced and Impacted by the War in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNHCR,Coordination,15 Dec 2022,"UNHCR has launched a first-of-its-kind integrated blockchain payment solution powered by the Stellar network to reach people in need with speed, agility, and accountability, 15 Dec 2022
Geneva, 15 December 2022
Stellar Development Foundation (SDF): San Francisco, CA, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the non-profit that supports the growth and development of the Stellar blockchain network, announced today the launch of a pilot first-of-its-kind blockchain payment solution for digital cash distribution to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other war-affected people in Ukraine., UNHCR, in collaboration with United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC), the UN’s technology solutions provider, are amongst the first to pilot the new Stellar-based aid disbursement solution, which ensures the delivery of cash assistance directly into the hands of those being assisted quickly, efficiently, and securely with full value transfer traceability and accountability., The pilot phase of the project is designed specifically for Ukraine but can be adapted worldwide. UNHCR confirms eligibility and distributes assistance in Circle Internet Financial’s USD Coin (USDC) — a stablecoin where one USDC is equal to one US Dollar — directly into a recipient’s Vibrant digital wallet which they can download onto a smartphone. This provides a secure place to hold and transport funds in USDC, a stable store of value, allowing people to travel within the country or cross borders without the need to carry cash., When recipients choose to convert to cash, whether it is dollars, euros, or local currency, they can withdraw their funds at any global MoneyGram location, including over 4,500 MoneyGram locations in Ukraine., The program is being piloted in Kyiv, Lviv, and Vinnytsia and will expand to other towns and cities in Ukraine. ​​The money will provide humanitarian assistance to some of the people most impacted and vulnerable due to the war, to help them cover basic needs like rent of accommodation, food, medical care and heating during the winter. The solution has been extensively tested over the last six months and is expected to be expanded to reach more war-affected people inside Ukraine as well as refugees from Ukraine in early 2023., This blockchain initiative complements UNHCR’s goals to further expand the systematic and rapid use of Cash-Based Interventions. Since 2016, when UNHCR issued its first Policy on Cash Based Interventions, UNHCR has delivered almost USD 5 billion in cash assistance to some 35 million people in 100 countries. UNHCR is committed to further expanding the provision of cash, which is normally the preferred assistance modality by people forcibly displaced, as it gives them the freedom and dignity to themselves decide how to prioritize the assistance given, based on their personal need., “Ukraine is a global lead in the development of technical solutions to increase access to social protection, including assistance for displaced people. Across the world, UNHCR has been collaborating for years with the tech sector, which has played a crucial role in helping us to innovate to deliver assistance faster, as speed is of the essence in humanitarian action. It’s also essential to provide people with a range of options for receiving aid, as one size does not fit all. Programmes need to be designed with the people they are meant to serve at the centre. I am very pleased that UNHCR and the SDF have chosen Ukraine for this launch, and look forward to expanding it beyond this pilot, so it can benefit many thousands more people in need of assistance as a result of the war”, said Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative to Ukraine., “SDF, together with UNHCR, is realizing the promise of blockchain and pioneering a new future for the delivery of billions of dollars in aid disbursed annually. Using Stellar, we are helping get funds into the hands of those who need them – and doing it quickly, transparently, and without the need for bank accounts or credit or debit cards. We are proud to work with UNHCR to deploy blockchain innovations that will play a role in assisting those in crisis”, said Denelle Dixon, Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director., “Today, we can see how blockchain technology allows us to scale humanitarian efforts in a way that wasn’t possible before. For fleeing Ukrainians, and primarily for those whose banks are inaccessible, this pilot project providing humanitarian assistance using a digital wallet, will serve as a possible lifeline for survival. The project itself is a vivid example of how blockchain has the potential to transform and revolutionize the way humanitarian funds are allocated. The use of blockchain technology allows humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR to be more transparent and accountable and ensure that the most vulnerable people will have access to funds provided in their name. In this way, humanitarian efforts around the world will be strengthened in an unprecedented way. The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine is grateful to SDF and UNHCR for standing with the people of Ukraine and doing this in such an efficient & modern way,” said Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development Oleksandr Bornyakov., ###, Media Contacts

Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Dec 2022,"Thank you, Prime Minister, thank you, Denys [Shmygal], for receiving me. I was recalling that you and I met in this same building many months ago, early on in this war. And it is a great privilege for me to be back. Thank you very much indeed., I was fortunate to visit Mykolaiv and Kherson earlier this week, and now also in Kyiv, meeting the Prime Minister and other leaders, as well as humanitarian agencies. And I'd like to share a few conclusions from those visits and from those meetings., Firstly, I was very impressed by the close partnership which the international humanitarian community, which is what I represent, has with your authorities, with your Government here. But also, very importantly in the oblasts, the government of Mykolaiv and Kherson. I spent time with the mayors of those two cities, the heads of hromadas also. And that relationship is extremely strong, but it's very operational. Needs are identified. Aid is delivered., And I want to thank you, in fact, for what everyone has been telling me from the humanitarian agencies, international and national, local, the frontline partners, to thank you for the very constructive and open relationship we have, even in these extraordinarily difficult times where all your days are filled with decisions and tragedies. You have provided the time for our agencies and our partners to do that job. It is a huge thank you., Since the beginning of the war, international humanitarian agencies have reached just under 14 million people with assistance, and we will continue to do so under your leadership., But let me say a few things about Mykolaiv and Kherson., We were in Kherson, as I said. The Governor was spending the day with us, the mayor, the people. We saw distribution sites for food, shelter, clothing, mattresses, all organized by local authorities, handing out these small bits of generosity to the people in their great time of difficulty. I was in a school where UNICEF has a child centre. And as we were there in Kherson, we heard the artillery coming closer to us. So the shelling, which is a daily phenomenon in Kherson, we heard that. And it's not that we were under threat, but we were reminded of these still uncertain lives and futures of so many people, even in Kherson, where you have managed to regain so much of your territory., We met in Mykolaiv, in a shelter provided by your Government to the displaced people from Kherson, some of these families. Some of them have been there for months, but some had recently arrived because their villages on the road between Mykolaiv and Kherson had been destroyed. And the following day we saw those villages, and they went back daily to try to restart their lives in those villages., They didn't know when the reconstruction of their houses would happen, and it was a reminder of two things. One, you have an enormous challenge ahead to reconstruct the places where people live. But equally, you have people who want to go home, who are determined to go home. And that is a great value and a great tribute to your people., Three things came across very strongly. And you mentioned them as priority needs. Number one, no surprise, is the electricity. I was absolutely stunned to see the degree to which electricity is the gateway to everything else. Without electricity, there's no warmth. The weather is getting cold., Without electricity, there are no medical services, there is no transport, there is no light., And in many parts of Kherson there is very little electricity. So, the effort that you were making in Paris on the same day, Denys, that is, making the repair of energy infrastructure the absolute central priority is one that I saw how important it was to the people of Kherson. And the Governor of Kherson is trying to amend the electricity lines coming into his oblast and hoping that if they were repaired, that they would not be damaged again., This issue is of central importance precisely because civilians suffer from the lack of electricity, civilians who should not suffer under international law in a conflict. That's the first priority., The second is de-mining, and we talked about it just now. I was told, for example, that there are about half a million hectares of agricultural land in Kherson alone, which needs de-mining. You can't get the country back into production without de-mining. I think, as you were saying to me earlier, Ukraine is probably now the most mine-polluted country in the world. So the urgent international priority to the mines is one that we will also do what we can., And then, finally, even in war, people want to see a future, and perhaps particularly in war. Restarting elements of a local economy is a central priority for people. People want to go back to work. They want their children to go back to schools, they want transport to work. They want the economy to work, they want employment to happen. And I am one of those who support you in your efforts to get that private sector back. Even now, even in places like Kherson, where the war is still going on with those people on the right bank are still being shelled every day, restarting, jumpstarting the economy, anything that we in the UN can do to support that effort – we’d happily do so., Thank you very much., Q: Could you elaborate if there is a special UN programme in preparation for a potential second wave of migration of Ukrainians, both outside and inside of Ukraine, in case of further adverse developments?, Emergency Relief Coordinator: Yes, our leader here, Denise Brown, the UN leader in Ukraine, is with us. The agencies like UNHCR [UN Refugee Agency], the agencies like the International Organization for Migration, are ready for that, for such displacement., As you will remember at the beginning of this war, there was the largest displacement experienced since the Second World War. Well, we hope to God that’s not going to happen., But I would make this point very strongly: Even where there is preparedness, what is so important, and we know it from all over the world, is to get people aid to where they are. That’s why people who want to go home should be encouraged to do so., Front-line services should be reinstated as soon as possible so that they don’t have to move, so that displacement doesn’t have to happen. And we hope that it doesn’t, but we’re ready., Q: You mentioned about the economic aid to Ukraine from the UN. What would it be in general? And what is the situation with the creation of a tribunal over Russia and the expertise of the UN?, Emergency Relief Coordinator: I’m not involved in the second aspect; I’m strictly involved in the humanitarian area., But the humanitarian does cover economic issues and I’d like to reply to that first question., There are a number of different things. I think, first of all, there is an enormous interest from the international private sector to do what they can to help the people of Ukraine, and that is what the Prime Minister and his Ministers mobilize, and that’s one of the reasons of course why [he] had to go to Europe, in Paris, this week. Mobilizing private sector support for the private sector is very important., And the Prime Minister was telling me earlier about the way in which small and medium enterprises are being supported through grants, through services, to enable them to work., But I want to give an example of what the humanitarian community can do about it: The World Food Programme contracted a large industrial-size bakery in Mykolaiv to produce bread for the people of Kherson. We saw the bread being made; we saw it being delivered in Kherson. In so doing, WFP delivered the humanitarian assistance, but they [also] invested in that bakery and more than 200 people came back to work there. That’s the kind of thing that we need to do. We need to have a double benefit if we can from humanitarian assistance so that the people can take their lives back into their own hands.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-martin-griffiths-remarks-press-conclusion-his-mission-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",2 Dec 2022,"KYIV, 2 December 2022 – On the International Day of People with Disabilities, UNICEF celebrates the rights, contributions, and potential of all children with disabilities, and encourages the Government and all humanitarian actors to ensure a disability inclusive humanitarian response in Ukraine, especially for internally displaced children and their families., ""Children with disabilities are first and foremost children, and they have the same rights that all children have. So any humanitarian activity should include children with disabilities and offer adequate care, protection, and a barrier-free environment. No child should be left behind, especially in times of war. We need to ensure children with disabilities are visible, heard, and protected, as all children should be"", said UNICEF representative Murat Sahin., UNICEF works to build a world where children and youth with disabilities reach their full potential, growing up healthy, educated, protected from harm, heard and engaged in their communities. It also works to ensure that children with disabilities and their families have access to community-based services and support, wherever they may live, in times of stability as well as in humanitarian emergencies., UNICEF successfully cooperates with the Ukrainian Government and partners in this area. As part of this cooperation, 19 municipal and civil society organizations from all over the country are equipped to provide early intervention services to young children with developmental delays and disabilities. This initiative is implemented within the Early Intervention project led by UNICEF and the Dzherelo Rehabilitation Center, with support from Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy., UNICEF’s partnership with the Dzerelo Rehabilitation Center focuses on children with disabilities. As a result of this partnership, in the past five months, 5,870 internally displaced children undertook a comprehensive assessment of their needs and some 42% of these children (2,465) were identified as having developmental delays or disabilities. These children were referred to social services and to rehabilitation or other specialized services, where required., In addition, UNICEF facilitated an advocacy training for 57 civil society organizations, led by parents of children with disabilities and women with disabilities. This training was to build their advocacy and networking capacity to make their voices heard and considered in their communities while planning and implementing humanitarian response activities., At the end of March this year, UNICEF launched its cash transfer programme with the Ministry of Social Policy, which targets families that have three or more children, as well as families with children with disabilities. About 50,000 children with disabilities and their families received it. UNICEF is planning to provide a second payment to these households this month, which represent the most vulnerable families among the 200,000 families that UNICEF has already supported with cash transfers., Moreover, UNICEF continues to strengthen community-based social services, as well as specialized services in communities with a large number of internally displaced population. Within the project, assistive devices are procured and distributed to families of children with disabilities, including hearing aids, wheelchairs, eye-tracking technology, and alternative communication systems. Families also received psychosocial support. A brochure with recommendations for community professionals, parents, and caregivers of children who have been disabled by landmines and explosive remnants of war is being developed., However, in order to ensure a comprehensive and disability inclusive humanitarian response, there is still a need for strengthening and consolidating these efforts with national and local authorities and with humanitarian organisations. It is a must that standards of services for displaced people are inclusive and accessible. Disability and inclusion needs to become a cross-sectoral priority for all actors., Media contacts, Damian Rance

We will be working with Ukrainian authorities to identify needs in locations that are not directly embroiled in conflict. Experience from these early interventions will accelerate recovery when more broad-based interventions are possible., Today’s conference gives us a perfect opportunity to collectively support Ukraine to ensure its early recovery and reconstruction embodies “acquis by doing” – and delivers for the future sustainable development of Ukraine., I thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-paris-conference-support-ukraines-civilian-resilience
Council of the EU - Council adopts €18 billion assistance to Ukraine,News and Press Release,EU,Recovery and Reconstruction,10 Dec 2022,"The Council reached agreement on a legislative package which will enable the EU to help Ukraine financially throughout 2023 with €18 billion. The proposal was adopted by the Council today via a written procedure and it will be submitted to the European Parliament for its possible adoption next week., The package provides for a structural solution to financially support Ukraine in 2023. The amount to be lent to Ukraine in 2023 will be €18 billion, and the loans will have a 10-year grace period. Member states will cover the bulk of the interest costs via external assigned revenues. The guarantees for that borrowing will be provided either by the EU budget or by member states., The aim is to provide short-term financial relief, financing Ukraine’s immediate needs, rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and initial support towards sustainable post-war reconstruction, with a view to supporting Ukraine on its path towards European integration., A part of the legislative package, an amendment to the financial regulation, had already been adopted by the Council in Ecofin formation on 6 December., Background, Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has caused Ukraine a loss of market access and a drastic drop in public revenues, while public expenditure to address the humanitarian situation and to maintain the continuity of state services has increased markedly., Among other support instruments, between 2014 and 2022 the EU supported Ukraine through several consecutive macro-financial assistance (MFA) operations that exceeded €7 billion of loans and grants., The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 September 2017, brings Ukraine and the EU closer together. In addition to promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and the respect for common values, the agreement has provided a framework for pursuing an ambitious reform agenda, focused on the fight against corruption, an independent judicial system, the rule of law, and a better business climate. The EU has shown continuous support for these reforms, which are crucial for attracting investments, boosting productivity and lifting the standards of living in the medium term.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/council-eu-council-adopts-eu18-billion-assistance-ukraine

Almost 7 million children in Ukraine at risk as attacks on energy infrastructure cause widespread blackouts and disruption of heating and water,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",14 Dec 2022,"UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell urges protection of children and civilian infrastructure, NEW YORK/KYIV, 14 December 2022 – Continuing attacks on critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine have left almost every child in Ukraine - nearly seven million children – without sustained access to electricity, heating and water, putting them at increased risk as temperatures continue to drop and winter deepens, UNICEF warned today., Without electricity, children are not only facing extreme cold - winter temperatures can drop below -20°C – but are also unable to continue the online learning opportunities which are many children’s only access to education, with so many schools damaged or destroyed. Additionally, health facilities may be unable to provide critical services, and malfunctioning water systems raise the already extremely high risks of pneumonia, seasonal influenza, waterborne diseases and COVID-19., “Millions of children are facing a bleak winter huddled in the cold and the dark, with little idea of how or when respite may arrive,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Beyond the immediate threats the freezing conditions bring, children are also deprived of the ability to learn or stay connected with friends and family, putting both their physical and their mental health at desperate risk.”, Intensified attacks in October destroyed 40 percent of Ukraine’s power production, further exposing families to harsh winter conditions, impacting livelihoods, and increasing the likelihood of additional large population movements. Despite ongoing repairs, on 28 November, the Ukrainian energy system was able to cover only 70 per cent of the peak demand to generate power, according to OCHA., The harsh winter, combined with a loss of income and the energy and socioeconomic crisis triggered by the war are devastating to the well-being of children and families. Families’ incomes, and access to services have been decimated by the destruction of infrastructure in the almost 10 months since the war escalated. The situation is especially acute for the 6.5 million people, including 1.2 million children, who are currently displaced within Ukraine., As areas previously affected by heavy fighting become accessible, UNICEF started distributing winter clothing kits, water heaters, and generators in the frontline and newly accessible areas of Kharkiv, Kherson and Donetsk oblasts. More than US$20 million worth of winterisation supplies have been procured to date., A bleak winter will also likely worsen the psychosocial situation for children, who are already facing a looming mental health crisis, with an estimated 1.5 million at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorders and other mental conditions. The impact on children’s access to education is just the latest disruption after the early end of the previous school year and disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF has winterized more than 55 of its SPILNO Child Spots – safe, warm spaces providing integrated services for children, youth and caregivers., “The rules of war are clear - children and the essential civilian infrastructure they rely on to survive must be protected,” said Russell. “It is also essential that UNICEF and our humanitarian colleagues have the rapid and unimpeded access to children and families in need of humanitarian assistance no matter where they are.”, To date, UNICEF has been able to provide access to primary health care in UNICEF-supported facilities and through mobile teams to nearly 4.9 million children and women in Ukraine. Over 4.2 million people have been provided with access to safe drinking water and over 1 million people have received critical water, sanitation, and hygiene supplies, including in newly accessible areas. UNICEF-supported mental health support interventions have reached over 2.5 million children, nearly 900,000 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education and nearly 500,000 children have benefited from learning interventions. Nearly 200,000 families have been reached by UNICEF-funded multi-purpose humanitarian cash transfers., Last week UNICEF launched its annual Humanitarian Action for Children Appeal. UNICEF requires US$1.1 billion to address the immediate and longer-term needs of 9.4 million people, including 4 million children, who remain deeply impacted by the war in Ukraine. Funding will enable UNICEF to provide, sustain and expand critical services in health, nutrition, child protection, gender-based violence, WASH and social protection alongside government relief and recovery efforts. It will ensure timely preparedness for additional internal displacements and refugee movements., Media contacts, Joe English UNICEF New York Tel: +1 917 893 0692 Email: jenglish@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/almost-7-million-children-ukraine-risk-attacks-energy-infrastructure-cause-widespread-blackouts-and-disruption-heating-and-water

To reduce costs, 63 per cent of respondents have reported that they are rationing their use of gas, electricity, and solid fuel., “Nearly 18 million people – 40 per cent of Ukraine’s population – need urgent humanitarian aid,” said IOM Chief of Mission in Ukraine, Anh Nguyen., “We must support them during winter, particularly those with no access to shelter or heat. IOM urges stakeholders to scale up their efforts as the needs keep growing with each passing day.”, The multiple attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have caused massive disruptions to water, electricity, and heating supply across the country., As of December, over 5 million people who had been displaced, within Ukraine or beyond, have returned home., “There were only 700,000 persons living in Kharkiv in March and now there are over 1.1 million. People are coming back and are determined to stay. We need to take care of them,” says Ievhen Hryschenko, Technical Director of the Kharkiv Heating Networks., Ukrainian authorities at central and local levels are addressing people’s most pressing needs by setting up “heating points” at strategic locations, where people can warm up, charge their phones, have hot drinks, and access vital services such as first aid., IOM has already donated 18 generators to the municipality of Kharkiv. According to Hryschenko, one of the generators is used to provide heating for 28 multistorey residential buildings, a school, a kindergarten, and a clinic. IOM has provided another four generators to the war-affected city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine., In Sumy, another region heavily affected by shelling, the Organization has delivered thousands of mattresses, blankets, and bed sets, as well as solar lamps and jerry cans to 150 government-established heating points., Similar assistance will be delivered to other regions in Ukraine, while another 1,200 generators are set to arrive in the coming weeks., Ukrainian Railways Ukrzaliznytsia has received 22,500 thermal blankets with IOM’s support, which will be used at heating points at nearly a hundred railway stations across Ukraine.

Impact of the war on agriculture and rural livelihoods in Ukraine - Findings of a nation-wide rural household survey (December 2022) [EN/UK],Assessment,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",14 Dec 2022,"Ukraine: New UN survey shows rural households are increasingly affected by the war, Nationwide assessment reveals that more than one in four respondents reported having reduced or ceased agricultural production, Kyiv/Rome -- After nine months of war in Ukraine, rural households are increasingly affected by the conflict with many forced to scale down or abandon agricultural activities, according to a new survey released by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)., The Impact of the war on agriculture and rural livelihoods in Ukraine: Findings of a nationwide rural household survey revealed that one in every four of the 5 200 respondents surveyed had reduced or stopped agricultural production due to the conflict. Rural households were interviewed to enhance understanding of the current agriculture and livelihoods situation and needs, particularly in view of the upcoming winter season., ""Ukraine's agriculture sector is an important source of livelihoods for the roughly 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas. While around two-thirds of agricultural production is made by enterprises, rural households produce around 32 percent,"" said Pierre Vauthier, head of FAO's Ukraine Country Office. ""The report indicates that 25 percent of the Ukrainian rural population involved in agriculture stopped their activities or reduced their output due to the war. The situation is much worse in the most agriculture-dependent regions of Ukraine, where over 40 percent of rural families are affected."", The impact of the war on the broader production system, characterized by disruptions to value and supply chains and price volatility, has had repercussions on the rural population, underlining their interdependence with the country's agricultural economy. While the effects of the war are more prominent in the oblasts (regions) along the front line, these are also widely experienced in the rest of the country., ""The report focuses on those households mostly involved in backyard farming and small-scale agricultural production,"" said Lavinia Antonaci, coordinator of the assessment. ""Although not officially defined as farmers, they play a pivotal role in ensuring the food security, incomes and livelihoods of rural populations by providing for their own food consumption as well as selling products locally, thus contributing to local supply chains."", Key findings, As the war persists, the current situation is likely to deteriorate further. Compounded by the winter season and the potential for further internal displacements to rural areas, the coping capacities of the rural population are likely to become progressively strained. It is critical to protect those households from the further deterioration of their productive capacities, which are the foundations of their resilience., The report notes that support to rural household food production is a means to mitigate the negative impacts of the war on their food security and livelihoods, and will also improve and maintain the hosting capacities of rural households. Revitalizing and sustaining the small-scale agriculture sector will strengthen and secure the contribution of rural households to the broader agricultural system and enhance the benefits they can access in return., In addition, it is critical to monitor the constantly changing situation and to continue providing complementary assessments and integrated analyses on the impact of the war on Ukraine's agricultural system to better inform short-, medium- and long-term actions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-war-agriculture-and-rural-livelihoods-ukraine-findings-nation-wide-rural-household-survey-december-2022-enuk

A central component of these revisions has been the redirection of Official Development Assistance (ODA) earmarked for long-term development projects in the Global South. This diversion of aid may have far-reaching consequences for recipient communities in the Global South., Brief Points, OECD-DAC donors are increasingly using ODA to cover the expenses of in-donor refugee-hosting at home to offset the toll of the Ukraine war on their own economies., OECD-DAC countries have increased their defence and military spending in response to the war in Ukraine, limiting funds for development assistance., Post-war reconstruction costs will be a further drain on resources, the extent of which will depend on the duration of the war, the scale of infrastructure destruction, and the standard to which reconstruction is carried out., Defence budget increases are likely to continue for the long-term and reflect a changing geopolitical order.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-ukraine-war-donor-priorities

It was a privilege to convey that message, which carries its own special meaning of the depth of concern that exists in addition to the practical, essential services the support enables.”, “The unprecedented support by Direct Relief is truly appreciated, said Andrej Vrsansky, the CEO of League for Mental Health Slovakia. “In our experience, this is an exceptional case where support was provided when it was most needed and on a scale that can make a difference. Being flexible is the prerequisite for any impact in a situation that dynamically changes every week and where any forecasts are unreliable. Direct Relief is a game-changer in this respect.”, “Seeing U.S. charitable organizations like Direct Relief stand with their Slovak counterparts makes me incredibly proud to be an American and to serve in Slovakia,” said US Ambassador to Slovakia Gautam Rana. “Announcements like these are proof that that though we are separated by an ocean, we are united by our shared humanity.”, “We are very grateful to Direct Relief for the support of unbroken Ukrainians,” said Oleg Samchuk, General Director of the First Lviv Medical Union. “With this funding, we will get even more opportunities for the treatment and rehabilitation of our people. I hope that our cooperation, at the heart of which is helping people, will be extended.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/direct-relief-announces-79-million-humanitarian-aid-package-ukraine
G7 Leaders’ Statement (12 December 2022),News and Press Release,Govt. Canada,"Food and Nutrition
Humanitarian Financing",12 Dec 2022,"We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met on 12 December, to reflect on progress of our cooperation under Germany’s Presidency to jointly address global challenges at a time of severe geopolitical crisis and critical moment for the world economy. We were joined by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This year in the face of Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, we stood more united than ever, together with Ukraine and in unwavering commitment to our shared values, the rules-based multilateral order and international cooperation., Today, we reaffirm our unwavering support for and solidarity with Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian war of aggression for as long as it takes. We condemn Russia’s continuous inhumane and brutal attacks targeting critical infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, and cities across Ukraine, and recall that indiscriminate attacks and attacks on the civilian population or civilian objects, constitute a war crime. We also condemn those who are facilitating Putin’s illegal war. We are determined to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. We will help Ukraine in meeting its winter preparedness needs, will continue to support Ukraine’s civilian resilience, and will further enhance our efforts on this during the international conference to be held in Paris on 13 December. We are determined that Russia will ultimately need to pay for the restoration of critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed through its brutal war. There can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities. We will hold President Putin and those responsible to account in accordance with international law. We reiterate that Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable and that any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons would be met with severe consequences., Building on our commitments so far, we will continue to galvanise international support to help address Ukraine’s urgent short-term financing needs. We ask our Finance Ministers to convene shortly to discuss a joint approach for coordinated budget support in 2023. We affirm that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be central to this effort., We firmly support efforts to secure Ukraine’s immediate financial stability and its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous and democratic future, in line with its European path. We will build on the outcomes of the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine held on 25 October in Berlin, as well as at the Ukraine Recovery Conference on 21-22 June 2023 in London. In particular, with a view to supporting Ukraine’s repair, recovery and reconstruction, together with Ukraine and our international partners and in close coordination with relevant International Organisations and International Financial Institutions, we will establish a multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform. Through this platform, we will coordinate existing mechanisms to provide ongoing short- and long-term support – with particular responsibility of the Finance Track for short-term financial support –, coordinate further international funding and expertise, and encourage Ukraine’s reform agenda as well as private sector led growth. We will also set up a Secretariat for the Platform. We will each designate a senior government representative to oversee the set-up of the platform and ongoing coordination efforts, and ask them to convene as soon as possible in January 2023., With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready to reach arrangements together with Ukraine and interested countries and institutions on sustained security and other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression in line with its rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter)., We will continue to coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements for military and defense equipment with an immediate focus on providing Ukraine with air defense systems and capabilities., We also reiterate our strong condemnation of Russia’s continued seizure and militarisation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and the willful destabilisation of its operations. We support the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) efforts to establish a Safety and Security Zone., Russia’s war of aggression must end. To date, we have not seen evidence that Russia is committed to sustainable peace efforts. Russia can end this war immediately by ceasing its attacks against Ukraine and completely and unconditionally withdrawing its forces from the territory of Ukraine. We welcome and support President Zelenskyy’s initiative for a just peace., We remain committed to our unprecedented coordinated sanctions measures in response to Russia’s war of aggression. We will maintain and intensify economic pressure on Russia and those who evade and undermine our restrictive measures. We will continue to shield vulnerable countries that are severely impacted by the repercussions of Russia’s war of aggression and its weaponisation of energy and food., We reaffirm our intention to phase out Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products from our domestic markets. During the week of 5 December 2022, the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil entered into force in our respective jurisdictions, delivering on our commitment to limit Russia from profiting from its war of aggression against Ukraine, to support stability in global energy markets and to minimise negative economic spillovers of Russia’s war of aggression, especially on low- and middle-income countries. We encourage third countries that seek to import seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products to leverage the price cap. We reiterate our decision that the price cap on Russian origin petroleum products will enter into force on 5 February 2023., Russia's war in Ukraine is exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy, with direct impacts on the cost of living of people in our own countries, and on the world's most vulnerable. We will continue to use all available policy tools to maintain global financial, macroeconomic and price stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, while providing targeted support to those most in need and working collaboratively to strengthen our collective economic security to external shocks and wider risks. We will make public investments and structural reforms to promote long term growth. We will further coordinate to respond to the urgent needs of most vulnerable countries and will encourage private investment in developing and emerging markets as a key enabler of sustainable economic pathways., We will keep up our ambition to address global food insecurity, including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS). We will keep supporting the delivery of grain and fertilisers to vulnerable countries in need and welcome the recent operations led by the World Food Programme (WFP) on this front. We welcome the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) alongside further efforts to bring Ukrainian food to the world, namely the European Union’s Solidarity Lanes and the Grain from Ukraine Initiative., Reaffirming our steadfast commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and the outcomes of COP26 and COP27, we commit to urgent, ambitious, and inclusive climate action in this decade to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We reaffirm our commitment to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050. To that end, and building on our statement adopted in June in Elmau, we endorse the Climate Club’s terms of reference as established by the Climate Club Task Force and hereby establish an open and cooperative international Climate Club. Focusing in particular on the decarbonisation of industries, we will thereby contribute to unlocking green growth. We invite international partners to join the Climate Club and to participate in the further elaboration of its concept and structure. In doing so, we will continue working closely together with relevant International Organisations and stakeholders. We ask the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in tandem with the International Energy Agency (IEA), to host an interim secretariat working together with other International Organisations., Recalling our commitment to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, we will work intensively towards a successful outcome at Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15, in particular the adoption of an ambitious and effective global biodiversity framework, with clear and measurable targets and its prompt and swift implementation. In this regard we are committed to mobilising resources from all sources and to substantially increasing our national and international funding for nature by 2025 to support the implementation of an ambitious global framework. We encourage countries beyond the G7 to join us in this endeavor., Accelerating our contributions to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to make our global partners a better offer on sustainable, inclusive, climate-resilient, and quality infrastructure investment, we welcome the progress on the Just Energy Transitions Partnerships (JETP) with South Africa and Indonesia as flagship projects for multilateral cooperation, just energy transition and sustainable investment and look forward to swiftly concluding negotiations on a JETP with Vietnam, as well as to making further progress with India and Senegal. We will intensify our cooperation within a PGII working group to deliver on our joint ambition to mobilise up to 600 billion dollars by 2027, and on JETPs, we will coordinate through the JETP working group., Reaffirming our full commitment to realise gender equality and to consistently mainstream gender equality into all policy areas, we welcome the key recommendations by the Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and look forward to receiving the GEAC’s full report by the end of the year. We thank this year’s GEAC for its important work, reiterate our intention to convene the GEAC as a standing feature of all G7 Presidencies, and look forward to further strengthening it., This year, we have achieved progress to improve the global health architecture with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, our capacity to prevent, prepare for and respond to future global health emergencies and to achieve universal health coverage, especially through the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness endorsed in Elmau. We welcome the successful Seventh Replenishment of the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). We will step up our efforts on training and qualifying health workforce as well as strengthening surveillance capacities to detect outbreaks and variants as early as possible by integrating the One Health approach. We will continue to support science to develop safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics., Under the German Presidency, we, the G7, together with other international partners, have demonstrated our resolve to jointly addressing both major systemic challenges and immediate crises of our time. Our commitments and actions pave the way for progress towards an equitable world. As we look to the 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima under the Japanese Presidency, and in our support to the Indian G20 Presidency, we stand strong, united and absolutely committed to rebuilding a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for all.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/g7-leaders-statement-12-december-2022

Targeting of Ukraine energy infrastructure may provoke second wave of refugee crisis,News and Press Release,IRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",13 Dec 2022,"CARE warned today that the severe winter weather and ongoing deliberate attacks on civilian energy infrastructure in Ukraine threaten to kick off a second refugee crisis, as millions of Ukrainians face the prospect of having to face Ukraine’s worst winter in thirty years without heat or electricity., Nearly nine months into the conflict, approximately 7.9 million Ukrainians have already sought refuge in neighboring countries – some for the second time this year. In the early stages of the conflict, more than 4.7 million people had crossed the border into Poland alone. Now, with winter temperatures reaching as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit, millions of Ukrainians living in damaged housing and temporary shelters, could be facing a death sentence., “Attacks against electricity and heating infrastructure throughout Ukraine are abhorrent. These continued and calculated attempts to freeze Ukraine quite literally, as it faces what could be its worst winter in decades, must end,” said Michelle Nunn, CARE CEO., “Already, these attacks have left an estimated 14.4 million Ukrainians with no choice but to leave their homes as they face plunging temperatures – threatening a second refugee crisis over the coming weeks and months. The world must do everything in its power to ensure that winter doesn’t mean a death sentence for millions of Ukrainians,” Nunn added., For its part, CARE is already providing families and individuals with warm clothes, fuel, and cash to help people prepare for the winter – while in Poland, Romania and other neighboring countries, CARE is working with partners to prepare for a new wave of refugees to come across the borders., Similarly, CARE has also launched the “Ukraine Second Wave Fund,” where contributions can be made to support our efforts to continue delivering life-saving aid and long-term recovery assistance – both in Ukraine and the many countries experiencing the secondary impacts of the conflict., For media inquiries, please contact Anisa Husain, CARE Press Officer, Anisa.Husain@care.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/targeting-ukraine-energy-infrastructure-may-provoke-second-wave-refugee-crisis
"Scale of Destruction across Ukraine Will Require Strong International Support Going Far beyond Humanitarian Aid, Secretary-General Tells Conference",News and Press Release,UN SG,Protection and Human Rights,13 Dec 2022,"SG/SM/21628, Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message for the international conference on Ukraine, in Paris today:, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the Governments of France and Ukraine for hosting this international conference to support Ukraine’s civilian resilience., The war in Ukraine is a relentless humanitarian nightmare. It is getting worse as the days pass and the temperature drops. Civilians are paying an especially heavy price during the winter season, particularly people living on the front lines and those cut off from heat, water and essential services., Every major Ukrainian power plant and electricity transmission system has suffered damage due to Russian bombing. Power, water and heating engineers are working around the clock to repair the energy infrastructure., But today, 10 million consumers — including families, businesses, hospitals and schools — are without electricity, and millions are cut off from water and heat. The severe destruction to homes, livelihoods and critical infrastructure will take years to rebuild., Over the past few months, humanitarians have provided more than 630,000 civilians with direct winter assistance, and 400 generators have been distributed to critical facilities. Thousands more are being procured or have already been dispatched to Ukraine from abroad. But all of this is a drop in the bucket., The scale of destruction across the country requires strong support from the international community — going far beyond humanitarian aid., We must invest in Ukraine’s resilient recovery and reconstruction to prevent the current crisis from cascading into poverty, hunger and destitution for millions of Ukrainians.

IRC Statement on the International Donor Conference for Ukraine,News and Press Release,IRC,Humanitarian Financing,13 Dec 2022,"December 13, 2022 — Statement by Michael Despines, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) Regional Director for the Ukraine Crisis on the international donor conference “Solidarity with the Ukrainian people,” hosted in Paris on 13 December:, Warsaw, Poland, December 13, 2022 - “The announcement of nearly $1 billion of new funding to meet serious needs in Ukraine through the rebuilding of critical health, food, water, transportation, energy infrastructure will help Ukrainians contend with plummeting temperatures and worsening humanitarian needs this winter. People are forced to live in damaged homes, without insulation or heating, or in buildings which cannot protect them from harsh winter conditions. What Ukrainians need right now is warmth and safety., “Our teams on the ground report that power cuts due to attacks on civilian infrastructure and the power grid are hampering aid delivery. The past few days, our staff in Odesa have experienced first-hand the disastrous impact of power and heating cuts resulting from continued attacks. Amidst these challenging circumstances, we are committed to stay and deliver., “Robust international support has prevented the worst case scenario from occurring in Ukraine, but that will only remain true as long as donors continue to adequately support the humanitarian response. Donors who pledged in Paris today need to ensure that new funding has a people-centred approach at its core, and guarantee that financial support goes directly to NGOs, local civil society and women-led organisations operating on the frontlines of the Ukraine response., “This rapid convening of donors, including from new sources, demonstrates what the international community can accomplish when there is sufficient will. We call on donors to robustly support humanitarian responses around the world as generously.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/irc-statement-international-donor-conference-ukraine
Update 136 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (13 Dec 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,13 Dec 2022,"Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal have agreed that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will establish a continuous presence of nuclear safety and security experts at all of the country’s nuclear power plants as part of stepped-up efforts to help prevent a nuclear accident during the current armed conflict., During a two-hour meeting in Paris that ended early on Tuesday morning, Director General Grossi said he and Prime Minister Shmyhal also made progress in ongoing discussions about setting up a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), where the IAEA deployed a permanent expert mission more than three months ago. Ukraine’s Energy Minister, Herman Haluschenko, also participated in the meeting., “While we are not yet there and more work is required, I’m increasingly optimistic that such a zone – which is of paramount importance – will be agreed and implemented in the near future,” Director General Grossi said after the talks. “I will continue my high-level consultations in the coming days – both with Ukraine and Russia – with the clear aim to get this done as soon as possible. We can’t afford to lose more time.”, The IAEA Director General was in Paris to attend an international conference on Ukraine – “Solidaires du peuple ukrainien” – hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been actively supporting Director General Grossi’s efforts in Ukraine., At the request of Ukraine, the IAEA has over the past month dispatched week-long nuclear safety and security missions to the three other operational nuclear power plants in Ukraine – Khmelnytskyy, Rivne and South Ukraine – as well as to Chornobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear accident., As agreed by Director General Grossi and Prime Minister Shmyhal during their meeting in Paris, the IAEA will press ahead with plans to establish a continued Agency presence at the four sites., “Our mission at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant has shown the vital importance of the IAEA being there to monitor the situation and give technical advice. Thanks to this presence, the IAEA is providing the world with impartial, technical and factual information about developments on the ground,” Director General Grossi said., “We have now agreed with the Government of Ukraine to further expand and strengthen the IAEA’s nuclear safety and security role in the country. This is especially important at a time when Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is facing unprecedented challenges as a result of the war and in the middle of the winter,” he said., In a new development underlining such difficulties, the IAEA team at the ZNPP today reported that the plant had lost its connection to the 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power line to the electricity grid. It was not immediately clear what had caused the disconnection. The ZNPP – Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – continues to receive the electricity it needs for essential safety and security functions from a 750 kV main external power line., The IAEA team at the ZNPP today was informed that work continues at the plant for the testing and setting in operation of mobile diesel-fuelled boilers which are intended to prevent the critical ZNPP systems from freezing during the winter, including heating of working environment for the ZNPP personnel. Mobile diesel-fuelled boilers with power in the range of 1-3 MW were installed and are currently in operation at one of the Units, with several more being deployed at other locations on the site., ZNPP has 20 fixed emergency diesel generators in stand-by mode and ready to provide electricity if all off-site electrical power is not available. However, to increase the ability to cope with such loss of off-site power, mobile diesel generators are currently being deployed as well, as a precautionary measure. Two such mobile generators are already connected to one Unit and are in stand-by mode. A few other mobile generators are to be tested and will be connected to other reactor Units.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-136-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-13-dec-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",13 Dec 2022,"“Winter is well underway in Ukraine, with the country expected to face one of its most difficult winters ever. Temperatures across Ukraine are now plummeting well below freezing; many parents are struggling to keep their children warm with no electricity, heating, or running water amidst constant power outages and ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure. We have heard numerous reports of families who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning due to running liquid gas generators or solid fuel stoves inside their homes just to save themselves from freezing in the dark., “Our teams are distributing blankets, warm clothes, solid fuel, and heaters to vulnerable families across Ukraine and providing hospitals and schools with generators and individual heating systems. But children and families will still feel the bitter cold this winter as long as attacks on energy infrastructure continue. Lasting blackouts could trigger another wave of massive displacement, setting tens of thousands of families astray. Civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times.

Supporting capacity building in Ukrainian hospitals: Polish Medical Mission organizes shipments of medical equipment funded by the Financial Mechanism of European Economic Area and the Norwegian Financial Mechanism,News and Press Release,PMM,"Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",13 Dec 2022,"By Rowan Joffe Mclachlan:, Polish Medical Mission (PMM) completed custom deliveries of medical equipment for 50 Hospitals across 22 Oblasts of Ukraine on the 6th of December. Over the course of the 6-month project and thanks to funding from Norwegian Funds, PMM was able to support the hospitals in their provision of an average of 255,600 patients a month with lifesaving medical care. The total project value was 1,000,000 EUR., After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine the healthcare system across Ukraine was under intense pressure, with a massive increase in both war wounded and IDP’s placing all oblasts under strain. This necessitated the increase in capacity for hospitals across the country., In June of this year, PMM began the process of selection and contact of hospitals that PMM could access and support. PMM identified the 50 hospitals most in critical need of support that were accessible for delivery. After establishing contact with hospitals, PMM established the lists of items that they most needed in order to support their activities. This was facilitated with the development of custom order sorting software in cooperation with Qualtrics. Each individual hospital was directed to order a custom shipment to support their specific needs and activities. These items were then bought on the Polish commercial market and delivered directly to hospitals., The equipment included sophisticated equipment such as cardio monitors, autoclaves, electro suctions, USG’s and centrifuges for surgical and ICU departments. In addition, significant quantities of surgical tools were purchased and distributed as well a wide variety of minor pieces of equipment necessary for the day-to-day operations of the medical departments. Also delivered were a number of incubators to neonatal wards across the country, PMM can already report that those incubators have already supported the birth and care of over 1,000 newborns., Alongside these medical machines was delivered a large number of essential consumables; surgical masks, gowns, disinfectant and also common medications that were provided by our in-kind donors., The distribution of these goods was at times challenging given the security situation in Ukraine and the damage to infrastructure and PMM is indebted to our partners, both NGO and commercial. The Ukrainian NGO UNITERS supported over 40 deliveries to hard-to-reach areas of the country, allowing our aid to reach the points where it was needed most. Meanwhile, in Poland the commercial logistics firm ROBANO Express Thermo Logistics shared both their warehouse space, delivery drivers and significant expertise to allow a very effective collaboration. Combined with PMM’s dedicated logistic team it was possible to build a monitored and accountable chain of distribution that stretched from suppliers to beneficiary hospitals., Since the close of the project PMM has already began conducting new shipments of medical equipment to both hospitals already supported and newly identified ones. Building on the networks and systems established during this project PMM will be able to continue our support of Ukrainian hospitals into 2023.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/supporting-capacity-building-ukrainian-hospitals-polish-medical-mission-organizes-shipments-medical-equipment-funded-financial-mechanism-european-economic-area-and-norwegian-financial-mechanism
Ukraine: Apparent Cluster Munitions Hit Kherson [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Mine Action,13 Dec 2022,"Days After Leaving, Russian Forces Fired on City, Wounding Civilians, (Kyiv, December 13, 2022) – Russian forces have apparently used cluster munitions on civilian populated areas of Kherson at least three times since they retreated from the city, Human Rights Watch said today. These were part of a series of attacks on the city that resulted in civilian casualties., “Residents of Kherson survived eight months of Russian occupation, and are finally free from fear of torture, only to be subjected to new indiscriminate attacks, apparently including cluster munitions,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch., Since November 11, when Ukrainian forces reclaimed the city, Russia has attacked Kherson from across the Dnieper River. As of November 25, the attacks killed at least 15 residents, including a child, and wounded 35, said the head of Kherson’s city council, Halyna Luhova. These attacks have led many civilians to evacuate the city, including patients at Kherson’s Clinical Hospital., Human Rights Watch researchers were in Kherson city from November 20 to 24. Over those five days, attacks on the city intensified., At around 12:30 p.m. on November 21, an apparent cluster munition strike wounded three people as they were walking down the street in a populated area. A 29-year-old man said he was on a bus pulling up to Universytets'ka Street in the Dniprovs'kyi district, directly north of the Dnieper River, when he heard several explosions. He got off and saw a woman lying in a pool of blood on the sidewalk. Her left foot had been blown off, leaving the bone exposed. A man whose feet had been blown off was dragging himself from a patch of grass toward the sidewalk. The witness said he had not seen any military forces as he approached the area. Andriy Dubchak, a photojournalist, arrived just minutes later and described the same scene. He said he saw military paramedics and police arriving to take the casualties to the hospital, but no other military presence in the area., Human Rights Watch researchers visited the site on November 22 and saw pools of blood from both victims. They identified three munition impact sites, one in the grass, another next to the pool of blood on the sidewalk, and the third in front of a nearby shop, fragmentation patterns on the sidewalk were consistent with that of a submunition detonation, and the remnant of what appeared to be a white-colored submunition stabilizer ribbon next to the fragmentation pattern. All of these findings are consistent with cluster munitions. They also indicate that the munitions were fired from the south., Another three detonations occurred around the same time approximately 400 meters away. Anatoli, a security guard at a nearby car repair garage who did not share his surname, said that a woman was injured in her chest and left arm: “I rushed out of the garage after the explosion and saw her lying on the ground. Underneath her jacket, it looked like porridge.”, Anatoli and his colleague showed researchers the site of another detonation, in the garage yard, and a third in the yard of a group of high-rise apartment buildings across the street. They said they had heard between 6 and 7 distinct explosions in quick succession. Another white-colored stabilizer ribbon was next to the detonation in the apartment yard, and the fragmentation patterns there and on the sidewalk where the woman was injured were also consistent with those of a cluster submunition. The evidence suggests they were also fired from the south. Researchers were unable to confirm whether the three victims survived., The concentration of the impact sites, the presence of the stabilizer ribbons next to two of the impact sites, and the direction of the fragmentation patterns, together with the witnesses’ descriptions of the attacks, indicate that the attack used cluster munitions., Researchers spoke to a Ukrainian soldier in Bilozerka village, 9 kilometers west of Kherson, where an attack on November 19 hit an aid distribution line, wounding at least eight civilians, according to authorities. The soldier, who asked for anonymity, said that there was a military presence in the village, but not at the aid point. He was off duty and was walking to the nearby market when he heard multiple explosions in quick succession next to a long line of civilians waiting for food and water at the distribution point. He said he saw eight wounded civilians and a soldier. He described finding small pre-formed metal fragments, like those found inside cluster munitions, on the ground after the attack. Researchers were unable to visit the area because of ongoing attacks., Serhii Kindra, 42, stayed in Kherson with his family throughout the occupation. He said that on November 22 at around 11 a.m., he was driving his sons – Timofy, 10, and Matviy, 13 – home from church on a main road near Antonivska Bridge, just north of the river, when he heard a series of explosions in quick succession, including one near the back of the car, one at the front, and one on the right side. The explosions sent glass and metal fragments into the car., “When I turned around, I saw Matviy lying on top of Timofy,” Kindra said. “[Matviy] had major injuries on his head, stomach, legs, and arms. We rushed him to a nearby checkpoint and from there to the hospital. The doctors tried to close the wounds in his stomach and liver. He fought for his life for 10 hours. During that time, his heart stopped twice but the doctors were able to bring him back. He was a real fighter, a real hero.”, Kindra and Timofy were also injured, with cuts on their faces and arms. Kindra needed stitches on his nose and forehead, and doctors removed a small metal fragment from Timofy’s back. Researchers interviewed two journalists who met Kindra and his sons at the hospital and confirmed the nature of their injuries., Researchers took that same road earlier that day and saw no fixed military presence in the vicinity besides the checkpoint. Kindra shared photographs of the damage to his car, and of his and his sons’ injuries. The damage to the car body and windows was caused by the impact of numerous uniformly sized metal fragments created by the detonation of ground-fired fragmentation submunitions., Researchers were not able to determine whether all the attacks in which civilians were killed involved cluster munitions. On November 22, a 13-year-old boy was injured, according to two people who arrived at the boy’s home just after the attack. They said the boy had been injured by an explosive munition just before 4 p.m. in the yard outside his home, in a residential neighborhood on the road out of the city toward Mykolaiv. Both said they did not see any military forces in the area at the time, which researchers were unable to confirm. They visited the boy later in the hospital after his arm had been amputated. They were unsure what munition was used in the attack., Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have repeatedly used cluster munitions, which are inherently indiscriminate weapons, in attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians and damaged homes, hospitals, and schools. Cluster munitions typically explode in the air and send dozens, even hundreds, of small submunitions over an area the size of a football field. Explosive submunitions often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines. Cluster munitions are banned by an international treaty, which neither Russia nor Ukraine has joined. Regardless, the use of cluster munitions in areas with civilians makes an attack indiscriminate in violation of international humanitarian law., Researchers saw some limited military presence in the city of Kherson, but the majority of forces they saw in the city were police carrying out law enforcement duties., Notwithstanding the existence of a legitimate military target, an attack is indiscriminate and unlawful if it uses a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited to military objects. Given the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians, their use in Kherson might constitute a war crime and should be investigated., “These attacks are being carried out with no apparent regard for civilian life,” Wille said. “They are a direct rebuke to claims by Russia that it is only targeting the military.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-apparent-cluster-munitions-hit-kherson-enruuk

Ukraine: Reclaimed territories reveal a health care system in ruins,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",9 Dec 2022,"Voices from MSF patients and staff on the devastating effects of war, As Ukraine takes back territories in Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts that have been devastated by war, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are witnessing the grave medical and humanitarian needs. People have gone without health care and medicines for over nine months and health care structures and pharmacies remain badly damaged. ​Elderly people are especially impacted by this, as well as people in need of medicines for non-communicable diseases and chronic conditions. Many people have endured months of extremely difficult conditions and fear for their lives and now suffer from stress, anxiety, and other mental health problems. ​, MSF teams have been working in areas of Kherson oblast since June. We are operating mobile clinics focused on basic health care, treatment for non-communicable diseases, and mental health. MSF ambulances also transfer patients to hospitals and between medical facilities around Kryvyi Rih and in the areas of the Kherson oblast that are under Ukrainian control. Apart from Ukrainian state actors and volunteers, there remain very few international organizations on the ground in recently re-taken areas of Kherson and Mykolaiv. ​, Below are stories from MSF patients and staff who have endured tremendous challenges to continue living and working through many months of fighting., “My husband and I lived under occupation for two months. When the Russians started letting people out, we left the town on foot. More than 600 people left Vysokopillia on Easter., When we tried to leave the town for the first time, there was horrible shelling. We had to drop to the ground a hundred times. I hurt my arm. Houses were exploding all around us."", When we learned that Vysokopillia had been liberated on October 4, we decided to go back home. On October 15, my husband became paralyzed, probably because of stress., I worry a lot. We have no one to ask for help. There is no light in the town, and every evening my husband needs an injection of magnesium. I'm in despair, I'm crying, I can't do anything., We called a hospital in the city of Kryvyi Rih. The doctors say it is very far away for my husband to be transported there, since he is in a severe condition., I put an IV in him and give him medicine at home. I came [to MSF's mobile clinic] to get him medicine. I spoke with your psychologist last time. It helped me so much!”, “I have lived in the city of Lyman for the past two years. That city had everything I needed: nature, parks, a river, blue lakes, a forest full of mushrooms and berries. I bought a house there. On February 22, I made the last payment. I lived on the outskirts of Lyman. In March, when they started shelling about 50 meters away from my house, I told my family that we had to leave. I never returned to Lyman again., We moved to Dnipro and in September I started working with MSF as an emergency room doctor and also support the MSF mobile clinics. Several people who approached us had previously had surgical operations and were constantly in pain. They have no paramedic, no doctor, no pharmacy nearby., We met one man who needed dressing for his wound, but he didn't have anything. He had no disinfectant solutions, no antiseptics, no dressing materials. He just washed and reused the dressing., I recently met a doctor who was a pediatrician all her life. Because of the war, she had to become a cardiologist, a therapist, a traumatologist, a resuscitator... this is very scary.”, “On May 5, at three in the morning, we ran for safety to the village of Mykolaivka, where volunteers found housing for us. My children are still living there but my husband and I decided to go back home. It took us years to acquire what we have. If we leave our house, everything that’s left will be gone., We don't have our animals anymore.This spring we planted vegetables under fire. We hoped for the best, but we have nothing. The roof and windows of our house are damaged; we have had to cover them. There is no electricity or gas in the village. We have stoves, so we heat the house with firewood., We want our children to come back. But they study online now and there is no electricity in the village. I have five children. One of my sons lives in the village of Korobky, in Kakhovka district [controlled by Russian military]. We are very worried about him and his family. We don't know what's going on there and we can't get in touch with them.”, “My husband and I stayed in Ivanivka for three months. Our children who live in the city of Kryvyi Rih kept asking us to leave the village. I don't sleep well; my hands are shaking. They shelled us so badly every day that it became a usual thing for us. During one shelling I realized that my husband could make it to the basement, and I couldn’t. The shelling was so close, that it felt as if hail was hitting the roof. One of our cows was killed and another one was injured., It took us 35 years to build our house, and now it is destroyed. A shell hit between the hall and the veranda, and the ceiling fell on the freezer. We have only two bedrooms now. We swept a little and covered the windows with plastic sheeting. When you go outside and look around, you can only see a pile of garbage and nothing else., There was a Russian doctor in the village. People with serious conditions had to turn to him. There were people with cancer here, and there was no way for them to get their medicine. People were scared but they asked that doctor for help.”, “I have been seeing this [conflict] since 2014, although back then they didn’t use such heavy weapons. I had to move twice due to the situation. In 2020, I was living in Kramatorsk with my family but the front line came very close, so my wife and I decided to leave the city with our two children., I was one of the first to join MSF’s project in the city of Kryvyi Rih in April. During our trips, I see terrible things that should never have happened. We meet a lot of people whose houses were hit by a missile, as well as those who lived under occupation for five or six months. People told us that they lived without food, water, or medicine.”, “Russian troops entered Snihurivka on March 19. I stayed in the town until August 15. In the end, there were just a few doctors in the hospital: me, an obstetrician-gynecologist intern, an ultrasound doctor, a trauma specialist, a therapist, an addiction physician, a psychiatrist, and a dentist. We had no surgeons at all. People with shrapnel injuries were brought to the hospital every day. We helped them., We ran out of medical supplies. I had to go to the Russians and tell them that we had nothing to treat people with. For example, we did not have urethral catheters which, are needed for people with serious injuries who are being treated in intensive care and cannot get up. We had to soak these catheters in special solutions and then reuse them. We didn't even have urine collection bags and used bottles instead., There was also a pressing need for medicines for people with diabetes and high blood pressure. Most of the people who stayed behind were elderly and had chronic diseases. Pharmacies were destroyed., Once the Russians told us, ‘Write down the list of medicines, we will give you everything.’ I must have given them those lists 10 times. The list consisted of 86 items, and they gave us only 16 things— bandages, gauze, plastic bedcovers, cannulas, syringes, and a few medications such as painkillers and anti-inflammatory pills. I asked them, ‘How can I treat hypertension or diabetes with these?’"", “Some 400 people previously lived in the village. During the occupation, only about 50 stayed here. We haven't had light or gas since March. Many people have nowhere to come back to because a lot of houses burned down., Our village was often shelled. I had to put out the fire in my house two or three times. The fields that we had sowed burned. All the wheat burned. Many animals were killed. My cow, a sheep, and a pig were badly hurt and I had to put them down. I’m a veterinarian. I knew that they were suffering."", “A few of us kept working in the hospital, but we became very close; we were united. We knew that no matter how scary it was, we had to help people. I have been living in the hospital since March 21., Nurses worked in shifts. Shrapnel injuries, fractures, cuts—this is what we had to deal with. There were a lot of hungry dogs left behind in the town. They attacked people, so we also had patients with bites.”, “On February 24, I was at work. A lot of wounded people came in. At the same time, many doctors were leaving the city, so there was not enough staff. In Novodruzhivka [a town near Lysychansk], people were lining up for water when there was an attack. I had to send three or four ambulance teams to Novodruzhivka that day. Lysychansk was occupied in June. Two weeks earlier, I left it through Russia. Then I immediately travelled to Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—and then back to Ukraine, all over three days., In August, I started working for MSF—first in the east of Ukraine, and now in the south. We go to hospitals in Kherson to pick up the wounded and take them to the hospital in Kryvyi Rih. A few weeks ago, the city of Zelenodolsk was shelled. Many people were wounded waiting for a bus when the shelling began.”, “We work in hospitals, outpatient clinics or just on the streets. Most often, people suffer from anxiety, tension, poor sleep, and nervousness. We take a standardized approach. First, we talk to people about mental health and how to maintain it; we explain coping mechanisms to them and how to restore them. We use different methods from different areas of psychology., Oksana Khodorkovska is a psychologist working with MSF in Kherson., One man had a concussion. He came to me and said, ‘I don't believe in your psychology! But I feel bad. Maybe you can help me.’, We drew together, did breathing exercises and many other things. After the first time he felt better. I thought that was it, but he came one more time and said, ""It made me feel better. I want more.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-reclaimed-territories-reveal-health-care-system-ruins
"CARE Condemns Targeting of Ukraine Energy Infrastructure. Warns – Winter, War Threaten Second Ukraine Refugee Crisis",News and Press Release,CARE,Shelter and Non-Food Items,12 Dec 2022,"Atlanta– CARE warned today that the severe winter weather and ongoing deliberate attacks on civilian energy infrastructure in Ukraine threaten to kick off a second refugee crisis, as millions of Ukrainians face the prospect of having to face Ukraine’s worst winter in thirty years without heat or electricity., Nearly nine months into the conflict, approximately 7.9 million Ukrainians have already sought refuge in neighboring countries – some for the second time this year. In the early stages of the conflict, more than 4.7 million people had crossed the border into Poland alone. Now, with winter temperatures reaching as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit, millions of Ukrainians living in damaged housing and temporary shelters, could be facing a death sentence., “Attacks against electricity and heating infrastructure throughout Ukraine are abhorrent. These continued and calculated attempts to freeze Ukraine quite literally, as it faces what could be its worst winter in decades, must end,” said Michelle Nunn, CARE CEO., “Already, these attacks have left an estimated 14.4 million Ukrainians with no choice but to leave their homes as they face plunging temperatures – threatening a second refugee crisis over the coming weeks and months. The world must do everything in its power to ensure that winter doesn’t mean a death sentence for millions of Ukrainians,” Nunn added., For its part, CARE is already providing families and individuals with warm clothes, fuel, and cash to help people prepare for the winter – while in Poland, Romania and other neighboring countries, CARE is working with partners to prepare for a new wave of refugees to come across the borders., Similarly, CARE has also launched the “Ukraine Second Wave Fund,” where contributions can be made to support our efforts to continue delivering life-saving aid and long-term recovery assistance – both in Ukraine and the many countries experiencing the secondary impacts of the conflict., Learn more about CARE’s work in Ukraine and how you can help here., For more information please contact:, Anisa Husain

Water Sanitation Hygiene",12 Dec 2022,"Singapore, 12 December 2022 – To support vulnerable Ukrainian communities facing a harsh winter, the Singapore Red Cross is supporting various humanitarian initiatives. Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General/CEO, Singapore Red Cross (SRC) said, “As the conflict continues into winter, many Ukrainians have found themselves cut off from power sources and without electricity or power. We are working closely with donors and ground partners to support meaningful projects that will both bring some immediate relief, as well as have lasting impact.”, Lighthouses; Singapore-designed Homes, To support Ukrainian communities this winter, SRC is contributing towards the rebuilding of homes and the powering of ‘lighthouses’ with generators. “Lighthouses” are warming points for people to come to keep warm, charge their communication and medical devices, and also serve as a care centre where vulnerable groups can have access to clean water, food packs and other basic necessities. Together with our partners, SRC will be supporting the purchase of six power generators and the associated fuel costs to keep the generators running. These generators are able to provide power and electricity for 750 people per day., SRC is also supporting the construction of 10 modular houses that can withstand winter and other shocks, designed by Singaporean architects, and will continue to support single mothers, the elderly, and other vulnerable communities with daily necessities such as food and diapers., Medical Equipping, Hospitals in Ukraine remain active in rendering health services to communities. However, many have suffered substantial damage and require assistance in continuing their services. Aside from the «Okhmatdyt» National Specialised Children’s Hospital, SRC has provided medical equipment and supplies such as an x-ray table, a shockwave physiotherapy device, and various medical supplies to other medical facilities in Odesa, Kyiv, and Uzhhorod., To assist with the mobility and delivery of medical services to communities who may not have access to healthcare facilities, SRC has procured one mobile medical clinic unit furnished with three expandable rooms for the Mykolaiv Regional Branch of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. The unit consists of an observation room, pharmacy, laboratory, and emergency room capable of doing minor surgeries. A portable x-ray machine is also available in the mobile medical clinic. Since July 2022, the clinic has been deployed daily in Mykolaiv City and Mykolaiv Oblast, providing primary medical treatments to between 300 to 400 residents or internally displaced persons (IDPs). To supplement the mobile medical clinic, 10 ambulances were procured to increase the mobility of healthcare services by the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. Over the past 2 months, these ambulances have been used for about 250 medical transportations, including medical evacuation and transportation of patients to specialised hospitals., In addition, SRC is supporting mobile health groups who engage the communities in medical services, including the provision of equipment such as one ultrasound diagnostic machine, seven portable ultrasound diagnostic machines, and five ventilators., Water & Sanitation, As displaced communities began to return to Ukraine, there has been an increased need for clean water and emergency filtration systems. Many of the infrastructure providing water to communities have been destroyed. SRC has provided two aquablock systems and two ROAMfilter systems to communities in Ukraine. SRC has also assisted with the coordination of a further 8 aquablock donations. AquaBlock is a community drinking water system that produces 1,500 litres of water per hour to support the daily requirements of up to 10,000 people, while the ROAMfilter systems are portable manual filtration systems able to produce over 200 litres of water per hour without the need for electricity. SRC is also in the midst of procuring further water filtration systems for communities in Ukraine., Volunteers trained in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) also conducted training for Polish and Ukrainian volunteers on the basics of WASH and the proper usage of the filtration systems., Besides providing access to clean water to communities in Ukraine, SRC is also working with several volunteer-led groups to provide care packs containing hygiene items, baby kits and other essential items for mothers and new-born babies, the elderly, children and other vulnerable groups in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/singapore-red-cross-supports-communities-facing-harsh-winter-ukraine

Direct Relief Awards $1 Million Grant to Unbroken National Rehabilitation Center in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Dec 2022,"By Tony Morain, Direct Relief, Lviv, Ukraine — Direct Relief announced a $1 million grant to the Unbroken National Rehabilitation Center, the largest facility of its kind in Ukraine. The grant will enable the center to procure critically needed rehabilitation equipment and provide training to center personnel, helping to improve the quality of care and support provided to patients injured by war., During the full-scale invasion, more than 7,000 wounded citizens received help at the Unbroken Center, including military, civilians, adults, and children., “We are very grateful to Direct Relief for the support of unbroken Ukrainians,” said Oleg Samchuk, General Director of the First Lviv Medical Union. “With this funding, we will get even more opportunities for the treatment and rehabilitation of our people. I hope that our cooperation, at the heart of which is helping people, will be extended.”, The World Health Organization estimates that 14.5 million people in Ukraine need health assistance, while more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have suffered injuries since the war began, according to the United Nations. While many of the injured will require long-term rehabilitative care, Ukraine’s healthcare infrastructure is severely diminished, with more than 600 medical facilities destroyed in the fighting., “Ukraine is facing multiple challenges that extend beyond the battlefield, including those experienced by healthcare providers targeted by shelling and people injured in the fighting,” said Thomas Tighe, Direct Relief President and CEO. “We recognize that, for many, these injuries and trauma will last a lifetime, and that is why Direct Relief is committing substantial resources to supporting the important work of the Unbroken National Rehabilitation Center.”, Direct Relief, among the largest charitable providers of medicines to Ukraine in 2022, has delivered more than $640 million in medical aid totaling more than 1,000 tons to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and local healthcare providers., About Unbroken: Treatment of the war-affected Ukrainians takes place within the framework of the UNBROKEN National Rehabilitation Center. This is a unique place where adults and children affected by the war can receive comprehensive qualified medical care. It includes reconstructive surgery, orthopedics, and robotic prosthetics. Here, prostheses are not only fitted but also manufactured. In addition, the Center provides physical, psychological, and psychosocial rehabilitation of injured military and civilians.

"Research Methodology Note: REACH Collective Site Monitoring, UKR2207b Ukraine (November 2022, V1)",Manual and Guideline,REACH,Camp Coordination and Camp Management,9 Dec 2022,"Excerpt, 2. Rationale, The CSM Round 5 will target households living in collective sites previously mapped by REACH and CCCM cluster partners. The Master List (ML) currently includes 7,234 collective sites, of which approximately 3,500 are actively hosting IDPs. The total population living in collective sites that are on the ML is around 99,000, as of 30 September 2022. Due to a combination of operational constraints and methodological considerations, it was decided to follow a quota sampling approach., The current master list is not exhaustive and does not contain all collective sites in the country., For many sites in the master list, information on current population is missing., Movement of people in and out of collective sites is too dynamic, meaning that for the sites where population is known, this information gets outdated quickly. Generating a sample based on this information is likely to result in field teams arriving at collective sites to find that the actual population is either significantly higher or lower than expected, rendering the sample’s randomization invalid., For some oblasts the master list contains very few sites, the real population of displaced HHs living in collective sites is not known, and generating a random sample across a handful of sites would have limited value in those locations due to homogeneity of respondents., Instead, a balanced but non-probability quota sample will be generated through the master list according to the following rules:, In oblasts (4 in total) with less than 1000 known population in the master list, a census approach will be adopted, in which a maximum of 200 HH interviews will be conducted. The 200 HH interviews will beassigned proportionally across the sites in the oblast ., In oblasts with population of more than 1,000 IDPs in collective sites (18 oblasts), a sample of 200 HH interviews will be conducted., The Shiny App sampling calculator will be used to randomly select collective sites within each oblast, and to assign the number of interviews per site based on the relative population of the sites. As sites are activated and de-activated on a month-to-month basis, and population data is subject to change, the field teams will be equipped with a map showing alternative sites in case they encounter a site that is no longer hosting IDPs., The CSM Household Level Tool will mirror the MSNA tool to a large extent. This is to enable the statistics for the Collective Site population to be compared to other population groups, and to ensure they are included in the MSNA analyses that will inform the revision of the Ukraine Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) next year. For this reason, the MSNA tool will be used as the basis for the CSM Household level tool, with adjustments in the phrasing and response options of questions to ensure they are relevant and appropriate for displaced populations living in collective sites. Additionally, a CCCM-specific module will be added to cover communal-living questions, site-management, protection, site-level and humanitarian needs., Interviews will be conducted F2F.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/research-methodology-note-reach-collective-site-monitoring-ukr2207b-ukraine-november-2022-v1
"Effective Arms-Control Measures Needed to Block Diversion of Ukraine Weapons, Senior United Nations Disarmament Official Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",9 Dec 2022,"SC/15136, 9216TH MEETING (PM), States must apply effective arms-control measures to prevent the diversion of weapons supplied to Ukraine, a senior United Nations official told the Security Council today, as some Council members defended their decision to continue providing military support to Kyiv while others detailed the danger of doing so., Izumi Nakamitsu, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said that the transfer of materiel to Ukraine by several States since the Russian Federation’s invasion on 24 February is a matter of public record. Information from Governments regarding transfers is largely accessible through open sources, she said, adding that there have also been widespread, independently verified reports of the transfer of conventional weapons to non-State armed groups involved in the conflict. The large-scale influx of weapons into any armed conflict raises many concerns for peace and security, including risks of diversion, potential spillover and escalation, she noted., Measures to counter arms diversions will be key to post-conflict recovery, regional security and stability, and preventing conflict in other regions, she continued. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, along with the Arms Trade Treaty, remain key tools to enhance transparency and track the influx of weapons and ammunition in conflict zones. Encouraging Member States to follow these widely accepted approaches, she also urged them to apply effective arms-control measures. The only way to end the suffering and devastation in Ukraine is by ending the war, she emphasized, appealing to all Member States to “make every effort for peace”., Daniel Kovalik, civil society organization representative, cited a report pointing out that the 2014 conflict in Ukraine led to the widespread proliferation of small arms, light weapons and ammunition, including to areas located far from the conflict zone. He also spotlighted several media articles that underscored the United States’ limited capacity to track and inspect the substantial supply of weaponry it has provided. “Who is watching the watchmen here?”, he wondered, noting that the United States will not provide international oversight over the billions in weapons it has sent to Ukraine. He urged the Council to live up to its responsibility and called for a negotiated end to the war., In the ensuing debate, several Council members said that their countries will continue to support Ukraine’s exercise of its right to defend itself, pointing out that it is the Russian Federation that is driving the flow of weapons into Ukraine. Others, however, stressed the need to prevent weapons supplied to Ukraine from inadvertently falling into the wrong hands, encouraging dialogue over proliferation and underscoring the importance of effective arms control., The Russian Federation’s representative said that his delegation requested today’s meeting to assess the impact of the ongoing influx of weapons into Ukraine on prospects for ending the conflict. Without Western assistance, military activities in Ukraine would have ended a long time ago, he said. Spotlighting the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine falling into the hands of terrorists and criminals, he said that the situation is so out of control that weapons destined for Kyiv are turning up on the black market in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He urged a sober assessment of the risks arising from the uncontrolled pumping of weapons to the Ukrainian regime., China’s representative recalled a statement from the High Representative in September about the risk of potential diversion of weapons, as well as a warning in June from the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) that weapons destined for Ukraine could end up on the black market or in the hands of criminals. Stressing that such situations have unfortunately materialized, he emphasized the need for a political solution to end the crisis, rather than a battlefield flooded with weapons which will prolong the conflict., France’s representative, taking a different view, urged those present not to “confuse the attacker and the attacked”, adding that the Russian Federation bears sole responsibility for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine. France is providing support to Ukraine so that Kyiv can exercise its legitimate right to self-defence and independence. If Moscow wishes the transfers it denounces today to cease, it must end its military operations in Ukraine, he said., Gabon’s representative urged the parties to stop both verbal and military escalation. “It is time to silence the weapons in Ukraine,” she said, as more weapons can only spell more death and destruction, and nobody can predict the destabilization and insecurity that might ensue with so many weapons circulating., Ukraine’s representative stated that the Russian Federation is again trying to legitimize its flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations by using the Council as a platform to circulate propaganda. Thanking those who have supported Ukraine, including by supplying modern weapons, he said that the liberation of the Kharkiv, Kherson and Luhansk regions demonstrates that all weapons in Ukraine’s possession are serving their intended purpose. Detailing the Government’s systematic arms-control efforts, he said that his country will continue to demonstrate transparency and cooperate fully with international export-control regimes., Also speaking were representatives of Norway, United Kingdom, Ghana, United Arab Emirates, Albania, Kenya, United States, Mexico, Brazil, Ireland and India., The meeting began at 4:11 p.m. and ended at 6:04 p.m., Briefings, IZUMI NAKAMITSU, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, [said](https://reliefweb.int/node/3915095 that, since the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, several States have transferred weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine’s defence forces. Recalling her statement to the Council in September, she said that this is a matter of public record and that information from Governments regarding their transfers is largely accessible through open sources. There have also been widespread, independently verified reports of the transfer of major conventional weapon systems to non-State armed groups involved in the conflict against Ukraine. The large-scale influx of weapons into any armed conflict situation raises many concerns for peace and security, including risks of diversion, potential spillover and escalation, she said. Measures to counter such diversion will be key to post-conflict recovery, to regional security and stability, and to preventing conflict in other regions, she added., Such measures include pre-transfer risk assessments and post-shipment controls, including on-site inspections and end-user verification, she continued. Equally important is the need to safeguard and account for transferred military equipment. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, along with the Arms Trade Treaty, remain key tools to enhance transparency in arms transfers and track the influx of weapons and ammunition in conflict zones. Encouraging Member States to follow these widely accepted approaches, she added that all parties to conflict have a duty to protect civilians when conducting military operations. Noting that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 17,181 civilian casualties since 24 February, she said that most of such deaths and injuries are caused by explosive weapons with wide areas of effect., She went on to say that since 2007, two Secretaries-General have expressed concern over the humanitarian impact of the use of such weapons in populated areas. Further, on 18 November, more than 80 States adopted a political declaration on protecting civilians from the humanitarian consequences of such use. That instrument marks a milestone in efforts to better protect civilians from the consequences of armed conflict, she said, calling on Member States to give effect to the same. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop, she emphasized, urging States to apply effective arms-control measures. The only way to end the suffering and devastation in Ukraine is by ending the war, she said, appealing to all Member States to “make every effort for peace”., DANIEL KOVALIK, civil society organization representative, noting that his background in human rights issues in Latin America, has included studying the movement of arms to military, paramilitary and right-wing groups in Colombia, shared with the Council what he learned about Ukraine and the overall danger of weapons ending up in the wrong hands. The Small Arms Survey’s 2021 report, he said, pointed out that the 2014 conflict in Ukraine led to the widespread proliferation of small arms, light weapons and ammunition — thousands of grenades, rockets, mortar rounds, landmines and firearms cartridges — including to areas located far from the conflict zone. As the barriers to smuggling such weapons out of Ukraine are hardly insurmountable, the report stressed that the prevention of a successful trafficking scheme and reduction of civilian casualties caused by loose ammunition will require a sustained effort by Ukrainian authorities and the international community for years to come, he said., He then spotlighted several media articles, including from CNN, The Guardian and The Washington Post, among others, which underscored the limited capacities of the United States to track and inspect the substantial supply of weaponry it has provided. Problems include a dependence on Ukraine for information, international concerns about weapons that will flood the international market once the conflict ends and the need to develop longer-term security plans. Offering some of his own observations from a week-long trip in Donetsk, he said that he witnessed Ukraine’s shelling of a school, a stadium and a water services site. Even when weapons go to the right people, they are not necessarily ending up in the right places, he said, adding that they have been used to attack civilians since 2014. He also referenced an article quoting the President of Nigeria as saying that the conflict has resulted in weapons and fighters streaming into the Lake Chad region. Weapons from Ukraine are already ending up in the hands of extremists, he said. “Who is watching the watchmen here?”, he wondered, noting that the United States will not provide international oversight over the billions in weapons it has sent to Ukraine. Urging the Council to live up to its responsibility, he called for a negotiated end to the war., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said his delegation requested today’s meeting to discuss the consequences of the growing smuggling of weapons being provided to Ukraine and for Council members to assess the impact of the ongoing influx of Western weapons into Ukraine on prospects for ending the conflict. Pointing to the proxy war by the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies against his country, he said that such large-scale military support has probably never extended to any State in history. Citing the American Center for International Policy, he said the overall volume of military assistance from Washington, D.C., alone to Kyiv from February to October totalled $40 billion. In addition, the United States and NATO are providing intelligence to the Kyiv regime. Without Western assistance, military activities in Ukraine would have come to an end a long time ago. The United States and NATO are providing the Zelenskyy regime with long-range weapons, allowing Ukrainian armed forces to strike peaceful areas of Donbass, he said, describing random strikes on residential and densely populated areas in recent weeks and days., He voiced regret that members of the Secretariat did not have the courage to condemn the shelling of Donetsk, although they speak out all the time about the strikes on Ukrainian territory. All crimes committed by the United States and its allies will have legal consequences. As equipment is dwindling in warehouses, he said that the United States and its allies are trying to work with third countries, buying equipment and material from them and then giving them to Ukraine. The legality of these actions should be assessed, he said, adding that, in doing so, Western countries are violating their obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty. Pointing to the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine falling into the hands of terrorist and criminals, he said those are warnings and concerns of the police forces of European countries themselves. The situation is already so out of control that weapons destined for Kyiv are appearing on the black market not only in Europe, but also in the Middle East and Africa. He urged a sober assessment of the risks arising from the uncontrolled pumping of weapons to the Ukrainian regime. Western countries do not understand that they are fuelling the fire and increasing threats to international peace and security, he said., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway), condemning the Russian Federation’s war in the strongest terms, said that her country will continue to stand by Ukraine. Moscow must abide by international law and stop its war of aggression now. Massive waves of missile and drone strikes demonstrate the Russian Federation’s disregard for the suffering it is causing to millions of people, she said, adding that children, persons with disabilities and the elderly must be protected. On the transfer of lethal weapons from Iran by the Russian Federation, she recalled that all States must respect the restrictions set out in resolution 2231 (2015). The Russian Federation is the one driving weapons flows into Ukraine through its illegal war, but it is not too late for it to do the right thing, respect the United Nations Charter, withdraw all troops and work for a peaceful solution through dialogue and diplomacy, she said., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that the Russian Federation is perpetrating this war with weapons sourced from Iran in violation of resolution 2231 (2015). It is ironic that Moscow is almost certainly seeking to source weaponry from other States sanctioned by the United Nations, such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as its own stocks dwindle. Despite resounding calls for a ceasefire and for peace, dialogue and diplomacy, heard in the Council on 6 December, the President of the Russian Federation has confirmed that the invasion will continue and that it will be protracted. Ukraine has no choice but to exercise its right to defend itself; otherwise, it will cease to exist. “In a similar situation, all of us would do the same,” she said, adding that due to a deep determination to live, Ukraine is prevailing. The Russian Federation can end the suffering immediately by ceasing attacks against Ukraine — including on critical national infrastructure and innocent civilians — and withdrawing all its forces illegally present in Ukraine, she said., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said that, over the past nine months, Ukraine has deployed its military and strategic capabilities to assert its inherent right to self-defence against the Russian Federation’s armed attack. Neither international law nor the United Nations Charter prohibit the supply of conventional weapons to a State under attack from another State. She added that she is acutely aware of the looming danger of a nuclear catastrophe, as the integrity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is persistently violated. As well, the war has spurred unprecedented levels of global energy, food and financial crises which have derailed the capacity of many developing States to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic, further worsening socioeconomic conditions for many communities far removed from the war. The international community must focus on the immediate cessation of hostilities, including the unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. “While diplomatic efforts to end the war may appear to have eluded the international community, we must remain steadfast and unified in our efforts to facilitate a political dialogue with credible guarantees of addressing the respective security concerns of the parties,” she said., GENG SHUANG (China) said that over the past 10 months, a large amount of weapons and ammunition have poured into Ukraine, adding: “Human lives seem so fragile when faced with gun barrels.” Both sides have suffered losses and trauma, with ordinary people bearing the brunt of the conflict. Recalling the High Representative’s statement in September about the risk of the potential diversion of weapons, as well as the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) warning in June that weapons destined for Ukraine could end up on the black market and in the hands of criminals, he said that such warnings have unfortunately materialized, with weapons landing in the hands of armed groups and terrorists in the Middle East and Africa. He called for a cessation of hostilities and emphasized the need for a political solution to end the crisis, rather than flooding the battlefield with weapons and prolonging the conflict. The international community must support efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement and all parties must exercise restraint and bring about conditions to relaunch negotiations. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons must be rejected, he said, adding that efforts must be made to stabilize the global supply chain and preserve the stability of developing countries. As well, humanitarian assistance must be provided on the ground, he added., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that the Russian Federation is again trying to have the Council believe that this war was caused by Ukraine, egged on by the United States and Europe. “Let’s not confuse the attacker and the attacked,” he urged, stating that the Russian Federation bears sole responsibility for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine. France is providing support to Ukraine so that Kyiv can exercise its legitimate right to self-defence and independence and it is proud of its decision to do so. It has been “robustly documented” that Moscow has used Iranian drones to target Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure, he said, calling on the Secretariat to investigate and report to the Council regarding this arms transfer that violates resolution 2231 (2015). France, for its part, will keep providing military support to Ukraine so long as Moscow’s aggression continues, just as it will continue providing humanitarian, economic and political aid. He added that, if the Russian Federation wishes the transfers it denounces today to cease, “the solution is a simple one”, which was provided by the International Court of Justice on 16 March. Namely, the Russian Federation must cease its military operations in Ukraine, withdraw from that country’s territory and respect Kyiv’s internationally recognized borders, he said., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) called on the Council to mitigate the risks of arms transfers. As the war continues, it is vital to safeguard weapons during transfers and deployment to prevent them from inadvertently falling into the wrong hands, especially those of terrorist groups. He welcomed initiatives to mitigate risks associated with arms transfers, including regional programmes to enhance anti-trafficking capabilities in the region, tailored plans concerning the transfer of high-technology weapons systems and stronger efforts to prevent the illicit trade in arms. The volume and type of arms involved in this conflict necessitate greater vigilance and transparency, he said, voicing his support for the calls for effective arms control measures. The Council has a responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and an obligation to Ukrainians and people around the world. For its part, the United Arab Emirates will continue to actively support and facilitate mediation and de-escalatory confidence measures, he said., ALBANA DAUTLLARI (Albania) said once again that the war in Ukraine is a war of choice, an aggression against another country and a blatant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Helping Ukraine to defend itself is a moral duty and Albania is proud to be among those doing what they can. Whoever is helping Ukraine in whatever way, legally and openly, is also helping to uphold international law and protect the Charter. The real and very disturbing issue is not what is being provided to Ukraine, but rather the transfer of killing drones to the Russian Federation by Iran in flagrant violation of resolution 2231 (2015), she added. Those who disrespect the law must face consequences and those who commit crimes must be held accountable, she said, urging full solidarity with Ukraine, its resistance, and its right to decide on its policies and choose its friends and its future., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya), reiterating her country’s call to undertake every effort to stop the war, said that the Council must be more responsive to its fundamental mandate to maintain international peace and security comprehensively. While Ukraine must bear the heavy responsibility of defending its internationally recognized boundaries, the proliferation of weapons will have a big impact both within and beyond that country. In noting the multi-pronged global crisis resulting from the war, she urged the Council to address this unprecedented proliferation. Food insecurity, a more complicated multilateral order and weapons proliferation cannot be effectively addressed with the war raging on. She also called for specific and sustained efforts to deliver a minimum level of de-escalation and de-confliction, the establishment of dialogue channels leading to a stable global order, the cessation of hostilities and a political settlement that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States) said the Russian Federation has wasted countless hours of the Council’s time on fictional dirty bombs in Ukraine, a claim debunked repeatedly by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As well, it has wasted the Council’s time on fictional biological weapons supposedly to be delivered to Ukraine’s near neighbours on the wings of birds and bats, he said, noting that those claims were rejected by the Council and by the States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention. The Russian Federation uses those stories to try to distract the Council from its own aggression, he said, pointing to credible reports of the Russian forces’ commission of rape, torture and summary executions in Ukraine. Frustrated on the battlefield, the Russian Federation has resorted to destroying Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure from afar, causing immense to civilians and defying the international community’s call to end its aggression. “Western assistance to Ukraine in the face of Russia's illegal and brutal invasion is not the problem here. It is Russia’s invasion itself.” The United States has seen no credible evidence of diversion of United States-provided equipment, he said, adding that it will review evidence to support such claims if it is produced. The United States takes very seriously its responsibility to protect its defence and dual-use technology and to prevent their diversion. At the same time, the United States is committed to continuing to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their country and their freedom, he added., LILLY STELLA NGYEMA NDONG (Gabon), noting that the Council is meeting for the second time in the week to discuss the war in Ukraine, reiterated her country’s rejection of the war and its appeal to the parties to negotiate in good faith. Nobody can predict the destabilization and insecurity that might ensue due to the numerous weapons being used in the war, she said, calling on parties to comply with international humanitarian law and to abstain from both using weapons of mass destruction and from targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. They must avoid any actions that inflict further suffering on civilians and allow for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid. She went on to urge parties to cease verbal and military escalation, adding: “It is time to silence the weapons in Ukraine.” More weapons only spell more death and destruction. The Council has a crucial role to play in seeking peace, she said, adding that Gabon stands with those who propose an alternative to the language of weapons., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), recalling his country’s concerns since 2014 regarding arms transfers, stressed the omnipresent impact of the weapons being used in the conflict. The highest price is being paid by civilians through their lives and the destruction of residential areas and infrastructure. All parties to the Arms Trade Treaty must abide by its provisions, he said, adding that States not yet party to that instrument must responsibly comply with the highest standards of precaution and with objectivity in their transfers. Thousands of lives depend on it, he said, underscoring the need for more specific arms control measures before the post-conflict stage and noting the increased difficulty as time passes. He reiterated Mexico’s call for the Council and the international community to promote dialogue and diplomacy and to not rule out mediation options. Ending the supply of weapons will require negotiations and a truce, but it will be impossible so long as the war continues, he said., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said that weapons now being used in Ukraine will possibly, in the future, fuel other conflicts in other parts of the world. Supplying arms and ammunition to the parties to the conflict in Ukraine might prolong the fighting and create more civilian suffering, but it is also undeniable that a State has a right to self-defence as enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Such a discussion, however, distracts the Council from its mandate to maintain peace and security, he said, adding that more than nine months into the conflict, it has yet to call upon the parties to resolve their dispute peacefully, as it is supposed to do under Article 33 of the Charter. Calling for an immediate ceasefire without preconditions, he said that the world is looking to the Council to exercise its responsibility and stop this spiral of violence., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland) pointed out that Ukraine did not commit an armed attack against the Russian Federation; rather, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine, justifying its invasion by invoking Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Ireland is applying the relevant European Union common position whereby the bloc’s member States assess exports of military technology and equipment against a range of criteria, including a specific criterion on risk of diversion. “Attempts by the Russian Federation to frame this urgent and necessary support for Ukraine’s defence as an ‘uncontrolled supply of weapons’ is, once again, a poor attempt at obfuscating their grievous actions.” He expressed concern about reports of Moscow obtaining ballistic missiles from Iran in contravention of resolution 2231 (2015). Comments by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s ambassador that his country is to supply the Russian Federation with ballistic missiles in contravention of resolution 1718 (2006) is also of serious concern. The Russian Federation must stop trying to use the Council as a platform to paint itself as the victim of its own aggression, he said. Rather, it must withdraw its troops and engage in good faith in dialogue and diplomacy to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict in line with international law and the Charter. Millions of lives in Ukraine, and across the world, depend on it, he said., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India), Council President for December, speaking in her national capacity, reiterated India’s call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, adding that dialogue and diplomacy are the only way forward. All efforts should be made to de-escalate and bring both sides to the negotiating table. Emphasizing that the conflict’s impact is not limited to Europe, she said that higher prices and shortages of food grains and fuel are having an acute impact on the global South. In that regard, she stressed the need to avoid measures that further affect the global economy. On the humanitarian front, she said that India has dispatched 12 consignments of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and stands ready to do more. Going forward, India will promote dialogue and diplomacy with a view to ending the ongoing conflict, and work with other partners to mitigate economic challenges, particularly to developing countries, she said., DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, said that his Western partners repeat the same talking points at every meeting, expressing a worldview in which the Russian Federation is guilty of everything everywhere. “In your blindness, you continue on a pathway that could lead to global consequences.” Blame for the Ukraine’s use of weapons on the peaceful citizens of Donbas cannot be placed on the Russian Federation. It is due to the “blooming corruption” of Ukrainian, American and European officials that weapons from Ukraine end up in the hands of international terrorists, fueling conflicts in other parts of the world and killing civilians there. The consequence of such actions is clear: it undermines international peace and security. The representative of the United States denied obvious facts and trends, he added, stating that that country’s desire to keep pumping weapons into Ukraine will be assessed by the international community and by American taxpayers themselves., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that, soon, it will be no surprise to see to see Leo Tolstoy’s novel renamed Special Operation and Peace to comply with President Vladimir V. Putin’s laws, as it is — like many of the Russian Federation’s Council statements — a mix of fictional narrative, history and often-perverse philosophy. Responding to the representative of civil society who briefed the Council, he said that there is freedom of speech in the United States, “but for God’s sake, even in a city where cannabis is now legal, there is no need to fill this Chamber with the smoke of conspiracy”. Noting that the Russian Federation is again trying to legitimize its flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations by using the Council as a platform to circulate propaganda, he said that this is an algorithm that Moscow has explored since Soviet times. First, the victim is blamed, and the more it resists and receives assistance from responsible nations, the graver the accusations. Second, the lie is wrapped in numerous terms and technical characteristics to make fakes look like facts, he said., Thanking all friends and allies that have supported Ukraine, including by supplying modern weapons, he said that his country is using the same to exercise its inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter. Recalling that Ukraine launched its operation to liberate its east and south after the Russian Federation brought the same allegations it brings today in the Council on 8 September, he stressed that the liberation of the Kharkiv, Kherson and Luhansk regions is evidence that all weapons in Ukraine’s possession are serving their intended purpose of helping Ukrainian soldiers liberate Ukraine’s people and territory. Further, to prevent their illegal use, Ukraine has created and ensured the effective functioning of a multi-level system of arms control. This comprises three elements: circulation and use of small arms and light weapons; export controls; and control and supervision of weapons and military equipment transferred by foreign countries. Detailing the Government’s systematic efforts in this regard, he said that Ukraine will continue to demonstrate transparency and a commitment to cooperating fully with its partners, as well as international export control regimes., For information media.

Statement to the Security Council - Threats to International Peace and Security: Statement by Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu High Representative for Disarmament Affairs (9 December 2022),News and Press Release,UNODA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",9 Dec 2022,"As delivered, New York, Madame President,
Distinguished members of the Security Council,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,, I have been requested to brief on the issue of “supplies of lethal weapons to Ukraine and their consequences”. This follows a similar briefing I provided in September to the Security Council., Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, a number of States have transferred weapons systems and ammunition to Ukraine for its defence forces. This, as I noted in September, is a matter of public record. Information from Governments regarding their transfers is largely accessible through open sources. Such transfers have included heavy conventional weapons, including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery systems, missile systems, uncrewed combat aerial vehicles, as well as small arms and light weapons., There have also been widespread and independently verified reports of the transfer of major conventional weapon systems to non-state armed groups involved in the conflict against Ukraine, including artillery rocket systems., The large-scale influx of weapons into any situation of armed conflict raises many concerns for peace and security, including risks of diversion as well as potential spillover and escalation. Measures to counter the potential diversion of weapons and ammunition will be key to post-conflict recovery and regional security and stability, as well as to conflict prevention in other regions. Such measures include pre-transfer risk assessments and postshipment controls, including on-site inspections and end-user verification. Of equal importance is the need to safeguard and account for transferred military equipment. To enhance transparency in arms transfers, the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms remains a key tool as does the Arms Trade Treaty. It is also an important tool to track the influx of weapons and ammunition in conflict zones. These are all widely accepted general policy approaches by Member States, which we encourage all to follow., Madame President,, Beyond addressing arms transfers, all parties to conflict have a duty to protect civilians when conducting military operations., Since 24 February, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 17,181 civilian casualties with the numbers incessantly rising. Most of the civilian deaths and injuries continue to be caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including attacks by heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and aircraft., In addition to thousands of civilians killed and injured, we have witnessed the destruction of civilian and critical infrastructure and services, especially using missiles and uncrewed aerial vehicles. Aside from homes, schools, roads, and bridges destroyed, hospitals and health facilities have also been impacted. The disruption of water, gas, heating and electricity caused by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure is of particular concern with the onset of winter bringing a new dimension to the humanitarian crisis and putting millions of people at risk., Under international humanitarian law, combatants must not direct attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and must take all feasible precautions in the conduct of military operations to avoid, or at least minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects., Since 2007, two Secretary-Generals have expressed their serious concerns over the humanitarian impact of explosive weapons in populated areas. They have consistently called upon parties to conflict to avoid their use due to the high likelihood of indiscriminate effects., Last month, on 18 November, more than 80 States adopted the Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas. This Declaration marks a milestone in our efforts to better protect civilians from the consequences of armed conflict. I call on Member States to give effect to this declaration., The past nine months have seen tremendous devastation – much as a result of the use of heavy conventional weapons. Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop., I also urge States to apply effective arms control measures to address the risks related to arms transfers. I want to reiterate: preventing diversion of supplied weapons and ammunition is essential to avoid fueling conflict and insecurity in the region and beyond., Madame President,
Distinguished members of the Security Council,, The only way to end the suffering and devastation in Ukraine is by ending the war. I appeal to all Member States to make every effort for peace., I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-security-council-threats-international-peace-and-security-statement-ms-izumi-nakamitsu-high-representative-disarmament-affairs-9-december-2022
Update 135 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (9 Dec 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Dec 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) carried out nuclear safety and security missions at Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyy and Rivne Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) this week as part of its ongoing and intensifying activities to help avert the danger of a nuclear accident during the current armed conflict in the country, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Requested by Ukraine, the two expert missions took place a week after the IAEA went to the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant to also provide on-site assistance and support in nuclear safety and security, and two weeks after a similar mission to the Chornobyl site. The IAEA has a permanent presence at the country’s largest NPP, Zaporizhzhya, since early September., “The situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant remains precarious, fragile and potentially dangerous and we are doing everything we can to prevent a nuclear accident there, especially with our proposal to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility. We are making progress in our consultations with Ukraine and Russia and I’m hopeful the zone will be agreed and implemented soon. It is urgently needed,” Director General Grossi said., “At the same time, however, it is very important that we don’t forget Ukraine’s other nuclear power plants. They may not be directly on the frontline as Zaporizhzhya is, but they are in a country at war and the potential nuclear safety and security risks are very clear. In recent weeks, our experts have conducted work aimed at reducing those risks, and this will continue as long as it is necessary,” he said., This week’s expert missions assessed the nuclear safety and security situation at the two plants and identified their future equipment and other needs for follow-up action by the IAEA. This will also inform the forthcoming planned continuing presence at these plants, including the South Ukraine and Chornobyl NPPs., At the Khmelnytskyy and Rivne plants, the IAEA experts found operating staff to be both professional and fully committed to their important tasks despite the challenging and difficult situation. Ensuring nuclear safety and security remained very much a priority at the two sites, the team said., Located in north-western and western Ukraine, the two plants have so far not suffered any physical damage because of the conflict, but both have experienced related challenges and other consequences, for example power blackouts, that led to the temporary operation of back-up emergency diesel generators., They requested continued IAEA assistance, including equipment deliveries and also in efforts to provide psychological support to staff working in extremely stressful conditions., “In the coming days and weeks, we will address the requests made by the plants during this week’s expert missions. We will continue to deliver the concrete assistance that is needed to help protect Ukraine’s nuclear facilities during this unprecedented war situation,” Director General Grossi said., At the Zaporizhzhya NPP this week, a new team of IAEA experts arrived at the site, replacing those who had been there for the past several weeks. It is the fourth IAEA team at Europe’s largest NPP since the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) was established on 1 September., The site continues to receive off-site power through a single 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line, with one 330 kV back up line from the nearby thermal power plant available. There is no change to the status of reactor units 1 – 6. Unit 5 and 6 remain in hot shutdown, producing the steam for the site and heating the water for the district heating system., Repair works of the damage caused by shelling on 19-20 November have been completed, except for some minor damage for which there is no safety concerns. At the thermal power plant 330kV switchyard, repairs continue., Separately this week, the fifth delivery of equipment to the country’s nuclear organizations and facilities, organized by the IAEA through its Response and Assistance Network (RANET), has arrived in Ukraine comprising of radiation detection and monitoring equipment. The delivery was made possible by a donation from Germany.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-135-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-9-dec-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 Dec 2022,"Mental Health of Women Forced to Flee Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan suffers as they struggle to survive, Cold weather and the inability to keep their children fed and warm, is taking a serious toll on the mental health of displaced female family heads, Displaced female-headed households putting themselves and their families at risk by utilising last resort heating methods in desperation, Willing to work, displaced women find employment opportunities precarious or non-existent plunging them deeper into poverty or forcing them to take on debt burdens as never before, As winter rapidly approaches, a new report by international aid agency, World Vision, reveals three of the world’s biggest displacement crises are seeing a common thread; displaced female-headed households are struggling to cope with harsh winter conditions, forcing them to take desperate measures, with the stress of the situation leading to mental health deterioration., World Vision’s new report, Out in the Cold, examines how displaced female-headed households from or within Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan will cope with the harsh climate conditions of winter and how a household head’s gender can significantly exacerbate the vulnerability of the household during winter. The study finds the rising costs of commodities and winter essentials puts displaced female-headed households at greater risk than other vulnerable groups because of the social stigma they face, and because help is often out of reach., “Accessing income creates several unique challenges for women in displacement camps. The foremost of these being the cultural and gendered norms that increase stigma around women’s economic activity said Eleanor Monbiot OBE, World Vision’s Middle East and Eastern Europe Regional leader. “Displaced women who are heads of household live double lives, where they must fulfil both domestic duties and generate income outside the home, but that is made very difficult as displacement camps and the closed communities they live in provide limited markets for their paid work and for the services they can provide.” Monbiot added., The research further found that female-headed households are reducing food consumption, taking on dangerous debt burdens as never before, sending their underage children to work, and selling their underage daughters into marriage or sex work. As temperatures hit life-threatening lows, they are also putting their health and family’s health at risk by using last resort heating methods instead of having to make the choice between food and heating their homes., “Displaced families from Ukraine are now facing their first harsh winter, but Syrian and Afghani displaced women, this is just another year of living in freezing temperatures where they are unable to buy fuel, wood, electricity or gas to heat their shelters during winter. As a result, they resort to using unsafe methods of heating and cooking which are unhealthy and extremely unsafe,” said Monbiot. “They are burning plastic bags and old clothes to stay warm. These practices are having chronic impacts on their health and the health of their families, on the environment, and significantly increasing the risk of fires in their communities.”, According to the new data, many female-headed households also face challenges accessing health facilities throughout the year and especially in winter due to transportation barriers, flooding and distance. When health facilities are available, lack of medicines and high costs prevent them from accessing needed healthcare services. In addition, the cold weather, the inability to keep their children warm and properly fed, and inadequate housing takes a toll on female family heads’ mental health and parental stress does result in physical and emotional violence, neglect, and subsequent behavioural issues among children., World Vision’s report, Out in the Cold, recommends, above all, prioritization of displaced female-headed households and the provision of seasonal cash assistance empowering them to provide for their families. In addition to cash assistance, immediate winterization provisions must be prioritised such as distribution of solid eco-friendly fuel and heating devices, distribution of winter clothing and blankets, and shelter insulation. And most critical of all, early access to mental health support services as women battle this season on all fronts., “We’re calling on the international community to step up and prioritise cash winter assistance for displaced female-headed households in Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan. These women have been forced to flee their homes, many alone with their children. They are now struggling to survive harsh winter conditions and their mental health is understandably suffering. The world must not forget these women. Their plight does not disappear as their stories disappear from news headlines. They have already been through unimaginable trauma, they need and deserve continued support now and in the future.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/out-cold-winter-related-challenges-displaced-female-headed-households-or-within-ukraine-syria-and-afghanistan-comparative-analysis-three-large-displacement-crises
Ukrainian Prioritized Multisectoral Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Actions During and After the War: Operational Roadmap,Manual and Guideline,WHO,Health,9 Dec 2022,"Executive summary, The development of this Operational Roadmap has been driven by a growing consensus in Ukraine on the need to prioritize activities that are urgently required to address the mental health and psychosocial needs of the country’s population and also the importance of basing the response on existing structures, resources and innovations introduced in reforms in past years.
According to this consensus, new resources mobilized by and for Ukraine should complement existing ones, in line with the national vision and with best international standards, and should be planned in a way that further strengthens the country’s mental health system., The Government of Ukraine is committed to urgently addressing the mental health and psychosocial needs of the population, under the auspices of the First Lady of Ukraine and the leadership of the recently established Intersectoral Coordination Council for Mental Health and Psychological Assistance to Victims of the Armed Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine (referred to in this document as the Intersectoral Coordination Council)., This Roadmap has been developed following a series of consultations with Ukrainian authorities and national and international agencies working in the area of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and engaged in emergency response in Ukraine. The consultation process was organized by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (MOH) and supported by WHO Ukraine, under the auspices of the First Lady of Ukraine and in collaboration with the MHPSS Technical Working Group of Ukraine (MHPSS TWG Ukraine) and the IASC MHPSS Reference Group (IASC MHPSS RG), and building on substantial advances in the mental health sector under existing programmes in the country., The Roadmap is informed by international technical guidance and national policies and plans, including the IASC Guidelines on MHPSS in Emergency Settings, the Minimum Services Package for MHPSS in Emergencies (MHPSS MSP), the IASC Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013– 2030, the WHO European Framework for Action on Mental Health, the Concept for Development of Mental Health Care in Ukraine until 2030, the National Mental Health Action Plan for 2021–2023 and the National Recovery and Development Plan., Informed by the overall goal of MHPSS assistance in Ukraine – to reduce suffering and improve the mental health and psychosocial well-being of the affected population – the Roadmap aims to provide a consolidated overview of envisioned MHPSS priorities, informed by the local context and the vision of the Government of Ukraine together with national and international partners, and with the best available evidence and resources, to all MHPSS stakeholders already engaged in or joining emergency response and recovery efforts in Ukraine.
As well as information on the context in Ukraine, the Roadmap includes:, • a list of evidence-based MHPSS interventions and services contextualized and introduced in Ukraine in recent years (described in Table 1) and, • a set of multisectoral actions to scale up MHPSS services in both the short and longer terms, informed by available evidence, international technical guidance and expert consensus (described in Table 2).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-prioritized-multisectoral-mental-health-and-psychosocial-support-actions-during-and-after-war-operational-roadmap

Shelter and Non-Food Items",9 Dec 2022,"Winter has arrived in Ukraine, and Ukrainians are being tested by increasingly frequent Russian airstrikes on civilian infrastructure. Russia's actions make it unimaginably difficult for ordinary Ukrainians to survive in freezing temperatures. Towns and villages are shrouded in darkness, and people often have no way to keep warm. People in Need continues working on the ground. In mid-November, we delivered urgently needed hygiene products as part of a humanitarian aid convoy to the newly liberated city of Kherson. In addition, roof slates, other construction materials, and bedding were delivered to recently liberated Lyman and other nearby settlements in eastern Ukraine. Our team, together with local partners, is working round the clock to replace windows and rooves and to deliver stoves to keep homes warm across Ukraine. We continue providing food and water to thousands of people in eastern Ukraine and already running ten child-friendly spaces for children to play and forget about the war for a while., AID IN UKRAINE, Humanitarian aid for newly liberated cities, repairs of schools and family houses, €32.1 MILLION WORTH OF AID, People in Need was part of the humanitarian convoy to the newly-liberated Kherson, which arrived in the city on the 17th of November. The convoy included four trucks filled with humanitarian items, including 500 hygiene kits, 1,000 packs of washing powder, sanitary pads, and 1,500 food kits. *""Humanitarian aid to Kherson is limited due to security reasons, and the needs are huge due to a combination of factors, for example, no basic services, limited access to markets and shops, and the meagre purchasing capacity of people,""*says Sergei Saenko, People in Need's Eastern Region Director., Recently liberated Lyman has been heavily damaged by months of fighting and Russian occupation. Slate and other construction materials and bedding were distributed to Lyman and other nearby settlements to ameliorate living conditions in the area., In the last month, we have been providing aid in nearly all oblasts of Ukraine. In the east, we have delivered non-perishable foodstuffs, canned food, and more for 16,900 people to villages and towns in Kirovohradska, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia and Mykolaiv Oblasts. Along with food, we are delivering basic hygiene supplies that cannot be bought locally. In the last month alone, 958 people in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and 1,445 people in the Kharkiv Oblast also received such aid. Furthermore, we provide much-needed drinking water; we have brought 42,240 litres of clean drinking water to the Kharkiv Oblast., ""All these attacks by Russia have just one aim---cause chaos and suffering among civilians and to force further displacement of thousands of people within Ukraine or into neighbouring countries."", Winter has come to Ukraine, temperatures have dropped below freezing, and the people lack electricity, water, and thus heating in many places. Hundreds of thousands of houses are damaged or destroyed. The recent Russian missile and drone strikes have crippled almost half of Ukraine's energy system. Due to Russian attacks, millions have no or limited access to electricity. *""All these attacks by Russia have just one aim---cause chaos and suffering among civilians and to force further displacement of thousands of people within Ukraine or into neighbouring countries,"" *says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for Eastern Partnership and Balkans at People in Need., Our teams are working hard to fix the windows and rooves of damaged homes and collective centres; more complex repairs are following. Additionally, tarpaulin, wood, and plastic sheeting that enable basic repairs are being distributed to families, in addition to winterisation items like stoves and mattresses., ""Everything that we had for our daily life, we do not have anymore. And now we are trying to rebuild at least something. And People in Need supported us. For example, we did not have the battens - we needed them for the roof. Thanks to the organisation [PIN], we received the battens, and we repaired the roof ourselves,"" says Liudmyla Chmil, a resident of Ivanivky village in Chernihiv Oblast., Across the country, we continue to repair houses, water systems and makeshift power supplies. In the Kirovohrad and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts, we have temporarily repaired homes for 1,630 people and bought furniture for collective centres, where 450 people have found shelter. Small and medium-sized repairs are also underway in the north in the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy Oblasts and in the west in the Zakarpattia Oblast. Because water systems are often closely connected with heating systems, they must be fixed before winter. We provide long-term solutions in several settlements. In newly liberated Balakliia, Derhachi, Eshar, and Alkhivska hromada, we delivered pumps and necessary equipment installed and ensured that the centralised water system was running., €110,000 WORTH OF AID, Thousands of Ukrainians spend their days in collective centres where they have found temporary shelter, including children. And it is for these children that we run ten Child-Friendly Spaces in Lviv, Ivano-Frankiv and Chernihiv Oblasts, where a total of forty assistants and one child psychologist for each space work. One hundred fifty children spend their free time there, and three hundred more await parental consent. And we still continue providing hot meals twice daily for 551 people in Lviv Oblast., €14.4 MILLION WORTH OF AID, We continue with cash distribution in some parts of Ukraine. The most vulnerable families receive the equivalent of CZK1,700 in hryvnia each month for a quarter of a year; this cash enables them to shop according to their needs., AID IN CZECH REPUBLIC, €3.69 MILLION WORTH OF AID, Almost 450,000 refugees have arrived in the Czech Republic since the war began, the highest number per capita of any EU country. Whilst they have managed to escape the war physically, life in a foreign land has been accompanied by joy and sad twists and turns., Valerie, her husband, daughter and four-year-old granddaughter, fled the horrors of war with the last of their strength. The terminally ill woman contacted us when she was already bedridden. ""She was distraught because her period of state-funded health insurance was ending. We resolved the situation, but the lady died two weeks later, and we ended up helping the grieving family with their last goodbye,"" says Helena Mourečková, SOS Ukraine's field coordinator., Another time, our worker was among the first to hear the crying of a newborn. His mother, Olga, who came to the Czech Republic in her fifth month of pregnancy with her three-year-old son and her parents, accompanied him through the second half of the pregnancy to the birth, during which she interpreted., Thousands of Ukrainians supported, Over the past period, we have supported 3,617 Ukrainians in various ways: 3,171 adults (18+) and 446 children. Of these, 774 clients sought help from our helpline. We provide additional refugees with information services in their mother tongue on our website, in groups on social networks, etc. In cooperation with the Hlavák Initiative, 6,766 more new arrivals, departures and others were supported with donations from the SOS Ukraine collection., In connection with the intensification of rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities, for example, in the Karlovy Vary Region, we have seen an increased number of new arrivals needing immediate food aid., Through our services, we support refugees mainly with social counselling---finding housing, employment or arranging humanitarian benefits. Like the siblings Irina and Oleg, a 19-year-old girl and her 14-year-old brother, who came to the Czech Republic alone. Their sick mother had to stay in Kyiv. In addition to applying for benefits, our colleagues helped them to furnish their room in the hostel, enrol the boys in school and arrange Czech tutoring., Our psychologists have mastered a new healing method, People come to us with all kinds of problems. It happens that, through an error of the authorities, they are left entirely without resources. In Prague, for example, a widower Yurii with an eleven-year-old daughter Baranyk, cannot work due to serious health problems. We provided him with food and necessary medicines and his daughter with a laptop for school preparation. We also face cases where people with certain visas are not entitled to humanitarian benefit payments or free access to the labour market. For example, we cooperate with employment offices in Prague, Pilsen, and Hodonín., Among our most common tasks is arranging medical care. In addition, refugees extremely often suffer from symptoms of depression and anxiety. Our psychologists have therefore been trained in the 'Assyst' ‚healing method, providing people with the opportunity to cope with traumatic events relatively quickly. At the same time, we also newly protect our Ukrainian team with supervision possibilities in Ukrainian., We're scaling up support where it's needed most, As members of the Consortium of NGOs working with migrants, we commented on LEX Ukraine 4., ""In order to meet the goals of the SOS Ukraine fundraiser, we have newly entered into partnerships with entities from different regions of the country, such as Children of Ukraine, Prague Maidan and others. We want to multiply our support where it is needed most - humanitarian aid for refugee families, educational opportunities for children who could not get to primary schools in Prague for capacity reasons, and Czech language courses,"" says **Zuzana Ramajzlová, **head of the SOS Ukraine programme in the Czech Republic., We continue to organise or coordinate aid centres for refugees. In Beroun, Central Bohemia, we are transforming an assistance centre into an integration centre. We are still working with Ukrainians in mass hostels and are already dealing with cases of people abuse by ""solidarity"" accommodation providers., Helpline support now requires longer-term collaboration, The support on the Ukrainian helpline (+420 770 600 800) now often requires longer-term cooperation with the client in dealing with multiple demands. A family that had to move out of a mass hostel in the Ústí nad Labem region managed to find social housing in Litvínov. Through other organisations and volunteers, they also furnished the flat and helped the family check contracts and handover protocols and interpret or explain what was needed. In the end, they stay in contact with the family in case of emergencies., We tutor, provide technology, and recruit volunteers, We see a lot of value in adaptation groups for children. In collaboration with other NGOs, we have made recommendations to the Ministry of Education for adequate funding for them. We are expanding online tutoring capacity for Ukrainian students. We have successfully rolled out support through a virtual branch. We also offer tutoring in some primary and secondary schools, e.g. in the Central Bohemia region, and career counselling for older children. We are still looking for ways to help Ukrainian teenagers aged 15+. We provide children and adults with the necessary technology., A focus group of Ukrainian teaching assistants continues to meet to bring us up to date on current issues., For both Ukrainian and Czech children, we organise joint leisure activities; for example, in Liberec, we organise joint cooking/baking, fighting, trips or yoga., We published the penultimate part of the Life in the Czech Republic series, which goes into more detail about helping war refugees from Ukraine. Through our traditional Stories of Injustice Awards, we expressed our support for all the brave Ukrainians defending their homeland this year. The award went to Ukrainian human rights activist and prisoner of war Maksym Butkevych, who is currently unjustly imprisoned., AID IN MOLDOVA, €985,000 WORTH OF AID, Since the beginning of the invasion, we have also been helping in neighbouring Moldova. We have been supporting families who have provided shelter to people fleeing the war. At the same time, we help run a helpline for aid in Ukrainian and Russian. As part of a new pilot project, Education in Emergencies for Ukrainian refugee children in Moldova, our team is finalizing the preparatory work to enable children to join distance learning.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/people-need-delivered-aid-liberated-kherson-and-lyman-we-are-preparing-homes-winter

This unity of women’s organizations is important nowadays. It’s time to unite”, The dynamic discussion confirmed that women leadership and joint efforts of all stakeholders amid the full-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine are much needed to navigate through these challenging times, mitigate the negative impact of the war on women and girls and streamline the humanitarian response and recovery efforts., Issues raised by participants also included political representation of women, as well as greater support to women affected by war to develop businesses to support their family in a context where there is a growing number of single-female headed households, with fewer and fewer income-earning opportunities, all on top of an already unequal labour market. Access to services related to gender-based violence, as well as support to women with disabilities were also identified as key priorities., Wrapping up the 1st Thematic Dialogue with Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations, Åsa Regnér, Deputy Executive Director for Policy, Programme, Civil Society and Intergovernmental Support, UN Women said: “This is a priority for us. We want to put women’s leadership and needs at the forefront of the agenda of the UN’s response”., The participants of the meeting agreed to establish a joint working group with the participation of UN agencies in Ukraine and CSOs to align on the next steps necessary to identify key directions for strengthening UN and Ukrainian Women’s Civil Society Organizations joint efforts.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-nations-ukraine-hosted-thematic-dialogue-ukrainian-womens-civil-society-organizations-kyiv

Ukraine Humanitarian Fund - UHF Partner Eligibility Process (As of December 2022),Manual and Guideline,OCHA,Humanitarian Financing,9 Dec 2022,"To apply for grants from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF), all prospective partners must first undergo and successfully pass the Fund’s eligibility process. The main objective of this process is to equip the UHF with adequate information about the capacities of a partner and that the partner meets all accountability requirements., Non-governmental organizations and organizations of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement that are currently implementing humanitarian response activities in Ukraine can apply to become UHF partners. The United Nations agencies with humanitarian operations in Ukraine are automatically incorporated upon request., As the UHF is part of the in-country humanitarian response system, active participation in and reporting to clusters is one of the requirements for eligibility., How to become a partner, Minimum Criteria, The UHF makes periodic calls for registration of new partners through an announcement to humanitarian clusters and on UHF webpages. Organizations seeking to become partners of the UHF should ensure that they meet a minimum criterion before applying. Please read the attached UHF Eligibility Process for a full update., Key aspects include:, • Operating according to humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence., • Valid registration in Ukraine with ongoing operations in-country and international registration Certificate for INGOs., • Active membership and reporting to UN-led humanitarian response coordination clusters in Ukraine., • Demonstrable partnership with donors, UN agencies and/or international organizations., • Programmatic expenditure/budget of at least $200,000 for INGOs and $100,000 for national NGOs per annuum in the last two years., • Having an operational bank account in USD or EUR in the name of the organization., • Demonstrable full programme cycle experience in project management., • Demonstrating a clear organizational structure and financial systems and capacity to manage and absorb funds., • Having a Board of Trustees or a recognized form of governance overseeing the organization’s operations., Step 1. Registration, Any organizations interested to become a UHF partner and meets the minimum eligibility criteria should submit their documents to prove that they meet all the requirements in their response to a call for registration of new partners.
Documents submitted outside the registration campaign periods will not be considered., Step 2. Due Diligence (DD), Upon registration on the OCHA Grant Management System (GMS), the UHF will guide the partner to upload the following documents in GMS (gms.unocha.org):, • Application form, • Due diligence declarations, • Registration certificate, • Bank account information, • Bank statement, • Identification documents, The UHF reviews the submitted documents to ensure that the organization meets the minimum requirements. Capacity Assessment is usually initiated after approval of the submitted due diligence documents., Step 3. Capacity Assessment (CA), Capacity assessment is the last step in the eligibility process for new partners to be able to access grants from the UHF. At the completion of this stage, each partner is assigned a risk level that determines grants ceilings, disbursement arrangements and monitoring and reporting requirements., For this stage, the prospective partner is asked to submit a list of documents that include organigramme, governance documents, manuals and policies of the organization, annual reports, work plans, financial statements, and others. The UHF uses these documents to review the institutional, technical, management and financial capacities of the prospective partner., The capacity assessment is undertaken in two phases: 1. Desk review of the documents provided by the partner; and 2. Interview with the organization’s staff – which could be virtual or a visit to the partner’s office. The UHF staff may also interview key informants such as previous/existing donors and partners of the organization, and cluster coordinators., UHF Risk Level, The eligibility process is completed by the UHF issuing an outcome of either granting eligibility or ineligibility status. The partners who pass the eligibility process are considered to have adequate systems and policies to manage UHF grants and are assigned a risk level., If a prospective partner does not meet the accountability requirements of the UHF, the UHF team will advise on areas that require strengthening. Such a partner could re-apply for another assessment during future partner calls after six months., The UHF assigns Low, Medium or High risk levels to partners at the conclusion of their successful eligibility process. The risk level is important as it determines the maximum budget that could be approved for a project based on implementation period. It also determines how funds would be disbursed, frequency of reporting, and planning for monitoring visits and spot checks., The assigned risk level is dynamic and is influenced by the performance of the partner throughout their UHF project cycle. The performance of partners will be used alongside the original capacity assessment score to determine and adjust the risk level., Consistent satisfactory performance is rewarded through improvement of the risk level, for example from High Risk to Medium Risk; or retention of assigned risk level. Regular poor performance can move the risk rating score from Medium Risk to High Risk or even to Ineligible status. Once rendered ineligible, an organization can re-apply for capacity reassessment one year after, if they can demonstrate that the elements that caused the poor performance have been addressed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-uhf-partner-eligibility-process-december-2022

WHO in Ukraine is here to stay and will continue working with all our partners on strengthening mental health service provision in Ukraine,” explained Dr Habicht., According to the new roadmap, emergency response during the war should take into account and complement the achievements of reforms and innovations of previous years, and be planned in a way to contribute to the further strengthening the country's mental health system., The meeting of the “Interagency Coordination Council on Mental Health and Provision of Psychological Assistance to Victims of the Russian Federation's Aggression Against Ukraine” a body of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, was attended by ministers, UN leadership, WHO, the European Union and representatives of embassies of the USA, Canada, Switzerland and United Kingdom., Denise Brown, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine, noted that the United Nations considers mental health and psychosocial well-being one of the priorities of humanitarian response and also emphasized its importance for Ukraine during the period of recovery and reconstruction., “Together with WHO and with the engagement of other UN agencies, we have mobilized our efforts to strengthen our support today and in the years to come"" emphasized Ms Brown., First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska said: “""It is extremely important that all agencies are active participants in this interaction.

I would like to express my special thanks to the World Health Organization and USAID for their understanding of our needs and comprehensive assistance. And even today, it is becoming increasingly clear that the unique experience that, unfortunately, Ukraine is gaining, will enable our country to add its cases and practices to the global baggage of mental health,"" the President's wife emphasized.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-endorses-roadmap-mental-health-during-war-under-prime-minister-and-first-lady-ukraine

The attacks and damage to homes are leaving millions at risk of extreme temperatures that can drop below -20°C., According to OHCHR, as of 5 December, 17,181 civilian casualties have been recorded since the start of the war. The actual numbers are likely to be much higher., UNHCR is striving to reach more people in the country with services and supplies that will keep them warm and protected during the winter. Nearly 1 million people have now been reached with winter support and 42 generators have been delivered to critical facilities.

Meanwhile, several Ukrainian embassies in Europe received packages being investigated as threats, including letter bombs at the Ukrainian embassy in Spain. Daily ceasefire violations continued on the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Meanwhile, demonstration activity linked to the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, climate grievances, and rising living costs took place across the region., In Ukraine, clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the Luhansk region (ISW, 27 November 2022). Ukrainian forces also engaged in counterattacks in the western part of the Donetsk region and eastern part of the Zaporizhia region last week (ISW, 2 December 2022). Meanwhile, Russian forces continued ground attacks towards Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, with Russia reportedly occupying several settlements in the area last week (BBC, 30 November 2022)., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with artillery shelling and missile strikes last week, reportedly killing around a dozen civilians in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Sumy regions. Two more civilians were reportedly killed and around four injured in landmine explosions in the Kharkiv, Kherson, and Sumy regions. Separately, Russian human rights groups reported that thousands of Ukrainian prisoners were transferred from occupied parts of the Kherson region to Russian prisons, where they are subjected to torture and ill-treatment (Activatica, 30 November 2022). According to these reports, Russian authorities are planning to review these prisoners’ cases under the Russian Criminal Code to prolong their sentences and set them up for recruitment by the government-linked private military company Wagner Group that operates in Russian prisons, in order to send them back to war. Additionally, dozens of civilians were reportedly forcibly relocated from the occupied Kinburn Spit in southern Ukraine (24 Channel, 30 November 2022)., In Russia, authorities of the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions blamed Ukrainian forces for incidents of cross-border fire that hit villages close to the Russia-Ukraine border. No casualties were reported (Kommersant, 2 December 2022). This violence contributed to a 120% increase in average weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Amid the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine, embassies and consulates of Ukraine in several European countries, including Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain, received packages with bloody pieces of animal bodies (El Pais, 2 December 2022). In Spain, at least five letter bombs were sent to high-profile politicians, including the prime minister, and to the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid. An embassy employee was mildly injured when the parcel exploded. Russia has condemned the threats and attacks, while the perpetrators and their motives remain unknown (BBC, 1 December 2022)., Daily reports of ceasefire violations continued along the** Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan** Line of Contact. As a result of the fighting, three Armenian servicemen were wounded last week in Armenia and Artsakh.

Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Dec 2022,"The innovative hotline format was launched in May to provide up-to-date information on legalizing a stay abroad and registering a business for displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries, Kyiv, 7 December 2022 – The Diia.Business virtual centre, launched in the format of an innovative hotline, provided 14,200 consultations to Ukrainians who were forced to relocate within the country or abroad during the first stage of the project., Most often, Ukrainians made requests in relation to:, ·obtaining temporary protection or the legal grounds for staying in the territory of another state;, ·the provision of housing and employment assistance;, ·acquiring information on doing business in seven EU countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and how to subsequently relocate to Ukraine., “The main goal of creating the Diia.Business virtual centre is to help every Ukrainian who has been forced to leave their homes,” said Valeriia Ionan, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation for European Integration., “The centre’s employees have already provided more than 14,000 consultations, because we strive to help each of our citizens return to Ukraine as soon as possible. And the effectiveness of this project is confirmed by the 95 percent positive reviews from those who used the help of the virtual centre.”, Maria Lindgren-Saltanova, Charge d'affaires of the Embassy of Sweden in Ukraine, emphasized that providing support for Ukrainian citizens in times of war is the ultimate goal of all initiatives in which Sweden is consistently cooperating with the government of Ukraine. “Millions of Ukrainians, including thousands of children, were forced to leave Ukraine, seeking refuge in safe countries,” she said., “The hotline was aimed at supporting and providing the necessary informational support to these people. After all, it is important for citizens to know that the country is taking care of them, no matter where they are.”, Jaco Cilliers, acting UNDP Ukraine Resident Representative, said that the government of Ukraine had launched a number of programmes to protect the population in times of war. “*The launch of the hotline, which provides much needed advice on issues of legalizing one’s stay abroad and registering a business, was one of the steps taken to support Ukrainians affected by the war,” Cilliers said., “UNDP appreciates its partnership with the government in implementing such important initiatives, and is determined to continue cooperation in the realisation of such programmes so that citizens obtain the support they need, and so that no one is left behind.”, The second stage of consultations of the Diia.Business virtual centre will start soon. At this stage, the centre will provide professional support for employment opportunities, business operations (from establishing a business to relocation) and legal issues for internally displaced persons. These consultations will be focused on the regions of temporary residence of the affected Ukrainian population, taking into account the fact that almost five million Ukrainians have returned from abroad., The project was initiated by the teams of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the Office for the Development of Entrepreneurship and Export, and the national Diia.Business project, and is implemented by the NGO “Consulting Centre for the Support of Small and Medium Businesses,” with the assistance of the DIA Support project, implemented by the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine, with the financial support of Sweden., Background, UNDP’s Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine Project (DIA Support Project) is being implemented by UNDP in Ukraine with funding from Sweden.

A mobile maternity unit delivers babies and critical health services amid war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",7 Dec 2022,"BALAKLIYA, Ukraine – “When the war arrived in this area, the women and children tried to escape – from danger, hunger and the lack of medical services,” said Dr. Olga Filipova, an obstetrician and gynaecologist in Ukraine., Dr. Filipova provides medical help for women in remote areas of the war-torn Kharkiv region. The team reaches them through a UNFPA mobile maternity unit currently stationed in the city of Balakliya, which was recently retaken from Russian forces. Although the shelling hasn’t stopped entirely, people are beginning to trickle back – many of them women and girls in dire need of health care., “As the war rages on, this mobile unit is going to be very useful,"" explained Dr. Filipova. “Because even now that the government has regained control of the area and people are starting to return home, local medical facilities are still very low.”, Most health-care facilities and other essential infrastructure in the Kharkiv region have been destroyed, including a UNFPA-supported clinic in Izyum that previously served several surrounding communities. With services now concentrated in a vastly reduced number of health centres, for many the mobile unit is the only way they can receive urgent – and often life-saving – sexual and reproductive health support., Fully autonomous and with access to their own electricity and water, in the mobile unit even complex procedures such as caesarian sections can be carried out under the harshest conditions. Staff work comfortably and with all necessary medicines and supplies so they can perform a wide range of examinations and help new mothers to give birth safely., “We provide broad assistance, from general visits and basic analysis to consultations on family planning, contraception and referrals to specialists. Pregnant women and the most severe cases are referred to hospitals,” Dr. Filipova added., Sharp increase in health risks and complications, The World Health Organization estimates that some 688 medical facilities have been attacked since the brutal war in Ukraine started nine months ago. Ongoing disruptions of power, water and heating and treacherous roads – many of them mined – are making it difficult to access or use those health services that are available, putting millions of lives at risk., There are around 80,000 women of reproductive age in the retaken territories, of whom more than 100 are pregnant in the Kharkiv region and 70 are expected to give birth within the next three months., “Many women – including pregnant women – haven’t received adequate medical assistance for months, nor did older people with chronic diseases. As a result we are seeing some severe complications among pregnant women and an exacerbation of clinical conditions,” said Dr. Filipova. The most common among these are cervical cancer, diabetes and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV., Each patient requires support to address their particular needs, which UNFPA has continued to ensure by opening new health services and running psychosocial mobile teams and helplines for survivors of violence. Since March 2022, more than 10,000 women and girls have received sexual and reproductive health services from UNFPA-supported mobile clinics and some 33,000 had access to psychosocial services via helplines or mobile clinics., Dangerous gaps in supplies and services, UNFPA will begin operating more than 30 mobile clinics across Ukraine in the coming weeks, to ensure thousands of women and girls receive the sexual and reproductive health support they need, including qualified birth assistance and post-natal care. An ambulance has also been handed over to the mobile team, which will work in the Kharkiv region and is based at the now destroyed hospital in Izyum., But logistics and supply chains are still facing lengthy disruptions, and with insecurity obstructing delivery of even the most essential medical services, women and girls in Ukraine are facing unprecedented challenges., Hundreds of thousands of isolated villages and towns have been cut off from power and communications infrastructure, meaning those living there are struggling to seek help as they most desperately need it.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mobile-maternity-unit-delivers-babies-and-critical-health-services-amid-war-ukraine
"Killings of civilians: summary executions and attacks on individual civilians in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions in the context of the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine, December 2022 [EN/UK]",Analysis,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,7 Dec 2022,"UN report details summary executions of civilians by Russian troops in northern Ukraine, UN report details summary executions and attacks on individual civilians by Russian troops in northern Ukraine from February to April, KYIV (7 December 2022) – In the initial weeks of the invasion of Ukraine, Russian armed forces summarily executed or carried out attacks on individuals leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians, the Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner said today. A UN Human Rights report based on the work of the Mission details how Russian troops killed civilians in Ukrainian towns and villages across the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions of Ukraine from 24 February until 6 April 2022., Bogner said the summary executions examined in the report may constitute a war crime. “There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in this report may constitute the war crime of willful killing,” she said., The report explains how killings of civilians were not confined to specific locations, although some areas were more affected than others. In the town of Bucha near Kyiv, which was under the control of Russian troops from 5 to 30 March, the Mission documented the killing of 73 civilians (54 men, 16 women, 2 boys and 1 girl) and is in the process of corroborating an additional 105 alleged killings., Summary executions often followed security checks by Russian armed forces. “A mere text message, a piece of camouflage clothing, or a record of previous military service could have fatal consequences,” Bogner said., The report states that the UN has, so far, documented the violent deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls) in the three regions in the initial 6 weeks of the Russian invasion alone. The report cautions that the actual figures are likely to be considerably higher as work is still ongoing to corroborate an additional 198 killings that occurred in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions of Ukraine occupied by Russia in the initial stages of the ongoing armed attack against Ukraine., Apart from the summary execution of civilians, the report covers cases when Russian troops launched attacks that did not respect the principle of distinction between military objectives and civilians, and failed to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians. “Civilians were targeted on roads while moving within or between settlements, including while attempting to flee the hostilities,” Bogner said., The report examines 100 killings in more detail. Of the number, according to the report’s assessment, 57 amounted to summary executions (48 men, 7 women and 2 boys). Thirty of those took place in places of detention while the remaining 27 victims were killed on the spot, shortly after coming under the control of Russian forces., “Russian soldiers brought civilians to makeshift places of detention and then executed them in captivity. Many of the victims’ bodies were found with their hands tied behind their backs and gunshot wounds to their heads,” said Bogner., The report found that men and boys comprised 88 percent of all victims of summary executions, suggesting that males were disproportionately targeted on the basis of their gender., The report states that although many months have passed since the first killings became known, much needs to be done to hold those responsible to account. The UN Human Rights Office has found no information that the Russian authorities have been actively investigating or prosecuting any of such cases. Bogner called for the Russian Federation to promptly investigate all alleged violations of international law and to bring those responsible to justice., ENDS, E-mail: ohchr-HRMMUinfo@un.org

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk concludes his official visit to Ukraine,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,7 Dec 2022,"Kyiv, 7 December 2022, Good afternoon and thank you all for coming., I have been here now for four days, in sub-zero temperatures. I have seen for myself the horrors, suffering and the daily toll that this war against Ukraine by Russia has had on the people of this country., I have spoken to the families of prisoners of war who anxiously await news of their loved ones. I’ve listened to the pain of those whose children are on the frontline; heard about the particular plight of people with disabilities and older people who are unable to reach safe shelter when the air raid sirens go off. I visited the site of a shelled apartment block in Izium, Kharkiv Oblast, where more than 50 people were buried under the rubble., And in the rubble were the signs of lives cut short by acts of indiscriminate shelling., A shoe. A piano. Toys. A closet full of clothes. Shelves of books., I talked to a woman who showed me her destroyed apartment block, where all her neighbours, now dead, used to live., I had to spend time in an underground shelter on Monday as at least 70 missiles were launched across Ukraine, again striking essential infrastructure and knocking out power. A group of human rights defenders joined us, and we calmly carried on with our meeting. As if it was normal to have your day interrupted by air raid sirens., It is not normal. It must not be normal., I fear that there is one long, bleak winter ahead for Ukraine. The consequences of the war on the enjoyment of human rights for people in the country have already been devastating, and the prognosis is very worrying., Some 17.7 million people need humanitarian assistance and 9.3 million require food and livelihood assistance. A third of the population has been forced to flee their homes. Some 7.89 million have fled the country, the majority of whom are women and children, and 6.5 million people are internally displaced., This means lives uprooted., Humanitarian aid plays a vital role in providing support to the most vulnerable, including older people and people with disabilities. Providing an adequate social security net to the most vulnerable need to be prioritized., Each day we receive information about war crimes. The scale of civilian casualties, as well as the significant damage and destruction to civilian objects - including hospitals and schools - is shocking as I saw for myself in Izium. During winter, this has horrible consequences for the most vulnerable. They are struggling with blackouts, with no heating or electricity, going on for hours., Information continues to emerge about summary executions, torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and sexual violence against women, girls and men., In relation to continuing reports of ill-treatment, torture and execution of prisoners of war, my Office issued a statement in mid-November raising serious concerns based on our findings. We will continue to follow this issue closely., Prisoners of war must be treated humanely at all times from the moment they are captured. This is a clear, unequivocal obligation under international humanitarian law. Prisoners of war who are suspected of committing war crimes should be prosecuted, in line with international standards. However, international law prohibits prosecuting them for mere participation in hostilities., During my visit on Monday to Bucha, north of Kyiv, I saw the visible trail of destruction left following the Russian forces’ departure from the town in March. Bullet holes on the walls of houses. The town was retaken by Ukrainian forces within less than four weeks, but – six months on – the trauma of so many who lived, terrified, through that period, and others who lost loved ones, remains palpable., Our presence here – the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine headed by Matilda Bogner – is today issuing a report that details the killings of civilians cutting firewood or buying groceries. The report documents the fate of 441 civilians in parts of three northern regions – Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy – that were under Russian control until early April. Bucha was the town hardest hit. We are working to corroborate allegations of additional killings in these regions, and in parts of Kharkiv and Kherson regions that were recently retaken by Ukrainian forces., There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing., The victims and survivors of these violations have a right to truth, justice and reparation – accountability must be ensured as soon as possible. It is important to put in place programmes early on to provide compensation to victims and survivors, to fill the gap until those who are responsible meet their obligations., What has also been deeply alarming is the questioning of international humanitarian law. We must remember that this area of law governing the conduct of hostilities emerged following the brutal Battle of Solferino in 1859 and was codified in the wake of the horrors of two world wars that started on this continent., And let us not forget, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted in direct response to “the calamities and barbarous acts experienced by the peoples of the world during the Second World War”., International humanitarian law is an important achievement of humanity and an obligation. My plea is to everyone engaged in hostilities to respect it fully, especially in the most difficult, most emotional circumstances. International humanitarian law is stronger than its violation by any State. A violation by one party does not legitimize violations by another., I urge justice for all victims, whoever they are, with respect for their dignity and humanity. The imperative for accountability is not altered by the affiliation of the victim or perpetrator. All allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law – by whomever and wherever committed - must be promptly investigated and brought to justice, under a fair and independent legal process., Such an approach is also essential to strengthen the rule of law in Ukraine., As one human rights defender I met this week said it is crucial for Ukraine to hold on tight to the values of a free society, grounded in respect for the rule of law and human rights, including the freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial, the freedom of religious belief, the right to social security – the whole host of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights., And not to lose them in the fog of war., I impressed upon my counterparts the need to keep a constant eye on the vision for the day after. To prepare now for the kind of Ukraine that the people would like to live in once this war is over. There will be a better future., For this, human rights must be the guide., This means building social cohesion among the different communities and ensuring the rights of the most vulnerable; ensuring equal access without discrimination to essential services for those most in need – including people with disabilities and older people, with women the most deeply affected., It means ensuring a fully functioning judicial system that delivers fair trials and justice to the people; ensuring that allegations of violations – recent violations and since 2014 – are acted upon with urgency and transparency, investigated and followed through with prosecutions; ensuring that laws under consideration are fully in line with international human rights standards., Civil society must be free to thrive, express their opinions and help to build a society that is strong through diversity., I have been encouraged by the openness of the authorities and their engagement with my Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. In addition to our monitoring work, we have also been providing advice on laws that require amendment, including Law No. 2108-IX which in March introduced criminal liability for collaborating with an “aggressor State”. The law contains provisions that are vague, while imposing harsh penalties. We are calling for it to be amended to bring it in line with international standards, as mentioned in my meeting earlier this week with parliamentarians. My Office will follow up on this with specific recommendations. We have also shared our concerns with Parliament on the draft law on citizenship and the draft laws on media., My Office in Ukraine has been working here uninterrupted since 2014 – documenting and reporting, working with civil society, advising the Government on compliance with international law and how to respond to our findings. Our mandate includes monitoring and reporting on all violations committed on the territory of Ukraine, irrespective of the perpetrator., It is important for us to have access to the occupied areas of Ukraine, from where we also continue to receive reports of violations. We have not had recent access, but continue to seek it., My representative in Ukraine and the head of our monitoring mission, Matilda Bogner, will now speak to you in more detail about our report on killings in northern Ukraine., On my part, let me stress that the most effective way to stop the running catalogue of cruelty from continuing is to bring an end to this senseless war – in line with the UN Charter and international law. My most fervent wish is for all people in Ukraine to enjoy the right to peace., ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-high-commissioner-human-rights-volker-turk-concludes-his-official-visit-ukraine

Gender
Protection and Human Rights",6 Dec 2022,"SC/15129, 9208TH MEETING (AM), Speakers Accuse Russian Federation of Using Winter as Weapon of War, Ongoing attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and the onset of frigid winter temperatures portend danger and worsening hardships for millions of Ukrainians, a senior United Nations official told the Security Council today, urging all parties to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law., Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that more than 14 million people remain forcibly displaced from their homes in Ukraine, including 6.5 million internally displaced and more than 7.8 million across Europe. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as of 1 December, 17,023 civilians have been killed since 24 February, including 419 children. Since February, 1,148 children have been killed or injured while millions have fled, been uprooted from their homes, separated from their families or put at risk of violence., “In Ukraine today, the ability of civilians to survive is under attack,” he said, noting that temperatures are expected to drop to below ‑20°C. Since October, sustained attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have left millions without heat, electricity and water, he said, adding that Kyiv needs enhanced international support beyond what humanitarians can provide., “Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population must be protected and constant care must be taken to spare civilians and civilian objects throughout all military operations,” he added, emphasizing that international humanitarian law must be respected. Underscoring Member State and other donor support to the Ukraine Flash Appeal, he pointed out that more must be done, however, to close the funding shortfall., In the ensuing debate, speakers once again deplored the Russian Federation’s attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, urged compliance with international humanitarian law and appealed for unimpeded access for humanitarian relief supplies. Several welcomed the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, but voiced alarm at soaring food prices and growing food insecurity worldwide., France’s representative, among many others, said the Russian Federation is using winter as a weapon of war. He called on Moscow to respect the order issued by the International Court of Justice on 16 March to end the war and noted that France is co-organizing a conference in Paris on 13 December to mobilize international assistance for Ukraine., The United States’ representative, commending France’s initiative, said that aid agencies in Ukraine have implemented the largest humanitarian cash assistance programme in history, transferring more than $1 billion to 6 million people. However, more assistance will be needed, she said, adding that her country has provided over $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance., Mexico’s representative, noting that 70 per cent of the attacks against health infrastructure around the world in recent months have occurred in Ukraine, said health care workers have had to abandon their posts due to internal displacement made worse by the energy crisis. He called once again for greater efforts to rebuild Ukraine’s power grid to supply electricity to priority services, along with guaranteed energy supplies for nuclear power stations to avert a nuclear disaster., The United Arab Emirates’ representative said that winter brings new and unforeseen dangers, with snow and ice concealing landmines and unexploded munitions. Pointing to the impacts of war on education, he said that while an estimated 2.6 million children have been learning online since September, even that remote access has been disrupted by blackouts and power cuts., Kenya’s representative warned that food security in Africa could worsen if fertilizer costs remain high due to the war. Warning that rising food prices could lead to widespread humanitarian suffering, she said that countries through which those food commodities are shipped must reflect their humanitarian responsibility and remove all measures blocking food exports., The Russian Federation’s representative, giving a different perspective, said the root cause of the crisis is Ukraine’s many years of crimes against civilians and children in Donbass, something that the West is shamefully trying to hide. Moscow is willing to negotiate, but if its aims cannot be achieved peacefully, and if Ukraine cannot become a normal, good-neighbourly State, then it will use all available logistical and military means to protect its interests, he said., Ukraine’s representative said that while the Russian Federation is trying to convince the Council of its desire for peace, it launched 70 missiles on 5 December to harm Ukrainian infrastructure. Nonetheless, the aggressor will be defeated, the Moscow dictatorship will fail and war criminals will be held to account, he said. He added that the United Nations and the international community must not remain silent on the deportation of 12,300 children to the Russian Federation or occupied territories., Representatives of countries in the region, including Latvia, Poland and Germany, spotlighted ways in which they are assisting Ukraine. Latvia’s delegate, also speaking for Estonia and Lithuania, added that a special international tribunal for the punishment of the crime of aggression against Ukraine must be established to hold the Russian Federation to account., Also speaking today were representatives of Gabon, Brazil, China, Norway, Ireland, Ghana, Albania, United Kingdom and India, as well as the European Union., The meeting began at 10:02 a.m. and ended at 12:25 p.m., Briefing, MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, [said](https://reliefweb.int/node/3913690 that more than 14 million people remain forcibly displaced from their homes in Ukraine, including 6.5 million internally displaced, and over 7.8 million across Europe. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as of 1 December, 17,023 civilians have been killed since 24 February, including 419 children. The World Health Organization (WHO) meanwhile reports at least 715 attacks on health care in the country, including 630 that impacted health facilities and 61 that affected personnel. Since February, 1,148 children have been killed or injured while millions have fled, been uprooted from their homes, separated from their families or put at risk of violence. Winter has now arrived across Ukraine, he said, noting that temperatures are already below freezing and are expected to drop to below -20°C. The attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including power stations and heating plants, have left millions of people without access to heat, electricity and water, adding another dangerous dimension to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war, he said., People are being deprived of health care and children deprived of education, he continued, adding: “In Ukraine today, the ability of civilians to survive is under attack.” Amid freezing temperatures and destruction, people at highest risk are the already vulnerable. Among them are the elderly, those with disabilities and the many millions of displaced people, essentially because of a lack of essential services. “International humanitarian law speaks for itself. Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population must be protected and constant care must be taken to spare civilians and civilian objects throughout all military operations.” Gender-based violence targeting women and girls remains pervasive and underreported, he added. “The humanitarian community remains committed to stay and deliver,” he said, with almost 690 humanitarian partners — most of them local organizations — providing life-critical assistance and protection to 13.5 million people. In preparation for the winter, humanitarians have provided more than 630,000 civilians with different kinds of direct winter assistance, and 400 generators have been distributed to critical facilities, he added., Since October, sustained attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have created a new level of need that impacts the whole country and exacerbates the needs caused by the war, he said, adding that the Government requires enhanced support from the international community beyond what humanitarians can provide. In recent weeks, more areas have become accessible in eastern and southern oblasts, allowing humanitarians to reach new communities with assistance, while interagency convoys are moving to bring aid to areas now back under Government control. In Kherson, for example, convoys have delivered food, potable water and medical supplies, as well as assistance for women’s and girls’ reproductive health., Humanitarians are working to respond to gender-based violence, he said, noting that an integrated network of spaces and providers has been delivering survivor-centred services for women, girls, boys and men who may have been subject to gender-based violence. Some 765,000 children have received psychosocial support. Mobile teams are operating in centres for internally displaced persons to identify, register, assess and support children with protection needs. None of this would be possible without Member State and other donor support to the Ukraine Flash Appeal, he said, with $3.1 billion — out of a requested $4.3 billion for 2022 — received. To date, almost $1 billion in humanitarian cash transfers have been provided to about 4.3 million people, he said., However, more must be done to close the funding shortfall, he said. While there have been some improvements in humanitarian access, the biggest challenge remains impediments to reaching areas in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Discussions continue between the United Nations and relevant parties to facilitate unimpeded access to those areas. “It is vital that we get convoys through to deliver relief items,” he said, noting that the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has established a presence in Moscow and that he continues to engage key interlocutors in Moscow, Kyiv and elsewhere. One million of the 13.5 million people reached since February are in areas outside of Government control, and they have been reached thanks to humanitarian partners who are still positioned in Donetsk and Luhansk, where humanitarian operations began in 2014., “While we continue to provide support in these regions through these local partners, our response is neither regular nor at the right scale,” he continued. Under international humanitarian law, all parties should allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. They also must ensure that their personnel have the freedom of movement. In areas where the Government has recently regained control, landmines and explosive remnants of war are a major concern for both communities and humanitarians, delaying the restoration of essential services, including electricity. States must bolster their support for mine clearance efforts, while information on mines and used or abandoned explosive ordnance should be shared promptly., Recalling last week’s launch of OCHA’s annual Global Humanitarian Overview, he said that 274 million people needed humanitarian assistance at the beginning of this year. For 2023, however, the projected number has grown to 339 million, representing a 24 per cent increase. That is a stark reminder of how fast humanitarian needs are accelerating, especially for Ukraine, he said, pointing to an unimaginable picture of “a world gone mad” that sees one in 23 people in need of humanitarian assistance worldwide., Statements, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) condemned the massive attacks launched on 6 December across Ukraine, saying that the Russian Federation is using winter as a weapon of war. This systematic targeting reflects Moscow’s clear desire to deprive the Ukrainian people of water, heat and electricity in the hope of undermining their resistance. Those who kill children and attack schools in violation of international humanitarian law deserve their place on the blacklist of the Secretary-General’s annual report, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to respect the order issued by the International Court of Justice on 16 March to end this unjustifiable and devastating war. He welcomed efforts by the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to evacuate civilians and wounded people from besieged areas. Such efforts must continue, he said, as respect for international humanitarian law and human rights is non-negotiable. Ukraine stands on the side of peace, he added, commending President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 10-point peace plan and recalling that France is co-organizing an international conference with Ukraine in Paris on 13 December to mobilize and coordinate international aid to help Ukrainians to survive the winter, with particular emphasis on energy, water, food and health infrastructure, as well as transport networks., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) noted that 70 per cent of the attacks against health infrastructure around the world in recent months have occurred in Ukraine. Health care personnel there were forced to abandon their work posts due to internal displacement made worse by the energy crisis. In this regard, he reiterated his urgent call to step up efforts to rebuild the power grid to ensure a supply of priority services. He also underscored the need to guarantee an electrical supply for nuclear stations to avoid a nuclear disaster. More than 3.6 million minors have been affected by the disruption in school services, he pointed out, adding that children represent almost 20 per cent of the displaced population and will pay the highest price in terms of their mental health. The Council should explore new options for mediation, he added., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) called on the warring parties to respect their commitments according to international humanitarian law. They must abstain from using weapons with indiscriminate effects, she said, underscoring the danger posed by landmines and unexploded remnants of war buried under snow to the civilian population. Echoing the appeal of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), she said the parties must “mark and clean the contaminated areas as soon as possible and inform the civilians of the danger”. Moreover, the parties must absolutely ensure that those unexploded remnants of war do not hinder access for essential services or engender additional risks for the population and humanitarian workers. The renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative is a sign of hope that the parties can negotiate a cessation of hostilities. She further urged all parties to abstain from all radical rhetoric that would complicate the political issue. The Council must keep diplomatic channels open to encourage the parties to meet and examine all possible avenues to put an end to the conflict. It is not enough to have more and more meetings on the matter without offering a genuine alternative to war, she said., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) underscored the importance of the victim-centred approach and emphasized the urgency of establishing a ceasefire. Western leaders’ expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with the Russian Federation to end hostilities must translate into the establishment of a mechanism for conducting pragmatic and objective negotiations, he said, adding that the Council serves as a platform to initiate such discussions. He expressed concern that serious violations against children might go unchecked, adding that protection of civilians, particularly children, and full respect for international humanitarian law must be a priority. Ending the conflict depends on a political solution that guarantees that the destruction witnessed during the last nine months will not be repeated, he added., GENG SHUANG (China), emphasizing that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is deteriorating, said that resolving the crisis through political means is in the best interests of the countries concerned and the entire international community. He encouraged the parties to resume negotiations as soon as possible, while the international community must adhere to a people-centred approach and spare no effort to limit the spillover effects of the crisis. The parties should uphold international humanitarian law, avoid attacks on civilians and infrastructure and eliminate security risks to nuclear facilities and supplies. It is crucial to avoid misunderstanding and miscalculations, and to remain vigilant to the risks of bloc confrontation. With the Ukrainian people facing a tough winter, humanitarian agencies should help restore damaged infrastructure and provide winter supplies and heating. Children in particular must be given protection. China rejects the politicization of food and energy issues and opposes unilateral sanctions, he added, also calling on the parties to the conflict to respect the basic rights of prisoners of war under international law., LISA A. CARTY (United States) commended the Government and the people of Ukraine for their tremendous resilience and resolve. Highlighting the work of the humanitarian community, she noted that over the last 10 months of war, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations have delivered principled humanitarian aid under difficult circumstances. Aid agencies in Ukraine managed to implement the largest humanitarian cash assistance programme in history, transferring more than $1 billion to 6 million people. Pointing out that since 24 February, the United States has provided over $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid, she noted that more assistance will be needed. In this regard, she commended the initiative of France to hold an international conference focused on Ukraine’s resilience on 13 December. Commending the efforts of the United Nations to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative, she noted that it has helped to lower food prices and ensure wheat purchased by the World Food Programme (WFP) reaches vulnerable people in Yemen, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Somalia., MONA JUUL (Norway), underscoring that the war has led to massive displacement, expressed concern over the risk of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking. She condemned the fact that thousands of Ukrainian children have reportedly been transferred to the Russian Federation for adoption and naturalization through simplified and accelerated procedures, without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. She reiterated Norway’s call for safe, rapid, and unimpeded, humanitarian access to all people in need, adding that children’s needs must be at the centre of the humanitarian response. She also expressed concern over the role of the Wagner Group in the conflict, saying that it is reportedly recruiting convicts from prisons in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. She went on to welcome the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative., JAYNE JEPKORIR TOROITICH (Kenya) welcomed the recent agreement to roll over the Black Sea Grain initiative, but warned that food security in Africa has deteriorated and might get worse if fertiliser costs remain high due to the war. The consequences are being felt on family dining tables as farmers pass along their higher costs and grow less food. Moreover, as their strategic grain reserves run low, rich countries will probably return to the food markets to restock in 2023 and 2024 just as African farmers might still be struggling to afford fertiliser. Food prices could then rise so sharply that widespread humanitarian suffering will be the result, she said, recalling violent uprisings in 2011 that were credibly linked to high food prices. Calling for “visible action against the fear of sanctions exposure by the banking and insurance industries in dealing with food and fertiliser supply chains,” she added that countries through which these commodities are shipped must remove all official and unofficial blockading actions to reflect their humanitarian responsibility. She went on to call for responsible leadership that can embrace discreet and even secret diplomatic channels, as well as a fundamental reset of the European security order., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the primary cause of the crisis is the years’ long crimes by Ukraine against civilians and children in Donbass, something that the West is shamefully trying to hide. Since 2014, Ukrainian shots and shelling in that region have killed more than 250 children, including 140 in the beginning of 2022. The Ukrainian army is continuing to fire on peaceful civilians there, he added. Western colleagues are also ignoring that children in Donbass are target practice for Ukrainian neo-Nazis and a target audience for poisonous neo-Nazi and Russophobic propaganda. As a result, a whole generation of children and adolescents have grown up with a warped psychology, thinking that their aim is to kill everyone who speaks Russian. He recalled that in July, the Russian Federation informed the Secretary-General and the Executive Director of UNICEF of a notorious website where neo-nationalists are posting the personal data of the enemies of Ukraine, including children. He asked what UNICEF has done since it received that request., Noting that a significant majority of Member States expressed interest in a diplomatic settlement, he said that the Russian Federation is willing to conduct negotiations aimed at eradicating the root causes that forced it to start its military operation. The Ukrainian people are being used by the West and by the criminal Ukrainian regime as cannon fodder, but the West is not interested in a political and diplomatic settlement, as evidenced by the results of a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Bucharest on 29 and 30 November and the expansion of weapons deliveries to Kyiv. Pointing to Ukraine’s prohibition of the activities of religious centres affiliated with the Russian Federation, he said that such action is essentially a ban on freedom of religion. “Our Western colleagues for an eight-year period have created an anti-Russian monster in Ukraine,” he continued. If the Russian Federation’s aims cannot be achieved peacefully and if Ukraine cannot become a normal, good-neighbourly State, then that aim will have to be achieved militarily. The responsibility for civilians must be borne by the Zelenskyy regime and its Western sponsors. Until Kyiv and the West understands this, the Russian Federation will protect its interests with all logistical and military means available to it, he said., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland), emphasizing that international humanitarian law must be respected, said the Russian Federation often says that it attacks military targets or infrastructure that supports the Ukrainian military, but the images of people living in the dark, queuing for food and huddling together to stay warm tell a different story. It is simply inhumane for the Russian Federation to restrict humanitarian access, he emphasized, adding that the war is robbing millions of young Ukrainians of their childhoods and their futures. Moreover, a new wave of displacement will exacerbate concerns for the protection of women and children. He voiced his support for the calls from the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict for swift and rigorous investigations into conflict-related violence in Ukraine, including mass rape and the rape of children. He also renewed Ireland’s call for the Russian Federation to cease hostilities, withdraw its forces and commit to resolving outstanding issues peacefully and in line with the Charter of the United Nations., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) said that in places like Mykolaiv and Kherson, the lack of electricity, running water, and heating in addition to the scarcity of food and medicine are stressing humanitarian response efforts. Winter also brings new and unforeseen dangers, as landmines and unexploded munitions are now concealed by snow and ice, with the lack of heating driving people — including children — to gather firewood in forests littered with hidden explosives. Citing the risk of a lost generation of students that are denied opportunity, he noted schooling provides an important source of stability and peer-bonding that children desperately need as they cope with the intense trauma of the war. Since September, it is estimated that approximately 2.6 million children in Ukraine have been learning online due to the impacts of war on education — yet even this remote access has been disrupted by blackouts and emergency power cuts resulting from the conflict’s impact on energy infrastructure. He was heartened to see the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) latest global food price index, which showed a modest decrease in global food prices due in part to the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, welcoming the donation of 260,000 metric tons of Russian Federation fertilizer and the news of the first shipment that is destined for Malawi. The Council must encourage dialogue and foster an environment that is conducive to a cessation of hostilities., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) expressed concern over the new wave of missile attacks that began yesterday and have reportedly claimed civilian lives — at a critical time when temperatures are dropping and many homes are already without access to heating or water. She strong condemned all forms of violations against the rights of children and voiced support for investigations into such cases to avoid impunity against children in Ukraine. She called for international support for the restoration of Ukraine’s damaged energy and water infrastructure, expressing hope that the international conference announced by the French Government to be held in Paris on 13 December will help to mobilize resources to augment the efforts of the United Nations humanitarian agencies and further enhance resilience in Ukraine. While a third world war has been kept at bay, she noted the war in Ukraine has had far-reaching global consequences, welcoming reports on the progress being made to resume ammonia exports through the Black Sea port. The unimpeded export of Ukrainian grain and Russian fertilizers are critical to avoid a rebound in global food price increases and avert a food shortage in the coming months. She further noted that the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian Federation forces from the internationally recognized territories of Ukraine would provide a much-needed window for diplomatic consultations towards a peaceful and comprehensive settlement., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) recalled that yesterday was the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum in which Ukraine delivered its nuclear arsenal and, in exchange, the Russian Federation committed to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. However, the only “celebration” yesterday was the barrage of missiles against Ukraine and a continued effort to cripple Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Noting that the Russian Federation says it does not target civilians, he pointed out: “The truth is that the only civilians not under attack are those 17,000 already killed.” Still, the aggression has failed to break Ukraine and has only bolstered its resistance and national identity. Reporting that out of 6 million children affected by the war, 3.4 million are in need of child-protection care, he commended the efforts of the United Nations and its humanitarian partners in delivering critical assistance. Highlighting the soaring evidence of war crimes committed against the civilian population by Russian Federation forces, he underlined the importance of ensuring accountability. He thus emphasized that the only way to stop the war is by the withdrawal of all Russian forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine, adding that the dialogue should be conducted in freedom and not under coercion., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that the devastating humanitarian impact of the systematic strikes on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure and civilian centres presents a potentially catastrophic situation for civilians as winter begins and people are left without power and shelter. Pointing out the appalling impact the war on children across Ukraine, she noted that millions have been forced to flee their homes, over 500 schools have been destroyed or damaged and thousands of children have been reported to have been forcibly taken to the Russian Federation. Also spotlighting the credible allegations of sexual violence against children by Russian forces, she said that the inflicted trauma will last for generations. She underlined the consistency of the Council’s response in calling for an end of the conflict and for peace. However, the Russian Federation has not been listening. It is time for the Russian Federation to end the war in Ukraine, withdraw from its territory and commit to dialogue and negotiations, she stressed., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India), Council President for December, speaking in her national capacity, expressed concern about recent attacks on civilians resulting in the loss of lives and homelessness, particularly for women, children and the elderly. While the protection of the rights of the child is the primary responsibility of national Governments, the international community has the obligation to do its utmost to provide succour to children affected by conflict. As well, this conflict is not just limited to Europe but has exacerbated concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security, particularly in developing countries. Spotlighting the critical issues of equity, affordability and accessibility for the global South, she stressed: “Open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination.” India has been providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and economic support to neighbours in the global South, including the exporting of more than 1.8 million tons of wheat to countries in need, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan and Yemen. She also noted that the conflict has also affected foreign students, including those from India. Her country facilitated the safe return of 22,500 Indian nationals, most of them students studying in Ukraine, she reported, expressing her appreciation for the relaxations made by the Ukrainian Government for this academic year in respect of medical students., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said the aggressor will be defeated, the Moscow dictatorship will fail and war criminals will be held to account. While the Russian Federation tries to convince the Council of its desire for peace, it launched 70 missiles on 5 December, from both aircraft and ships, to harm Ukrainian infrastructure, with fragments found in the Republic of Moldova. The Russian Federation’s missile terror threatens not only to Ukraine, but neighbouring countries. Welcoming the meeting in Paris scheduled for 13 December, he said that it speaks volumes that Moscow decided to attack Ukrainian infrastructure on the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum. Citing a letter once sent from former President Boris Yeltsin to former President William J. Clinton, he said that the post-Soviet transformation in the Russian Federation was not accompanied by the dismantling of an authoritarian style of leadership. After the imminent defeat of the Russian Federation, “de-Putinization” must follow, as Moscow has neither the moral nor legal grounds to possess nuclear weapons, he said., A so-called “peace à la Kremlin” will be based on a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, as troops leave behind mass graves and torture chambers, he said. He condemned the vile practice of family separation, with 12,300 children deported to the Russian Federation or occupied territories and demanded information on their fate. The United Nations authorities and the international community must not remain silent on such crimes. Citing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s November peace plan, he invited Member States to take leadership and participate in any of its 10 points. Citing the representative of Kenya’s comments on food security, he said that the only root cause of the problem is the Russian Federation’s war on Ukraine. He also pointed to the Grain from Ukraine programme, the 4 December shipment of 25,000 tons to Ethiopia, and forthcoming shipments of 60,000 tons for Somalia and Sudan. Calling on the international community to harbour no illusions about Moscow’s desire for peace, as that society is ruled by war criminals and hatred, he encouraged responsible nations to deprive Moscow of fossil-fuel revenues to fund the war. Moscow can only be forced into to peace, as that is the only language they respond to, he said., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), also speaking for Estonia and Lithuania, stressed that there must be no impunity for the Russian Federation’s crimes in Ukraine. The international community will hold its perpetrators accountable for their crime of aggression and all other atrocity crimes, so it is imperative to continue documenting and properly storing evidence, as well as reporting regularly on all war crimes committed throughout Ukraine. There is currently no international court or tribunal that could bring the Russian Federation’s top political and military leadership to account for committing those crimes. As such, a special international tribunal for the punishment of the crime of aggression against Ukraine must be established to fill that jurisdictional loophole. In aiding Ukraine, Baltic States are leading, based on their share of gross domestic product (GDP), he said, calling on all relevant United Nations institutions and the international community to continue their life-saving efforts. Moreover, survivors’ access to comprehensive services, including medical and psychological support must be ensured., The Russian aggression is the direct cause of the current global food insecurity, and not the sanctions that are aimed to stop and to end the aggression, he emphasized, calling on the Russian Federation to stop prolonging the inspection of vessels heading to and from the Black Sea ports and thereby preventing Ukrainian grain and foodstuffs from reaching millions of people. Voicing support for the Secretary-General’s Black Sea Grain Initiative, work of the Joint Coordination Centre and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in facilitating trade in food and fertilizers to alleviate global food insecurity, he called for transparency in that important work. Unhindered freedom of navigation in the Black Sea is the only practical way to ensure reliable flow of Ukraine’s grain and other food staples. “In order to achieve that, Russia must immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders,” he stressed., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said that in most conflicts, a humanitarian crisis accompanies military aggression. In this case, however, the Russian Federation is deliberately using the humanitarian crisis as a weapon of war. This constitutes a war crime and a blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. Besides hosting and supporting the biggest community of Ukrainian refugees, Poland is serving as a hub for international humanitarian assistance going into Ukraine. Seventy-seven per cent of Poles have been involved in various kinds of assistance to Ukraine and to Ukrainian refugees, with about 200,000 refugee children in Polish schools and 35,000 in preschool. Further, over 2,500 Polish and Ukrainian teachers have used special language courses in order to facilitate their communication with children from Ukraine to enable them to better respond to their educational needs., He went on to say that Poland is also giving attention to the needs of children with disabilities and, inside Ukraine, building temporary housing for 20,000 internally displaced persons at an estimated cost of €75 million. Strongly condemning the use of harsh winter conditions as a weapon of war, and strongly urging the Russian Federation to end its war of choice, he said that war cannot be hidden from children, as they are traumatized as much as, and sometimes more so than, adults. Citing a message from a 7‑year‑old girl wishing for peace, he stressed that it was high time to deliver that hope. “There is one State in this room that can make it happen, if it chooses to,” he added., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) highlighted the Russian Federation’s systematic attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure far from the frontline — with a special focus on disrupting basic services, such as electricity, water and heat, during winter. Quoting the Minster for Foreign Affairs of Germany, she said that “the Russian President uses the cold as a weapon of war”, attacking the most vulnerable in Ukraine. Such attacks are blatant breaches of international humanitarian law. She underlined the importance of coordinating all support for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure among international partners and allies. After the successful Group of 7 plus Foreign Ministers meeting in Bucharest, the summit in Paris on 13 December will be the next important step., She also reported that the Chancellor of Germany spoke with the President of the Russian Federation and urged the swift withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine as a precondition to any diplomatic solution. Welcoming the President of Ukraine’s 10-point peace formula, she said that Germany will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, and reaffirmed her country’s commitment to its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. “Russia needs to reverse its course and immediately and unconditionally stop its aggression and withdraw its troops,” she emphasized., BJÖRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, reiterated the need to respect humanitarian law and enable unhindered humanitarian access. Attacks around nuclear power plants are bringing the world to the brink of a nuclear disaster. As temperatures drop below zero, the Russian Federation’s brutal and unlawful attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure not only add to growing evidence of war crimes but are also creating a humanitarian catastrophe. The Russian Federation is obstructing access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, he said, adding that the situation is most severe near the frontlines and in newly liberated areas. Expressing deep concern at the immense scars being left on the mental health and psychosocial well-being of the Ukrainian people, he emphasized the need to maintain well-targeted humanitarian support for the most vulnerable children as well as sustained support for relevant international actors such as UNICEF, Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict and the Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict., Underlining the global consequences of the Russian Federation’s aggression, he said that the targeting and destruction of Ukraine’s agricultural production infrastructure, as well as grain looting and the obstruction of exports, are exacerbating hunger and food insecurity worldwide. Together with the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the European Union’s Solidarity Lanes initiative is making a difference, enabling Ukraine to export 29 million tons of grain and other foodstuffs, including to Ethiopia and Somalia. The Russian Federation must be held to account for its horrific crimes and pay financially for the devastation it has caused. Further, it must immediately and unconditionally withdraw its military forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. While Ukraine has indicated that it is ready for a just peace, and the European Union supports all meaningful efforts in that direction, the Russian Federation is still bombing civilians and critical infrastructure, deliberately blocking humanitarian access and using cold and hunger as weapons. The global consequences of the war against Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian situation are extremely challenging and requires a full engagement of solidarity, he said, adding that the European Union is proud to be at the forefront of all humanitarian efforts, hand-in-hand with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs., For information media.

Ukraine: Russian Attacks on Energy Grid Threaten Civilians [EN/UK],Analysis,HRW,"Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 Dec 2022,"Leveraging Civilian Harm as a Tactic of War; Millions Without Electricity, Water, Heat, (Kyiv, December 6, 2022) – Russian forces’ widespread and repeated targeting of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure appears primarily designed to instill terror among the population in violation of the laws of war, Human Rights Watch said today. Numerous missile and drone attacks in October and November have deprived millions of civilians of at least temporary access to electricity, water, heat, and related vital services ahead of the cold winter months., The attacks have also killed at least 77 civilians and injured 272. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the attacks on November 23, 2022 alone killed or injured over 30 civilians and interrupted access to power for millions throughout Ukraine. The entire population of Kyiv, estimated at around 3 million, had no access to water for the day, and parts of Kyiv, Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa regions were completely disconnected from electricity, the UN said., “By repeatedly targeting critical energy infrastructure knowing this will deprive civilians of access to water, heat, and health services, Russia appears to be seeking unlawfully to create terror among civilians and make life unsustainable for them,” said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch. “With the coldest winter temperatures yet to come, conditions will become more life-threatening while Russia seems intent on making life untenable for as many Ukrainian civilians as possible.”, The laws of war prohibit attacks on objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and violence or threats, “the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population.”, Russian politicians, lawmakers, and other commentators on Russian state media widely applauded the prospect of Ukrainian civilians being left without heat and water in winter. One member of parliament stated that ordinary people should “rot and freeze”, another said the strikes were necessary to destroy the Ukrainian state’s capacity to survive., Average winter temperatures in Ukraine hover around minus 3 degrees Celsius and can plunge to minus 20 degrees., Human Rights Watch gathered data from the public domain, analyzed police and fire brigade reports and official statements, and interviewed an energy company official, two energy experts, local authorities, rescue workers, and civilians in Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kherson, and Mykolaiv, to build a picture of the widespread and cumulative impact of the attacks on the power grid. Human Rights Watch also visited the site of at least one of the attacks that severely damaged civilian homes and killed civilians in November., On November 16, Ukraine’s office of the prosecutor general reported that Russia had carried out 92 attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in October and November. Olexander Kharchenko, director of the Energy Industry Research Centre, an independent research and consulting company, told Human Rights Watch that power was disrupted in 10,700,000 households throughout Ukraine, roughly half of the country’s population, due to Russia’s attacks., According to information posted by DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, as of November 15, the company’s energy facilities had been attacked 13 times over one and a half months, with significant damage. In a response to a written request from Human Rights Watch, the company also stated that because of Russian attacks on power infrastructure on October 10 alone, more than 40 percent of Ukraine’s energy system had been damaged. The company also said that October and November strikes killed 3 DTEK employees and injured 22., On November 21, Kharchenko told Human Rights Watch that after strikes on November 15, Ukraine’s overall power-generation capacity had decreased by 50 percent. During the subsequent week, authorities were able to restore only 10 to 20 percent of what had been damaged. He said it was difficult to estimate the overall damage to any particular infrastructure facility because they are interconnected, adding that further strikes, if they happen in quick succession, could result in an uncontrolled blackout, and could take 3 to 10 days to restore the system. “The whole of Ukraine would be without electricity, water, and heating for that period,” he said., Power infrastructure is considered dual use – military and civilian—and may lawfully be the target of attacks in an armed conflict. However, such attacks are subject to the laws of war, which prohibit indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks. Human Rights Watch is not in a position to assess any concrete and direct military advantage that Russia might have anticipated in conducting the attacks on Ukraine’s electricity and heat-generating grids, nor of any actual military gains made because of these attacks. However, the civilian harm was foreseeable, as is the increasing severity of that harm with the cumulative impact of each strike wave, including on the ability of civilians to remain in Ukraine and survive the winter., The World Health Organization’s Europe director, in a public statement, expressed grave concern that millions of Ukrainians are without power as winter temperatures drop. He underscored that “continued attacks on health and energy infrastructure mean hundreds of hospitals and health-care facilities are no longer fully operational – lacking fuel, water, and electricity to meet basic needs.” Noting that “cold weather can kill,” he added that the winter ahead “will be about survival.”, Human Rights Watch spoke with a Kyiv resident and full-time caregiver for her parents, who described how lengthy electricity blackouts affected her 75-year-old mother, who has stage 4 lung cancer and is oxygen-dependent: “We have a stationary oxygen concentrator at home that becomes useless when there is no power. Without that, her oxygen levels drop to 70 percent within minutes. If there is no electricity for over two hours, we are trapped and all I can do is watch my mother struggling to breathe.” Sustained blood oxygen levels at 70 percent could result in organ damage and death., Her family has crowdsourced funds for a car battery which can keep the concentrator working for two hours. But it is not sufficient, she said, because power cuts can last for hours. A Ukrainian charity recently gave her mother a portable concentrator that has a charge of up to six hours, but, as she said, such concentrators are in very limited supply in Ukraine: “I understand that someone else who is oxygen-dependent might urgently need it soon,” she said. “Maybe a child with cystic fibrosis or another cancer patient. And then what are we going to do?”, According to the United Nations humanitarian agency, the attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure also affected water pumping, “adding to the previous challenges faced by millions of people to access clean water or run their heating systems at home.”, A 34-year-old Kyiv resident who lives with her 84-year-old mother said that her family was concerned about surviving the cold in their flat during the winter, when the temperature in Ukraine drops below zero, as well as about “cooking meals, especially for families who have small children or care for older people, and storing food when refrigerators don’t work for prolonged periods of time.”, The International Committee of the Red Cross Commentary on Additional Protocol 1, to which both Russia and Ukraine are parties, notes that although attacks on facilities that provide services to civilians but also direct support to military action can be legitimate, attacks and acts of destruction that are bound to have such serious effects on the civilian population that they would die or be forced to move, are not. The commentary also states that the laws of war “prohibit acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population without offering substantial military advantage. … This calls to mind some of the proclamations made in the past threatening the annihilation of civilian populations.”, “Russia continues to flagrantly bomb energy infrastructure all over the country, putting millions of Ukrainian civilians’ security and, in some cases, their very survival, on the line,” Gorbunova said., For more information and additional details, please see below.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-attacks-energy-grid-threaten-civilians-enuk

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 Dec 2022,"Madam President,, We have discussed the situation in Ukraine on numerous occasions in this Council, yet the torment it continues to bring to the people of Ukraine and beyond is colossal., Today I will brief on the widespread death, destruction, displacement and suffering caused by this senseless war, ongoing humanitarian operations and the challenges that the humanitarian community continues to face., Over 14 million people remain forcibly displaced from their homes in Ukraine, including 6.5 million internally displaced in Ukraine, and over 7.8 million refugees recorded across Europe., According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as of the 5th December, there have been 17,181 civilian casualties, since 24 February 2022, including 6,702 killed. However, I think we all know that the real toll is far greater., The World Health Organization reports at least 715 attacks on health care in the country, including 630 that impacted health facilities and 61 that affected personnel. These attacks in Ukraine represent more than 70 per cent of all attacks on health infrastructure reported worldwide this year., Since February, 1,148 children have been killed or injured while millions have fled, uprooted from their homes, separated from their families or put at risk of violence., Madam President, winter has now arrived across Ukraine. Temperatures are already below freezing and are expected to drop to below -20 degrees Celsius., The attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including power stations and heating plants, have left millions of people without access to heat, electricity, and water, adding another dangerous dimension to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war., As a result of the attacks on civilian infrastructure, people are being deprived of health care and children deprived of education. In Ukraine today, the ability of civilians to survive is under attack., Amid freezing temperatures and destruction, people at the highest risk are the already vulnerable – among them, the elderly, those with disabilities and the many millions displaced to which I referred earlier – because of a lack of essential services., International humanitarian law speaks for itself: Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population must be protected; Constant care must be taken to spare civilians and civilian objects throughout all military operations., Gender-based violence targeting women and girls continues to be pervasive, and we are very clearly under-reporting., Madam President, our work is to safeguard life and preserve dignity., The humanitarian community remains committed, still, to stay and deliver., Almost 690 humanitarian partners – the majority of which are local, frontline organizations – have provided life-critical aid and protection services to 13.5 million people., These are terrifying statistics., I have profound gratitude for their endurance and commitment to the response., They are working against the clock to support civilians with vital services and supplies for the winter., Over the past few months, in preparation for the winter, humanitarians have provided more than 630,000 civilians with different kinds of direct winter assistance, and 400 generators have been distributed to critical facilities., Since October, the sustained attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have created a new level of need that impacts the whole country and increases the needs caused by the war. The scale of destruction of the electrical and heating infrastructure requires the international community’s enhanced support to the Government of Ukraine beyond what humanitarians can provide. And indeed there are discussions to this end in Kyiv and elsewhere., In recent weeks, more areas have become accessible in eastern and southern oblasts, allowing humanitarians to reach entirely new communities with assistance. And we are grateful for this., Our teams are responding and interagency convoys are moving to bring aid to areas where Ukraine has recently regained control. In Kherson, for example, convoys have delivered much-needed potable water for thousands of civilians, medical supplies to treat 100,000 people for up to three months and assistance for women and girls’ reproductive health. And food assistance has been delivered in Kherson for nearly 100,000 civilians., Humanitarians working to respond to gender-based violence, including in particular local women's organizations, also are seeking to scale up the delivery of essential services for women and girls. An integrated network of spaces and providers has been delivering survivor-centered services for women, girls, boys and men who have been subject to gender-based violence., And these efforts and activities which began at the beginning of the war continue., Some 765,000 children – I find it difficult to imagine this - received psycho-social support to help them deal with the distressing effects of the war and displacement. Mobile teams are operating in centres for internally displaced are identifying, registering, assessing and providing direct support to children with protection needs., None of this would be possible without the unprecedented Member State and other donor support to the Ukraine Flash Appeal. To date we have received as a result of that generosity $3.1 billion received of the $4.3 billion required through the end of this year., To date, we have transferred almost $1 billion in humanitarian cash transfers to more than 4.3 million people., Cash as a mode of delivery has come to its maturity as a result of the tragic events in Ukraine., But more must be done to close the funding shortfall. Continued support is critical to sustain humanitarian operations through 2023., Madam President,, While there have been some improvements in humanitarian access, the biggest challenge remains the impediments to reaching areas in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia., Discussions continue between the UN and the parties to facilitate unimpeded access to those areas. It is vital that humanitarians that we get the convoys through to deliver relief items. OCHA has established a presence in Moscow and I continue to personally engage key interlocutors for access, in Moscow, in Kyiv, and in meetings elsewhere., Today, of the 13.5 million people reached since February, some one million of these people are in areas outside of Government of Ukraine control. They have been reached thanks to humanitarian partners positioned still in areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, where humanitarian operations had begun since 2014. While we continue to provide support in these regions through our local partners – and there are still international staff in those areas – our response is neither regular nor at the right scale., Under IHL again, all parties must allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need and must ensure that personnel have the freedom of movement required for their work., In areas where the Government of Ukraine has recently regained control, the presence of landmines and explosive remnants of war is a major concern for communities and, of course, the humanitarians that serve them and causes delays and impediments in the restoration of essential services, including electricity., States must bolster their support for clearance to prevent further casualties by these mines, restore safe access to livelihoods and essential services and allow humanitarians to safely bring aid in. Information on mines and used or abandoned explosive ordnance should be shared by those who know at the earliest possible time., Madam President,, Last week, in Geneva, I launched the Global Humanitarian Overview which is our annual assessment of global humanitarian needs and how to respond to them., At the beginning of 2022, 274 million people needed humanitarian assistance. For 2023, the projected number of people in need has grown to 339 million from 274 million. This is an increase of nearly 24 per cent, or 65 million people have arrived at our doorstep.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",30 Nov 2022,"The following report was created by the Ukraine Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) team in support of ongoing humanitarian operations, to identify current heating systems and the estimated cost of solid fuel items. The report further investigates vendor perceptions of supply, demand and cost of essential items since the start of the conflict and for the coming period., Between November 14-25, data collection experts visited 120 markets in 20 oblasts, plus Kyiv city, to conduct face-toface interviews with local authorities and vendors. For the purpose of this assessment, markets are defined as shops or vendors which supply solid fuel items. In each oblast, data was collected from a minimum of 3 markets in at least one rural and one urban area., The results of the assessment are presented first by summarizing the overall presence of civilian heating modalities. These figures were sourced through key informant interviews with local and regional authorities about individuals residing in their respective oblast. The remainder of the report focuses on the results of direct market assessments through interviews with local vendors. It provides a summary of future expectations of vendors, followed by a price summary for each solid fuel item., The DTM team are committed to providing humanitarian partners with the most relevant and quality data.

The need for rehabilitation services in the WHO European Region [EN/RU/DE],Analysis,WHO,"Health
Recovery and Reconstruction",6 Dec 2022,"Nearly 400 million people across Europe and Central Asia need rehabilitation care for health conditions but most aren’t getting it, warns WHO/Europe, Lack of action risks costing economies millions in lost income, A new report released today by the WHO Regional Office for Europe warns that 394 million people – nearly half of the population – in the European Region live with a health condition that requires rehabilitation care, but the majority of people are not getting the care they need. Rapidly ageing populations, a significant increase in the number of people living with chronic conditions and lack of awareness about the benefits of rehabilitation are among the main drivers of this unmet need across Europe and central Asia., People’s quality of life can be limited by ageing, a health condition – including chronic conditions – or an injury or trauma. Rehabilitation can support these people as they go about their daily lives. The report shows that the majority of people requiring these services are not getting the care they need, leading to an estimated total of 49 million years of healthy lives lost because of a health condition requiring rehabilitation. Some of the key barriers to people’s access to rehabilitation include little awareness of what rehabilitation is, how it works and its benefits, as well as misconceptions about affordability., Crucially, a serious shortage of rehabilitation professionals is stopping people in some parts of the European Region from getting the rehabilitation care they need. The report highlights that there are 12 times fewer physiotherapists, 141 times fewer occupational therapists and six times fewer prosthetics and orthotics professionals in middle-income countries than in higher-income ones., In the Region as a whole, some of the most common conditions that drive the need for rehabilitation include low back pain, fractures, hearing and vision loss, as well as stroke and dementia. As these conditions affect people’s lives, including their ability to work, countries face millions of dollars in costs due to lack of economic productivity and rising poverty and joblessness., “It’s staggering that nearly half of the Region’s population needs some form of rehabilitation,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Rehabilitation is an essential health service that should be available to all who need it and at all levels of health care. If no action is taken, countries risk restricting people’s opportunities and limiting economic productivity because so many are simply unable to fully contribute to society.”, The primary focus of rehabilitation is to support someone with a health condition to improve and maintain their functioning. Difficulties in functioning occur because of impairments such as pain or muscle weakness and limitations in activities, such as self-care or walking., Importantly, rehabilitation should be available in primary health care settings, where most cases of chronic diseases are managed, and in popular community settings, such as homes and schools., “The integration of rehabilitation services into primary health care is important because many people who could benefit from rehabilitation services may never enter the hospital system and may require long-term rehabilitation that is close to their home and local community,” explained Dr Natasha Azzopardi Muscat, Director of Country Health Policies and Systems, WHO Regional Office for Europe. “However, in many countries in our Region, rehabilitation services are provided in secondary and tertiary level facilities that are situated in urban areas, leaving rural and remote areas underserved. In most health systems, rehabilitation has not been fully or effectively integrated into primary health care. This needs to change.”, There is progress, but much more is needed to make rehabilitation more widely available, Evidence shows that rehabilitation activities are cost-effective and help to achieve and maintain the best outcomes of other health interventions. Crucially, access to rehabilitation supports the realization of the right of all people to health., Progress has been made in recent years to ensure rehabilitation is more readily available to people who need it. In some countries, it is now available in emergency settings and there are concrete actions to support people with long-term care., In addition, long COVID has shone a spotlight on rehabilitation, as countries are now recognizing how serious the condition is and the key role that rehabilitation services can play in supporting people living with it., Research shows that rehabilitation has the potential to avoid costly hospitalization and reduce the time spent in a hospital, decrease re-admissions and lower the risks of complications due to health problems. By improving physical, mental and social functions, and the ability to participate in everyday life, rehabilitation cuts the costs of ongoing care and supports individuals to participate in education and employment., The WHO Regional Office for Europe is urging countries to:, “Most of us will either require rehabilitation at some point in our lives or know someone very close to us who does,” concluded Dr Kluge. “Rehabilitation can have a life-transforming impact on individuals and their loved ones, reducing pain, optimizing independence, supporting mental well-being, empowering people and enabling participation in work or education, and thus helping people and communities to thrive.”, Media Contacts, Ramy Srour

"“I Used To Have A Home”: Older People’s Experience of War, Displacement, And Access To Housing in Ukraine [EN/RU/UK]",Analysis,Amnesty,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",6 Dec 2022,"Ukraine: Older people face heightened risks, unable to access housing in displacement following Russian invasion – new report, Older people in Ukraine have been disproportionately impacted by death and injury during Russia’s invasion and are unable to access housing on an equal basis with others after being displaced, Amnesty International said in a new report today., The report, ‘I used to have a home’: Older people’s experience of war, displacement, and access to housing in Ukraine, documents how older people often remain in or are unable to flee conflict-affected areas, exposing them to harm and dangerous living conditions in severely damaged housing. Those who do flee often cannot afford to cover rental costs, while thousands have had to stay in overstretched state institutions, which do not have enough staff to provide the necessary level of care., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has had a devastating impact on civilians of all ages, threatens the physical security of older people and has forced millions from their homes. Ultimately, the most expedient way to protect the rights of older civilians in Ukraine is for Russia to end its unlawful war., “Russia’s devastating invasion is having a disproportionate impact on older people in Ukraine, with many staying behind in areas where they regularly come in harm’s way from relentless ground and air attacks,” said Laura Mills, researcher on older people and people with disabilities at Amnesty International., “Older people are often either staying in unsafe homes or, when they are able to flee, end up in shelters that do not have adequate resources to meet their needs, particularly if they have disabilities. From there, they risk being placed in state institutions. As the harsh grip of winter takes hold, the international community must urgently take action to bolster support for this group.”, The Ukrainian government has made significant efforts to evacuate people from conflict-affected areas, including by announcing the mandatory evacuation of around 200,000 people from Donetsk region in July., The cost and logistics of ensuring housing for older people displaced by the war, however, should not be Ukraine’s alone. Amnesty International is calling on other countries to facilitate the evacuation of older people — with special attention paid to older people with disabilities — to accessible accommodation abroad where possible., International organizations should do more to financially support older people so that they can afford to rent homes and, working together with the Ukrainian authorities, include them among those prioritized for placement in any newly-built accommodation., Disproportionate risks, In Ukraine, people over 60 years old comprise nearly one-fourth of the population. Older people are disproportionately vulnerable to attacks: according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which collects data on civilian casualties in Ukraine, people over 60 made up 34% of civilians killed from February to September 2022 for cases in which an age was recorded., Older people, who more frequently have health conditions, are also at a greater risk in occupied areas, where Russian forces have severely restricted the access of humanitarian aid, in flagrant violation of international law., Svitlana*, 64, who was in a Russian-occupied village near Kharkiv, said that her 61-year-old brother collapsed from a stroke in April 2022. He was hospitalized, but the hospital did not have electricity or running water. He was discharged the next day., “They couldn’t do anything, they couldn’t do an electrocardiogram, they couldn’t do an encephalogram, they had no medications,” Svitlana said. Less than a week later, her brother died from a second stroke, according to a death certificate seen by Amnesty International., Displacement and rising institutionalization, Many displaced older people have struggled to find suitable accommodation. Pushed out of the private market by increased rental prices and pensions that are well below subsistence levels, many older people are at heightened risk of losing access to housing altogether., Nina Silakova, 73, who was displaced from Luhansk region, was evicted twice from rental apartments: once in August after she had a heart attack and her landlady feared having to care for her, and again in October. Nina was worried she wouldn’t be able to find a third apartment: “There are no places for that price in the city because there are so many [displaced people]… I don’t know where to turn… Should I go out into the street, stand there and ask people? People will just pass by and think I am an ill old grandmother.”, Amnesty International found that shelters were often physically inaccessible to older people with disabilities and did not have enough staff to support them. As a result, older people with disabilities often had no choice but to live in a state institution. Between February and July 2022 alone, at least 4,000 older people were placed in state institutions after losing their homes during the conflict, according to statements released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy., Olha Volkova, who runs a shelter for displaced older people with disabilities in Dnipro, said: “About 60% of the people [get sent to institutions]. They can’t afford to rent housing, to pay for utilities, to eat. And so we have to send them to nursing homes.”, Amnesty International visited seven institutions for older people and people with disabilities in Ukraine, and found these facilities were unable to provide the requisite level of care – particularly for older people with limited mobility – in part because they do not have enough staff to care for them. Independent Ukrainian monitors reported that such conditions were common before the invasion, which has only exacerbated staffing shortages., “They turn me over only once when they change my diaper in the morning, once when they change my diaper in the evening… We’re abandoned here,” said Liudmyla, 76, who lives in an institution in Kharkiv region., “In a nursing home there is basically no rehabilitation,” said Olha Volkova. “A person will lie down there until they die.”, As Russia’s war on Ukraine continues, civilian infrastructure and services have come under intense pressure. However, the Ukrainian government must do all it can to ensure monitors are able to access state institutions, and ensure that older people living in them are among those prioritized for alternative housing as soon as it becomes available., Dangerous housing, Some older people have chosen to stay behind in their homes. Others told Amnesty International that they were unable to flee because information about evacuations was less accessible to them., Liudmyla Zhernosek, 61, lives in Chernihiv with her 66-year-old husband, who uses a wheelchair. She said: “I saw every day younger people walking alongside my building with backpacks on. Only later I found out from others in the stairwell that they were going to the centre of the city, there were still evacuations from there. But that would have been 40 minutes on foot, I couldn’t get there with my husband. Nobody told us about evacuations, I always found out only afterwards.”, Amnesty International also documented older people living in housing without electricity, gas or running water. Windows or roofs damaged during the conflict no longer provided protection from rain, snow or cold temperatures., When Amnesty International interviewed Hanna Selivon, 76, in Chernihiv, only the bathroom, where volunteers had put a mattress in the bathtub to allow her to sleep, had covering overhead., Hanna said: “Everyone on our street left. The only people left were me and two other older women… One had a disability. We just had nowhere to go. I would hide in a hole in my cellar… On 29 March, there was a lot of shelling, and when I came out [from the cellar] I just saw that flames were flying… that [my house] was burning. My legs wouldn’t move.”, Amnesty International is calling on governments and international organizations to step up support for older people in Ukraine by facilitating the voluntary evacuation of older people abroad, ensuring that older people are among those prioritized in cash assistance, and by supporting the creation of physically accessible housing for older people with disabilities., “As the freezing winter months have arrived, older people must be evacuated to accessible shelters, and the repair of their homes must be prioritized,” said Laura Mills., Methodology, Amnesty International interviewed 226 people for this report, including during in-person visits to seven state institutions. The research was carried out between March and October 2022, and included a four-week trip to Ukraine in June and July 2022., Accountability for war crimes, Amnesty International has been documenting war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs are available here., Amnesty International has repeatedly called for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for the aggression against Ukraine and for violations of international law to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/i-used-have-home-older-peoples-experience-war-displacement-and-access-housing-ukraine-enruuk
World Bank Delegation to Ukraine Reflects on Recent Visit,News and Press Release,World Bank,Recovery and Reconstruction,5 Dec 2022,"STORY HIGHLIGHTS, The World Bank is working on urgent repair projects, including electricity and transport, and planning for the reconstruction of infrastructure and services across Ukraine., Three projects for electricity, transport and health are slated to be approved by the end of this year., The Bank has mobilized around $17.8bn in financial support as of November 22, 2022., While touring a bomb shelter in Kyiv was a scheduled part of Anna Bjerde's visit to Ukraine earlier this month, spending hours in that bomb shelter shortly upon arrival waiting for the shelling to stop was not., Anna Bjerde, Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, together with Arup Banerji, Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe, Koen Davidse, Executive Director, and Roman Kachur, Alternate Executive Director, were in Ukraine in mid-November to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and other members of the government to reiterate the Bank's support and express solidarity with the people of Ukraine. This was the highest World Bank delegation to visit Ukraine since the war began and came on the heels of Arup's recent visit., ""We had to take shelter for several hours. It was quite unsettling, and we only experienced it for a short period of time,"" Anna Bjerde, Vice President for Europe and Central Asia said. ""However, this is nothing compared to what our counterparts and the people of Ukraine have to endure every day."", ""It's important to be here to see the type of damage this war has caused because we're moving forward now with urgent repair projects and starting to plan for the reconstruction of infrastructure and services across the country,"" Anna said., In addition to Kyiv, they visited Bucha and Irpin, two towns that suffered immensely early on in the war., ""I was most impressed by the local government and community members for their commitment to restore livability in their cities and to also provide for support to survivors of victims brutally killed,"" Anna remarked., Ukraine's needs are staggering., The Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA) published in September—and covering the period from when the war started to June 1—estimated the country's recovery and reconstruction needs to total $349 billion. These needs have continued to rise as the war continues, and have escalated since the attacks on civil infrastructure in the past month., Since the war started, the Bank's efforts have focused on supporting continuity of essential services such as pensions, healthcare, education, and social protection through the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) Project, which aims to help the government meet urgent budget needs and continue to function., ""The World Bank will be there, in partnership with others, to help Ukraine's recovery, even as the conflict is still ongoing,"" said Koen. ""The Bank is a long-term partner of Ukraine and has been involved in the country's recovery from the conflict since day one. The Bank was supporting the budget of the Ukrainian government within 10 days."", More than 50% of all economic aid that has gone to Ukraine since the war started, has gone through the World Bank. A total of $11.4 billion, much of this is the large package of grant support by the US to Ukraine, has been channeled and disbursed through the World Bank., In addition to staff still in the country, the evacuated country team as well as other staff across the World Bank Group have been working hard to deliver support to the country., Now the World Bank is also moving forward with urgent repair projects to restore critical infrastructure and health services and to support activation of the economy., During the visit, World Bank and Ukrainian officials discussed the most immediate projects to focus on, including electricity and transport., Almost half of Ukraine's electricity network has been damaged by missiles and drones. ""We witnessed this first-hand, as there is large scale rationing of services throughout the country,"" Anna said., ""We were all shocked by the destruction that we have seen. We talked to the authorities of towns we visited and what we heard was that we cannot delay the recovery,"" said Roman., Other priority areas include transport and healthcare services. Three projects for electricity, transport and health are slated to be approved before the end of December. These projects will be approved under the Ukraine Relief, Recovery, Reconstruction and Reform Trust Fund (URTF) and will serve as a coordinated financing and support mechanism focused on operational delivery. It will operate under the overarching Multi-Donor Resources for Institutions and Infrastructure (MRII - МРІЇ) for Ukraine Facility, which will form part of broader international support to Ukraine., ""It's going to be tough winter because core electricity infrastructure across much of Ukraine has been destroyed over the last few weeks,"" said Arup. ""The World Bank will continue to work intensively with the Government of Ukraine to restore and repair the infrastructure needed to ensure that the difficult months to come will be as bearable as possible for Ukraine's people."", So far, as of November 22, the World Bank has mobilized around $17.8 billion in financial support to Ukraine., ""This war must come to an end,"" Anna said. ""But it's important for us to be here even during these very difficult times."", ""I look forward to returning to Ukraine soon again. At that time, I hope that this war will have ended and that we will be working on a longer-term recovery of this country. Over the medium term, we will support Ukraine in its reform path as it's very important to move Ukraine toward a modernized and competitive economy,"" Anna concluded.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-bank-delegation-ukraine-reflects-recent-visit

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Nov 2022,"Washington, DC (17 November 2022) – Project HOPE – the global health and humanitarian aid organization – has completed an initial needs assessment after the liberation of Kherson to identify the greatest health needs in the city. As one of the first humanitarian organizations to arrive in Kherson, Project HOPE has delivered an initial procurement of more than 700 hygiene kits to those in need., “The road from Odesa to Kherson is marked by villages that have been destroyed and roads severely damaged,” said Artem Murach, Project HOPE’s Ukraine Information Officer who deployed as part of the team. “Ruined bridges burned vehicles lying upside down, missiles stuck in the ground and mines are just a part of what Russians left. Some small villages on the way seem to be completely wiped out. Local people are reported to have been hiding in their cellars for months, without seeing what’s happening.”, Medical needs are high in the city following months of occupation. One former doctor at a hospital Project HOPE assessed told the team that they expect a higher influx of patients from rural areas, where the situation was described as “catastrophic.”, Other challenges that were highlighted included a lack of fuel, water, and electricity, which could especially impact the large portion of the elderly population that has chronic diseases. There are also serious staff shortages and only 10 ambulances left in the city.

"Ukraine Could Face Power Grid Collapse by Christmas, Plunging Millions into a Freezing Humanitarian Catastrophe",News and Press Release,Mercy Corps,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",5 Dec 2022,"Roughly 50% of Ukrainian energy infrastructure has reportedly experienced significant damage following large-scale missile attacks in the past month, the biggest sustained attack on energy since the beginning of the war. The entire national grid could collapse within weeks if the attacks continue, leading to a deepening humanitarian catastrophe right at the onset of harsh winter conditions when energy access is critical for heat, water and other life-sustaining needs., These attacks leave tens of millions in the cold and dark, while long-term outages will also stop large industrial facilities such as metalworks, automobile production, and agricultural equipment from functioning - worsening skyrocketing unemployment. Businesses operating on generators during partial blackouts will have to increase prices to cover their costs, leading to reduced purchasing power for consumers where markets are functional., Should the national grid energy infrastructure collapse with further strikes, as appears increasingly likely, Europe could face even further waves of refugees fleeing the winter cold., Michael Young, Mercy Corps Ukraine Response Director said:, “Ukraine’s cities will become almost unlivable over the next four months: freezing, dark, and dangerous. The implications of a collapse of Ukraine’s national energy grid are potentially catastrophic for the already dire humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Our own cash assistance program is heavily dependent on a functioning bank system reliant on a functional energy supply and the ability for people to withdraw money from their bank.”, “To mitigate this risk we and our Ukrainian and international partners have to purchase more generators and power banks, and find alternative options to deliver cash and other types of support. In the coming weeks we plan to deliver cash to 4000 households to ease the burden of winter. But it’s not enough or sufficient, especially with Ukrainians facing continued bombardment. Attacks on energy are attacks on civilians. Without urgent assistance and protection of the energy grid, the need for basic goods like food, water, and heat will skyrocket as the temperatures plunge and markets falter in the dark.”, About Mercy Corps in Ukraine, Since the escalation of conflict in 2022, Mercy Corps has supported local partners across Ukraine and neighbouring countries, providing urgent cash assistance, household, food and hygiene kits for the coming winter, and information services for newly arrived refugees to Poland. Mercy Corps previously worked in Ukraine from 2015-2017, delivering humanitarian assistance to over 200,000 following the 2014 conflict. Assistance included emergency cash, food, water and sanitation supplies, restoration of war-damaged homes, and provision of small-business development grants and training to help people earn income and support themselves and their families.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-could-face-power-grid-collapse-christmas-plunging-millions-freezing-humanitarian-catastrophe

Participants included regional health directors, hospital directors, chiefs of surgery, chiefs of ICU, and select medical staff, representing 19 hospitals located in six oblasts (administrative areas) in Northeast, East, and Southeast Ukraine., Since February, the conflict in Ukraine has caused over 6,490 civilian deaths and 9,972 injuries, in addition to the over 700 attacks on healthcare facilities across the country according to recent WHO and OHCHR reports. A large majority of attacks are caused by explosive weapons with wide area impacts, which caused 95 percent of civilian casualties in October alone. The staggering number of victims of these attacks has had far-reaching impacts on Ukraine’s health system, which is concurrently struggling to cope with a myriad of challenges, including mitigating major disruptions in medical supply chains, insufficient power and energy supply, and the displacement of medical staff., The MCI training provided a structured forum for hospital directors and medical staff to share their experiences from the nine-month conflict among their peers, learn about evidence-based practices in mass casualty management, review and update their preparedness plans, and learn key change management techniques that will assist them in implementing their MCI preparedness plans with their staff and external stakeholders., One of the hospital directors from the heavily-impacted Kharkiv oblast shared their feedback at the end of the training:, “Now I understand that we were totally unprepared, and now I will return knowing what needs to be done.”, The lead trainer was Dr. Neil Shorney of UK Med who co-authored the WHO Academy Course on Mass Casualty Planning. Dr. Vadym Aristov and colleagues from Kyiv-based Revival Institute facilitated the workshop, leading sessions on organizational learning and change management, and helped organize the event with SAMS and United Help for Ukraine (UHU)., The training was part of SAMS’ larger project with partners Revival Institute and UHU to develop Ukrainian hospitals’ capacity to respond effectively to mass casualty incidents by providing tailored kits of supplies needed during MCIs, facilitating trainings in MCI preparedness, and strengthening coordination among Ukrainian hospitals, humanitarian aid organizations, and health authorities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sams-united-help-ukraine-and-partners-lead-mass-casualty-incident-training-kyiv-frontline-health-workers
CEB welcomes contributions to bolster Ukraine response and socially inclusive climate action,News and Press Release,CEB,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",3 Dec 2022,"New agreements signed with Ireland and the Czech Republic, Strasbourg – On the margins of the Governing Board meeting, the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) signed two contribution agreements with Ireland and the Czech Republic totaling more than €1 million., Governor Carlo Monticelli and Ambassador Breifne O’Reilly, Permanent Representative of Ireland to the Council of Europe, signed an agreement to endow the newly-established Ukraine Solidarity Fund with €1 million in funding., Championed by the Irish authorities during CEB’s 2022 Joint Meeting in Dublin, the Ukraine Solidarity Fund will address social needs created by the war, such as emergency assistance, resettlement and integration of displaced persons and, in time, the reconstruction of social infrastructure., Given the high number of internally displaced persons and the equally large number of Ukrainian who have fled their country, the Fund will support projects in both Ukraine – once it becomes member of the CEB – and other countries hosting refugees from Ukraine., Ireland’s Minister for Finance and President of Eurogroup Paschal Donohoe has welcomed the signing of the contribution agreement between Ireland and the CEB., Minister Donohoe noted: “I want to thank Governor Monticelli for the decisive role the CEB has taken in supporting those displaced by the war in Ukraine. I am hopeful that this specially established donor fund will act as a catalyst for other donors to come forward and make contributions which will significantly assist the Bank’s role in this regard, and when the time is right, that it will be used to support the reconstruction of vital infrastructure in Ukraine.”, Additionally, Governor Monticelli and Ambassador Petr Válek, Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the Council of Europe, signed an agreement for a CZK700 000 contribution (approximately €29 000) to the CEB’s Green Social Investment Fund (GSIF)., This is the Czech Republic’s second contribution to GSIF, which was set up by the CEB to help implement climate-resilient social development in member countries: in 2021, the Czech Republic contributed CZK1.2 million to the Fund., “We welcome the contributions from Ireland and the Czech Republic as a strong signal of shareholders’ continued support and confidence in our operations,” Governor Monticelli said., “Europe is in the grip of overlapping crises, brought on by the war in Ukraine on the heels of fragile COVID-19 pandemic recovery. These multiple challenges are exacerbated by the global climate emergency, which disproportionately affects those who are poor and vulnerable. Today’s contributions from Ireland and the Czech Republic recognise the urgency of the CEB’s unique mission to safeguard social investments for the benefit of all,” the Governor emphasised.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ceb-welcomes-contributions-bolster-ukraine-response-and-socially-inclusive-climate-action

Source: Internal Displacement Report, More details: Operational Data Portal, Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, Since the beginning of hostilities, nearly one-third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes, in what has become one of the largest human displacement crises in the world today., As of today, close to 7.9 million refugees from Ukraine are present across Europe, of which some 4.7 million have registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes. According to the most recent Ukraine Internal Displacement Report by IOM, over 6.5 million people were internally displaced by the war within Ukraine as of 27 October., Data which UNHCR obtains from authorities across the region has not yet pointed to any significant recent increase in border crossings related to the war in Ukraine. However, the situation inside the country continues to deteriorate. It has been noted that returns and pendular movements back to Ukraine have reduced. A wave of missile attacks on energy infrastructure has caused widespread blackouts across Ukraine and a disruption to heating and water supplies. This situation is compounded by the onset of harsh winter conditions and plummeting temperatures., In the neighbouring countries, UNHCR continues to work closely with the national authorities as well as partners to prepare contingency plans with a focus on neighbouring countries. Preparedness measures include the procurement of an adequate stock of essential relief items, including thermal blankets, mattresses, clothes and other items both for the regional stockpile in Hungary as well as in warehouses in other neighbouring countries including Moldova, Poland and Romania. Inside Ukraine, the central warehouse is stocked up in order to ensure that the 10 warehouses level at various locations across the country are replenished.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-36-2-december-2022

Absence of medical care for the elderly caught between the frontlines,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",2 Dec 2022,"As the Russian army took control of towns and villages across Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in late February 2022, those unable or unwilling to leave their homes were mostly the elderly and people with disabilities. Caught up in the middle of the fighting, they coped by turning cellars into shelters and sharing scraps of food with neighbours, while enduring the near-continuous bombings., Now, three months after the Ukrainian army retook control of these areas, people’s medical and mental health needs are still high. Many communities have been left with damaged health facilities, while many residents have been left with psychological wounds caused by months of fear, loss, isolation and proximity to violence. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mobile clinic teams are working in the area to provide people with general medical care and mental health support., Uncontrolled chronic diseases, Most patients at MSF’s mobile clinic are babushkas – older women and grandmothers – many living with disabilities, such as limited mobility and loss of hearing or sight. Some of these medical conditions are the result of age, others of untreated chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes., “We are seeing very high levels of blood pressure, such as 200 over 100, compared to a regular blood pressure reading of 120 over 80,” says MSF medical team leader Dr Gino Manciati. “In another context, these patients would be hospitalised. Here it’s just not possible.”, Untreated hypertension can lead to serious complications, including sight loss, kidney failure, neurological impairment and even sudden death. The lack of doctors, nurses and medicines, on top of all the stresses of living through war, have seen many patients’ medical conditions spiral out of control., “Sadly, we have seen patients with end of organ complications, such as kidney failure,” says Dr Manciati., In this region, the war has prevented many people with diabetes from getting hold of medications, while food shortages have prevented them from controlling their diet, leading to problems with mobility, eyesight, and muscle function, and increasing their dependence on others., One of these is Maria, who has difficulty walking after her diabetes went untreated for months., “We came here [to the clinic] because of the babushka,” says Maria’s daughter Tonya. “She is shaking and has a headache. We’ve had no medication for her diabetes [for months].”, Tonya’s husband, who suffers from paralysis, is back at their home. Like many others with severe disabilities, Tonya’s husband finds it difficult to leave the house and so cannot access any healthcare at all., Support to heal psychological wounds, “When the war arrived on the morning of 24 February, I was sitting close to my window,” says 68-year-old Raisa, who stayed in her home village of Yakovenkove since February. “I heard loud explosions and saw a cloud of dust in the sky. Rows of tanks began to move forward. We tried to get used to the situation, but it was impossible to get used to this amount of shelling. Shooting all night and all day. It was terrible.”, Raisa is receiving mental health support from MSF psychologists. They provide patients with tools to control their stress, which can help to normalise blood pressure, and with coping mechanisms for anxiety, acute stress reactions, and panic attacks., “I came to see the psychologist because I still can’t sleep,” says Raisa. “In the darkness of night, rockets are flying over the buildings. It’s very scary. It’s destroying my nervous system.”, Although most people will recover on their own from the nightmares and flashbacks, mental health support can speed up their recovery. When mental health support alone is not enough, the MSF doctors and psychologists work together to find the best way to support patients., “I am sleeping very badly, I am exhausted,” says 70-year-old Valentyna, from Vasylenkova, whose son Roma was killed by a landmine. “I wake up horrified and see him in front of me.”, Valentyna is receiving general healthcare to help with her sleeping problems, while MSF psychologists are providing her with mental health support., “This war took my health and my son,” she says. “I am crying and screaming. Now he is gone and my life is over.”, Many of the older women who come to MSF’s clinics feel isolated, abandoned, and lonely., “For these older women, the feeling of having lost their purpose in life causes anxiety, and the feeling of having to rebuild a new purpose for the last years of their lives causes hopelessness,” says MSF mental health activity manager Camilo Garcia. “We hear elderly women tell us that they feel like the last years of their lives have been stolen from them.”, “The babushkas of Ukraine have a hidden power: resilience,” says Garcia. “They decided to stay in their villages despite the fighting and despite the bombs. They have defended their right to stay where they belong, which takes courage.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/absence-medical-care-elderly-caught-between-frontlines

As the ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine shows no signs of abating, the human rights situation across the country remains dire. This reporting period was marked by multiple human rights violations affecting both civilians and combatants, including arbitrary deprivation of life, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). It was also characterised by widespread attacks against critical infrastructure which caused the humanitarian situation to further deteriorate.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-august-31-october-2022-enruuk
Update 134 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (2 Dec 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,2 Dec 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) carried out a nuclear safety and security mission to the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant (SUNPP) this week as it steps up its efforts to help prevent a nuclear accident during the current armed conflict in the country, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Requested by Ukraine, it was part of a suite of IAEA missions to provide on-site assistance and support in nuclear safety and security to the country’s nuclear power plants (NPPs), including the SUNPP as well as the Rivne and Khmelnitsky NPPs, and the Chornobyl site to which the IAEA sent a mission last week., Director General Grossi met Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, in Bucharest on Tuesday confirming that the IAEA will strengthen its presence at these NPPs. The Director General led a high-level IAEA delegation to the SUNPP in late March. This week’s mission was the first time a team of experts stayed at the site for several days to acquire a better understanding of the nuclear safety and security situation and of the plant’s needs., At Ukraine’s largest NPP, Zaporizhzhya, the IAEA has been continuously present for the past three months, currently with a team of four experts., During the mission to the SUNPP, the IAEA team met plant management and staff and conducted walkdowns and interviews in the areas of nuclear and radiation safety, nuclear security, emergency preparedness and response, and logistics and communications., The IAEA experts observed that the SUNPP staff continue to operate the plant with high professionalism and in accordance with the design and in compliance with the approved operational license, in particular with operational procedures and safety limits, despite the very challenging conditions arising from the armed conflict in Ukraine, with numerous air raid warnings., The IAEA team also learned more about the loss of external power on 23 November, and the subsequent shutdown of the two operating units, that resulted from attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The site’s diesel generators were able to provide power to maintain nuclear safety and security systems, but there were some plant challenges and there was also an impact on on-site and off-site communications., The team also assessed logistics and spare parts management and reviewed the list of support equipment earlier requested through the Ukraine regulator. This led to a better understanding of site needs and how the IAEA can provide further assistance with regard to nuclear safety and security., The IAEA team’s assessments will help inform the follow-up missions to the SUNPP to provide the Agency’s continuing assistance and support. The IAEA’s initial missions to the Rivne and Khmelnitsky plants will take place next week., With regard to ZNPP, the site continues to receive off-site power through a single 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line, with one 330kV back up line from the nearby thermal power plant switchyard available., In addition, ZNPP site management has informed the IAEA team that they had received information from Rosatom that a further 330kV power line to the thermal power plant switchyard is being repaired and should be ready soon as an additional back-up power line in case of loss of the 750kV and 330kV power lines that are routed from Ukraine controlled territory. It was also reported by site management that a further two power 330kV power lines may also be restored, but no deadline was given. There is no information regarding any plans to restore any of the lost 750kV power lines., Up to 70 mobile diesel boilers are being gradually deployed in the nearby city of Enerhodar to provide for heating of communal buildings, houses and flats. Currently, these boilers operate at a local school, kindergarten and the hospital. Up to seven mobile diesel boilers are being deployed on the ZNPP site to heat buildings at the site. One has arrived and a further three will arrive today., Four of the reactor units remain in cold shutdown, while the two other units are in hot shutdown – enabling them to provide steam to the plant and heat to Enerhodar. The city also continues to receive electricity from the off-site power lines through the ZNPP and thermal power plant switchyards system., This week it was announced on site and by the Russian Federation that ZNPP’s Chief Engineer Yuri Chernichuk has been appointed as plant director. The Ukraine operator Energoatom has rejected this appointment and has appointed Dmytro Verbytskyi as acting director general of the plant, and Igor Murashow as chief engineer, who are not on the site., Director General Grossi reiterated that the IAEA regards ZNPP as a Ukrainian facility, and he expressed concern about the decision-making situation showing open contradictions regarding the chain of command at the plant, which could have a negative impact on nuclear safety and security., There has been no shelling on the ZNPP site itself since 20 November but there has been some shelling in the vicinity of the site. Work to repair the damage caused by the shelling onsite continues, including the completion of the repair of a power cable to one of the site’s 20 diesel generators., Director General Grossi continues to engage in high-level discussions with both Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible., In mid-November, the fourth delivery of equipment to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, organized by the IAEA through its Response and Assistance Network (RANET), arrived in Ukraine comprising of personal protective equipment, contamination monitors and detectors. The delivery was made possible by a donation from France’s ORANO and EDF.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-134-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-2-dec-2022
Statement at the end of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine’s visit to Kyiv - 2 December 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,2 Dec 2022,"Kyiv, Ukraine, Erik Møse, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, On behalf of the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, composed of Erik Møse (chair), Jasminka Dzumhur and Pablo de Greiff, I want to welcome you to this press conference., Since our first visit to Kyiv by the three Commissioners in June, our investigators have carried out several visits in Ukraine. The current visit is the tenth mission of the Commission., In conformity with the Commission's mandate from March this year, we have provided an oral update to the Human Rights Council on 23 September 2022 and submitted a written report to the General Assembly on 18 October 2022. It contained our findings concerning events during late February and March 2022 in the four regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy, as requested by the Human Rights Council. As you will know, the Commission found that war crimes had been committed in those regions., Since then, the Commission has devoted more of its resources to the broader temporal, geographical, and thematic framework set out in our mandate. Investigations are on-going, and we are now preparing the Commission's comprehensive report which will be submitted to the Human Rights Council in March next year., This week we have had meetings with different stakeholders in Kyiv, including the Supreme Court of Ukraine, the Prosecutor General, the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, the Minister of Health, the Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporary Occupied Territories, the Ministry of Education and several other Ministries, government institutions and non-governmental organisations. This week also included meetings with diplomatic representations. In Odesa, the Commissioners met with the Deputy Prosecutor of Kherson region and internally displaced persons., Jasminka Džumhur, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, During this visit, the Commission devoted significant attention to the issue of the destruction of the civilian infrastructure of the country, particularly the destruction of its energy and transportation grids. Both are preconditions for accessing rights, and civilian infrastructure is protected by international humanitarian law. The Commission intends to examine this issue in detail and will return to it in its report to the Human Rights Council next March., The Commission expresses concern about the devastating situation which continues to affect children's rights and lives. The spectrum of their endangered rights is constantly multiplying. In addition to documented cases of violations to the personal integrity of children, mothers told us that children are facing challenges accessing education. Destroyed and demolished schools in many cases, especially in the zone of military operations, prevent physical access to education. Furthermore, the online education system established during the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be used as one of education models during the armed conflict. However, attacks on the energy system compromises this model's effectiveness. Ensuring access to education for children in de-occupied regions, such as Kharkiv and Kherson, is a particular challenge., Destruction and devastation of medical institutions by attacks prevents people to access health protection. Additionally, attacks on transport and energy infrastructure limit mobility of patients and indirectly reduces enjoyment of the right to health. Patients with chronic conditions and those who have need for urgent medical treatment are particularly affected by this situation., Pablo de Greiff, Member of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, The Commission has long insisted that it would take a victim-centric approach to its work, and that this covers accountability in broad terms, including criminal justice, victims' rights to truth and reparations, as well as guarantees of non-repetition. This is the notion of accountability contained in existing international legal instruments. Exchanges with stakeholders this week confirms the importance of this multidimensional conception of accountability., The right to truth in the sense of full accounts of what happened to individual victims, or a more comprehensive account of the conflict, will require proper truth-gathering strategies and structures that may come later. In conflict situations, it is not uncommon to begin the process by the recovery of remains and information about missing persons., In most cases of interstate conflict, 'reparations' is often understood mainly in terms of reconstruction, and there is certainly a lot of reconstruction to be done in Ukraine. But reparations go well beyond reconstruction. The establishment of a comprehensive reparations programs is a long-term process, which calls for consultations with those most affected. While its final design and implementation will take time, there are some immediate steps that can be taken by the Ukrainian government withoutexempting the Russian Federation from its responsibility. Victims have needs that require immediate attention. To this end, the establishment of a victims' registry or a victim-friendly functional equivalent will facilitate access to support services, for example mental health and psychosocial support to those exposed to violence, including displaced persons., Consistent with our mandate, we will continue to investigate violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law and related crimes, and, where possible, seek to identify those responsible. National and international efforts being carried out in Ukraine for this purpose are well-known. The Commission continues to try to contribute to these manifold initiatives. It is important to note that the achievement of criminal justice in circumstances of conflict is a resource-intensive and time-consuming exercise. In its comprehensive report in March 2023, the Commission will also make recommendations concerning the various possible mechanisms of accountability., ENDS, Background:, The UN's Human Rights Council created the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes that may have been committed in the context of the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The fact-finding mission is led by three Commissioners: Erik Møse of Norway (Chair), Jasminka Džumhur of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Pablo de Greiff of Colombia. The Commission is required to present its findings and recommendations, including on accountability measures relating to those responsible for the violations, to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2023., More information about the work of the Commission can be found here, Media contacts:, In Vienna, Saule Mukhametrakhimova, Commission of Inquiry Media Adviser, at saule.mukhametrakhimova@un.org / +43 676 3493464; In Geneva: Todd Pitman, Media Adviser, Investigations Support Unit, todd.pitman@un.org / +41 76 691 1761, Rolando Gómez, HRC Media Officer, rolando.gomez@un.org / +41 79 477 4411",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-end-un-independent-international-commission-inquiry-ukraines-visit-kyiv-2-december-2022-enruuk
Ukraine Higher Education Needs Assessment (25 June – 25 October 2022),Assessment,Education Cluster,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",2 Dec 2022,"Background, The education process in Ukraine has been severely affected by Russia’s war on Ukraine since 24 February 2022. According to the latest information by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MoES), as of 28 October 2022, there are 2,677 damaged educational institutions, including 331 that are completely destroyed. Out of them, 174 are colleges1 and universities.2, Between 25 June and 4 August 2022, the MoES together with the Institute of Educational Analytics, the Education Cluster in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Save the Children and the World Bank, conducted a survey of professional pre-higher and higher education institutions (hereinafter – tertiary institutions) to learn about the current state of professional pre-higher and higher education, identify current losses and damages as well as the urgent needs., In total, 1,247 tertiary institutions were invited to contribute to the needs assessment, including (territorially) separate structural subdivisions of tertiary institutions. Altogether, 749 (62%) tertiary institutions responded to the survey: 252 (34%) are higher education institutions (universities) and 497 (66%) are professional pre-higher education institutions (colleges). It is important to note that more than 90% of the total number of colleges in Ukraine participated in the survey, compared to only 36% of universities. Thus, the results of the survey are very representative of colleges in Ukraine, but not as much for universities. The survey has a good coverage of the Ukrainian student population: the respondent institutions reported a total of 127,493 employees and 1,146,137 students (875,241 university students and 270,896 college students). The average size of a surveyed professional pre-higher education institution is 545 students, compared to 3,473 for a higher education institution. Finally, submissions were received from all the regions of Ukraine, except from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea., Survey highlights, • All the 749 institutions that answered to the survey are still operating. More than half (58%) of these institutions have continued providing their services exclusively online, with another 42% opting for a hybrid format (face-to-face and online)., • In the vast majority of tertiary institutions, nearly all students (81-100%) or more than half of students (51-80%) resumed their studies after 24 February 2022. Only in 26 tertiary institutions did less than 50% of the students continue their education., • While the great majority of students intend to continue their studies, 23,223 students (which corresponds to 2% of the respondent institutions’ student population) already had to drop out for various reasons. Conversely, 1,825 academic staff, or 1.4% of tertiary educations’ employees, were unable to continue teaching and research duties after 24 February 2022., • About 21% (or 165) of the respondent tertiary institutions, reported infrastructure damages due to the war. Most of the damaged institutions are from Eastern oblasts., • According to the MoES’s database, 115 institutions relocated since 24 February 2022 from the frontlines to safer regions., • Tertiary institutions reported financial losses of almost UAH 4.3 billion (more than USD 115 million) for the destruction of education equipment and additional costs related to operations during war time. Cost of destruction and damages to their physical premises is not included., • According to tertiary institutions, the main barriers to the continuation of education for students are the lack of internet connection (reported by 79% of institutions), deteriorated security situation (46%) and the lack of electronic devices for online learning (39%). For academic staff, the main obstacles are the security situation (reported by 60% of institutions), the lack of internet connection (50%) and the lack of electronic devices for online teaching (33%)., • Around 63% of tertiary institutions reported that few (up to 30%) of their students were internally displaced and 91% indicated that few students (up to 30%) were evacuated abroad. For academic staff, half of the respondent tertiary institutions indicated that up to 30% of their education workforce were internally displaced and 81% reported that up to 30% were currently abroad., • The war is negatively affecting their ability to work and study. 95% of tertiary institutions reported that the war and the related psychological trauma would impact students’ ability to study., • 77% of respondent institutions could always pay for students’ scholarships, and this figure goes up to 81% when it comes to education staff’s salaries. This however means that 19% tertiary institutions had interruptions in salary payment to their staff and 23% for scholarship transfers to their students.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-higher-education-needs-assessment-25-june-25-october-2022

The survey has a good coverage of the Ukrainian student population: the respondent institutions reported a total of 127,493 employees and 1,146,137 students (875,241 university students and 270,896 college students). The average size of a surveyed professional pre-higher education institution is 545 students, compared to 3,473 for a higher education institution. Finally, submissions were received from all the regions of Ukraine, except from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea., Survey highlights, • All the 749 institutions that answered to the survey are still operating. More than half (58%) of these institutions have continued providing their services exclusively online, with another 42% opting for a hybrid format (face-to-face and online)., • In the vast majority of tertiary institutions, nearly all students (81-100%) or more than half of students (51-80%) resumed their studies after 24 February 2022. Only in 26 tertiary institutions did less than 50% of the students continue their education., • While the great majority of students intend to continue their studies, 23,223 students (which corresponds to 2% of the respondent institutions’ student population) already had to drop out for various reasons. Conversely, 1,825 academic staff, or 1.4% of tertiary educations’ employees, were unable to continue teaching and research duties after 24 February 2022., • About 21% (or 165) of the respondent tertiary institutions, reported infrastructure damages due to the war.

FAO and Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food launch registration for machinery for loading and unloading grain sleeves [EN/UK],News and Press Release,FAO,Agriculture,2 Dec 2022,"Registration will take place in two stages until 11 December through the State Agrarian Registry, The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), jointly with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, is implementing a programme to provide farmers with temporary grain storage solutions (grain sleeves). Thanks to the support of the governments of Canada, Japan and the Minderoo Foundation, Ukrainian farmers are benefiting from the use of over 30 000 grain sleeves with a capacity of 200 tonnes each, which is covering 30 percent of the national storage deficit., In continuation of this programme, FAO and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food are launching the registration process for 105 sets of specialized equipment for the loading and unloading of grain sleeves. Each set consists of one loader, one unloader and one bunker., Registration will take place in two stages: the first stage is dedicated to the registration of recipients of the equipment; the second stage involves the selection of the final recipients of the equipment as elected by agricultural producers who have benefited from the grain sleeves distributed via FAO’s programme., The first stage will last until 11 December and is accessible through the following programme in the State Agrarian Registry (SAR): ""Receiving equipment from FAO for loading sleeves for grain storage."", Within this stage, potential receivers (operators) of equipment who are ready to provide services for the loading and unloading of grain sleeves on a commercial basis can register their interest. Each applicant is required to provide information on the equipment already in their possession, the oblast to be served and the associated costs for the loading and unloading services., The second stage will last from 4 to 11 December and is accessible through the following programme in the SAR: ""Selection of the recipient of equipment – the provider of services for loading grain sleeves received from FAO."", Within this phase, recipients of grain sleeves from FAO can identify between one and three recipients for the machinery based on the official list generated during the first stage of the registration process. The farmers who recently received grain sleeves from FAO can formally identify the operators that they believe should receive the equipment and should also indicate the number of sleeves that they need to be loaded by the selected operator., For the convenience of agricultural producers, the list of the potential machinery operators will be published on the websites of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food and the SAR., In addition, FAO and the Ministry will hold a webinar at 11:00 on 2 December 2022 on the terms of participation in the programme., Please join via the following link: https://fao.zoom.us/j/97321286492, Useful materials:, Contact Information:, +38 099 090 7582; +38 068 318 0943; UA-Feedback@fao.org, Journalists & editors:

"Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict: Under snow and ice, landmines and unexploded ordnances pose deadly danger to civilians [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,ICRC,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",2 Dec 2022,"Geneva (ICRC)—As the winter freeze sets in and attacks on infrastructure leave people without heat or electricity, civilians face an increased risk of being injured or killed by landmines and unexploded munitions. Snow and ice make these weapons harder to detect while the lack of heating is forcing more people to venture into potentially weapon-laden forests in search of firewood., ""Mines and unexploded ordnance lurk in farmland and neighborhoods, each holding the potential to destroy lives,"" said Ariane Bauer, the regional director for Eurasia at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). ""Mines must not be used, and we appeal to the parties to the conflict to mark and clear the contaminated areas as soon as possible and inform civilians of the dangers."", While mines and unexploded ordnances have been a long-standing danger in this region, the risk they pose has increased exponentially since February., More land has become littered with landmines, artillery shells, grenades, mortars, rockets, air-dropped bombs, and cluster munitions, many of which fail to detonate but remain a risk to civilians., Swathes of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions were already heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance following eight years of conflict. The winter season now compounds the long-term dangers that civilians are facing., The misery and destruction inflicted by such hidden threats is immense. Blasts can be fatal or cause injuries such as blindness, burns, damaged limbs, and deep shrapnel wounds. In addition to the loss of life and injury, unexploded ordnance frequently hinders or prevents access to essential services like hospitals or they make repairs to water and power facilities unsafe or prolonged., Even before February, Ukraine was home to ICRC's largest weapons contamination team. Today 18 ICRC weapons contamination specialists are helping mark and clear areas with unexploded ordnance and are sharing mine safety information with communities and municipal workers. The ICRC is also helping repair damaged homes and essential infrastructure like water and electricity systems and supporting over one million people with heating., The 25th anniversary of the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention is Sunday (4 December). Since it came into force, civilian causalities caused by anti-personnel mines declined by 90 percent globally. The risks these weapons still pose to civilians underscore there is still a long way to go to reach the Convention's goal of a mine-free world by 2025., For more information, please contact:, Jennifer Sparks (English), ICRC Geneva, +41 79 217 32 00 jsparks@icrc.org, Crystal Wells, ICRC Geneva (English), +41 79 642 80 56 cwells@icrc.org, Jason Straziuso, ICRC Geneva (English, French), +41 79 949 35 12 jstraziuso@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-ukraine-international-armed-conflict-under-snow-and-ice-landmines-and-unexploded-ordnances-pose-deadly-danger-civilians-enru

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (19-25 November 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,1 Dec 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Russian forces continued targeting critical infrastructure across Ukraine. Fighting continued along the Armenian-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. In Kazakhstan, President Kasym-Jomart Tokayev won re-election during presidential elections on 20 November, triggering anti-government demonstrations involving opposition activists. Demonstrations took place across the region in commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Meanwhile, demonstrations opposing Turkey’s operations against Kurdish bases in northern Syria and Iraq were reported in multiple countries. In Northern Ireland, members of the New Irish Republican Army (NIRA) held a rally in Derry to oppose the arrest of NIRA militants during recent crackdown operations by British state forces., In Ukraine, Russian forces conducted another set of coordinated missile strikes across the country on 23 November, targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure. As a result of the strikes, 10 civilians were reportedly killed and over 40 wounded in the country’s capital city of Kyiv and the adjacent town of Vyshhorod (Hromadske Radio, 23 November 2022). The strikes caused blackouts in all government-controlled regions of Ukraine, with temporary regionwide blackouts reported in 11 regions (Suspilne Media, 24 November 2022). Over 20 more civilians were reportedly killed by Russian shelling in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions., Amid ongoing Russian targeting of critical civilian infrastructure, rallies against the war and in support of Ukraine took place in Armenia, Austria, Germany, Greece, Moldova, Russia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom., In Russia, six incidents of cross-border fire were reported by the authorities of Belgorod and Kursk, reportedly resulting in the death of one resident (TV Rain, 22 November 2022). These trends contribute to the 323% and 235% increases in average weekly violent events in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, respectively, in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker also warned of increased violence in Belgorod during the preceding four weeks. Separately, Federal Security Service officers reportedly killed three people accused of belonging to a ‘pro-Ukrainian extremist cell’ during a special operation in Voronezh last week (Activatica, 23 November 2022). The operation comes amid growing rhetoric by law enforcement of fighting ‘saboteurs’ with alleged Ukrainian ties., Daily ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact last week, resulting in injuries to one Armenian serviceman. Additionally, Azerbaijani forces reportedly continued targeting Artsakh farmers near the Artsakh-Azerbaijan border, though no casualties were reported. This violence contributed to the 175% increase in violent events in Azerbaijan and Artsakh1 last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., In Kazakhstan, President Tokayev was re-elected with more than 80% of votes during presidential elections on 20 November, sparking several demonstrations last week. Activists from the Oyan Kazakhstan party, the unregistered Democratic Party of Kazakhstan, and the banned Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan party protested on election day in Almaty and Astana. The activists demanded free and fair elections and called on the government to cease the persecution of the political opposition. Police intervened in the demonstrations and detained protesters. The results of the election were criticized by the opposition and international human rights groups, with international observers highlighting limitations on free speech and the lack of pluralism in the country (OSCE, 21 November 2022)., Demonstration events condemning all forms of violence against women were recorded across the region last week, commemorating the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November. Rallies were recorded in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Spain, protesters took part in gatherings in over 50 locations, lamenting the 1,171 femicides experienced by the country since 2003 (RTVE, 25 November 2022)., Meanwhile, in the wake of the aerial campaign launched by Turkish air forces against Kurdish bases in northern Syria and northern Iraq on 19 November, members of the Kurdish community and their supporters held anti-Turkish government demonstrations in Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, and Germany. In Austria, an Austro-Turkish cab driver who had attempted to drive through a spontaneous Kurdish rally in downtown Vienna on 20 November was physically assaulted by some participants, suffering minor injuries., In Northern Ireland, members of the NIRA and other hard-line republicans staged a rally outside a police station in Derry city on 20 November, condemning the arrest of several fellow militants. Police arrested the militants over their suspected involvement in a mortar attack against a Northern Ireland police patrol car in Strabane on the night of 17 November. The paramilitary group claimed responsibility for the action in a statement last week using a recognized codeword. Observers have claimed that the NIRA planned the attack to assert its resilience to the British authorities following the recent arrest of several of its leaders and handymen in MI5-led Operation ‘Arbacia’ (Belfast Telegraph, 20 November 2022; The Irish News, 25 November 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-19-25-november-2022

The impact is clearly visible on the images above, taken from the US Space Agency, NASA, which show the country in almost total darkness on 24 November 2022 compared to approximately one year prior. Regions like Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, and Chernihiv have been completely disconnected from electricity, and on 24 November, 70% of Kyiv residents woke up without power. Damaged infrastructure has also impacted neighbouring countries such as Moldova, which experienced massive power cuts around the same time., Power cuts increase protection risks, threatening the safety and lives of already vulnerable individuals, and put them further at risk through the loss of heating systems just as temperatures drop. Power impacts on critical services including water and sanitation, as well as communal heating, increase the risk that urban areas will not be able to fully sustain the population. Already, various local and national officials have suggested that Ukrainians make contingency plans to relocate to rural Dachas (farm homes) in case systems cannot sustain the population. Risks of large-scale displacement, both inside and out of Ukraine, remain high, with further increases likely as temperatures fall., Following the withdrawal of RF troops and subsequent control by Ukrainian authorities, RF forces have intensified the shelling in the southern part of Kherson. Immediately following de-occupation, over 165,000 civilians were found to be living in dire conditions in the city, where damage to infrastructure is so severe that it makes it almost impossible for people to survive. On 27 November, the Ukrainian government moved hundreds of citizens out of Kherson to central and western parts of the country in its ongoing efforts to evacuate the remaining population to areas where basic services are more accessible and threats less immediate. IOM’s efforts to monitor the location and flows of displaced people, as well as their needs, support targeting these vulnerable populations with assistance they require., Winterization support remains a high priority for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) across Ukraine and in other countries hosting refugees and other displaced people. In Ukraine, IOM is currently providing preparedness support to those in need through the distribution of basic goods, light repairs, financial support, and prepositioning of items to provide uninterrupted assistance throughout the winter season. IOM is working in close collaboration with the Ukrainian government, local partners, and the international community to address the urgent needs of civilians, including in newly accessible and heavily impacted areas such Mykoliav and Kharkiv. In host countries, IOM is working closely with the government and civil society to continue its support to refugees and third country nationals (TCNs), tailoring its response to the different needs and challenges faced there.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-30-november-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",30 Nov 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Ukraine saw this season’s first snow in November, just days after new attacks on energy infrastructure caused widespread blackouts and disruption of heating and water supplies., The onset of winter brings new dimensions to the humanitarian crisis, as attacks and damage to homes leave millions at risk of deadly temperatures that can drop below -20°C., Disruption of utilities and lack of vital supplies continue to impose enormous challenges to people in Kherson and other areas where Ukraine has recently regained control., Humanitarians continue working against the clock to support people with services and supplies for the winter, as well as to bring much-needed aid to areas retaken by Ukraine., Aid organizations are providing generators in coordination with the authorities to ensure energy supply to critical facilities such as hospitals, schools and heating points., ANALYSIS, Winter arrives, bringing new dimensions to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine., Ukraine saw the first snow of the season falling in mid-November, just a couple of days after a new wave of missile attacks targeting energy infrastructure had left approximately 10 million consumers, including families, businesses, hospitals and schools, without electricity, and millions cut off from water and heating supplies. The onset of winter conditions in Ukraine, where temperatures can drop below -20 degrees Celsius, brings new dimensions to the humanitarian crisis in the country and could be a matter of survival for millions of people if they cannot stay in a protected and warm place., Among other challenges, the freezing temperatures arrived at a moment when the country is facing a serious energy crisis, following almost weekly waves of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Despite ongoing repairs, on 28 November, the Ukrainian energy system was able to cover only 70 per cent of the peak demand to generate power. As a consequence, people in all regions of the country have constant power outages, also affecting civilians’ access to water and heating, as the pumping system needs electricity to operate. The situation is more critical in the west of the country and the capital Kyiv, the worst affected by the latest attacks on energy infrastructure. According to the authorities, restoration of the heating supply in parts of Kharkivska oblast in the east, and Khersonska oblast in the south, have not been possible yet due to the exceptionally severe damage inflicted. In the south, an attack on 28 November reportedly hit a station in Khersonska oblast pumping water to Mykolaiv, just a week after it had been repaired. The station was first hit in April, and since then, all 250,000 people who remain in the city have not had piped water., The level of damage or destruction to other civilian infrastructure since the war started, including homes, hospitals or schools, also opens new dimensions and concerns during the winter months. Some of the most vulnerable among the millions of Ukrainians who were forced to flee their homes because of the war are those who will have to endure the winter in collective centres for displaced people. Humanitarian organizations have confirmed that many of these centres are not adequately equipped for the winter and urgently need heating and fuel, in addition to other critical repairs., Similarly, many people who returned to their villages and towns live in damaged houses or have no access to essential supplies, including water, heating and electricity. At the same time that needs are increasing because of the cold season, insecurity and obstacles imposed by the Russian Federation continue to hamper humanitarians’ capacity to support people in areas close to the front line or not under the control of Ukraine. People close to the front-line face immense needs caused not only by the most recent massive destruction of infrastructure but also by the damage accumulated in the previous eight years of conflict in the east., Meanwhile, hostilities and fighting in the east and the south continue to take a heavy toll on civilians, killing or injuring dozens every day and impacting their capacity to flee, if they choose to, and their access to essential services. Across Ukraine, the authorities report that over 32,000 civilian objects have been damaged since the start of the war, including at least 700 critical infrastructure facilities such as airports, bridges, oil storage facilities and electrical substations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-29-nov-2022-enruuk
Protecting civilians against mines and other explosive ordnance in Ukraine: the role of Geneva,News and Press Release,GICHD,Mine Action,25 Nov 2022,"25 November 2022 – Geneva, A widespread contamination threatening the population, The recent liberation of Kherson came as a stark reminder of the danger posed by landmines, cluster munition and other explosive ordnance (EO) littered across Ukraine. The current hostilities add to legacy contamination dating as far back as past world wars and Soviet-era firing ranges. Currently, an estimated 14.6 million people are at risk and urgent action is required to prevent accidents and save lives., Though humanitarian demining efforts are already taking place, the scope of work that can be done is limited. Humanitarian action, however, can and must be undertaken to protect civilians. Two areas of activity are particularly critical in this respect: first, the timely collection, management and sharing of information on contaminated areas to guide emergency humanitarian demining and lay the ground for speedy clearance activities once the conflict ceases. Second, risk education for civilians, which is a life-saving activity in emergency contexts, especially where large population movements increase their vulnerability to explosive threats., Bridging national needs and international support for responsive mine action in Ukraine, Behind the increase in mine action activities in Ukraine has been an increase in funding over several months. Coordination between the Ukrainian national authorities, funders, international organisations, and mine action NGOs and operators is more important than ever to address quickly evolving needs., At the end of the month, the GICHD is organising in Geneva a Donor Coordination Workshop for Mine Action in Ukraine, along with the governments of Switzerland and Germany. This technical event will bring national and international actors to the table with Ukrainian officials to build a shared understanding of needs and priorities. The workshop presents a unique opportunity to discuss success stories, challenges, and new avenues to implement mine action coordination efforts and, eventually, serve as a catalyst to positively impact the lives of Ukrainian communities., Urgently mapping risks for targeted action that saves lives, Drawing on a decade of GICHD support to Ukraine, I can attest to the power of working hand-in-hand with the national authorities and local and international partners to ensure that the required institutional set-up, solid mine action programmes and the necessary funding provide the basis for safe, speedy and cost-efficient operations tailored to local needs., A concrete example is the Mine Action Information Management cell, which acts as a hub, gathering data from a variety of national and international sources, including social media. This data is shared across key partners, from national authorities and UN agencies to mine action operators working on the ground. Access to up-to-date data helps authorities prioritise and target resources to pressing humanitarian demining needs, making further life-saving possible., To date, Ukrainian authorities report that they have already located, recorded, and removed over 256,000 mines and explosive devices as well as surveyed 73,000 hectares of land., Ukraine’s Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA), developed by the GICHD, is receiving daily new information on explosive ordnance located, areas surveyed, and on-going risk education activities., This level of collaboration is years in the making, built on solid foundations between the Ukrainian government and the local and international mine action community. Underscoring this work is an on-going commitment by the GICHD to support increased mine action capacity in country. It is a key tenet of mine action that national authorities must be in charge of their own programmes. The GICHD continues to provide trainings in Ukraine for national authorities and operators, based on identified needs. We see that these trainings are in high demand, with the majority of participants travelling from other areas of the country, despite challenging circumstances. We are humbled by this dedication., Reaching civilians at risk, With the on-going fighting, explosive ordnance contamination in Ukraine continues to increase, posing a threat to civilians’ lives and livelihoods. The GICHD has seen lessons learned from other contexts that show the critical importance of EO risk education (EORE) from an early stage, including across borders, to reach resident communities, internally displaced persons and refugees. EORE efforts ensure that women, men, boys and girls receive information that corresponds to their specific needs, thereby promoting safer behaviours and reducing the risk of injury or death., In Ukraine, the GICHD supports a UN-led working group bringing together actors working around the country to coordinate efforts and enhance the quality and impact of risk education activities delivered. The work carried out now to support and strengthen the national EORE capacity is laying the foundation for on-going efforts that will be essential in years to come until mines and other EO are cleared, and communities are safe., A Treaty that saved lives and that remains indispensable, In 1997, a landmark treaty banning antipersonnel mines was adopted and is now in force in 164 States. During the last 25 years, the treaty has saved innumerable lives. More than 50 million antipersonnel mines have been destroyed, more than 30 States are now mine-free and the international norm against these weapons is well established. Still, as we mark the 25th anniversary of the Mine Ban Treaty, the contamination in Ukraine, as well as in over 60 other countries, serves as an urgent call for renewed commitment, intensified collaboration, and investment that promotes long-term solutions in mine action. The antipersonnel mine ban treaty is – regrettably – more relevant than ever. While new use of anti-personnel mines became rare over the last two decades, it did not disappear; to the contrary, as we can witness in Ukraine and in other recent and current situations of armed conflict. On behalf of the GICHD, I stress the imperative for all actors to uphold the norm against antipersonnel mines, enshrined in the Convention -- in Ukraine and in every country and territory around the world. The lives, safety, and livelihoods of the 60 million women, men, boys and girls living in areas affected by mines and explosive ordnance depend on it., Ambassador Stefano Toscano

Ukraine: Donor coordination conference strengthens support for humanitarian demining in Ukraine,News and Press Release,GICHD,Mine Action,30 Nov 2022,"In support of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, international funding for mine action since the escalation of the conflict in February has seen a welcome surge. A crucial part of a successful response will be ensuring that funds donated are aligned with the mine action needs and realities faced on the ground in Ukraine. This week over 80 representatives from Ukrainian national authorities, donor governments, major funding agencies, international organisations and national and international mine action operators gathered in Geneva to do just that., “The first success of the event was bringing diverse actors to the same table so that Ukrainian officials could share information on the evolving situation and their needs. This simple space for communication is difficult to achieve,” explained Ambassador Stefano Toscano, GICHD Director, “and we are already seeing progress on coordination and commitments.”, The three-day workshop served as a unique platform that acted as an incubator for solutions, action points and next steps toward addressing these challenges in a cooperative, needs-driven and evidence-based manner., ”The workshop helped donors and international implementers to better understand how to best support our Ukrainian partners” Dr. Ferdinand von Weyhe, Head of Division for Humanitarian Mine Action from the German Federal Foreign Office said. “We look forward to further strengthening cooperation for the people of Ukraine. This is also important as mine action is a key prerequisite for recovery and reconstruction.”, Coming out of this workshop, the mine action community at all levels is better placed to support Ukrainian national authorities in a way that is aligned with their needs., “Switzerland continues to support Ukraine in line with the Principles of the Lugano Recovery Conference” emphasized Ambassador Simon Geissbühler, Head of the Peace and Human Rights Division of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs of Switzerland. “During my visit in Kyiv region in spring, I have seen with my own eyes the effectiveness of Ukrainian early demining efforts. However, given the magnitude of the challenge, it is necessary that donor countries provide support to Ukraine’s national efforts. This workshop is an important step in order to coordinate all our efforts and to make them as effective as possible.”, Media Contact:, GICHD: Laura Collier, Communications Manager, l.collier(at)gichd.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-donor-coordination-conference-strengthens-support-humanitarian-demining-ukraine

"United States, International Community Stands With Ukraine's Farmers to Meet Grain Storage Deficit",News and Press Release,USAID,Agriculture,28 Nov 2022,"Joint Press Release.
For Immediate Release, As of November 2022, the coordinated action of Ukrainian farmers, supporting countries, and charitable organizations are fulfilling Ukraine’s urgent need for grain storage resulting from the impacts of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked war, including the previous blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. This supplemental storage provided by the international community bolsters Ukraine’s economy by enabling farmers to store crops – including corn, wheat, and sunflower seed which are critical to food security in the country and globally – until they are sold for export, processing, or domestic use., While Ukrainian farmers continued to harvest throughout this year, they have been unable to safely store their harvests. The Russian Federation’s months-long blockage of Black Sea ports caused a massive accumulation and backlog of Ukrainian grain from last year. In addition, an estimated 15 percent of storage has been damaged, destroyed, or has become inaccessible because of the damage to Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. While the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative has opened up some of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and, along with the EU Solidarity Lanes, has been critical to releasing significant amounts of Ukrainian grain to the global market and stabilizing global food prices, overall exports have been cut in half relative to prior years. As a result, Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food requested support for 15 million metric tons (MMT) of supplemental storage., The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, with financial donations from Canada, Japan, and the Minderoo Foundation, is covering 6.2 MMT of the storage needs. USAID’s Agriculture Resilience Initiative - Ukraine (AGRI-Ukraine) covers 1.7 MMT. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation is providing 0.676 MMT. This combined funding supports the purchase of storage bags, storage structures, and filling equipment, much of which should be reusable for future harvests. Ukrainian farmers are covering the costs for the remaining 6.424 MMT., As Putin continues to manipulate the global food supply, allies and partners have united to support Ukrainian farmers as they continue to feed the world. These unified efforts are a testament to what can be accomplished when donors and the people of Ukraine unite to address surging food needs around the world., This announcement builds on the Agency’s broader effort to support Ukraine’s agriculture sector, the bedrock of its economy, through AGRI-Ukraine., AGRI-Ukraine will provide 8,000 storage sleeves, 29 grain loading machines, and support the establishment of 69 modular grain storage facilities. AGRI-Ukraine is working with 13 Ukrainian companies that will use these items to provide storage services to micro-, small-, and medium-sized grain-producers in Ukraine with a focus on corn and sunflower seed. This effort will directly enable more than 2,000 farmers to preserve their harvest until they can sell it for export or domestic use and earn much-needed revenue, create jobs for Ukrainian workers, and ease the global food security crisis exacerbated by Putin’s brutal war against Ukraine., Ukraine’s agriculture sector remains acutely vulnerable in the immediate and the long term. The costs of planting, irrigating, fertilizing, harvesting, and transporting crops have all risen substantially, draining farmers’ primary source of income and jeopardizing their ability and willingness to plant for future seasons., Launched in July, AGRI-Ukraine is designed to bolster Ukrainian agricultural production and exports and to help alleviate the global food security crisis. USAID contributed $100 million and seeks to leverage an additional $150 million from fellow donors, the private sector, and foundations, with an overall investment target of $250 million., For more information on AGRI-Ukraine, visit: www.usaid.gov/ukraine/agriculture-resilience-initiative-agri-ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-international-community-stands-ukraines-farmers-meet-grain-storage-deficit

OFFICE OF THE SPOKESPERSON, In the midst of Russia’s continued brutal attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Secretary of State Blinken announced today during a meeting of the G7+ on the margins of the NATO Ministerial in Bucharest that the United States government is providing over $53 million to support acquisition of critical electricity grid equipment. This equipment will be rapidly delivered to Ukraine on an emergency basis to help Ukrainians persevere through the winter. This supply package will include distribution transformers, circuit breakers, surge arresters, disconnectors, vehicles and other key equipment., This new assistance is in addition to $55 million in emergency energy sector support for generators and other equipment to help restore emergency power and heat to local municipalities impacted by Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s power system. We will continue to identify additional support with allies and partners, and we are also helping to devise long-term solutions for grid restoration and repair, along with our assistance for Ukraine’s effort to advance the energy transition and build an energy system decoupled from Russian energy., Since Russia’s further invasion on February 24, working together with Congress, the Administration has provided nearly $32 billion in assistance to Ukraine, including $145 million to help repair, maintain, and strengthen Ukraine’s power sector in the face of continued attacks. We also have provided assistance in areas such as EU integration and regional electricity trade, natural gas sector support to maximize resource development, support for nuclear safety and security, and humanitarian relief efforts to help Ukrainians to overcome the impacts of energy shortages., Since 2014, the United States has provided over $160 million in technical support to strengthen Ukraine’s energy security, including to strengthen EU interconnectivity, increase energy supply diversification, and promote investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean energy technologies and innovation. Much of this support has helped prepare Ukraine for its eventual interconnection with Europe’s ENTSO-E electricity grid, including the island mode test in February 2022 that not only demonstrated Ukraine’s progress in meeting the EU’s technical requirements, but also proved to be critical considering Russia’s subsequent military activity aimed at disrupting power supplies and distribution in Ukraine., Specific examples of U.S. energy security support this year include:, USAID, Based on consultations with Ukrenergo, relevant municipalities, and the Ministries of Energy, Regions, and Infrastructure in Ukraine, USAID is responding to nearly $80 million of high priority energy sector procurement needs, focused on the areas of emergency power generation, electric system repair, natural gas, and heating., Procured and delivered approximately $23 million of items to support Ukraine’s energy sector. This support includes back-up generators; first aid and body armor equipment for utility workers; mobile boiler houses; and miles of piping and associated equipment for heating networks., Currently finalizing procurement of $10.6 million of electrical equipment for the restoration of high-voltage substations as well as heavy equipment for power system repairs in five municipalities., Approximately $46 million of additional procurements underway with expected delivery dates in 2023. These procurements are focused on provision of mobile boiler houses and related equipment as well as additional repair materials for the electric power system. We expect this assistance to provide heating for 7 million civilians in 19 oblasts, beginning later this winter., Provided modeling, analytical, and methodological technical assistance to Ukrenergo that helped ensure:, Retuning of Ukraine’s generation fleet in order to fulfill Ukraine’s requirement from the ENTSO-E catalog of measures. Improved the flexibility and resilience of the gas transmission system by:, In cooperation with the Energy Community Secretariat, USAID engaged energy regulator (NEURC) to reconsider emergency measures to suspend the competitive electricity market trading., Provided analytical and technical support to the Rada Subcommittee on Energy that resulted in:, In support of USAID Administrator Power’s commitment of $55 million to support winter preparation, USAID analyzed winter heating supply and demand and prepared a plan to assist local municipalities with emergency heat systems, including mobile heating units, heating tents, and pipelines and advanced procurement of these systems in close cooperation with the municipal governments. Of that, the following has been delivered:, Prepared emergency modeling for electricity and gas sectors:, Department of Energy (DOE), With the increased attacks on Ukraine’s electricity grid and energy infrastructure in October, DOE worked with the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and DOE national laboratories to collate, vet, and help prioritize lists of emergency electricity equipment for grid repair and stabilization., Engaged at the CEO level U.S. private sector and public utilities and equipment manufacturers to identify $35 million of available electricity grid equipment in the United States compatible with the Ukrainian system for emergency delivery. Identified $17.5 million to support purchase and transportation of this equipment., With support from Congress, initiated work on full integration of Ukraine with ENTSO-E to support resumption of Ukrainian energy exports to other European countries in the region, including funding for energy infrastructure analysis, collection of satellite data and analysis for system mapping, and work on cyber security., Initiated work on a new dynamic model of interdependent gas and power systems of Europe and Ukraine to advance identification and mitigation of critical vulnerabilities., Delivered emergency diesel fuel and other critical materials needed for safe operation of Ukrainian nuclear power plants, as well as initiated the purchase of three truck-mounted emergency diesel backup generators to be delivered to improve plant safety in the event of the loss of offsite power., U.S. Department of State, Building on eight years of technical engagement, the State Department continued to provide technical support to Naftogaz and UkrGasVydobuvannya to advance corporate governance reform, increase domestic gas production, provide strategic planning, and assess critical sub-surface and above-ground technical issues that impact the company’s core business functions., The State Department is developing new programs focused on emissions abatement, decarbonization, and diversification to support Ukraine’s ambitious clean energy and climate goals and address the impacts of reduced supplies of natural gas from Russia., The State Department led a decades-long U.S. government engagement to develop and expand natural gas reverse flow (west-to-east) routes to enhance European and Ukrainian energy security. Ukraine is now able to import natural gas from Europe, eliminating the need for Ukraine to purchase natural gas from Gazprom.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/energy-security-support-ukraine

"Between Life and Death: After Fleeing Mariupol, a Doctor Continues His Mission",News and Press Release,IOM,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",28 Nov 2022,"Lviv, 28 November 2022 – “When the war started, we didn’t have time to evacuate Mariupol before it was already under full siege. We understood the risks we were taking if we tried to leave the city, so we decided to wait,” explains Ihor, a doctor with 30 years of experience., Ihor and his wife Svitlana spent three weeks in the city, surrounded by Russian troops. Mariupol became notorious for Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. According to human rights activists, the war crimes committed in Mariupol by Russian forces are among some of the most serious in history., Humanitarian organizations do not have access to the occupied city of Mariupol and have not been able to verify the number of civilian casualties., Before the war, Ihor and his wife worked in the clinic at the Azovstal steel production company. When the war started, many residents, employees of the enterprise, and defenders of Mariupol hid from the shelling in the factory’s bomb shelter., “We had minimum supplies. There was nothing there: no electricity, gas, water, or heating. Soon after, Russian troops started shelling the city from all sides with different types of weapons,” Ihor recalls. “We lived on the left bank where the most severe fighting took place, aimed at gaining control of the steel production company.”, Many residential buildings were damaged in Mariupol during the attacks, but Ihor and his wife succeeded in crossing the only bridge still under the control of the Ukrainian military forces and took shelter in a relative’s house in the city centre., The couple soon managed to escape the besieged city with the first evacuation convoy headed towards the city of Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine. They spent two days on the road and passed through 15 Russian military checkpoints. When they reached their destination, Ihor and his wife decided to head to Lviv to reunite with their daughter and grandchildren., The war forced them into displacement, but it did not change their calling: to help others and save lives. In this unfamiliar environment, hardly knowing anyone in Lviv, they had to start from scratch and look for an opportunity to make themselves useful., Soon after, they started volunteering while they searched for a job. Finally, after several months, Ukraine’s employment centre offered them jobs as ultrasound specialists. They are now working in mobile clinics operating out of Lviv region, with support from local Sheptytskyi Hospital and the International Organization for Migration (IOM)., The opportunity to continue practicing his medical profession has helped Ihor keep faith that all their problems will soon be behind them. He is always glad to be able to assist local community members where mobile clinics provide on-site care, and many of those who go to the mobile clinic for their appointment prefer to get an ultrasound conducted by Ihor., According to an IOM survey, every third displaced person in Ukraine has limited access to health care and medicine. Most of Ihor’s patients live in remote locations where access to health care is a luxury., “We provide medical assistance to those displaced, as well as to the local population, in various villages and small towns in the Lviv region. People are always excited when we arrive, eagerly waiting for their turn; others come to us,” Ihor explains. “We can see that our assistance is crucial because such services are not easily available.”, In Lviv region, IOM mobile clinics rolled out in April, once the local health care system was not able to cope anymore with the influx of people who needed urgent assistance. Thanks to the teams’ day-to-day work, more than 50,000 people in the region have already received assistance in IOM-run mobile clinics., Ihor says that the timely identification of pathological conditions increases the chances to refer patients for appropriate care, contributing to a faster recovery. For this reason, he takes great care of his ultrasound machine. He knows that lives may depend on it., Written by Tetiana Astakhova, Communications Specialist with IOM Ukraine,tastakhova@iom.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/between-life-and-death-after-fleeing-mariupol-doctor-continues-his-mission

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Nov 2022,"Brussels – 24 November 2022 | As the war in Ukraine enters a new phase and winter approaches, Belgium will provide the Ukrainian people with additional funds to rebuild schools, hospitals and other key infrastructure and make them winter-proof. This was announced by the Minister for Development Cooperation, Frank Vandenbroucke., Since the start of the war against Ukraine, the Russian army has caused more than 120 billion euros worth of damage. Countless homes, hospitals and schools are in ruins. One in five Ukrainians have had no access to healthcare or medication since February. Almost half of all Ukrainian children are missing lessons at school. Recent coordinated attacks on power supplies are causing massive power cuts, leaving millions of people in the cold. All this while winter temperatures in Ukraine can drop to as low as -25°C, for weeks at a time., Minister for Development Cooperation Frank Vandenbroucke stresses how great the need is: ""The destruction in Ukraine is incalculable and the Russian army's targeting of energy and healthcare facilities is making daily life almost impossible for many people. With winter approaching, the first thing we must do now is ensure that people’s basic needs are met: a roof over their heads, access to medicine, hospitals that can stay open, clean drinking water, food, and protection from the bitter cold. Children must be able to continue to go to school, safely. As Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the World Health Organization said earlier this week, 'this will be a question of survival'. Solidarity with the people of Ukraine is the only answer."", ""Children in Ukraine continue to suffer the devastating impact of war, including from explosive weapons, unexploded ordnance and remnants of war, and the inability to access schooling online or in-person – many schools have been severely damaged or destroyed and, due to disabled civilian electricity infrastructure, online lessons are unable to function. Moreover, as winter is now upon us, the lack of electricity means that many children are struggling just to keep warm,"" added Murat Sahin, UNICEF representative in Ukraine., Belgium will, therefore, immediately step up its efforts with a number of new initiatives., In cooperation with UNICEF, the UN organization responsible for protecting children worldwide, Belgium is providing support to school-going children and young people so that they can continue their lessons in a safe environment. Nine million euro will go towards, among other things, restoring sanitary facilities in school buildings and constructing bomb shelters. UNICEF will also help parents with feeding their newborn babies and young children., Through the International Organization for Migration (IOM), ten million euro will be spent fixing hospitals, schools, and damaged water infrastructure. A dozen hospitals, all in regions bordering the front lines or newly liberated by the Ukrainian army (Kyiv, Kharkiv and Sumy), will be able to repair the damage they suffered from the bombing and fighting. This will enable them to reopen their doors to patients to provide urgent care. Another priority is to repair water pipes, sanitation, and heating systems, especially in schools., This solidarity comes on top of initiatives already underway since the start of the war. Together with the Ukrainian Humanitarian Fund, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the International Red Cross Committee, among others, Belgium has been providing support to the population in Ukraine, and school children in particular. The NRC, for example, ensures that education can continue in the heavily affected south of the country. With Belgian support - two million euro - the organization provides teaching materials and psychosocial counselling for the children, their families, and teachers. In an already ongoing project with IOM, nearly 6,000 households in and around Kyiv are receiving help to repair, renovate and insulate their homes against the winter cold. The Belgian contribution here amounts to three million euro., ""We expect the Russian army to do everything in its power to break the resistance of the Ukrainian citizens in the coming months. Their attacks on care and energy facilities are clearly geared towards that. This package confirms our support for the people of Ukraine. For many Ukrainian families, this will hopefully provide some hope, in what will nevertheless be very dark days,"" Minister Vandenbroucke said., Finally, Belgium is joining the Ukrainian government’s ""Grain from Ukraine"" initiative, which will send grain shipments to countries with high and immediate needs. The Belgian contribution amounts to ten million euro. This will sponsor shipments to countries such as Sudan and Yemen - countries where millions of people live with acute hunger or do not know where their next meal is coming from. The United States has also already announced its support for the project, donating twenty million dollar., The additional aid now going to Ukraine amounts to twenty-nine million euro. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Belgian development cooperation has delivered a total of 61.5 million euro in aid., Media contacts, Damian Rance, Chief Advocacy and Communications, UNICEF Ukraine, Email: drance@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/solidarity-needed-belgium-sends-support-rebuild-schools-and-hospitals-ukraine

The Humanitarian Coordinator, Denise Brown, travelled over the weekend to Kherson and Mykolaiv, in the south of the country, to see the humanitarian situation in these two cities, meet authorities and monitor the response provided by aid organizations., Since the start of the war and until recently, Mykolaiv had been shelled almost daily, leaving some 250,000 people who remained in the city completely cut off from water supply and other essential services. Local authorities tell us that now, with the front lines moving further from the city, they are finally able to start to repair the water system., The situation, however, is still critical and the city continues to receive people fleeing Kherson in recent days, which has been a trend since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine., Ms. Brown says that, to help the people of Mykolaiv and those arriving from other places, humanitarian organizations, with the support of our donors, are coming together and making every effort to support the authorities to prepare the city for the winter. Some heating points have already been established in Mykolaiv to help people who cannot heat their homes. Aid workers are providing supplies and generators to make these places functional., In Kherson, Denise Brown saw how the supplies provided by the UN and our partners since the Government retook control of the city have made a difference in the lives of people. We expect that, with support of the authorities, we will be able to cover the basic needs of people who have stayed in the city, if we are able to sustain the same level of aid sent over the past two weeks., The situation with water, heating and electricity, however, remains dire, although the electricity supply is gradually being restored., We continue to be concerned about the plight of civilians in Ukraine especially as winter sets in. We are working to support people with services and supplies to make sure they can be protected and keep warm during these harsh months., Donors’ financial support to the Ukraine humanitarian response has been extraordinary – we thank them for that – with $3.1 billion received of the $4.3 billion Flash Appeal in 2022. In order to maintain the momentum of the response and continuity of operations to support people across Ukraine over these cold winter months, continued funding is obviously critical.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/highlights-noon-briefing-stephane-dujarric-spokesman-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-monday-28-november-2022-ukraine
WHO supports Ukrainian health-care system as winter approaches,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,28 Nov 2022,"With half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure either damaged or destroyed, and continuing attacks on health care, millions of lives remain under threat. WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge’s fourth visit to the country this year underlined WHO’s ongoing commitment to provide essential support to Ukraine in the short and long-term., Joint winterization efforts, WHO will continue to contribute to the integration of life-saving humanitarian interventions with the ongoing health reform agenda, as was stated during the meeting with the Minister of Health of Ukraine, Viktor Liashko, and his team., “We express our strong solidarity and admiration for efforts by the Ministry of Health to ensure health system resilience,” underlined Dr Kluge. WHO and the Ministry of Health will expand collective efforts to prepare health facilities for winter, so that essential health services remain functioning, regardless of energy shortages, and Ukrainians have access to critical and routine medical care., In his meeting with the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, Dr Kluge also emphasized continuing WHO support to Ukraine’s health system in the lead up to winter. With millions facing the prospect of winter without heating and fuel, this assistance is essential, as the delegation saw when visiting Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro, not far from the front line. The hospital was just hours away from losing all energy, but the donation of a generator from WHO helped to avert devastating consequences for patients on life support., “As attacks on power and heating infrastructure continue, so will our support to health facilities, because everyone has a right to health and well-being. Health care must never be a target,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine., Dr Kluge’s visit also included a meeting with the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Denise Brown. Dr Kluge expressed gratitude for the strong leadership of the United Nations country team and support for WHO operations. Discussions focused on joint efforts to prepare for winter and address challenges posed by the energy crisis., Mental health in wartime, Ukraine is facing a large-scale mental health crisis, with a quarter of the population at risk of developing a mental health condition as a result of the war. In response to this potential threat, a national mental health and psychosocial support programme has been launched. At a meeting with the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, Dr Kluge welcomed this initiative and highlighted that much has been done in the last few months by the Government of Ukraine and the Ministry of Health to strengthen the response to mental health challenges. Next steps for cooperation with WHO were discussed, such as coordinating the intersectoral response on mental health, building accessible and evidence-based mental health services, raising awareness on mental health among Ukrainian people, and sharing self-help practices and digital tools for stress management., People with severe mental health conditions are among the most vulnerable during the war. Dr Kluge and Dr Habicht also visited a psychiatric hospital in Dnipro and handed over a vehicle to community mental health teams. This will make it easier to reach those in need of mental health care in places where they reside or elsewhere. More cars from WHO will be delivered to Dnipro in the coming weeks, so mental health support can reach communities directly., Dr Habicht emphasized: “Mobile mental health teams are vital when millions of people in Ukraine are at risk from developing mental disorders as a consequence of the war. The delivery of these cars is one more step towards strengthening mental health services nationwide in coordination with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine”., In addition to meetings with officials, Dr Kluge also had a chance to discuss the situation with volunteers who work in areas regained by the Government of Ukraine and along the contact line. They reported massive destruction of primary health care services as well as critical shortages of medicines and medical supplies. Dr Kluge expressed his commitment to mobilize life-saving medicines and equipment to leave no one behind. Volunteers, in their turn, agreed to join forces to boost rehabilitation and psychosocial support in regained areas, where it is urgently needed., Reflecting on his fourth visit to Ukraine this year, Dr Kluge concluded: “This week I have witnessed first-hand the incredible work that my colleagues from WHO Ukraine, the wider UN family, and our dedicated partners are doing across the spectrum of health care. With winter intensifying and many facilities damaged or destroyed, the situation is dire. But we are here to stay and support”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-supports-ukrainian-health-care-system-winter-approaches
Work to restore Kyiv neighbourhoods ramps up with “safety first” training [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,28 Nov 2022,"UNDP with support from the Government of Japan trained recovery teams and local authorities on handling explosive ordnance and hazardous waste while removing debris, Kyiv, 28 November 2022 --- The Japan-UNDP project ""Emergency Explosive Ordnance (EO) Clearance and Debris Removal"" entered a new phase this week to ramp up recovery efforts in the Kyiv region and remove debris from the damaged buildings and unstable structures. Local authorities are eager to recover and rebuild, to prepare neighbourhoods for the safe return of their residents and to provide safe access for recovery and rebuilding efforts., The project, supported by a generous financial contribution from the Government of Japan, takes a comprehensive approach to recovery, starting with a series of inception workshops for local recovery and debris removal teams on workplace safety, handling explosive ordnance and managing the proper disposal of hazardous waste such as asbestos., According to the Kyiv Regional Administration, 46 (about 200 settlements) out of 69 communities in the oblast of Kyiv suffered irreparable damage to their buildings, which now must be safely demolished and removed. In Kyiv Oblast alone, there are more than 200 settlements that have suffered damaged frpm the war. A UNDP damage assessment estimated that there are at least 5 million tonnes of debris in just 40 settlements out of these 200 communities in Kyiv Oblast. Five million tonnes of debris has enough recyclable material to build a 1,400 km road from Kyiv to Berlin., Reconstruction can not begin until debris from damaged builds is removed -- and removed safely. Doing so involves risks and dangers that come with handling mines, explosives, or materials with asbestos contamination. To help minimize the risks, UNDP has organized awareness training on such hazards, which has already been taken by 110 debris removal workers., During the opening of the training session, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative in Ukraine Christophoros Politis said the work to restore Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure is important, but that the principle of ""safety first"" is paramount. ""Building awareness of and the capacity to manage debris and ordnance safely should become a common thread of all projects aimed at supporting Ukraine,"" he said. ""And we are grateful to the Government of Japan for being such a valuable partner in this comprehensive endeavour."", Mykhailo Koval, Deputy Head of the Gostomel village administration, a сommunity near Kyiv that was hit particularly hard in the early days of the invasion, expressed his gratitude for the support of UNDP and the Government of Japan. ""With the beginning of the full-scale invasion, almost 40 percent of Gostomel suffered destruction of varying complexity,"" he said. ""It is almost impossible to dismantle the debris and clean the territory by ourselves -- we are enormously grateful to have such powerful professional support."", Naoto Kanatsu, Second Secretary of the Embassy of Japan in Ukraine expressed his deep respect for all those who are engaged in such life-threatening activities as clearing mines, unexploded ordnance and debris. ""The safety of the Ukrainian people and the future of Ukraine depend on each and every one of you working in the field,"" he said. ""The Government of Japan will continue to provide support for and stand by the people of Ukraine who are facing hardship, in collaboration with the international community, including all G7 members."", Following the completion of the training, debris removal work will commence in Makariv and Hostmel and subsequently in Bucha and Irpin., Under the Emergency Explosive Ordnance and Debris Removal project, UNDP is supporting Ukraine's State Emergency Service with the procurement of mine action equipment to support national responders, as well as debris removal services to safely transport ERW-contaminated debris out of conflict-destroyed areas of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel (Moschun inclusive) & Makariv (all in Kyiv region), and beyond. On completion of the project, when mines and debris have been removed from Kyiv Oblast, UNDP will help the Government of Ukraine provide a safe return for more than a million people who have been displaced from their homes., Media contact: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Head of Communications, Yuliia.Samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/work-restore-kyiv-neighbourhoods-ramps-safety-first-training-enuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items",25 Nov 2022,"Context and Methodology, To inform humanitarian actors, REACH has been conducting monthly Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM) since March 2022 across Ukraine, covering: (i) accessible or government-controlled areas (GCAs), including both conflict-affected1 , IDP-hosting2 and newly accessible areas3 , and (ii) hard-to-reach areas, including non-government controlled areas (NGCAs)4 and/or territories of active conflict5 , and conflictaffected areas with no phone coverage6 .
The sixth round of HSM specifically intended to inform strategic decision-making processes in alignment with the Humanitarian Response Planning timeline, as well as to allow humanitarian actors to get a better overview of how humanitarian needs have changed over time and get indicative information on the areas where a higher level of need or service access concerns have been registered., Data collection for the sixth round was conducted between September 5th and 16th by adopting the ‘Area of Knowledge‘ (AoK) methodology in both urban and rural NGCAs. The current briefing note provides key indicative findings on the assessed settlements in Khersonska oblast. 92 settlements were assessed through a total of 194 interviews with key informants (KIs)7 . Out of these, 39 settlements were located on the right (west) bank of the Dnipro river (these settlements were categorised as NGCAs at the time of data collection in September but are considered newly accessible areas (NAAs) as of November) and 53 settlements to the east of the river (categorised as NGCAs). The briefing note focuses on the 39 NAA settlements west of the river aiming to inform and support programmatic and operational response in these areas., The findings should be interpreted as indicative of the situation in the assessed settlements as of September 2022. While the recent Russian withdrawal from the areas on the west bank of Dnipro river led to a change in the humanitarian situation, this briefing note aims to provide a useful backdrop of information on the situation in these areas prior to the withdrawal, to inform partners currently aiming to set up a response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-november-2022-briefing-note-humanitarian-situation-newly-accessible-areas-khersonska-oblast-enuk
Update 133 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (25 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,25 Nov 2022,"Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plant sites all have access to the national grid again following a complete loss of off-site power earlier this week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., The IAEA team of experts present at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) reported already yesterday that the facility’s external power connection had been re-established, a day after it was disconnected. The ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, is in shutdown mode but still needs electricity to maintain essential safety and security functions., Ukraine today also confirmed to the IAEA that the three other nuclear power plants – Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy – had been re-connected to the grid and were operating to generate electricity for the country’s needs. Power had also been restored to the Chornobyl site, it said., Separately today, Director General Grossi said the IAEA had completed a week-long nuclear safety and security expert mission to Chornobyl, including the Exclusion Zone set up around the plant following the 1986 accident. The mission will help pave the way for upgrades and improvements of the plant’s nuclear security systems. The IAEA experts also gained a better understanding of the plant’s safety and security needs and provided advice and guidance on radiation monitoring., The IAEA announced earlier this month that it would soon send such missions to Chornobyl as well as to the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy sites, at Ukraine’s request. The mission to South Ukraine will take place next week, Director General Grossi said. The IAEA established a continued presence at the ZNPP on 1 September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-133-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-25-nov-2022

"Women continue to pay the highest price for the war in Ukraine, warns IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",25 Nov 2022,"Warsaw , November 25, 2022 — On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) together with the Feminoteka Foundation call on donors and the international community to come together to put the protection needs of women at the heart of the Ukraine crisis response. Nine months since the war in Ukraine escalated, a staggering 93% of refugees staying in Poland are women and children - many of them face exploitation on their journey, or leave homes where they had already experienced violence., As in every humanitarian crisis, the ongoing war in Ukraine has triggered increased levels of violence used as a weapon of war, but also borne witness to escalating cases of domestic violence. Women and girls are not only at high risk of abuse on their way to safety, but oftentimes do not find the protection they need upon arrival to their destination points in Europe. In Poland, the situation is compounded by pre-existing legal barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare., It is an imperative that humanitarian organisations active in countries hosting Ukrainian refugees work with international donors, local and national authorities to prioritise the needs of women and girls, and are well equipped to provide them with all necessary services and support. All actors must unite in solidarity to mitigate risks, including the risks of trafficking, inequalities, sexual violence, or discriminatory barriers in the labor market women and girls might experience in the host countries., Barbara Araujo, IRC’s Women’s Protection and Empowerment Manager, said:, “Even before the conflict escalated, two thirds of women in Ukraine had experienced some form of gender-based violence in their lifetime. The Ukraine crisis is - first and foremost - a protection crisis, in which the vast majority of people affected by it are women and girls. However, it is unclear how much funding is available to deliver life-saving services for survivors and to protect those at risk of experiencing abuse. Donor governments should inquire how humanitarian funding is prioritised, how the need for specialised services for women and girls is assessed and in how far their needs are currently met.”, Feminoteka, in partnership with IRC Poland, has opened a safe space in Warsaw for women who have fled Ukraine and experienced violence. In a carefully curated space, clients find a comfortable place to live, seek psychosocial support and information, take part in workshops on their rights, and get referred to a wide range of support services.**, Joanna Piotrkowska, CEO of Feminoteka, said:, “Having been through the horrors of war, women fleeing Ukraine who make it to Poland deserve nothing but care and protection. Our place is a safe haven for women and their children to heal and to get back on their own two feet. We see that whilst many of the women affected by the war in Ukraine have survived war-related violence, the majority of women we are working with have escaped situations of domestic abuse. No matter what experience, survivors of violence and trauma compounded by the ongoing war are in dire need of specialised services to help them recover, connect with their potential and thrive.”, The IRC launched an emergency response to the war in Ukraine in February 2022, working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. In Poland, we are providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households, improving access to legal assistance and providing a variety of tailor-made protection services, including safe spaces for women and children. Together with Feminoteka_, we join forces to ensure that women have a safe haven in Warsaw to recover from the experience of the war and stand on their own two feet._ Feminoteka has a long-experience in supporting women who experienced GBV to address the needs of the survivors on the best ways; With IRC's support, Feminoteka continues to support women affected by the war in Ukraine with quality case management from a survivor centred approach.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/women-continue-pay-highest-price-war-ukraine-warns-irc

Mobile protection services are critical in delivering support to survivors of gender-based violence across Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",24 Nov 2022,"Author Victoria Andrievska, UNHCR | 24 Nov 2022, Kateryna, a 31-year-old social worker at UNHCR’s partner NGO Rokada, coordinates the gender-based violence (GBV) programmes in ten oblasts of Ukraine and oversees the work of 20 specialist staff., “We see that because of the war, there is an increase in gender-based violence. Apart from sexual violence linked to the war, the war has also triggered a shift in the psychological state of people as they face hardship from staying in places heavily affected by the hostilities or they experience displacement and have resorted to relieving stress through negative coping mechanisms like alcohol abuse,” explains Kateryna., GBV can take many forms including sexual, physical, mental and economic harm inflicted in public or in private. It can include threats of violence, coercion and manipulation, intimate partner violence and sexual violence. It disproportionately affects women and girls, and in situations of displacement, their risk of exposure to GBV increases., “*When people are forced to flee their homes, they can lose their network of friends and family and their livelihoods, finding themselves in new towns or cities. This can compound their vulnerability,” continues Kateryna. *, The subject of gender-based violence, including domestic violence is often a taboo in Ukrainian society according to Kateryna. In small towns and villages, people are ashamed to talk about their abuse. “Victims are often blaming themselves for what has happened, and it just worsens their condition.”, UNHCR and its partners have intensified efforts to meet critical service gaps through a variety of means, such as multi-functional mobile teams, which go to hard-to-reach or insecure locations, where access to social and protection services have been disrupted., “One mobile response team is usually made-up of a few specialists – social workers, lawyers and psychologists, who provide specialist support to the local population. Such groups are in the field every day, meeting with communities,” explains Kateryna. Apart from individual consultations and counseling, the experts conduct group discussions and training on different subjects including gender-based violence prevention and response, and where to access available services., “People in the community can be the first to identify GBV, they see the signs of it amongst their group of friends or acquaintances. It is therefore important that they too can share critical information with survivors so that they can receive the support they need” adds Kateryna., UNHCR’s partner Rokada uses mobile teams to provide psychosocial and legal support to men, women, boys and girls, including GBV survivors, in 10 regions across Ukraine including Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Rivne, Volyn, Lviv, Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk., Karen Whiting, UNHCR Assistant Representative for Protection believes that the mobile response teams enable GBV specialists to reach communities in hard-to-reach areas, which may not otherwise receive the specialized services that survivors need. *“UNHCR is a part of a larger network of organizations that collaborate in the area of preventing and responding to GBV, working in close cooperation with the state institutions in Ukraine. Through localization of our protection services, we are engaging local specialists across Ukraine who know their communities and the situation on the ground. They are therefore best placed to respond to the needs of survivors. We also recognize that women and girls with disabilities are up to ten times more likely to experience gender-based violence than women and girls without disabilities, and therefore we must reach under-represented women and girls in our work.” *, Ten UNHCR partners are engaged in preventing, mitigating and responding to GBV, includuing Rokada, Neemia, Neeka, Insight, Proliska, Intersos, Triangle Generation Humanitaire, Right to Protection, Crimea SOS and Stabilization Support Services. In 2022 alone, they have provided over 87,000 individuals with a combination of psychosocial support, targeted GBV assistance, and training and awareness raising on protection from GBV and Psychological First Aid., UNHCR is grateful for the support of donors, including EU Humanitarian Aid which makes the work of GBV specialists possible., Kateryna believes that this work must continue: “The war worsens the psychological condition of people and as we have learned from the GBV survivors who were assisted in recent months, old traumas tend to re-open when triggered by the stress caused by the war. These people suffer tremendously, often blaming themselves. Some are even children. We must bring relief to these people and ensure that they receive the help that they so urgently need.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mobile-protection-services-are-critical-delivering-support-survivors-gender-based-violence-across-ukraine
Missile strikes on Ukraine and alleged POW executions underscore why international law must be respected - UN Human Rights Chief,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,25 Nov 2022,"GENEVA (25 November 2022) -- UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk on Friday expressed his shock at the unabated human suffering in Ukraine, as highlighted by continuing Russian missile and drone strikes against critical infrastructure on a broad scale, and recent allegations of summary executions of prisoners of war (POWs)., ""Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes. Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked,"" Türk said., According to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), further missile strikes on Wednesday killed at least eight civilians, including one girl, and injured at least 45 others, among them seven children, in the city and region of Kyiv. A two-day old baby boy was killed and two doctors injured by a rocket strike that hit a hospital in Vilniansk, in the Zaporizhzhia region., These casualties bring the total verified by HRMMU since Russia began its ongoing barrage of missile strikes and loitering munition attacks across the country on 10 October to at least 77 civilians killed and 272 injured., In addition to documenting civilian casualties, the Monitoring Mission has been examining videos and other information about alleged summary executions of both Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war., ""Since Russia began its armed attack on Ukraine in February, there have been numerous allegations of summary executions by both parties of prisoners of war and others no longer participating in the fighting. Persons hors de combat, including soldiers who have surrendered, are protected under international humanitarian law and their summary execution constitutes a war crime,"" Türk said., Among some of the videos that HRMMU has examined are several that surfaced over the last two weeks on social media. These include video clips from the village of Makiivka which shows the apparent surrender of Russian forces or Russian-affiliated armed groups; a man opening fire at Ukrainian soldiers; and subsequently the dead bodies of some 12 Russian soldiers., ""Our Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has conducted a preliminary analysis indicating that these disturbing videos are highly likely to be authentic in what they show. The actual circumstances of the full sequence of events must be investigated to the fullest extent possible, and those found responsible appropriately held to account,"" said Türk. ""The analysis the Mission has done to date underlines the need for independent and detailed forensic investigations to help establish exactly what happened., ""We understand the Ukrainian authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the events in Makiivka,"" said Türk. ""It is essential that all allegations of summary executions are investigated fully in a manner that is - and is seen to be - independent, impartial, thorough, transparent, prompt and effective."", Türk continued: ""I also call on the parties to issue clear instructions to their forces that there should be no retaliation, no reprisals, against those they take as prisoners of war and to ensure that these instructions are fully complied with. The rules governing armed conflict set out in the Geneva Conventions demand this., ""Order your troops to treat those who surrender and those they detain humanely."", ""The devastating impacts of the patterns of missile strikes by Russian forces and the allegations of summary executions of prisoners of war show all too plainly the intolerable human cost of this, and any other, armed conflict.

He will also announce that the UK will step up its support on demining, increasing its support from £2 million this year., While in Ukraine, the Foreign Secretary will meet President Zelenskyy, as well as Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, and other key members of the Ukrainian government, including ministers involved in reconstruction efforts. He is also meeting members of civil society who are fighting to protect human rights, and the UK's embassy staff in Ukraine., Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said:, As winter sets in, Russia is continuing to try and break Ukrainian resolve through its brutal attacks on civilians, hospitals and energy infrastructure. Russia will fail., The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. I have today announced a package of hands-on support for our Ukrainian friends in their fight, from ambulances to crucial support for survivors of the sexual violence carried out by the Russian military., I've seen here first-hand how the UK's efforts are helping brave citizens to resist and rebuild. Our support will continue for as long as it takes for this remarkable country to recover., During the visit the Foreign Secretary has seen the scale of catastrophe wrought indiscriminately by Putin, and how the UK -- with its international partners -- is providing concrete support for recovery., Through this fund the UK is supporting the Government of Ukraine, local officials and Ukrainian communities to rebuild vital local infrastructure. This is enabling people to return to normal life by clearing debris from Russian attacks, making areas safe and secure, and rebuilding schools and shelters in towns and villages.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",25 Nov 2022,"BACKGROUND, On November 9, the Russian military announced a full retreat of all their forces from the right bank of Dnipro River; by November 11, 41 settlements, including Kherson city, were de-occupied by Ukrainian forces. Civilians who live in these areas have endured months of combat and occupation. Services have been interrupted or severely disrupted due to damage or destruction of facilities and infrastructure through combat actions, looting of the majority of the valuable assets by the retreating Russian troops, and dispersion of the people rendering said services., Currently, Kherson city and surrounding areas continue to fall within range of artillery, and the retaken areas report multiple shelling incidents daily with frequent reports of civilian casualties. The damage to civilian buildings is extensive, affecting housing and critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, energy generation and water services. Landmines, explosive traps and other unexploded ordnance (UXO) continue to pose a significant risk for civilians and humanitarian actors operating in the area., METHODOLOGY, Following the de-occupation of Kherson and gaining access to the Oblast, Nonviolent Peaceforce Ukraine (NPUA) conducted a two-day rapid protection assessment with the purpose of identifying civilian protection concerns and analysing urgent humanitarian needs in the recently de-occupied area. Over the course of two days, the NPUA team engaged over 30 actors in Key Informant Interviews (18 civilians, 5 representatives from government authorities, and 8 representatives of local volunteer organisations), as well as conducting observations at a key aid distribution warehouse and in a central humanitarian and community hub in Kherson City. This rapid assessment did not directly engage in hromadas outside of Kherson City but nevertheless has implications for regional and rural areas of the Oblast and serves as the basis for further assessment in these sites. This assessment is rapid in nature, and cannot provide a comprehensive overview of civilian needs. The NPUA team can provide more detailed briefings on request and will supplement this initial assessment with updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/kherson-rapid-assessment-civilian-protection-needs-responses-november-2022
Caritas reports missile strikes leave several neighbourhoods in Ukraine without heating and electricity,News and Press Release,Caritas,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",24 Nov 2022,"Last week, missile strikes targeting power networks have left several areas in the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Kharkiv with absolutely no power. With the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine following the country-wide missile strikes on October 10, thousands of Ukrainians are again living and working in a state of continuous danger and uncertainty., Talking to Caritas Internationalis from Kiev, Catholic Relief Services’ Andrew Perkins, who was seconded for three weeks as a Safety and Security Advisor to the Caritas Emergency Response Support Team (ERST) in Ukraine, says that the humanitarian situation in the eastern European nation has further destabilised over the last month. “We had a very large spike in missile strikes. At this time, it was about 100 missiles fired into the country. I was in Kharkiv at the time on a Caritas call and then the lights went out in the middle of the call because the missiles had knocked out the power,” he said. Besides power infrastructure, it is reported that the civilian populace were also targetted during these recent missile strikes., Yet in spite of the increased volatility in the country, Mr. Perkins says he is amazed at the resilience of Caritas staff and volunteers who are working non-stop in spite of the conflict escalation: “Everywhere I go I meet these inspiring people who just keep on working all of the time… I was down in Zaporižžja and – talking to the Caritas Ukraine team there – a few of the team members were internally displaced from a conflict area in the other part of the country. So they are displaced, they come to another Caritas centre, and they start work in another Caritas centre. So the work is always ongoing”., Executive Director of Caritas-Spes, Father Vyacheslav Grynevych, reported that the power cuts created new challenges for the Ukrainian people, who are now coping with recurring power blackouts on a daily basis. “Sometimes we have problem with internet connection, sometimes with heating systems, but it cannot stop us because, in this new reality, we have to continue our work and our support for people because we know and understand that many people are waiting for our help,” he said., In light of these developments, Caritas is calling for a renewed sense of solidarity within and beyond the confederation to do even more for the people of Ukraine who are in need. Fr Vyacheslav Grynevych says that, in spite of the new challenges, it is “very important to know that we are not alone. We are grateful for this experience to not be alone.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the full-scale war, the learning process in Ukraine has been significantly disrupted. UPSHIFT members worked to make education in communities safer, more entertaining and effective through their projects., The ideas developed by the teams included a board game with tasks on legal education, a platform for distance education that gives children the feeling of being present in the classroom, and spaces for leisure and informal education. Nineteen-year-old Yehor, a new UPSHIFT member, has been working with his team on creating one of these spaces., “Our project called Media Space is a space for everyone, where like-minded people can gather and receive media education,” says Yehor. “We plan to educate and train everyone who is into this topic. We want to create a community of media professionals who will exchange experience and also be able to work in our large team.”, According to UPSHIFT national trainer Vasylisa Haidenko, the teams are highly motivated and committed to creating useful projects for society. In addition, these young people are open to mutual assistance and cooperation. Participants were interested in each other’s projects and, during the training, agreed to join forces and collaborate., Applications for the third round of recruitment for the UPSHIFT programme in communities of the Kirovohrad region are welcome until 22 November.

Update 132 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (24 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,24 Nov 2022,"External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) a day after it lost access to off-site electricity in the latest incident highlighting continued threats to nuclear safety and security during the current armed conflict in the country, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., Also today, Ukraine’s national nuclear operator Energoatom said it was “doing everything possible to restore the operation of nuclear generation as soon as possible”, after Ukraine’s three other operational nuclear power plants were also disconnected from the grid yesterday., Energoatom added: “Start-up operations are being carried out at the power units of the Rivne, South Ukrainian and Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plants. During the day, if the power system is ready … these stations will be connected to the power grid”. Ukraine separately informed the IAEA that the three plants had been relying on diesel generators for back-up electricity while in shutdown mode., Director General Grossi noted that Ukraine’s nuclear industry yesterday had experienced the most extensive loss of off-site power since the conflict began nine months ago, saying this further underlined the need for stepped-up action to protect the plants and prevent the danger of a serious nuclear accident., “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is become increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous. It is the first time that all the plants suffer a loss of external power at the same time. This would have been completely unimaginable before this tragic war. It is extremely concerning. All military action threatening the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities must stop immediately,” Director General Grossi said., At the ZNPP, the IAEA team of experts said the plant’s emergency diesel generators – eight of which had been operating since the loss of off-site power around 3:30pm yesterday – were switched off shortly before 9am this morning, after the plant’s access to both its main 750 kilovolt (kV) and back-up 330 kV lines was re-established., Four of the reactor units remain in cold shutdown, while the two other units have been returned to hot shutdown again – enabling them to provide steam to the plant and heat to the nearby city of Enerhodar – after being cooled down following yesterday’s power loss. Enerhodar – where many plant workers live – is also receiving electricity again. The ZNPP has lost access to external electricity several times in recent months, for example in early November when it took two days to restore off-site power., Reactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown and do not produce electricity anymore. In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, usually at least for several days and 10 days or more in the case of the ZNPP. Four trucks with diesel fuel have arrived at the site to refill the tanks, the IAEA team reported today., The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined early during the conflict., The IAEA team of experts also reported that repair work following the weekend shelling at the ZNPP site is continuing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-132-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-24-nov-2022

"Senior Official Condemns Russian Federation’s Missile Strikes against Ukraine’s Critical Infrastructure, as Security Council Holds Emergency Meeting on Attacks",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,23 Nov 2022,"9202ND MEETING (PM)
SC/15118, Hours after the Russian Federation launched a barrage of missile and drone strikes attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure across Ukraine overnight, a United Nations senior official condemned such attacks and demanded they stop, stressing to the Security Council that they are prohibited under international humanitarian law, as that 15-nation organ held an emergency meeting on the matter today., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, reported that widespread attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure are continuing across Ukraine, with devastating consequences. Overnight, a new wave of missile and drone strikes terrorized the people of Kyiv and other cities in the country. Ukrainian officials stated that there were practically no large thermal or hydroelectric power plants left intact in Ukraine, she said, pointing to fears that this winter will be catastrophic for millions of Ukrainians who could be without heating, electricity or water amid freezing temperatures., “I will say it once again: attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” she emphasized. “The United Nations strongly condemns these attacks and demands that the Russian Federation immediately cease these actions,” she stressed, calling on the international community to ensure that the most vulnerable people in Ukraine are adequately protected and able to cope with the months ahead., Turning to the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, she called for the immediate cessation of all military activities at, and around, the plant, underscoring that the reported shelling at the plant over the weekend is reckless and deplorable. However, spotlighting a positive development “amid the dark news of today”, she said the parties reported today yet another prisoner exchange and called on them to continue those releases and ensure that they fulfil their obligations under international law., Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addressing the Council via tele-videoconference, said: “When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity.” He also described the overnight rocket attack on a hospital that took the life of a 2-day-old baby and the 70 rockets aimed at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, affecting hospitals, schools and transport., Although the Russian Federation has been trying to turn the 15-member organ into “a platform for rhetoric and manipulation”, he underscored that Council was created as the world’s most powerful platform for decisions and actions.“It is time to support the Ukrainian formula for peace.There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world,” he stressed, calling on the international community to support that peace proposal and for the Council to provide a clear assessment of the Russian Federation’s actions and consider a resolution condemning any form of energy terror., In the ensuing debate, Council members denounced the Russian Federation’s latest strikes, voicing concern that the resulting mass power outage will further inflict misery on already suffering Ukrainians. They called on the parties to comply with international humanitarian law and described how their countries are assisting Ukrainians to avert a life-threatening winter., The representative of the United States, noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “weaponizing winter”, said that if he cannot seize the country by force, he will try to “freeze the country into submission”. There must be a mechanism for accountability, and the international community must do everything in its power to support Ukraine’s people.For its part, the United States has contributed over $250 million in winterization-specific humanitarian assistance that will help provide heating supplies, blankets, shelter-repair materials and generators, she said., Albania’s representative emphasized that the Russian Federation may use whatever camouflaged language it has used in the past, but it is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.The European Parliament’s landmark resolution confirmed this, recognizing the Russian Federation as a State sponsor of terrorism and as a State that “uses means of terrorism”, he said.The cause and root lie solely with the Russian Federation’s aggression, he said, calling once again on that country to stop, withdraw and engage in diplomacy., Kenya’s representative, joining other delegations, said: “We cannot overstress the need to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure from attacks”. Noting the roll-over of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement to ensure the unimpeded export of Russian food and fertilizer, he said unimpeded deliveries must be ensured to countries in need, especially those in Africa.The Secretary-General and his good offices must be leveraged further to bring the war to an end and the Council must explore all options that can lead to the war’s cessation, followed by a dialogue for a political solution that guarantees Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity., However, the Russian Federation’s representative, countering delegations’ claims about the attacks, emphasized that his country is conducting strikes against infrastructure in response to the “unbridled” flow of weapons into Ukraine and Kyiv’s reckless appeals to defeat the Russian Federation. Over the course of its special military operation, the Russian Federation has had to deal not only with the Kyiv regime’s units, but also the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), who are providing various military support while “conducting a proxy war with Russia”.Thus, to weaken and destroy the military potential of its opponents, Moscow has conducted precision strikes against energy and other infrastructure used to supply Ukrainian units armed with Western weapons. Weakening Ukraine’s military capacity will continue by military means until the Kyiv regime adopts a “realistic position”, he said., Romania’s representative, drawing attention to the war’s spillover effects, reported that his country is making its own grain available to partners around the world and will continue to help facilitate Ukrainian exports.To that end, Romania, which shares the largest land border with Ukraine, has inaugurated a new crossing point between the two countries. More so, the Russian attacks have not only put millions of Ukrainians’ lives at risk because of no access to heat or electricity, they also created a complete blackout today in the Republic of Moldova.For the past month, Romania has been supplying between 80 and 90 per cent of that country’s electricity needs, he noted., The representative of the Republic of Moldova, on that point, said today’s event left his country with severely disrupted and unavailable power, water supply, internet and mobile phone connection services. The war should stop now to avoid catastrophic humanitarian consequences, he stressed, calling on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its military aggression, withdraw its forces from Ukraine’s sovereign territory, fully comply with its international law obligations and uphold human rights., Also speaking were representatives of Norway, France, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Gabon, China, India and Ghana., The meeting began at 4:05 p.m. and ended at 5:33 p.m., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said relentless, widespread attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure are continuing across Ukraine, with devastating consequences.Overnight, a new wave of missile and drone strikes terrorized the people of Kyiv, Odesa, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia.As Ukrainians desperately sought shelter from the bombing, they also had to contend with freezing temperatures. Those latest attacks renew fears that this winter will be catastrophic for millions of Ukrainians, who face the prospect of months of frigid weather with no heating, electricity, water or other basic utilities., According to initial media reports quoting local authorities, the strikes today killed or injured over 30 civilians as residential buildings were hit in Kyiv and in Chabany and Vyshhorod towns in the outskirts of the capital, she said. The United Nations has also seen reports of an overnight strike on a maternity hospital in the town of Vilnyansk in Zaporizhzhia region where a two-day-old baby was reportedly killed in the attack.Even before the latest strikes, Ukrainian officials stated that there were practically no large thermal or hydroelectric power plants left intact in Ukraine., Today’s barrage is likely to make the situation even worse, she continued.Emergency shutdowns were introduced today in all regions of the country, and regions like Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa and Chernihiv were reportedly completely disconnected from electricity. In Kyiv, Darnyts’ka Thermal Power Plant was hit. All of Kyiv region was reportedly deprived of electricity and the approximately 3 million people of the capital were left without running water. The Ladyzhyn Power Plant in Vinnytsia region was also hit. Russian strikes also damaged energy infrastructure in Kremenchuk, Lviv and Odesa. There are also reports that Odesa has no electricity nor running water. Three nuclear power plants still operating — Rivne, South Ukraine, and Khmelnytskyi — were reportedly disconnected from Ukraine’s energy grid as a result of today’s attacks.People in neighbouring Republic of Moldova are also likely to suffer consequences, as today’s strikes reportedly resulted in a blackout across the Republic of Moldova — a country that is already suffering an energy shortage due to the war., Further, the World Health Organization warned this week of a life-threatening winter in Ukraine, she said.The international community must ensure that the most vulnerable people in Ukraine are adequately protected and able to cope with the months ahead.Humanitarian actors in Ukraine are working to support people facing the challenges imposed by the energy shortage. Over the past weeks, more than 430,000 people have received some sort of direct winter assistance and nearly 400 generators have been distributed to ensure energy in hospitals, schools and other critical facilities. “I will say it once again: attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law. So are attacks against military objectives that may be expected to cause harm to civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated,” she emphasized., “The United Nations strongly condemns these attacks and demands that the Russian Federation immediately cease these actions,” she stressed, underscoring that there must be accountability for any violations of the laws of war. Voicing concern as well about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — the largest in Europe — she underlined that the reported shelling at the plant over the weekend is reckless and deplorable. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on Monday that — despite the severity of the shelling — key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns. “This is the result of sheer luck. We do not know how long this luck will last,” she said, emphasizing that “the world cannot afford a nuclear catastrophe”.Highlighting the risks of those attacks, she said that just a couple of hours ago IAEA reported that the plant has lost external electricity access and is relying on diesel generators to power cooling and essential nuclear safety functions.“All military activities at, and around, the plant must cease immediately,” she said., “Amid the dark news of today, I want to mention a positive development,” she said, noting that the parties today reported yet another prisoner exchange. Thirty-five Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners were released, she reported, encouraging the parties to continue those releases and to ensure that they fulfil their obligations under international law, particularly the third Geneva Convention. However, she also reported that the temperature in Kyiv right now is said to be -1°C, with snow forecast. “The weather we have been both preparing for, and dreading, is now upon the people of Ukraine,” she pointed out, emphasizing that the international community must all work together to prevent a man-made humanitarian catastrophe this winter. “The resulting shocks would exact a heavy price not only on Ukrainians, but on us all,” she added., Immediate de-escalation is needed, she stressed, calling once again on Member States and international organizations to support efforts to this end, with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.The United Nations will continue to do its part on the ground and remains ready to support all efforts towards peace, in line with the Charter of the United Nations and international law., Statements, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine, addressing the Security Council via tele-videoconference, said his country awaits a firm reaction from those who recognize the Charter of the United Nations.Ukraine has presented its “peace formula”, consisting of 10 points on how to restore the Charter, violated by the Russian Federation, to its full force, he said, adding: “In response to our peace formula, Russia is following the path of its terror formula.”In the wake of his presentation of his proposal to the Group of 19 (G19) summit in Indonesia, Ukraine received “10 Russian missiles for each point of the peace formula,” he said.A week after Ukraine outlined the peace formula to the Council on 16 November, the strikes continue., After Ukraine liberated Kherson, and the Russian army fled the city, the Russian Federation began to methodically destroy that city, with daily strikes that targeted people, he continued, reporting that shells hit residential buildings.“It seems that this is one of the main points of the Russian terror formula,” he noted. In addition, on the night of 22 November, a rocket attack on a hospital took the life of a 2-day-old baby. Further, on 23 November, there were 70 rockets aimed at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, he continued, noting that those strikes affected hospitals, schools and transport.Pointing out that the attacks by the Russian Federation led to a blackout in Ukraine, as well as in the neighbouring Republic of Moldova, he stressed: “When the temperature is below zero outside, and tens of millions of people are left without heat and water as a result of Russian missiles hitting energy facilities, this is an obvious crime against humanity.”, “There are representatives of a State among you that offers nothing to the world except terror, destabilization and disinformation,” he said, stressing: “It is time to support the Ukrainian formula for peace. There must be no opportunity left for terror in the world.”Ukraine is therefore turning to its partners for support to protect its skies and is in need of modern and effective air defence and missile defence systems. The Council must take concrete steps to protect humanity and life.Although the Russian Federation has been trying to turn the 15-member organ into “a platform for rhetoric and manipulation”, that Council was created as the world’s most powerful platform for decisions and actions.Calling on the Council to provide a clear assessment of the actions of the Russian Federation, he urged it to consider a resolution condemning any form of energy terror, adding: “Let’s see if anyone in the world, along with Russia, can say terror against civilians is a good thing.”, He went on to confirm his country’s invitation to United Nations experts to examine critical infrastructure that has been or may be hit by Russian missiles, underscoring the need for a proper assessment of the damage and destruction, and for justice to be restored within the United Nations. It is a “dead-end” for the party responsible for terror to block any attempt by the Council to carry out its mandate, he said, pointing out that the right of veto is reserved for the Council member waging a criminal war.“The world should not be held hostage by one international terrorist,” he stated.Noting that the Russian Federation is trying to make the electric generator “a more powerful and necessary tool than the United Nations Charter”, he called on the Council to offer solutions and to restore meaning to the Charter., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), observing that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems determined to reduce Ukraine’s energy facilities to rubble, stated that he is “weaponizing winter” to inflict immense suffering on Ukraine’s people.If he cannot seize the country by force, he will try to “freeze the country into submission”, she added.However, if that happens, millions will be left without power, water and heat during the cold winter months.Having struggled on the battlefield, Moscow is now adopting a cowardly, inhumane strategy that punishes Ukrainian men, women and children — a shameful escalation in the Russian Federation’s already unjustifiable war.Underscoring that the catastrophic scale and cruelty of Russian attacks cannot be overstated, she stressed that there must be a mechanism for accountability and that the international community must do everything in its power to support Ukraine’s people.For its part, the United States has contributed over $250 million in winterization-specific humanitarian assistance that will help provide heating supplies, blankets, shelter-repair materials and generators.Further, it pledged an additional $4.5 billion on 22 November to help Ukraine keep its schools, hospitals, utilities and emergency services running and, today, announced an additional $400 million to help Ukraine’s military resist Moscow’s attacks.Adding that President Putin seems to think his “campaign of brutality” will weaken the resolve of Ukraine’s people, she stressed that “he is, once again, gravely mistaken”, as the Ukrainian people will not be deterred – “no matter the cold and dark that Putin tries to inflict”., ARIAN SPASSE (Albania) pointed out that it has become a pattern that when the Russian Federation feels it is losing ground, it resorts to targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.It may use whatever camouflaged language as it has done in the past, but it is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.The European Parliament’s landmark resolution confirmed this, recognizing the Russian Federation as a State-sponsor of terrorism and as a State that “uses means of terrorism”.The terrible reality is that a Council’s permanent member has descended so low that the most prominent house of democracy — the European Parliament — has qualified it as a sponsor of terrorism.As the unjust war continues, the risk of catastrophic spillover effects are real, as demonstrated by the blackouts across the Republic of Moldova.The more successful Ukraine proves, the angrier the punishing response, including attacks on its energy infrastructure in an effort to “submit Ukraine by freezing the population to death”. The international community has made a clear choice by condemning the Russian Federation’s aggression and supporting Ukraine politically, militarily, and economically. The cause and root lie solely with the Russian Federation’s aggression, he said, reiterating his call to that country to stop, withdraw and engage in diplomacy., MONA JUUL (Norway), noting that she heard Ukraine’s President “loud and clear”, reiterated her country’s unwavering support. The recent waves of attacks against Ukraine clearly demonstrate, once again, the Russian Federation’s complete disregard for the horrible suffering of millions.Such attacks increase humanitarian harm, serve no military purpose, aim to terrorize Ukraine’s population, are illegal and may constitute war crimes.Those responsible must be held to account.Turning to the concerning situation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, she voiced her support for IAEA’s efforts to establish a protection zone.“The war against Ukraine is a tragedy for individuals, Ukrainian society and its people for generations to come.It also has serious global ramifications,” she emphasized, before welcoming the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.She also repeated her call for the Russian Federation to immediately cease its unlawful and senseless aggression.Humanitarian organizations must have safe, rapid and unimpeded access to people in need; all civilians must be protected; and international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be fully respected and implemented, she emphasized., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) strongly condemned the ongoing strikes on civilian targets, saying that every time Ukraine achieves a military victory, the Russian Federation responds with new attacks on essential infrastructure.Such retaliatory strikes are intolerable, he said.France will continue to support Ukraine, including by organizing an international conference on 13 December to set up a mechanism to coordinate international assistance for the Ukrainian people.It will also support the Republic of Moldova, he said, noting that the recent third meeting of the Moldova Support Platform, held in Paris, raised €100 million., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) reaffirmed that attacks against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure, are unjustifiable and violate international law and international humanitarian law.The parties must suspend hostilities immediately to avoid a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.He also noted with concern the announced deployment of air defence systems in Poland close to the Ukraine border.It is necessary to act responsibly and to prevent at all costs the conflict from taking even greater proportions.As important as it is to condemn the violations committed during this crisis, such statements are irrelevant to civilians who, on both sides of the front line, aspire for peace, he said., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) said that the Russian Federation is trying to achieve with terror and murder what it could not achieve on the battlefield, namely the complete subjugation or destruction of Ukraine.The Russian Federation must observe its obligations under international humanitarian law, he said, noting that the President of Ukraine has presented a comprehensive plan for a negotiated end to war.The first crucial steps are for the Russian Federation to end its unilateral aggression and to restore Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, in line with its obligations under the United Nations Charter.He added that United Kingdom will be providing new air defence equipment and stepping up humanitarian support for Ukraine for the cold, hard winter ahead., CÁIT MORAN (Ireland), noting that rolling blackouts have become the new normal in Ukraine and that today much of the neighbouring Republic of Moldova is without power, condemned the Russian Federation’s use of energy as “a weapon of war”. Citing the report of a Russian rocket attack on a maternity ward in a southern Ukrainian hospital that killed a newborn baby, she further noted that in Kyiv three people were killed as a result of Russian shelling and highlighted recent reports of torture chambers uncovered in Kherson. These attacks have achieved nothing beyond terrorizing and punishing the civilian population. Further, attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects are war crimes, she stressed, adding: “Russia’s use of explosive weapons in populated areas is grossly disturbing.”In that regard, she highlighted the “Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians”, which 83 countries adopted in Dublin last week. She called for parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law, including obligations against attacks that do not distinguish between military targets and civilians, among others.“This is all the more urgent as millions of people across Ukraine enter into a dark and freezing winter at the hands of the Russian Federation,” she emphasized. Noting that the Russian Federation “continues along its path of escalation, death and destruction”, she called on that country to cease all hostilities, withdraw its troops and return to diplomacy., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) expressed deep alarm that the recent reported missile strikes across Ukraine have caused an increase in rolling blackouts, cuts to water supplies and significant power outages to the extent that they have affected neighbouring Republic of Moldova.She also expressed concern about reports that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was subject to renewed shelling over the weekend and echoed calls for a concerted effort by parties to avert a nuclear disaster.“It is completely unacceptable that the people of the region, and indeed the world, should live under constant threat,” she said.With the damage and destruction extending beyond Ukraine’s power plants and electricity grid, she urged parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure.The current situation is yet another reminder of the urgent need for a cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of this war.Noting last week’s positive development regarding the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative to create the necessary momentum towards broader talks, she said the Council must rise to the occasion by showing unity around the path forward to resolving this conflict., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), warning that a nuclear accident would have unacceptable humanitarian and environmental consequences, called for a security perimeter to be urgently established around the Zaporizhzhia power plant.He also noted that the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols state unambiguously that civilian objects cannot be targeted.Underscoring the war’s impact on food prices and its effect on food security in many countries, he welcomed the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative as well as the memorandum of understanding between the Russian Federation and the United Nations Secretariat to facilitate market access for food and fertilizers., LILLY STELLA NGYEMA NDONG (Gabon) called once again on the parties to find a political solution and escape from the logic of belligerence.There is no possible solution other than dialogue, she said, adding that to prolong the war is to toy with the lives of thousands of civilians who are being exposed to indiscriminate attacks, including those on civilian infrastructure.Interrupting electricity for millions of Ukrainians will worsen the humanitarian situation and exacerbate suffering as winter approaches, she warned., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya), warning that “we cannot overstress the need to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure from attacks”, called for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Dialogue and diplomacy must be given a chance.Noting the roll-over of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement to ensure the unimpeded export of Russian food and fertilizer, he called for political assurances to ensure unimpeded deliveries to countries in need, especially those in Africa. He added that the Secretary-General and his good offices must be leveraged further to bring the war to an end.For its part, the Council must explore all options that can lead to the war’s cessation followed by a dialogue for a political solution that guarantees Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, addresses underlying grievances and secures a stable European security order, he said., GENG SHUANG (China) expressed concern that the conflict in Ukraine has led to constant attacks on civilian facilities and a steady rise of civilian casualties and displaced persons. “There is no winner in the conflict and the war, and dialogue and negotiations are the only way forward.” China calls once again on the parties concerned to show restraint, avoid actions that exacerbate confrontation, and prevent complications from spiraling out of control. The international community must focus on helping Ukraine repair its damaged energy infrastructure, provide supplies to the affected population, meet the basic needs of refugees and displaced persons, and help people properly resettle and survive this winter.He called on all parties concerned to act with prudence, make every effort to ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and avoid man-made nuclear accidents. China further welcomed the agreement reached by the parties concerning the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he said., VASSILY NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), regarding President Zelenskyy’s participation in today’s meeting, reiterated that his country is not opposed to such participation.Rather, it should be in-person, as required by the rules that have guided the Council’s work for more than 75 years.Addressing Norway’s representative, he said that, while she heard President Zelenskyy “loud and clear”, that President did not hear her as he is not interested in the views of Council members; rather, he simply wants a platform on which to speak.Over the course of its special military operation, the Russian Federation has had to deal not only with the Kyiv regime’s units, but also the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), who are providing various military support while “conducting a proxy war with Russia”.Thus, to weaken and destroy the military potential of its opponents, Moscow has conducted precision strikes against energy and other infrastructure used to supply Ukrainian units armed with Western weapons.Noting that many members today expressed outrage that Ukrainian citizens may find themselves without light or water, he said that the West displayed no such concern when the inhabitants of Crimea found themselves in such a situation due to Ukraine’s actions in 2015. “Not to mention the Donbas, which saw its economic lifeline snuffed out for eight years,” he added., He stressed that the West’s reckless flow of weapons to Ukraine has already killed peaceful inhabitants in the Donbas and Ukrainian cities.Kyiv’s propaganda attempts to carefully conceal this in its attempts to reduce everything to the Russian Federation’s fault.Moscow is carefully recording all evidence of crimes committed by Ukrainian military units, “including on the territory of Russian regions temporarily under their control”, he noted.Detailing purges, repression, torture, execution and other atrocities committed by the Ukrainian military, he said that his country expects the international community and international human-rights organizations to condemn Kyiv for its failure to comply with international humanitarian law.The Russian Federation is conducting strikes against infrastructure in response to the “unbridled” flow of weapons into Ukraine and Kyiv’s reckless appeals to defeat the Russian Federation.Weakening Ukraine’s military capacity is one of the special military operation’s goals, and this will continue by military means until the Kyiv regime adopts a “realistic position”, he stated.In the meantime, what the world is hearing from President Zelenskyy and his supporters is not a readiness to achieve peace; rather, it is the language of reckless threats and ultimatums.Western countries have encouraged this approach, and “war to the last Ukrainian” allows their military-industrial complex to make huge profits and test NATO armaments.He stressed that, in this way, Western countries are trying to “consolidate their geopolitical hegemony using the bodies and lives of ordinary Ukrainians”., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) expressed regret that history has shown that killing civilians and devastating civilian infrastructure have been used as legitimate weapons of war.She strongly condemned the use of oppressive violence against innocent civilians and the targeting of civilian objects in armed conflict, regardless of who commits them.Her country consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, an end to the violence, and for both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, she said, reiterating her Prime Minister’s statement that this cannot be an era of war.India’s people-centric approach encompasses providing both humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and economic support to some in the Global South under economic distress due to the conflict’s ripple effects. It also provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, financial aid for educational reconstruction, at the request of Ukraine, and exported 1.8 million tons of wheat to help low-income countries fight against price rises and foodstuff shortages. She expressed her sincere hope for an early resumption of the peace talks to bring about an immediate ceasefire and early resolution of the conflict., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), Council President for November, spoke in his national capacity, saying that the painful reality, made evident with each Council briefing, is that civilians are paying the highest price and will continue to suffer unless the war ends immediately.Urging the collective support of the Council to bring relief to Ukraine’s people, he also called on all parties to exercise restraint and ensure compliance with the IAEA’s seven pillars of nuclear safety.All warring sides must fully comply with their obligations under international law and international humanitarian law as well as with the prohibitions against direct attacks on civilian infrastructure.He then stressed the importance of thorough, transparent and independent investigations into all claims of human rights violations and possible war crimes.The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine, he reiterated.For its part, the Council must unify its efforts towards the immediate cessation of hostilities and further diplomacy to restore peace, he said., CORNEL FERUȚĂ (Romania) stressed that the humanitarian situation has been dire for the past almost nine months but is now further deteriorating, with the civilian population enduring missiles or brutal unmanned aerial vehicle attacks in areas of limited military significance — intentionally targeting critical civilian infrastructure.It is now night in Ukraine and many civilians do not have access to proper heating or electricity; the lives of many millions are at risk. Recent attacks also affected the electricity interconnection between Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and the European electricity grid.In the Republic of Moldova, these attacks led to a complete blackout today, and for the past month, Romania has been supplying between 80 and 90 per cent of that country’s electricity needs., Last week, the General Assembly decisively stated that Moscow must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making full reparations, with the need to establish an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury, he continued.All victims of the Russian Federation’s aggression deserve justice and reparation, he stressed.Welcoming the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 19 November, he noted that Romania is making its own grain available to partners around the world, will continue to help facilitate Ukrainian exports, and has inaugurated a new border crossing point between the two countries to ensure better connectivity and diversify export routes. With his country sharing the largest land border with Ukraine, he noted more than 8.5 million tons of grain and other food products were exported via Romania., GHEORGHE LEUCĂ (Republic of Moldova) condemned the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine and its recent attack on civilians and civilian infrastructure.For more than nine months now, his country’s neighbour has been defending its freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity from an unprovoked war of aggression.This aggression has triggered the largest humanitarian refugee crisis in Europe, prompted global food shortages, caused economic downturns and has deepened the continent’s energy crisis.Further, this brutal war continues to cause unforeseen human losses and the significant destruction of civilian and energy infrastructure which only worsens the overall humanitarian situation, he noted, expressing additional concern over the forthcoming winter period., The spillover effects of the war against Ukraine are being felt increasingly in neighbouring countries, including in his country, he stressed.The continued attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have left the Republic of Moldova in darkness.During the similar incident on 15 November, more than 50 per cent of the country was without electricity and had its water supply affected.Today’s event left the Republic of Moldova with severely disrupted and unavailable power, water supply, internet and mobile phone connection services.Reminding the Council of the missile debris which landed in a northern village on the border of Ukraine, he said such incidents demonstrate one thing: the war should stop now to avoid catastrophic humanitarian consequences.As such, the Russian Federation must immediately cease its military aggression, withdraw its forces form Ukraine’s sovereign territory, fully comply with its international law obligations and uphold human rights.Standing in solidarity to defend the values of freedom, liberty and democracy, he reaffirmed his country’s unwavering support to Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity., UKRAINE, For information media.

The funding, which will help alleviate the acute budget deficit caused by Putin’s brutal war of aggression, was made possible with generous bipartisan support from Congress. The Government of Ukraine will receive the funding in two tranches before the end of 2022., These funds, provided by the United States through the World Bank, allow the Government of Ukraine to withstand the immense economic, social, and political pressures from Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. This assistance keeps basic government services like hospitals, schools, and utilities running, and it sustains support for emergency responders and firefighters that save the lives of Ukrainian citizens every day. The budget assistance maintains support to Ukrainians further pushed into poverty since the start of the war, including low-income individuals, seniors, children with disabilities, and internally displaced persons. It will also provide new housing and utility subsidies over the winter season in response to Putin’s brutal assault on Ukraine’s electricity and heating infrastructure., Once these additional funds are fully disbursed, the U.S. government will have provided $13 billion in direct budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine. Robust safeguards put in place by the World Bank, coupled with USAID-funded, expert third-party monitoring support embedded within the Ukrainian government, ensure accountability and transparency in the use of these funds., Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, USAID has been coordinating with humanitarian partners in the country and region to provide Ukrainians with lifesaving humanitarian assistance while also ramping up critical development assistance to respond to cyber-attacks and threats to the energy sector, countering disinformation, supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector, documenting human rights violations, meeting essential health needs, and bolstering the continued functioning of local, regional, and national government entities., The United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine and its people in the wake of the Kremlin’s unprovoked and unjustified war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-contributes-45-billion-support-government-ukraine-enuk
Update 131 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (23 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,23 Nov 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost access to external electricity and is instead relying on its emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, using information provided by the IAEA staff on the site., Also today, Ukraine’s national operator Energoatom said that “due to a decrease in the frequency in the power system of Ukraine at the Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyy nuclear power plants, emergency protection worked, as a result of which all power units were automatically disconnected. Currently, they work in the design mode, without generation into the power system”. It also said that the radiation background at the NPP sites is normal., The latest incident at the ZNPP highlights the increasingly precarious and challenging nuclear safety and security situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, coming just a few days after it was repeatedly shelled, Director General Grossi said., The ZNPP has been disconnected from the national grid several times during the current military conflict in Ukraine, most recently in early November when it took two days to restore external power supplies., The team of IAEA experts present at the ZNPP said it lost off-site power at 3:30pm local time today when it was fully disconnected from the grid, following reports of widespread military action targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure., Initially all the site’s 20 diesel generators started operating automatically, and now eight of them are supplying the site with back-up electricity needed for all safety related equipment. The other 12 diesel generators are in stand-by mode., The IAEA team also reported that the plant’s operating personnel were performing all activities according to procedures for a loss of off-site power event and that the six reactors were in a safe and stable state. The two reactors that have been in a hot shutdown mode to provide the plant and the nearby town of Enerhodar with steam and heating will be prepared for cooling down. The four others remain in cold shutdown., The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites is one of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict that the Director General outlined in March., Reactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown mode and do not produce electricity anymore. In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, at least for 10 days in the case of the ZNPP., Earlier today, the Director General met a Russian delegation led by Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev in Istanbul, for consultations on operational aspects related to safety at the ZNPP and on the need to urgently establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-131-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-23-nov-2022

No child should be born under a barrage of missile strikes. No child should die buried in rubble remaining from hospitals, where their mothers seek safety and protection., “This attack is part of a dangerous global trend of increasing attacks on health in conflict which all too often are committed with impunity. Hospitals are not a target. Health facilities are protected under international law and should be safe havens in times of crisis and conflict., “As the fighting and violence move into Ukraine’s densely populated areas, we witness a daily loss in critical civilian infrastructure, which is particularly worrying in light of the upcoming winter. Our teams and local partners have entered a race against time to help people in Zaporizhzhia and other heavily conflict-affected areas to prepare for winter, but we cannot effectively deliver critical assistance under a barrage of missile strikes.”, The IRC launched an emergency response to the war in Ukraine in February 2022, working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. In Ukraine, we are focusing our response in the conflict-affected areas in the east and southeast. We are distributing essential non-food items, providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households, improving access to health care, and providing a variety of tailor-made protection services, including safe spaces for women and children. In the Zaporizhia oblast, IRC has provided four health donations to date, supplying medical trauma kits and pharmaceuticals to local health departments., Our emergency programmes are also active on the ground in Poland and Moldova.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",23 Nov 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, A new wave of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this afternoon has left millions of people in all regions of the country without electricity, adding to the already grave energy crisis faced by millions of Ukrainians., The emergency power outages – which come on top of the ongoing scheduled cuts – also affect access to water and heating, at a time when temperatures are below zero in many parts of the country., Following the attacks, some Ukrainian regions like Lviv in the west, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south and Chernihiv in the north have been completely disconnected from electricity., In Kyiv, the entire population – estimated at around 3 million people – was left without water today, and authorities informed they are working around the clock to restore the supply., Residential buildings were also hit in Kyiv and in Chabany and Vyshhorod towns in the outskirts of the capital. While search and rescue teams are still operating, authorities have confirmed that over 30 civilians have been killed or injured in the three localities., Humanitarians in Ukraine are working to support people facing the challenges imposed by the energy crisis. Over the past weeks, more than 430,000 people have received some sort of direct winter assistance, and nearly 400 generators have been distributed to ensure energy in hospitals, schools, and other critical facilities., SITUATION OVERVIEW, A new wave of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this afternoon has left millions of people in all regions of the country without electricity, adding to the already grave energy crisis faced by millions of Ukrainians. The emergency power outages – which come on top to the ongoing scheduled cuts – also affect access to water and heating, at a time when temperatures are below zero in many parts of the country. Today’s strikes happened just a few hours after the European Parliament passed a resolution declaring the Russian Federation a “state sponsor of terrorism”, stating that deliberate attacks and atrocities committed against Ukraine violate human rights law and international humanitarian law., Following the attacks, some Ukrainian regions like Lviv in the west, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south and Chernihiv in the north have been completely disconnected from electricity. Blackouts are also affecting large parts of the central regions of Vinnytsya and Dnipro, western Khmelnitsk, northern-eastern Kharkiv and Sumy, southern Mykolaiv and the capital Kyiv. According to the Ministry of Energy, temporary power outages have affected all Ukrainian nuclear power plants., In Kyiv, the entire population – estimated at around 3 million people – was left without water today, and authorities stated they are working around the clock to restore the supply. The attacks caused delays in trains and metro, and hours of traffic jams were reported across the city as people tried to rush to their homes when the air raid alarms were lifted, around 3 p.m., more than two hours after being activated. People in some parts of the city are also facing challenges with the heating system, with temporary cuts of internet and mobile data also reported in the past hours. In addition to energy infrastructure, residential buildings were also hit in Kyiv and in Chabany and Vyshhorod towns, in the outskirts of the capital. While search and rescue teams are still on operating, authorities have confirmed that over 30 civilians have been killed or injured in the three localities., In Kharkiv, people had to be evacuated from metro stations, as the power cuts forced all electric transport to stop. In Odesa, the heating system stopped working, and the lack of electricity also led the stoppage of the region’s water pumps. In Dnipro, water supply has been affected, and in Dniproand Lviv, internet stopped working for several hours., The strikes targeting energy infrastructure were not the only attacks affecting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine over the past 24 hours. In the Zaporizhzhia region, there have been reports of a new-born killed due to an airstrike that hit a maternity ward of a hospital in Vilniansk, close to the front line. Children were also killed and injured due to hostilities in the Kherson and Berislav districts, of the Kherson region. Attacks also impacted people trying to receive assistance, as a Government facility in Zaporizhzhia used by volunteers to distribute supplies to people affected by the war was hit, killing and injuring some civilians who were there when the attack happened.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no7-23-nov-2022-enruuk
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (12-18 November 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,23 Nov 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Russian forces continued to launch missile and drone strikes at critical infrastructure across Ukraine. Violence resulting from the Russian invasion also spilled across the border into Russia and Poland, leading to fatalities. Daily fighting occurred along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Demonstrations on the anniversary of a student uprising against the former dictatorship led to clashes in Greece, with students also staging demonstrations in other countries over various issues. Meanwhile, climate grievances and the rising cost of living continued to spark demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions last week. In the Luhansk region, Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the direction of Kreminna and Svatove (ISW, 12 November 2022). Meanwhile, Russian forces intensified operations in the direction of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region (TSN, 19 November 2022; ISW, 14 November 2022)., Russian forces continued targeting civilian buildings and critical infrastructure facilities across Ukraine last week. Following a mass missile attack on 15 November, almost half of all energy infrastructure in Ukraine has been disabled, leading to mass power outages, rolling blackouts, and disruptions in water supply, heating, and cell phone connections (Ukrinform, 18 November 2022; Suspilne Media, 20 November 2022). Additionally, Russian shelling and missile attacks reportedly killed over a dozen civilians and wounded over 40 last week; among them, 10 civilians were killed in a missile strike that hit a residential building in Vilniansk in the Zaporizhia region on 17 November (Ukrayinska Pravda, 18 November 2022)., Violence arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine also spilled over into the territory of Poland for the first time when a missile hit the Przewodow village close to the border with Ukraine on 15 November, reportedly killing two people. While investigations are ongoing, initial reports suggest that a Ukrainian air defense missile aimed at an incoming Russian rocket missed the target and landed in Poland (AP, 17 November 2022)., In Russia, authorities of the Kursk and Belgorod regions reported 16 incidents of cross-border shelling of villages close to the Russia-Ukraine border, reportedly resulting in the death of five residents (RFE/RL, 15 November 2022; Kommersant, 18 November 2022). Moreover, one civilian reportedly died and another received injuries in a landmine explosion in the border village of Azarovka in the Bryansk region (TV Rain, 17 November 2022). This violence contributed to the 52% increase in violent events in Russia last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact on a daily basis last week. The clashes resulted in the wounding of one Armenian serviceman. Similar to the week prior, Azerbaijani forces also reportedly opened fire on farmers in Artsakh1 on three different occasions, leaving one civilian wounded near the Khramort village of the Askeran region. This violence contributed to the 26% increase in violent events in Azerbaijan and Artsakh last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the region during the preceding four weeks., Climate and environmental protests continued to take place across Europe last week, coinciding with the Global Day of Action for Climate on 17 November and the UN COP27, which concluded on 18 November in Egypt. Demonstration activity was recorded in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, police intervened and arrested Extinction Rebellion activists during a national day of action against Barclays bank due to its involvement in the fossil fuel industry., Meanwhile, students, far-left groups, and labor unions led several marches in Greece on the anniversary of the 17 November 1973 student uprising against the former military dictatorship, condemning US support of the dictatorship at the time. The demonstrations led to clashes with the riot police in Athens, Thessaloniki, and Patras, driving the 26% increase in violent events in Greece last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month, flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map., Student demonstrations also occurred across the region last week, with protests recorded in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Moldova, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. In Italy, anti-government demonstrations demanding more investment in education were recorded in more than 30 cities. In Cyprus, student-led marches took place in all major cities on the anniversary of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence of Northern Cyprus on 15 November, with demonstrators demanding a federal solution to the Cyprus problem and condemning the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In Hungary, students, teachers, and other activists organized about 50 protests across the country last week in support of the teachers’ strike for better salaries, more teaching staff, and academic freedom., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests held in Albania, France, Greece, Germany, Ireland, San Marino, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-12-18-november-2022

"Stress, fear and anxiety for mothers and newborns in Ukraine as more than 900 babies born every day during 9 months of war – Save the Children",News and Press Release,Save the Children,Health,23 Nov 2022,"KYIV 23 November -- More than 900 babies are estimated to have been born every day since the deadly war in Ukraine escalated nine months ago, according to Save the Children, with the consequences of the conflict taking a serious toll on the health of mothers and their newborns., New analysis by the aid organisation, using data from the UN population prospects, reveals that an estimated 247,440 infants--or an average of 903 babies a day--were born since 24 February to women who were living in Ukraine when the war escalated nine months ago., The analysis comes as the country's health care system is under immense pressure after nine months of war, imperiling the lives of hundreds of thousands of infants and new and expectant mothers with limited access to medical care, particularly in areas of active conflict., In the nine-months of war, urban areas across Ukraine have been repeatedly shelled, with at least 703 attacks on health infrastructure. In southern Ukraine, missiles reportedly hit a maternity ward on Tuesday night, killing a two-day-old baby and injuring two doctors. Since the war escalated, at least 1,170 childen have been killed or injured in Ukraine, according to verified UN data., *""An average of about 900 children a day are being born into a life of uncertainty. *The chaos of the war poses a serious threat to these mothers and newborns,"" said Sonia Khush, Save the Children's Country Director in Ukraine. We're hearing accounts of women who've gone into labour early because of their constant state of stress and fear."", ""At the start of the war, many pregnant women were forced to give birth in basements or bunkers. Now, we're seeing women give birth in overwhelmed hospitals, away from family members, and in countries hosting refugees from Ukraine. Even though there are fewer women giving birth in bunkers compared to earlier this year, their pregnancies are still just as stressful,"" Khush added., High levels of stress and anxiety during pregnancy may affect a baby's brain development or immune system and can lead to preterm birth or even miscarriage. A recent study in the journal Infancy also found that babies exposed to more fluctuations in stress during pregnancy showed more fear, sadness and distress at 3-months than those of mothers who were less stressed., Antonina*, 27, was 30-weeks pregnant when she fled fighting in Donetsk Oblast with her husband, Andriy*, 36, on 10 May. The couple sought refuge in Dnipro where Antonina gave birth two days later to a premature baby girl with severe health complications., ""The war added an immense amount of stress to my pregnancy. I couldn't sleep with the constant sound of fighting and fear that something may happen to my family. I was so stressed that I ended up getting high blood pressure. I knew there was something seriously wrong but we were living in an area with no doctors who could help, so we had to leave,"" said Antonina. ""If it wasn't for the war, I don't think I would have had such a stressful pregnancy."", Andriy lost his job almost immediately after the war escalated in February, adding immense pressure to both him and Antonina as they eagerly awaited the birth of their daughter, Ganna*., Due to stress and anxiety, Antonina needed to have an emergency caesarean section about 10-weeks before her due date. Ganna was born with a compromised immune system, and now requires an inhaler three times a day and will be on medication for the next three years., ""Due to all the complications of the pregnancy, we spent several weeks in the hospital. We couldn't even go outside because of my baby's immune system and her respiratory complications,"" said Antonina., Although the family now lives in Dnipro, a large city situated in eastern Ukraine, Andriy is still unable to find a job, making it difficult for them to afford Ganna's medication., *""Andriy is still without work. Since we're displaced from *Donetsk, no one wants to hire him. They only want locals from Dnipro. Andriy is an electrician and a builder, he can do work but just can't find a job,"" said Antonina. ""We have no extended family. It is just us. The only plan we have is to raise a healthy child."", Due to the family's financial situation, they are living in a collective centre with about 280 others who fled fighting in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine., Save the Children is supporting displaced families in Dnipro like Antonina's by providing mattresses and clean water to collective centres. The aid organisation is also providing cash assistance to vulnerable families in Ukraine so they can purchase much needed items, such as clothes, medication and food. In western Ukraine, Save the Children is training health workers on breastfeeding practices., With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, and baby and hygiene kits to displaced families., ENDS, Notes to Editor:, Based on UN data published in its World Population Prospects, an estimated 329,620 births are expected in Ukraine in 2022 and therefore 247,440 births during the 274 days since the war escalated on 24 February (274/365*329,620). This equals to approximately 903 babies a day. Due to the high volume of people fleeing Ukraine since 24 February, many of these babies were likely born in countries hosting displaced women from Ukraine., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to get access to the services they need., Between Feb. 24 and Nov. 21, the UN has verified that 1,170 children have been killed or injured in the war, with 415 children killed and 755 injured: Ukraine: civilian casualty update 21 November 2022 | OHCHR",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/stress-fear-and-anxiety-mothers-and-newborns-ukraine-more-900-babies-born-every-day-during-9-months-war-save-children

Ukraine: People cut off from aid face extreme suffering as winter conditions worsen,News and Press Release,NRC,Protection and Human Rights,23 Nov 2022,"Without access to life-saving aid across Ukraine, vulnerable people living in areas outside of government control and along frontlines will face extreme suffering and risk losing their lives this winter, warns the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)., “Right now, across the country, people are facing a grim choice: flee or freeze. This week, I met families in Zaporizhzhia who fled for their lives from bombed out basements through the only crossing point on the frontline. They were shelled as they crossed. From a one-month-old to 91-year-old, they arrived cold and traumatised, but deeply relieved that they are now safe,” said Jan Egeland, NRC’s Secretary General on a visit to Ukraine., He emphasised that humanitarians can provide the essentials people need to survive, but they must be able to access communities currently out of reach., “We urge the Russian Federation to do their duty under international humanitarian law to provide safe passage for aid agencies into areas of active hostilities and under its control, so that the most vulnerable are not left behind. Aid workers must not be targeted or criminalised for supporting those that need it the most,” added Egeland., Millions of people living close to the frontlines in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts have limited or no access to food, fuel, water or adequate shelter. Many communities in areas of active hostilities or under Russian control, have received virtually no assistance since the war began last February. Some areas, including large parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk region, will have no heat for the entire winter, according to the Ukrainian government., This, along with the recent damage and destruction of critical energy infrastructure, could trigger new waves of mass displacement. Possibilities for safe civilian movement across the frontlines remain extremely limited. Those who choose to leave the areas outside of government control are forced to undertake lengthy, physically exhausting and costly trips across Ukraine or through Russia to get to Europe, often travelling via Belarus, Georgia, Armenia or Latvia to reach safety., “This is a brutal conflict targeting the most vulnerable. Many civilians, including those who are sick, disabled or elderly, cannot or will not leave their homes under bleak weather conditions. They must not be forgotten and must receive aid and assistance before it’s too late,” said Egeland., Egeland emphasised that aid organisations are bound by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence and impartiality. He reaffirmed that all parties to the conflict must ensure that aid workers and civilians are not sanctioned or penalised for providing or receiving aid or for humanitarian engagement., “We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritise protection of civilians and ensure they can access the assistance they so badly need to survive this winter. The international community should issue general carve outs in sanctions regimes so that aid can get to those in need as quickly as possible, wherever they are,” said Egeland., For more information, please contact:, Notes to editors:, About NRC’s response in Ukraine:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-people-cut-aid-face-extreme-suffering-winter-conditions-worsen

Water Sanitation Hygiene",22 Nov 2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused massive destruction in villages and cities across Ukraine; it has damaged and destroyed homes across the country and left over 11.2 million people in need of emergency shelter or vital household items. As temperatures drop below freezing and the country experiences its first winter snow, People in Need's teams are working hard to fix the windows and rooves of damaged homes and collective centres; more complex repairs will follow. Additionally, tarpaulin, wood, and plastic sheeting that enable basic repairs are being distributed to families, in addition to winterisation items like stoves and mattresses., As winter looms in Ukraine, the needs are massive. Winter temperatures in Ukraine can easily drop to -20°C or below. In July, the Ukrainian Government warned that hundreds of thousands of homes had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without a roof over their heads. This number has significantly increased with recent attacks and ongoing fighting., Furthermore, in recent weeks, millions of people in Ukraine have been left without electricity and water; consequently, many Ukrainians now have insufficient heating as Russia has concentrated its air strikes against critical civilian infrastructure. On November 15th, Russia conducted the largest attack on energy infrastructure since the start of the war, hitting critical infrastructure in at least 16 of the country's 24 oblasts and the capital city Kyiv. The situation with energy supply is precarious in a total of 17 oblasts and Kyiv., ""All these attacks by Russia have just one aim---cause chaos and suffering among civilians and to force further displacement of thousands of people within Ukraine or into neighbouring countries,"" says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for Eastern Partnership and Balkans at People in Need., ""Attacking civilian infrastructure like power plants is a clear violation of international humanitarian law. Winter must not be used as a weapon,"" he adds., The recent wave of Russian missile and drone strikes has crippled almost half of Ukraine's energy system. According to the Ukrainian Government, more than 10 million people have no access to electricity due to Russian attacks. Most of these people are in Vinnytsia, Odesa, Sumy, Ternopil Oblasts and Kyiv.

"Winter in Ukraine: people’s health cannot be held hostage - Statement by Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe",News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Nov 2022,"Dobri vechir., Good evening from Kyiv., This winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine., The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukrainian health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine., The country is facing a therma-crisis on top of a perma-crisis brought on by the war and the pandemic., Half of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is either damaged or destroyed. This is already having knock-on effects on the health system and on people’s health., Put simply, this winter will be about survival.
WHO has so far verified 703 attacks on health since the war began 9 months ago. This is a breach of international humanitarian law and the rules of war., Continued attacks on health and energy infrastructure mean hundreds of hospitals and health-care facilities are no longer fully operational – lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs., Maternity wards need incubators; blood banks need refrigerators; intensive care beds need ventilators; and all require energy., To focus the world’s attention on this situation is why I am here on my 4th visit this year and just days after the largest wave of missile strikes across the country – to meet officials, health workers and patients and offer WHO’s unwavering support to the Ministry of Health, to the government and to the Ukrainian people., And to express my gratitude and respect for Ukraine’s doctors, nurses and other health workers, who continue to show their heroism., What we know is that hundreds of thousands of premises across the country – including private homes, schools and hospitals – have no gas supplies, essential not only for cooking but also for heating., Today, 10 million people – a quarter of the population – are without power.
Cold weather can kill., Temperatures are predicted to plummet as low as -20 ˚C in parts of the country., As desperate families try to stay warm, many will be forced to turn to alternative heating methods, like burning charcoal or wood, or using generators fuelled by diesel, or electric heaters. These bring health risks, including exposure to toxic substances that are harmful for children, older people and those with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, as well as accidental burns and injuries., We expect 2–3 million more people to leave their homes in search of warmth and safety. They will face unique health challenges, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pneumonia and influenza, and the serious risk of diphtheria and measles in under-vaccinated populations., All of this is taking its toll on the mental health of Ukrainians. This week, the war enters its 9th month, and already some 10 million people are at risk of mental disorders such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD., By training health-care workers on how to provide mental health services, WHO has so far reached 1400 people with severe mental health conditions across Ukraine., Tens of thousands of psychosocial support and mental health consultations have been held for health-care workers and the general public, including by mobile mental health teams who go out to the community to offer care. This wouldn’t be possible without the tireless support of the First Lady, Her Excellency Ms Olena Zelenska, whom I thank for our meeting earlier today., I have also met with the Prime Minister, His Excellency Mr Denys Shmyhal, and the Minister of Health, Mr Viktor Liashko, with whom I discussed energy supply, preparing for the winter, and perhaps most crucially, meeting critical health needs in both newly regained and occupied areas., And this brings me to my next point – humanitarian access.
The war has impacted both access to health-care and supply lines for the flow of humanitarian aid. Ukraine needs sustained resources to see the health system through the winter and beyond, points that will be high on the agenda at next month’s Ukraine Conference in Paris, under the leadership of President Macron and President Zelenskyy., I am very concerned for 17 000 HIV patients in Donetsk, who may soon run out of critical antiretroviral drugs that help keep them alive. I am urgently calling for the creation of a humanitarian health corridor into all newly regained and occupied areas. WHO and our partners are ready to mobilize at a moment’s notice., I reiterate my call on both parties to allow urgent humanitarian access to meet people’s health needs.
Access to health care cannot be held hostage., Finally, let’s not forget that people are more likely to acquire viral respiratory infections in the winter than other seasons. Like in the rest of Europe, the many sub-variants of Omicron are also circulating in Ukraine. However, with low basic vaccination rates, let alone boosters, millions of Ukrainians have waning or no immunity to COVID-19. Couple that with an expected surge in seasonal influenza and difficulties in accessing health services, and this could spell disaster for vulnerable people., We are helping Ukraine’s health system prepare for the winter. This includes emergency repairs to health facilities and heating infrastructure, and energy maintenance., We are also providing prefabricated structures in newly regained areas, portable heating devices with fuel, survival blankets, diesel generators and ambulances., Ukraine’s health system is facing its darkest days in the war so far. Having endured more than 700 attacks, it is now also a victim of the energy crisis. It is being squeezed from all sides and the ultimate casualty is the patient., In the short term, we must find practical solutions that allow health-care services to continue through the winter as best as they can.

Update 130 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (21 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,21 Nov 2022,"An expert team of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today assessed the extent of damage caused by intense shelling over the weekend at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. They were able to confirm that – despite the severity of the shelling – key equipment remained intact and there were no immediate nuclear safety or security concerns, the Director General said., The four IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts currently staying at the site were briefed by management and then conducted an extensive visit of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to assess first-hand the physical impact of shelling that occurred on Saturday evening and again on Sunday morning, in one of the most serious such incidents at the facility in recent months, Director General Grossi said., The status of the six reactor units is stable, and the integrity of the spent fuel, the fresh fuel and the low, medium and high-level radioactive waste in their respective storage facilities was confirmed, the team said., Nevertheless, the IAEA experts still observed widespread damage across the site. “This is a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks on one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants,” Director General Grossi said., The team’s observations included damage to condensate storage tanks that caused non-radioactive leaking, several impacts on the main road along the plant’s reactors as well as on a site railway that is out of service, a pressurised air pipeline hit by shrapnel, two impacts on the roof of a special auxiliary building, minor visible damage to a sprinkler charging pipeline, as well as two impacts in a guardhouse area., Operating and maintenance staff have already begun repairing some of the damage and plant personnel are also cleaning up the site following the weekend attacks, the IAEA team said., The IAEA team also reported that there had been no further attacks on the plant overnight or so far today, though there had been shelling in the area of the nearby city of Enerhodar and the industrial area., Senior site management separately informed the IAEA team that four of the ZNPP’s reactors remained in cold shutdown and two in hot shutdown, continuing to produce steam and hot water for the site and Enerhodar, where many plant workers and their families live., In the wake of the renewed attacks, the Director General intensified his consultations aimed at establishing a protection zone at the plant.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-130-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-21-nov-2022
"Press briefing remarks by Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO’s Representative in Ukraine and Head of WHO’s Ukraine Country Office",News and Press Release,WHO,Health,21 Nov 2022,"Kyiv, 21 November 2022, During the last week, WHO teams were able to enter Kherson with life-saving medical supplies to help treat people in the city, and we continue to bring in essential supplies today., WHO is providing medicines, supplies, and equipment to conduct consultations and surgeries for over 100,000 people. This complements what WHO has already provided including surgical supplies, generators, and medicines for chronic conditions, since 38 settlements in the oblast were regained., Similar to what has been observed in other newly regained areas, the population is made up largely of the elderly, with chronic conditions like stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes., The demand for medical services is high amid the onset of winter and due to damage to key infrastructure. There are fewer functioning health care facilities operating due to disruptions to water and electricity, evacuations, and structural damage., As the Regional Director noted, a major priority for WHO in Ukraine is ensuring the continuous flow of humanitarian health supplies to newly accessible areas., Since February 24, more than 2,000 metric tonnes of medical supplies have been brought into the country in coordination with the Ministry of Health and our partners., Areas including Izium, Kharkiv and Balaklaia in the Kharkivska oblast have been reached with ambulances, medicines, generators, trauma kits and much more., WHO works across a range of programmatic areas to contribute to the continuation of public health work, as well as the resilience of health system., Let me share with you a few examples:, Together with the Office of the First Lady and the Ministry of Health we have trained health care workers with stress management techniques to strengthen the provision of mental health services in the country, and agreed a coordinated way forward on developing mental health and psychosocial services to address the needs of millions., We have ensured that populations have access to timely vaccinations through the COVAX mechanism together with our partners, including UNICEF and Member States. Millions of lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines, so people have access to vaccines and booster doses, have been brought to Ukraine this way in the past months alone., WHO-supported mobile health units are ensuring access to health care is continued in some of the remotest parts of the country and that access to chronic care and non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, are being addressed., We also continue trainings for thousands of health care workers across a range of health needs including trauma care, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology, and laboratory diagnostics, meaning that these health care workers continuously bring new knowledge and energy into the health system., This winter will present formidable challenges and with the coming of snow we will feel it more than ever., Continuous attacks on energy infrastructure have repercussions for health systems which have repeatedly come under attack., Access to health care has already been impacted as a result of this war as our health survey has shown., It found that 1 in 5 people overall struggles to access medicines. This figure jumps to 1 in 3 in occupied and active conflict areas., But without electricity, the machines in intensive care units stop working, surgeries can’t be continued, and cold chain facilities needed for vaccines and medicines will be disrupted. One can only imagine the potential impact this has for civilians across Ukraine., Until now the health system has demonstrated remarkable resilience and has continued to provide care in the direst of circumstances, but now it is a stress-test we have not witnessed yet during nine months of war, Our Health Cluster partners have donated over 400 generators to health facilities (as of November) across the country, and this is complementing the efforts of the Ukrainian health authorities., Our eyes now look forward to the coming days and weeks., WHO is here to stay and will continue supporting the Ministry of Health so that health services continue to be delivered in Ukraine., Lastly, my gratitude goes to the authorities, health leaders and our many partners on the ground for their continuous work and support to provide health care to their populations., WHO stands alongside all of you as we continue to witness power cuts across the country., I often hear stories from doctors and nurses who have witnessed unimaginable situations where care and support are needed., I hear from doctors who willingly stayed behind to provide health care for their populations when they have needed it the most., I hear heroic efforts from volunteers taking extra steps to support people in Ukraine, My deepest respect and thanks go out to you., Thank you, ENDS, For interviews with Dr Jarno Habicht, please contact:, Alona Roshchenko, roshchenkoa@who.int, Rayyan Sabet-Parry, rsabetparry@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/press-briefing-remarks-dr-jarno-habicht-whos-representative-ukraine-and-head-whos-ukraine-country-office

"Ukrainians Collect Water from Puddles in Kherson as Explosives, Shelling Cut Off Supplies",News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Nov 2022,"KHERSON, Ukraine, 21 November, 2022 - Families in Kherson have been collecting water from puddles and queuing for more than a kilometre to buy drinking water and fuel for heating due to destroyed infrastructure with at least another month of disruptions expected, Save the Children said., More than 165,000 people, including about 80,000 children, live in areas of Kherson that have recently been retaken by Ukraine, and the needs among the population are at critical levels due to ongoing hostilities, extensive damage and destruction of infrastructure., Georgia Tracy, Save the Children Programme Director in Ukraine, said:, “Families have not had water and electricity for over two weeks, markets are running low on food and water, and most shops are empty. Pharmacies and health facilities have no medicines, and people can only rely on locally produced fruits and vegetables, if available, to feed themselves., “The hospital we saw had much of its equipment looted, including surgical equipment and tables, medicine, wheelchairs and frozen food and water supplies for patients. The situation Kherson faces is now dire and the levels of need are enormous. We have managed to reach more than 4,000 families with water in a single day but so many more are in need.”, In spite of efforts by the local authorities to facilitate humanitarian access and restore some services, Save the Children said there was no realistic way of reaching all of the people who are in need of assistance across Kherson. Families must be allowed to leave and go to areas with better services without coming under fire., It will take weeks or even months before all the essential services like electricity, central heating and water supplies in Kherson are restored to full capacity. Last week, the government of Ukraine approved funding of US$2.1 million to repair the region’s critical infrastructure, but the works can only start once the territory is decontaminated from explosives. This may take up several weeks, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs., Save the Children calls on warring parties to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law and avoid attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure. Attacking water and power stations are prohibited in the international rules of war, and within the Russian Federation and the Ukraine’s IHL manuals., This weekend, Save the Children distributed drinking water to more than 4,000 households in Kherson, while also registering families in need of cash assistance that the organisation will support in the coming weeks and months., The aid organisation is working to ensure stable water supplies in parts of Ukraine affected by combat, including delivering submersible pumps to a water utility in the city of Sumy, supplying water filters to Mykolaiv and Kherson regions, drilling boreholes, installing manual water pumps, and repairing a water intake facility in Chernihiv region. The child rights organisation has also assisted in plumbing repair works and distributing bottled water and hygiene kits., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to access education and other critical services., Notes:, The Ukraine Protection Consortium (funded by BHA/USAID) led by Save the Children is providing holistic life-saving Health, Shelter, Cash, Protection, WASH and Nutrition assistance to conflict affected people living in Ukraine.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Nov 2022,"Conflict, In early October, Ukrainian forces continued recapturing areas of southern and eastern oblasts, notably Lyman (Donetsk oblast). The liberation of thousands of square kilometres resulted in the grim discovery of two new mass graves in Lyman and Sviatohirsk (containing of 120 civilian bodies). Shelling and missile strikes continue to cause the majority of casualties with 1,043 civilian casualties registered by OHCHR in October. Five waves of missile attacks on urban centres were recorder in October alone, leading to widespread disruption of energy supply with millions of citizens being deprived from electricity and water at times during the month., Displacement, The displacement figures have continued to follow a downward trend since August with a decrease of 297,000 IDPs in October compared to the previous month (4.5% drop). However, the number of returnees remains relatively static. Conflict and safety remain the biggest push/pull factors. The majority of IDPs continue to originate from, and reside in, the eastern part of Ukraine. Latest survey data indicates a significant increase of older persons within IDPs households. The number of refugees from Ukraine continues to increase in Europe with over 7.8 million individuals having fled their country, an increase of 200,000 people compared to the previous month., Humanitarian Access, Humanitarian partners achieved to access newly liberated areas, despite the fuel challenges and risks from Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). However, physical limitations and threats continue to hamper access, notably the 1,500 military checkpoints across the country as well as the insecurity which puts humanitarian staff and volunteers’ health at risk. Martial law established by Russian authorities in Donetska, Kharkivska, Mikolaivska and Sumska oblasts is also a concern regarding access. Finally, persons with disabilities seem to face particular challenges when trying to access assistance, due to lack of mobility and a lack of sufficient aid., Humanitarian Conditions, Livelihoods: Loss of livelihoods and income as a result of the conflict and subsequent displacement continue to impact millions of households in Ukraine. However, ILO expects the situation not too be as bad as feared with employment levels in 2022 estimated to be 15.5% below the 2021 (pre-conflict) level, equating to a loss of 2.4 million jobs. Financial assistance is still the main reported need with many households dependent on government assistance or humanitarian aid. Displaced households are overall more heavily affected than non-displaced households, with IDPs in collective centres reporting the lowest incomes. However, in surveys from Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv, much lower percentages of non-displaced households reported receiving humanitarian aid compared to the displaced., Food Security: Eight million people in Ukraine have inadequate food consumption, an increase of 1.03M since the previous month. Populations in recently liberated areas and rural populations in oblasts close to the contact line are amongst the households most at risk. Also, a recent survey found that 31% of respondents from Kharkiv oblast stated that they could never access enough food when living under occupation, raising concerns for the food security situation in NGCA. On a positive note, the median cost of the JMMI basket in September fell by 2% compared to the previous month to now cost 1025 UAH. The basket consists of food and hygiene items and some of the drop was attributed to normal seasonal price fluctuations for produce. Families still report struggling to get enough food for babies and infants and many households are using negative coping mechanisms due to food insecurity and low incomes., Health: Attacks on health facilities continue to heavily impact health services with a total of 631 attacks throughout the country having been verified by WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care since the beginning of the war (as of October 26, 2022). This restricts access to primary care but also to specialized care, with a lack of specialized doctors. Even though the availability of medicines seems to be improving this month, the high prices is strongly limiting civilians to access them, medication for high blood pressure, for heart conditions and for pain being the ones lacking the most. This is putting a toll on the population’s health, especially for those with chronic illnesses.
Furthermore, the upcoming of winter coupled with the lack of water is adding an additional threat on people’s wellbeing, respiratory diseases being the most common in winter., Protection: The risk of violence due to armed conflict remains the main threat for civilians in Ukraine. Two mass graves were discovered in Lyman and Sviatohirsk after the takeover of the area by the Ukrainian troops, highlighting once again the serious breaches of international humanitarian law since the onset of the conflict. Civilians are also suffering from restricted freedom of movement, either due to insecurity, to martial law implemented by Russian authorities in non-government-controlled areas or to curfews established by Ukrainian authorities.
Gender-based violence continues to be flagged by humanitarian actors as a major risk, with over 100 cases of sexual crimes investigated by the Ukrainian Prosecutor General. Violence, displacement, family separation and trauma all contribute to increasing mental health issues and needs, vulnerable groups of population such as children, persons with disabilities and older persons being at heightened risk of violence and abuse., Shelter: Widespread damage to residential housing and displacement are still driving shelter needs. Across Ukraine, 45% of IDPs, 18% of returnees and 16% of the non-displaced population reported their habitual residence had been damaged by the conflict, with lack of finances being the most common barrier to households affecting repairs. Disruption to utilities is making it harder for households to heat their homes and has led to an increasing need for solid fuel such as wood. There is also significant need for sleep items (beds, mattresses, and blankets) as well as other NFI items across many collective sites. Many still reside in accommodation that is deemed inadequate for the winter., WASH: In the month of October, the five waves of missile attacks in urban centres across caused wide-scale disruptions to water supplies leaving millions of people without access or with limited access to drinking water. In addition to restricted access, contamination of water sources is a major concern for civilians, with 24% of respondents from IOM monitoring reporting such issues. This is particularly a problem as the consumption of unfiltered water is an increasingly used coping strategy. Moreover, the lack of water and of WASH facilities - notably in collective centres for displaced people- leads to increased risks of communicable disease outbreaks.
The need for hygiene and menstrual products continues to remain high amongst IDPs as prices increase., Education: Russian missile strikes on power infrastructure, often in Ukrainian urban centres, is leaving many schools without power and heating as well as posing a direct risk to children. This has resulted in more schools shifting to distance learning modalities. However, there are still widespread needs for electronic devices to facilitate online education, with the Ukrainian Government indicating that 175,734 laptops and 202,562 tablets are needed across the country. In addition, children’s ability to learn is being severely impacted by ongoing exposure to conflict related trauma and psychosocial stress. Almost 630,000 children have already received psychosocial support in the form of structured sessions to help them deal with the distressing effects of the war and displacement.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-18-nov-2022

The overall objective of the Programme is to support Ukraine in withstanding the full-scale Russian invasion, introducing early recovery and rebuilding efforts as conditions allow, and facilitating a swift return to development pathways and processes to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals., Ambassador Matti Maasikas, Head of the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said the new contribution aligns with the key outputs of the EU Emergency Support Programme for Ukraine, while supporting the practical implementation of a number of reform prerequisites for EU accession, including strengthening the rule of law and supporting structural economic reforms. “This June,” he said, “the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine. This new contribution will be part of the support that will facilitate moving towards the EU while also helping Ukraine further address the needs of its population which is suffering from Russia’s aggression.”, Interim UNDP Resident Representative Jaco Cilliers said UNDP welcomes the expanded partnership with the European Union. “We have worked closely with the EU in Ukraine over the past decade through various programmes,” he said. “Their strategic support has been essential in helping ensure government at all levels in Ukraine remains resilient and able to fulfil its leadership role in all humanitarian and crisis response efforts.”, The new contribution will support initiatives to strengthen the resilience and early recovery of communities in selected target areas of Ukraine by expanding access to quality public services such as healthcare facilities, strengthening community security and public safety, and enhancing the strength of the social fabric at local level. In line with the UNDP Digital Strategy 2022-2025, the project will leverage digital technologies and solutions as much as possible to address the identified development challenges., In addressing the needs of the more than 6 million displaced Ukrainians, most of whom have were forced to flee from the eastern and southern oblasts, the new funds will be used to expand programmes and community initiatives to support their further integration into host communities, placing a particular emphasis on youth engagement and on local solutions that link humanitarian response to early recovery planning. Women and men veterans will be one of the key target groups for assistance under the expanded programme, given their specific vulnerability and the pivotal role they will play in peacebuilding and development activities at the end of the war. The funds also will be used to strengthen the capacity of Ukraine’s National Police to prevent gender-based violence through community policing and other measures., Media enquiries: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Head of Communications; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/european-union-expands-programme-support-ukraine-enuk

The ZNPP’s external power supplies, which have been knocked out several times during the conflict, were also not affected., The latest shelling began shortly before 6pm local time yesterday and, after a lull, resumed at 9:15am today with more than a dozen blasts within 40 minutes. After the morning shelling, the area was again quiet, the team of IAEA experts reported in the afternoon today., According to the IAEA experts, site management reported damage in several places, including a radioactive waste and storage building, cooling pond sprinkler systems, an electrical cable to one of the reactors, condensate storage tanks, and to a bridge between another reactor and its auxiliary buildings., “Once again, we were fortunate that a potentially serious nuclear incident did not happen. Next time, we may not be so lucky. We must do everything in our power to make sure there is no next time,” Director General Grossi said, reiterating his call for urgent measures to protect the ZNPP and prevent a nuclear accident during the current conflict in Ukraine., The Director General said he has been in active consultations with world leaders today on the latest shelling at the ZNPP, and he is insisting that agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP must happen now., “Even though there was no direct impact on key nuclear safety and security systems at the plant, the shelling came dangerously close to them. We are talking metres, not kilometres. Whoever is shelling at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, is taking huge risks and gambling with many people’s lives,” Director General Grossi said., The IAEA team of experts plan to conduct an assessment tomorrow of the shelling impact on the site.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-129-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-20-nov-2022

The United States Announces Additional Funding to Deliver Ukrainian Grain to the World’s Most Vulnerable,News and Press Release,USAID,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",18 Nov 2022,"Press Release
For Immediate Release
Friday, November 18, 2022, The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing up to $20 million for the “Grain from Ukraine"" initiative, announced by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the G20 Summit earlier this week, to help feed people around the world facing staggering levels of food insecurity. USAID will provide support through the UN World Food Program (WFP) to facilitate additional shipments of Ukrainian grain moving through the Black Sea Grain Initiative., Before Putin’s invasion, Ukraine was one of WFP’s top suppliers of grain and the fourth largest commercial exporter of wheat globally. The Kremlin’s brutal war against Ukraine halted shipments and for months, millions of tons of grain and essential food exports were stuck in the country, exacerbating an already catastrophic global food crisis and sending food prices soaring. Since the UN-brokered agreement began in August, the Initiative has helped to stabilize spiraling food prices worldwide and provided desperately needed food to millions of people., Today’s announcement builds on the $173 million to date in existing U.S. support to WFP to purchase Ukrainian grain to feed people in countries facing the most severe food crises, including Ethiopia, Yemen, and Afghanistan. U.S. funding has purchased 210,000 metric tons of food, enough to feed approximately 12.6 million people for one month., Since the beginning of Putin’s war against Ukraine in February, the United States has provided more than $11 billion to respond to the global food crisis, including nearly $8.6 billion in humanitarian assistance. USAID humanitarian assistance, including our support to WFP, includes direct food assistance, as well as other support including safe drinking water, health care, and protection to meet needs made even worse by food crises., USAID also continues to assist Ukraine’s farmers, who are risking their lives to feed the world, through the Agriculture Resilience Initiative - Ukraine (AGRI-Ukraine). AGRI-Ukraine is bolstering Ukrainian agriculture production and exports while addressing the sector’s long term needs. The initiative focuses on four areas that are critical to sustain Ukraine’s agricultural exports and its contributions to global food security: providing critical inputs for farmers; improving export logistics and infrastructure; increasing farmers’ access to financing, and supporting crop drying, storage, and processing needs. USAID has invested $100 million in the initiative, and the agency is seeking to raise at least $150 million in additional funding from fellow donors, foundations, and the private sector.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-announces-additional-funding-deliver-ukrainian-grain-worlds-most-vulnerable
ShelterBox helping people in Ukraine survive sub-zero winter,News and Press Release,ShelterBox,Shelter and Non-Food Items,18 Nov 2022,"Charity launches urgent fundraising appeal, The international disaster relief charity ShelterBox has essential aid in Ukraine designed to help people survive a long and harsh winter. Millions of people are bracing for temperatures as low as -15 degrees centigrade as they continue to live in damaged homes, with limited or no heating., Almost nine months after the start of the war, an estimated 15.7 million Ukrainians – that’s more than a quarter of the UK population – are still in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, according to UNHCR., It’s becoming increasingly difficult for people who have continued to live in damaged homes, or returned to them, to keep warm with electricity and gas supplies badly affected by the ongoing war., Using its many years of experience supporting displaced people in Syria through freezing winters, ShelterBox will be helping thousands of people in Ukraine protect themselves and their families from the cold., The charity will be giving people thermal blankets, clothing, and emergency repair kits –including tarpaulins and timber – to help them fix damaged roofs, seal windows and doors, keep the heat in, and make homes watertight., The most vulnerable households will also be given solid fuel stoves, and a supply of firewood that will last the average family through the winter, to help them prepare for the bitterly cold season. This type of stove is regularly used to heat homes in rural areas of the country and is desperately needed to help people survive the cold., ShelterBox’s Programme Manager for Ukraine, Rachel Harvey, is in Kyiv as the next phase of the charity’s response gets underway., She says: “With the passage of time, whilst the number of people leaving the country has reduced, many thousands of people still living in Ukraine are struggling to survive in damaged homes., “We know from our work in Syria that heating one room can make a huge difference to a whole family., “It’s regularly sub-zero in parts of Ukraine and with gas and oil supplies badly hit, people are facing temperatures inside their homes that are potentially life threatening. That’s why we are focusing on keeping people and their houses as warm as possible.”, Cornwall-based ShelterBox has already supported thousands of families affected by the crisis in Ukraine since March – refugees on the move in Moldova, as well as people internally displaced at collective centres, or living in damaged homes., As its attention now turns to helping people survive the winter months in Ukraine – supporting thousands more people who are living in ravaged homes – ShelterBox is renewing its urgent appeal to help fund its responses around the world. Supporting the charity with its winter appeal is long-term supporter and friend of ShelterBox, Stephen Fry. He provides the introduction for a new film based on a poem about home by Ukrainian poet Serhy Zhadan, and voiced by Ukranian actor Ivantiy Novak, to help raise awareness of ShelterBox’s lifesaving work., ShelterBox has worked with thousands of people – both in Ukraine and neighbouring countries – who have faced the impossible question of ‘What would you take?’. This film is for them, the 100 million people who are forced from their homes by disaster and conflict every year., ShelterBox believes home is that essential first step of recovery – a place of safety and dignity; a place to cook, sleep, and shelter. ShelterBox is working in Ukraine in partnership with Relief Aid and Green Chernobyl., As well as supporting people in Ukraine, ShelterBox is also helping people displaced by conflict in Yemen, Syria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Mozambique. Support is provided in many ways and includes different combinations of emergency shelter items and training that are locally appropriate to make the biggest difference for communities after disaster., For more information about ShelterBox’s end of year campaign visit the charity’s website., ENDS, Contact the press office at ShelterBox via pr@shelterbox.org., Notes to Editors, Interviews available with ShelterBox’s Programme Manager for Ukraine, Rachel Harvey, who is in Kyiv as the next phase of the charity’s response gets underway. Interviews available Friday 18, Saturday 19, Sunday 20 November 2022, ShelterBox b-roll in Ukraine, Interviews with two recipients of ShelterBox aid in Ukraine during the summer, Images and captions available on request, ShelterBox has been working with people from Ukraine on a film about home, in support of its fundraising appeal to help people in Ukraine this winter. It is introduced by long-term ShelterBox supporter and friend, Stephen Fry. It launches on Friday 18 November., The film is based on a poem by Serhiy Zhadan which asks a simple question with a tangle of answers. What would you take? (DropBox link and YouTube link), The film features images and footage from the charity’s work in Ukraine, showing the brutal impact of war and how some of the people supported by ShelterBox have been affected., Often described as one of the most important voices in contemporary Ukrainian literature, award-winning writer, and musician Serhiy Zhadan has remained in his home city of Kharkiv throughout the war, organising humanitarian aid. Serhiy has written this untitled poem about home and the Ukraine’s experience of war, exclusively for ShelterBox’s winter appeal. Known as ‘the rockstar poet’, he’s played with his band for hospital patients and people sheltering in bunkers. Ivantiy Novak is a Ukrainian-British writer, actor, director, and poet. Since the outbreak of the conflict, he’s been raising funds, packing supplies – and sharing the culture and art of Ukraine with the world. Ivantiy has voiced the poem for the film. He also worked on the translation with writer and translator, Charlotte Hobson., People, like snails, wait for the evening Sleeping so soundly, so deeply in stations Women who left clean bedsheets back home Children who cling to their mother’s hand. What will you take, little snail, from your burning home? First of all, faith that you will return. Remember the way the furniture stood; Hide the keys in your pocket like a dried flower. This is your road – walked by the voiceless. Overnight stays between silence and rain. Be brave, snails, know your worth on this journey. You’re denied a home – never a heart.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/shelterbox-helping-people-ukraine-survive-sub-zero-winter

WHO delivers life-saving medical supplies to Kherson,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,18 Nov 2022,"18 November 2022, WHO in Ukraine have delivered life-saving medical supplies to Kherson days after the Government of Ukraine regained control of the city., The supplies include generators to ensure health-care facilities can continue functioning in emergency settings, surgical kits and medicines for thousands of people in the city, while more supplies will continue to arrive in the coming days., Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine said: “WHO continues to deliver essential, life-saving medical supplies in coordination with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and other United Nations partners to areas recently regained by the Government of Ukraine. These supplies will save lives and go towards ensuring that the resilient health system can continue delivering care in these challenging circumstances and support hundreds of thousands of people”., Less than 72 hours after Kherson was regained by the Government of Ukraine, WHO also joined an interagency United Nations convoy to deliver food, shelter and medicines for thousands of people. The deliveries marked the first time aid workers were able to bring in humanitarian and health supplies to the city following the developments. More supplies will be delivered by WHO to Kherson in the coming days., The supplies were made possible with funding from European Union Humanitarian Aid, the Government of Canada, the United States Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF), the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR), Direct Relief, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)., WHO has delivered more than 2000 metric tonnes of medical supplies to Ukraine since the Russian Federation invasion of the country on 24 February. Deliveries include power generators, ambulances, oxygen supplies for medical facilities, supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries, and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases and more., Since 24 February, WHO has delivered supplies to newly accessible areas in Ukraine. In the past months, WHO has ensured deliveries in Kharkivska oblast including in Balakliya, Izium and Kharkiv, and many other areas throughout Ukraine, while more supplies continue to come in., Media Contacts

Refugees from Ukraine hope for a peaceful future,News and Press Release,JRS,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",18 Nov 2022,"Since February 2022, JRS has been working together with the Xavier Network, Concordia Moldova, the Society of Jesus, local civil society, and NGOs to accompany, serve, and advocate for people fleeing Ukraine., So far, thousands of people have been supported through emergency assistance, housing, education, cash allowances, and psychosocial support. These are some of their stories., Anna, a 13-year-old student, found refuge in Slovakia, “My mother woke me up with the words that the war had begun and my native Kharkov was attacked. Honestly, at first, I thought it was a stupid joke”, Anna remembers vividly., With only the essentials, she and her mum left their apartment to a safer place where they stayed for 10 days. At the start of March, they decided to take a train to Lviv because “every day it got worse”. “We didn’t have a plan; we were just saving our lives.”., The train to Lviv took 28 hours, then another day by bus to get to the Polish border. “At the station, a volunteer approached us and offered to find an overnight stay. It turned out he had a friend in Bratislava, and he called him”, described Anna., On the train to Bratislava there were many families fleeing the war. “Every person I met had their own heart-breaking story,” commented Anna. The next morning, she and her mum arrived in Bratislava and “were finally able to sleep with the thought that we did not need to run anywhere and save ourselves”., Anna and her mother have been living in the Jesuit house in Trnava for seven months now. Anna’s mother works as an assistant in the kitchen, while she improves her Slovak to be able to find a job that matches her administrative experience. Meanwhile, Anna is attending high school and is working on learning Slovak, which “is similar to Ukrainian, so it’s not that difficult, also I like learning”. In her free time, she helps at the Family Help Centre of the house. “There are wonderful people here who have helped us a lot. I don’t even know how things would have turned out if the Jesuits hadn’t helped us. Now we have a house, food, and help”., Tetiana, a dentist, is rebuilding her life in Poland, “On March 3, my daughter and I fled Kharkiv as it was extremely difficult to live in the basement. We got on an overcrowded train to Lviv. The train was really crammed with people; so many that you could hardly get to the bathroom. But we didn’t care about how we had to travel. We only wanted to escape the shelling”, Tetiana recalls of the days fleeing. Thankfully, she was received with open arms by her Polish neighbours., Tetiana is now living with her sister, who also had to flee Kharkiv, and their children in Nowy Sącz. “In Poland, I have received lots of help from different organizations which I am grateful for from the bottom of my heart. It has given me a chance to stay on firm ground”, she highlights., A little bit more settled now, Tetiana is starting to plan her next steps: the key is recovering her professional life as a dentist. “I have already received the proof for the recognition of my diploma here and now I am employed at one of the dental clinics. I have to work under supervision for three months though, but then I will be entitled to work independently and for that, I need to learn the language. Thanks to JRS I am now attending Polish courses”, she explains., Avankiats Olena feels supported in Romania, “I remember when my friend called me at 5 am on February 24th and informed me that the Kiev airport was under fire”, recalls Avankiats Olena. She immediately knew she had to flee: “I am originally from Donetsk and I knew it was the beginning of the war, so I tried to think calmly and decided not to waste any time because I knew that near Bucha there is an airport and an important strategic point for the enemy. We started to gather ourselves to leave the country and decided to go to Romania.”, However, the journey to get there would not be easy. “I had to drive for about 25 hours”, remembers Avankiats Olena, who drove her mother and children safety. At the border, she was pleasantly surprised by the helping open arms that received them., Once inside Romania, Avankiats Olena received help from JRS Romania. As she describes, upon registering for activities “I felt released and supported. It gave me time to look for a good job and learn the language, as well as to take care of my children. It also helps me to pay for my flat and my mother’s medicine. Without this help, it would be very difficult to continue in Romania”., Beyond the tangible help, Avankiats Olena also highlighted the warmth of the staff: “They try to lighten our days so that we can believe in tomorrow and they are very good at taking care of our children”., While she does not know what the future has in store for her, Avankiats Olena wants to stay in Romania. “I don’t want to go back to Ukraine in the near future. I want to stay in Romania. It’s not the first country I’ve lived in, but it’s the first one where I feel rested and supported”, she concludes., “In March 2022 my city was under the fire of Russian missiles, and we were forced to flee. I will never forget this terrible trip. It was not safe at all, accompanied by explosions of bombs, volleys of weapons, air alarms, and an inability to hide anywhere. In those moments I regretted leaving home. I felt like I had put my family in even greater danger”, she recalls of her journey., In Lviv, Mykhailiuk Liudmila and her two boys found help and support in JRS Ukraine. “JRS extended a helping hand to us. They provided essential aid we so needed: safe shelter, food, ability to study and work. We felt like we were adopted into a friendly family. It’s so precious and vital to feel such support. ”Despite the current dire situation, Mykhailiuk Liudmila does not lose her hope of returning home someday., “With time I haven’t lost my hope to return home one day,” she affirms. “If there is no chance to do it, I will do my best to build a new life in any possible safe place. I might stay in Ukraine while it’s possible. I don’t feel like I could manage to start a new life abroad by myself with kids. Although, I don’t stop thinking about my next steps. For now, I work with a sense of the importance of every day and with the understanding that right now and here I have a mission,” she adds., Helena started a new life in Hungary*, As the violence approached the city of Dnipro, Helena had one priority in her mind: “All I wanted was to save my son from the invasion”., However, the decision to leave was not easy, and neither was the journey. “I felt absolute loss the day I fled. I clearly remember the traffic was terrible. There were kilometers and kilometers of cars with signs saying Kids”, Helena recalls. “When we finally arrived in Budapest, I felt relaxed and safe”, she confesses. In Budapest, JRS Hungary helped her settle and support herself and her son in the new city. “JRS helps me a lot on every step of my life in Hungary. Their support is 80% of my social protection and help in Budapest”., Looking forward, Helena still is in doubt. “My future is very hazy. On the one hand, I miss my motherland, but, on the other, I have new life in Hungary. For the moment, I will definitely stay in Hungary. ”, she expresses. “If Budapest becomes my motherland in the future, then it will mostly be thanks to JRS.”, Yevheniia found hope in Moldova, When Yevheniia and her mother decided to leave Odessa, the streets were full of families just like hers escaping the violence that the war was bringing to their homes. “We were 2 families in a 5-seat car. When there is no traffic, the trip to Moldova takes around 2 hours. That day, however, it took 27 hours for us to get to Moldova because the line was extremely slow”, Yevheniia recalls., Since February 25th Yevheniia and her mother are in Moldova. They live with other three families in a house provided by CONCORDIA, who converted the place into a home after the war in Ukraine started. More than 8 months since leaving Odessa, Yevheniia longs for her hometown. She especially recalls with melancholy the Odessa National Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet and the Statue of the Duc de Richelieu., While the present is bleak, Yevheniia maintains hope. “Russians are bombing Odessa little by little, but I hope that they will not destroy the architecture, we have so many monuments there… I hope we will soon go back to our Odessa, and we will have a peaceful sky over our heads.”, *Name changed for privacy and security., These stories were originally published by JRS Europe.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/refugees-ukraine-hope-peaceful-future

Priority is given to those with specific vulnerabilities, like older persons, persons with disabilities and families with young children. Essential items like mattresses, blankets and kitchen sets have been distributed, in addition to cash assistance and emergency repair materials for damaged houses. Legal and psychosocial support has also been provided through UNHCR’s local NGO partners working in the region., In August, UNHCR’s programme expanded to include repairs of damaged homes belonging to persons with specific vulnerabilities., UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing commended the partnership with the Head of the Chernihiv Regional State Administration, Viacheslav Chaus, and his team during the ceremony of signing: “I am impressed by the Chernihiv people’s and authorities’ determination to quickly recover and rebuild and reaffirm UNHCR’s commitment to efficiently support this collective effort, by providing humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people impacted by the war against Ukraine”., Viacheslav Chaus, Head of the Chernihiv Regional State Administration, emphasized that the collaboration with the UNHCR is important for the restoration of Chernihiv region: “More than 9,000 destroyed buildings in the oblast are residential. Hospitals, schools, administration buildings are also among them. Unfortunately, Chernihiv oblast struggles with lack of electricity due to frequent attacks on energy infrastructure. Although almost 50,000 explosive items were defused, de-mining remains a pressing issue. However, with Ukrainians’ bravery and a strong international support, we are destined to succeed.”, So far, around 30,000 people in the Chernihiv region have been assisted through UNHCR’s protection, assistance and housing repair programmes, and the Agency aims to assist a total of 2,000 families with housing repairs within the next few months. Across Ukraine to date, UNHCR has provided humanitarian assistance and services to more than 3 million people impacted by the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-and-chernihiv-regional-state-administration-solidify-ongoing-collaboration-support-people-impacted-war-recover-and-rebuild-their-homes-and-lives-enuk

Their job is to help children and families cope and make sure they can access other services like health, cash, mental and psychosocial support., However, for such a big job, only about 3,260 social workers are left in Ukraine to support the ever-increasing caseloads of children and families who need more help than ever because of this war., ""Work of social workers is becoming increasingly important. But at the same time, their workload increases too. That is why we have to support them with new knowledge, mental health care, and digital tools to simplify the work processes. This is a priority for us and our international partners. We are grateful to UNICEF for supporting social services development in Ukraine,"" says Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine Oksana Zholnovich., “Social workers continue to deliver in Ukraine for the most vulnerable children and families who have been affected by this war – and they need support too,” says UNICEF Representative in Ukraine Murat Sahin. “UNICEF understands that, and so we make sure that social workers have access to the help they need to do their jobs well, which in turn means better support to the children and families the social workers serve.”, Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, UNICEF has provided 1,000 social workers with laptops. Furthermore, at the request of the Ministry of Social Policy, UNICEF has purchased 5,000 tablets for social workers and children's services specialists to facilitate their work., UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Policy also plan to expand the e-system of case management, to simplify documentation, streamline the work of specialists and introduce digital social services to promote the modernization of the workforce for a modern era., UNICEF continues to develop social workers' skills and prevent burnout by holding training sessions and webinars., Media contacts

Ukrainians rush to take shelter ahead of looming winter,News and Press Release,IOM,Shelter and Non-Food Items,17 Nov 2022,"Bobrovytsia, 17 November 2022 – Halyna, a volunteer from the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, has seen many things and has many stories to tell., “I know an old lady who lives with her daughter in a garage. Their house was destroyed but they refuse to move because they are afraid that the little they have left will be stolen,” Halyna says., “We gave them some pots and pans, which they cherish since they have lost everything else.”, Born in Belarus but living in Ukraine since her marriage, Halyna lives in a suburb called Bobrovytsia which suffered heavily during the first months of Russian invasion., “We were hiding in the basement – we could barely withstand the cold anymore. We could hear the planes outside; everything was shaking and burning around us; we could only smell gunpowder and smoke,” she recalls., Together with her family, she fled to western Ukraine for a brief period before returning to the ruins of Bobrovytsia. She is now engaged in the distribution of humanitarian aid arriving from both abroad and local contributors., Half of those internally displaced interviewed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) at the end of October reported that their homes had been damaged (45 per cent) or completely destroyed (5 per cent). Of those, nearly all cited the lack of funds as the main barrier to repairing the damage., IOM’s mission in Ukraine has helped 77-year-old Hanna with the partial reconstruction of her home. A new roof has already been built, and soon, an IOM mobile construction team will proceed with the internal repairs., Hanna’s neighbour, a surgeon at a local hospital, has been repairing his home all on his own. At first, he felt too proud to accept an emergency shelter kit, but he relented and the tarpaulin he received proved essential on the rainy, cold autumn days., As harsh as the weather might have been in the past few weeks, the residents know that with winter looming, this is just the beginning of their ordeal., “People want to start rebuilding their houses as soon as possible, but they need help. Some have been provided with construction materials, but they also need manpower because they can’t do it all on their own,” explains Halyna., Since June, local youth and residents from Chernihiv have been coming to Bobrovytsia in the evenings and during the weekends to help clean the rubble and fix or partially restore damaged houses – but the needs are much bigger than the available resources., Halyna never had the opportunity to volunteer before the outbreak of the war. Now, she is regularly making soup, muffins and tea for the brigade of volunteers., “The windows in my house have been broken, but the damage pales in comparison to that of my neighbours. I wanted to make myself useful,” she says., She faces a spectrum of emotions, from pain and disbelief to gratitude and hope, on a daily basis. However, Halyna says she always keeps her patience and resilience., “You never know what someone is going through until you walk a mile in their shoes.”, As of November 2022, IOM had distributed emergency shelter kits to urgently repair damaged houses for 19,500 families across different regions in Ukraine. IOM has also fully repaired 80 individual houses while another 51 are currently being repaired., Written by Varvara Zhluktenko, IOM’s Communications Officer in Ukraine, If you have been affected by the crisis and need support, please call one of IOM’s Hotlines.

As the war rages on, many are left wondering if relief will ever come., Ukrainian cities have recently been bombarded by numerous kamikaze drones. Non-combatant civilians have to survive without electricity and water for days. Others have lost their homes entirely and need a warm place to stay in the cold. Many have lost employment, and with it, any ability to provide for their basic needs. People are in need of electric generators, warm clothes and portable stoves., Children are also suffering without access to their schools, which have been destroyed or seriously damaged. Most students have had to switch to online learning, which is challenging as many towers for internet and cellphones were destroyed. Children are unable to interact with their teachers and their peers., On the most recent trip, Salesians brought relief supplies including food, children’s winter boots, diapers and hygiene products. The Salesian Warsaw Emergency Coordination Team took them to a home for children and the Children’s Hospital in Lviv., “Ukrainian civilians need humanitarian aid of all kinds, including social assistance. We should do everything we can including prayer and material support,” said Daniel Kotvytskyi, with the Salesian Coordination for Emergency Management. “This most recent emergency aid was made possible thanks to our generous benefactors from South Korea, Canada and Australia.

Ukraine: More than half of children missing out on education due to blackouts - Survey,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",17 Nov 2022,"KYIV, 17 November --- One in two caregivers in Ukraine said their children's education suffered after reoccurring attacks on power plants in October left more than 4.5 million households without electricity, according to a survey by Save the Children., Children's access to education is set to drastically worsen the longer the fighting continues around urban centres and heavily populated areas such as Kyiv. The continued attacks on energy infrastructure in November have left some 10 million families across the country without electricity., Save the Children conducted an online survey of more than 1,600 caregivers across Ukraine to find out whether emergency power cuts had disrupted children's education. Half of them reported that between October 10-21 their children missed online classes or could not do their homework due to an absence of electricity, internet connection, or because they needed to take shelter., A mother of a school student in Ukraine who responded to the survey said:, ""It's challenging, but my kid does all the tasks herself. She has a knack for learning, but it's tough to read, write and complete tasks via smartphone."", It's estimated that 2.6 million students are learning from home, as of October 22, according to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine. Whilst some schools have been able to reopen since September 1, many lack protective shelters, have been damaged or destroyed, or remain under possible threat of attacks. As a result, online education is essential for children to continue their learning., Khrystyna*, 14 years old, from Poltava said:, ""I miss 3 to 4 lessons per week. The mobile network is very bad. I look through the textbooks myself and study with a tutor. There are some topics you really need someone to explain to you."", Viktoriia*, 16 years old, from Boryspil near Kyiv added:, ""In our town, the power outages are quite often. And every time they happen, I miss some lessons. Mobile internet is not always good enough to connect to online classes. I go through the material myself but it's difficult because I really miss talking to teachers in person. Without their explanations I can't really understand everything."", Teachers have reported that the power blackouts are also affecting children's motivation to learn., Mariia*, a mathematics teacher from Kyiv region, said:, ""The teachers do their best. We attach video lessons, we create presentations, we send out lessons to those who couldn't connect to the internet. But we have a hard time, and children do as well. They lack motivation. Then, parents have to jump in, to control and to motivate. Once the electricity is back on, kids do not want to learn, they want to play. Then the blackout comes back, and no homework is done."", In Ukraine, Save the Children is helping to rebuild damaged schools and has established a network of Digital Learning Centers to help children access education. The organization also distributes Education Kits which contain pens, colouring pencils, notepads, and educational materials, so children do not miss crucial learning., Sonia Khush, Save the Children Country Director in Ukraine, said:, ""The war has delivered a devastating blow to children's education in Ukraine. Thousands of schools have been damaged by shelling and missile strikes, and hundreds are completely destroyed. A small number of children who are still able to attend school in person are forced to hide in shelters every other day. The power cuts and rolling blackouts are robbing the millions of children who learn online of their education. The continued fighting around urban centres will make a bad situation even worse., ""It goes without saying how crucial education is for children. Knowledge is important, but school also provides an opportunity to connect with their peers and to support one another through a very difficult time. We are at risk of a whole generation of children missing out on the learning, development and joy that education provides., Save the Children calls on warring parties to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, including those on proportionality and discrimination in the targeting and carrying out of operations, and ensure that civilians and civilian objects, especially those impacting children such as homes, schools, and hospitals, are protected from attack., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to access education and other critical services., Notes, *Name has been changed to protect the identity., The survey was conducted via social media from 20-31 of October. Save the Children surveyed 1604 parents of children, who learn at schools, colleges, higher educational establishments, technical schools, specialised schools, and boarding schools., Throughout October, there were five waves of attacks on power plants across Ukraine, that took out an estimated 40% of energy infrastructure in the country, according to the Ukrainian government. To stabilize the energy system and reduce the consumption of electricity, the authorities have introduced rolling blackouts. Scheduled power cuts hit 7 to 10 regions in the Northern, Central and Eastern parts of Ukraine every day, with outages lasting up to 12 hours in total.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-more-half-children-missing-out-education-due-blackouts-survey

Over 6 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. The destruction of people’s homes compounded by harsh winter conditions could possibly lead to massive displacement once again., CARE is particularly concerned about the situation of women and girls. In conflict, their risk of experiencing gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation and abuse increases. Further to this, disrupted health services pose major challenges, especially for pregnant and lactating women in dire need of such services., “The damage to infrastructure is critical. Although our operations are challenged by air alerts, CARE and our partners are doing all we can to continue to support people with winter supplies, including clothing, blankets and heating. Ukrainian citizens urgently need support to survive the winter, specifically in terms of renovations of collective shelters and infrastructure. It is also crucial to ensure that protection and gender-based violence prevention and response are a focus of winterization activities,” says Fabrice Martin, Country Director, CARE Ukraine., CARE and its partners are supporting families in Ukraine with essential items to help them face the harsh winter ahead: Aid workers are distributing warm clothing, blankets, and heating equipment. Renovation work is being done to help keep the cold out of private homes and community centres: windows and doors are being replaced, roofs and heating systems repaired, and walls insulated. But none of these efforts will have impacts if attacks continue. We call on all conflict parties to respect their obligation under International Humanitarian Law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and to exercise distinction and proportionality., For more information please contact:, Anisa Husain

"Senior Official Warns Security Council of ‘Catastrophic Spillover’, as Death, Destruction in Ukraine Conflict Keeps Growing",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Nov 2022,"9195TH MEETING (PM), SC/15109, Speakers Reiterate Russian Federation’s Responsibility for War, Any further escalation must be prevented to avoid a potentially catastrophic spillover of the war in Ukraine, a United Nations senior official told the Security Council today, a day after an explosion that killed two people in Poland near the Ukrainian border, as speakers underscored the Russian Federation’s full responsibility for the war., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that, in the past few days, Ukrainians have been subjected to some of the most intense bombardments of the nine-month-old war. Russian Federation missiles and drones have rained down on Kyiv and many other cities in the country, destroying or damaging homes and severely disrupting critical services, she said, warning that the impact of such attacks can only worsen during the coming winter months., She reported that, as of 14 November, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 16,631 civilian casualties, totalling 6,557 persons killed and 10,074 injured since the start of the aggression. Voicing concern about the loss of electricity, hampered humanitarian efforts, allegations of atrocities and human rights violations and a looming food crisis, she said: “There is only one way to stop the death, destruction and division. The war must end.”, Warning that there is no end in sight to the war, she said: “As long as it continues, the risks of potentially catastrophic spillover remain all too real.” The incident in Poland near the Ukrainian border on 15 November is a reminder of the absolute need to prevent any further escalation, she added., In the ensuing debate, speakers called once again on the Russian Federation to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Pointing to the conflict’s alarming consequences, they also urged unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians, as well as the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative., The United Arab Emirates’ representative said the 15 November incident — which remains under investigation — was an unnerving warning of the inherent risks of the war’s continuation. “This cannot be the new normal,” she stressed, urging the Council to support any effort at talks and focus on measures that bring the sides together rather than further apart., The United States’ representative said the incident never should have happened but for the Russian Federation’s needless invasion of Ukraine and its recent missile assaults against civilian infrastructure. Ukraine has every right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, she said, adding: “If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.”, The Russian Federation’s representative, rejecting that view, said that, if the West had not interfered and not supplied Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, but instead encouraged the Ukrainian leadership to make peace on realistic terms, then Moscow would not have had to carry out precision strikes on infrastructure in order to weaken Ukraine’s military potential., Mexico’s representative, among other things, focussed on the humanitarian situation. If living conditions keep deteriorating, there will be a new wave of displacements, he warned, adding that the conflict is also having severe mental health consequences., Poland’s representative said two Polish citizens lost their lives from the explosion of a missile five kilometres from the Polish-Ukrainian border. Poland, acting with full restraint and responsibility, immediately launched an investigation, with initial findings supporting the hypothesis that the event was not a deliberate attack. Consultations between Poland and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and key partners are continuing. However, notwithstanding the outcome of the investigation, the Russian Federation is responsible for menacing the world with its war of aggression and spill-over effects, he said., Ukraine’s representative, on that point, said that, as temperatures drop in his country, “these terrorists” are aiming to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, water and heating by targeting civilian infrastructure in at least 11 regions. The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw all its fighters from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and transfer control of that facility to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Ukrainian personnel, he added. Highlighting that 400 Russian Federation war crimes have already been documented, he said that, with the courage of the Ukrainian army, the commitment of the Ukrainian people and international solidarity, the Russian Federation will be stopped., Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, France, United Kingdom, Kenya, India, Gabon, Ireland, Brazil, China, Norway, Ghana, Estonia and Slovakia, as well as the European Union in its capacity as observer., The meeting began at 3:04 p.m. and ended at 5:23 p.m., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that in the past few days, Ukrainians have been subjected to some of the most intense bombardments of the nine-month-old war. Russian Federation missiles and drones have rained down on Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv, Lviv, Poltava and elsewhere, destroying or damaging homes and severely disrupting critical services, she said, warning that the impact of such attacks can only worsen during the coming winter months. As of 14 November, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 16,631 civilian casualties: 6,557 persons killed and 10,074 injured since the start of the invasion. Attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, she noted. Meanwhile, the military dynamics on the ground are evolving, with Kherson returning to Government control, but heavy fighting continuing in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “Indeed, there is no end in sight to the war. As long as it continues, the risks of potentially catastrophic spillover remain all too real,” she said, emphasizing that the incident in Poland near the Ukrainian border on 15 November is a reminder of the absolute need to prevent any further escalation., The ongoing bombardment of Ukraine has already damaged an estimated 40 per cent of the country’s power-generation capacity, she said, with most parts of Kyiv, which has been hit hardest, now without electricity for 12 hours a day. As the Government focuses on repairing damaged infrastructure, the United Nations is making it a priority to ensure that the most vulnerable receive winter supplies and services. More than 185,000 people have already received essential basic winter supplies, humanitarian partners are setting up “heating points” near front lines and 525 generators have been or will be distributed to hospitals, clinics, collective centres and other priority institutions. Humanitarian access has resumed in the areas back under Government control, including in Kherson, but it remains extremely difficult to reach people in need in Russian Federation‑controlled areas of the east and south and across the front line. Landmines, particularly close to the front or where control has recently shifted, are putting more lives at risk, impeding the movement of civilians and hampering humanitarian efforts. Parties are required by international humanitarian law to facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for all civilians in need, she stressed., The allegations of atrocities and human rights violations in Ukraine during this war are extensive, she continued, highlighting that more than 400 children have been killed, and many more injured, lost their family members or forced to leave their homes. According to the Government portal “Children of War”, 279 children were considered missing as of 12 November, she said, adding that there are disturbing reports of forced transfers of children, including of some under institutionalized care, to Russian Federation-occupied territory or to the Russian Federation. OHCHR has documented several individual cases, including those involving unaccompanied children, that appear to amount to deportations to the Russian Federation, in violation of international humanitarian law. Moreover, among the 57 cases of conflict-related sexual violence verified by OHCHR, 48 are attributable to Russian armed forces and affiliated groups and nine to Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement authorities. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine is planning another visit to the country before the end of the year. She welcomed the continued prisoner exchanges between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, encouraged the continued release of prisoners of war, and called on the parties to ensure humane treatment of prisoners of war. She further called on the Russian Federation to grant OHCHR and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) unimpeded access to detainees., The extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative remains vital to help avert a food crisis for millions of people, she said, noting that more than 10 million metric tons of foodstuffs have now been moved under the Initiative, reaching, or on the way to, some 40 countries. The impact of the Initiative extends far beyond immediate ports of arrival, helping to lower global prices for key food commodities around the world. The Secretary-General has continued to engage with all parties in support of the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative and is committed to removing remaining obstacles to Russian Federation food and fertilizer exports. Those products are not under international sanctions but suffer indirect impacts, she pointed out, stressing that it is critical to get them back to world markets ‑ “the sooner, the better”., The risk of a nuclear incident in the context of the open hostilities in Ukraine remains an unacceptable danger, she said, echoing the concerns expressed by several Member States in that regard. In the coming weeks, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will send nuclear safety and security missions to three more operating nuclear power plants, as well as to Chernobyl, at the request of the Government of Ukraine. She reiterated the imperative to avoid any military activity that could risk compromising the safety and security of any nuclear facility., “One significant casualty of the war has been the international collective security system we have all pledged to uphold,” she said, noting that the significant damage to the structures built to resolve or manage conflict has made it more difficult to chart a path out of the hostilities in Ukraine. “There is only one way to stop the death, destruction and division. The war must end. And it must end in line with international law and the UN Charter, as called for by the UN General Assembly,” she said., Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), noting the tragic explosion that killed two people in Poland near the Ukrainian border, affirmed her country’s assistance in investigating the incident. Although not all the facts are known, one thing is clear: this tragedy would never have happened but for the Russian Federation’s needless invasion of Ukraine and its recent missile assaults against civilian infrastructure. Ukraine has every right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, she said, highlighting the recent widest-scale missile attack on Ukraine since the beginning of the war. The actions of the Russian Federation are “a deliberate tactic by Putin”, she noted, observing that it seemed he decided that, if he cannot seize Ukraine by force, he will try to freeze the country into submission. She also recalled that, during her trip to Ukraine, she had had to announced more humanitarian funding in the dark due to a blackout caused by Russian Federation attacks. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks a just peace based on the Charter of the United Nations and its principles, she stressed, adding: “If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.” Turning to the global security crisis, she underlined the importance of securing the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has helped stabilize food markets and enabled prices to fall to pre-war levels. Pointing out that two thirds of the wheat exported under the Initiative went to the Global South, she called on the Council members to “keep the deal alive”., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that, while nine months is the period humans need to bring a baby to life, the Russian Federation has used it to make a disaster of terrible proportion. The missile that landed at a farm in Poland, killing two people, landed roughly at the same time as a barrage of Russian missiles that attacked Western Ukraine. “As long as the war goes on, we run the risk of spillover, by accident or intention,” he said, welcoming the 10‑point peace plan presented by the President of Ukraine at the Group of 20 Summit. Noting the Russian Federation’s decision to withdraw its troops from Kherson, he said that “no one, including in Russia, is buying anymore the camouflaged language”. He also called for extending the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 22 November., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), condemning the Russian Federation’s new campaign of strikes against Ukrainian cities and reaffirming its support for Ukraine, expressed solidarity with Poland and extended his condolences to the two victims. The Russian Federation alone bears full responsibility for the war, he said, underlining that Ukraine is only exercising its strict right to defend itself. He also pointed out that the Russian Federation is seeking to plunge Ukraine into cold and darkness as winter approaches and is not hesitating to exploit food insecurity and malnutrition. After first suspending its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative for a few days, that country is now seeking to monetize the renewal of that agreement. This blackmail is intolerable, he stressed. Everything must be done to ensure that Ukrainian grain exports continue unhindered. France will organize with Ukraine a conference on 13 December with an aim to respond to the emergency and to increase the supply of international aid to Ukraine, whether in the form of basic equipment or the reconstruction of critical infrastructure, particularly energy, he said., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that, while the outcome of an investigation into the incident in Poland is pending, the tragedy indisputably stems from the Russian Federation’s inhumane assault against civilians across Ukraine. Through the largest barrage of missiles and drone strikes since the start of the war, the Russian Federation is knowingly generating military advantage by creating desperation. Its attacks may violate international humanitarian law and are in any case deeply inhumane. Turning to the General Assembly’s adoption of a resolution this week to establish an international reparations mechanism, she said it is an important first step towards justice for Ukraine. Supporting a renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, she called on the Russian Federation to cease hostilities, withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and commit to dialogue., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said yesterday’s incident demonstrated that each day of continued fighting becomes a gamble in which there cannot be any winners. Around the world, Governments continue to warn of the war’s consequences on the global food supply – most recently at the Group of 20 Summit in Indonesia. In addition to the export of grains, the supply of ammonia and fertilizers, crucial to ensure adequate crop yields for next year’s harvest, are also a priority. Citing the Secretary-General’s warning that this year’s crisis of affordability cannot become next year’s crisis of availability, she called for the Black Sea Grain Initiative to be renewed and urged stakeholders to reach a solution which ensures its extension. Only a sustainable, peaceful resolution of the war can put an end to the suffering it has caused. For its part, the Council must support any effort at talks and focus on measures that bring the sides together rather than further apart. While public statements counselling calm and restraint helped avoid escalation, yesterday’s overall episode was an unnerving warning of the inherent risks of the war’s continuation, she noted. “This cannot be the new normal — too much is at stake, not least of which is Ukraine,” she stressed. The Council must encourage confidence-building measures, open channels of communication and ensure that today is not an era of war., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said the lack of electricity is compromising the supply of water and other basic services, putting the lives of millions at greater risk. If living conditions keep deteriorating, there will be a new wave of displacements, he warned, noting that host countries are already at their capacity limits. He called for unrestricted humanitarian access to all civilians, including in occupied oblasts where martial law has been decreed. The conflict is also having severe mental health consequences, he said, reiterating the importance of including psychosocial support services in the humanitarian response strategy. As the impact on mental health will not end when the conflict does, a long-term strategy must be developed. Turning to nuclear safety and security, he called for the establishment of a protection and security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as proposed by the IAEA. He went on to say that the Black Sea Grain Initiative must continue to facilitate access to global markets of food products and fertilizers., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) stated that the humanitarian costs to the people of Ukraine are joined by millions around the world. The flow of grains and fertilizers from Ukraine over the Black Sea and also from the Russian Federation over land corridors must be assured. He encouraged the European Union and the African Union to review and report on the experiences of their member States in ensuring unimpeded exports of Ukrainian and Russian Federation food and fertilizer to world markets. The Horn of Africa is experiencing the worst drought in decades and cannot afford to pay for exceedingly expensive fertilizer. Further, Africa is the most food-insecure region in the world. Yet, it has the largest amount of underused arable land with a population that is still mostly rural. This crisis presents an opportunity to put in place financial risk mitigation, technology transfers and investments in order to transform agricultural productivity on the continent, he emphasized, adding: “While we commend the humanitarian efforts being made to offer relief, our target must be sufficient production.”, RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India), expressing concern at the targeting of civilian infrastructure as well as civilian fatalities, said that “this cannot be an era of war”. So far, India has dispatched 12 consignments of humanitarian aid and stands ready to do more. Emphasizing that the serious economic impact of the conflict on the Global South, she also underscored growing concerns for energy and food security in the wake of the severe stress caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic. She expressed hope for the renewal of the Black Sea Grain Initiative and encouraged all parties to earnestly implement it in all aspects. Going forward, India’s approach will remain people-centric, she said, adding that it will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as well as to neighbouring States in the Global South., LILLY STELLA NGYEMA NDONG (Gabon), hailing the resumption of exports following the brief suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, called for the renewal of that agreement and its full and balanced implementation. Its resumption is a sign that, even in times of war, the channels of dialogue and diplomacy remain open, she said. Highlighting the humanitarian consequences of the war, she pointed to mass displacement of people as well as the high number of civilian victims and incalculable material losses. Ongoing supply chain problems have plunged people into hunger, she said, also pointing to increased sexual violence and trafficking. Calling on warring parties to uphold international humanitarian law, she stressed that civilian infrastructure, including civilian nuclear sites, must not be targeted. More so, dialogue and negotiations must be done in good faith, she said., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland), stressing the importance and applicability of the IAEA’s seven pillars of nuclear safety and security, condemned the Russian Federation’s heinous attacks against civilians and civilian objects. Such attacks are war crimes for which those responsible must be held to account. Parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law, including the obligation to take all feasible precautions and the prohibitions against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. There must also be full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to civilians in need, he added, recalling also that the forced transfer or deportation of civilians can constitute a war crime. All sides must continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative and maintain their engagement, he said, urging the Russian Federation to immediately cease hostilities, withdraw its forces and resolve all outstanding issues peacefully and in line with the United Nations Charter., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil), echoing the concerns over the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine and the conflict’s impact on food security, encouraged parties to engage in the immediate extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. While the conflict is not the only cause of food insecurity, the continuation of grain and fertilizer exports helps to stabilize prices and prevent shortages. In that regard, global food supply fragilities stem from systemic actions that have hindered agricultural development throughout the developing world, particularly in Africa, including massive agricultural subsidies and distorting tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder agricultural production in developing countries. Turning to the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, he condemned the attacks against residential areas and civilian facilities. All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and adopt practical measures to minimize civilian injuries and damage. For its part, the international community must stand together and provide humanitarian assistance, he stressed, also pledging to send an additional 24 tons of rice from his country. Brazil has also simplified entry requirements to facilitate the reception of refugees. Governments and the private sector must engage in solidarity, he stressed, adding that there is no more urgent task facing the United Nations than the search for an immediate ceasefire without preconditions., ZHANG JUN (China) said the international community must play a responsible role in seeking consensus and de-escalating tensions, adding that an increasingly protracted and complex conflict is in no one’s interest. Noting that the Russian Federation has expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue, he hoped that concerned parties will commence direct engagement as soon as possible. Legitimate security concerns must be accommodated to achieve a balanced European security architecture, address the security deficit behind the crisis and foster peace. In addition, the United States, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Russian Federation should engage in comprehensive dialogue on that matter. On the missile incident in Poland, he called for all parties to maintain calm and to avoid actions that might worsen the situation. All actors must abide by the Convention on Nuclear Safety and do their utmost to avoid nuclear risks, he said, adding that the international community must ensure nuclear weapons are never used. Expressing concern over the humanitarian situation, he called on parties to abide by international law and avoid targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. China stands ready to resolve differences on the export of Russian Federation food and fertilizers, he said, deploring the indiscriminate use of sanctions and rejecting the use of “beggar thy neighbour practices or the creation of closed and exclusive clubs”., MONA JUUL (Norway) stressed that the explosion resulting in the tragic loss of Polish lives would not have happened had it not been for the Russian Federation’s attacks on civilian infrastructure. Yet they did what they could to make the situation as difficult as possible for the civilian population by destroying water, heat, and electricity supplies. With winter approaching, the number of casualties and displaced persons could accelerate. Children, the elderly, and other people in highly vulnerable situations are particularly at risk. She called for the safe, rapid and unimpeded access of humanitarian organizations to all people in need. International law and international human rights law must be fully respected and implemented, she stressed, adding: “International Law applies to all nations. It is not optional.” Turning to the global consequences of the war that have destabilized financial markets, supply chains and energy security, she emphasized the need to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The Council has a duty to set a different course from the Russian Federation’s disregard for the Organization’s core principles and the suffering of millions. She urged the Russian Federation to heed the ruling of the International Court of Justice, listen to the calls of States, suspend its military operations in Ukraine and stop the senseless bloodshed and global suffering., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), recalling incidents in 2008 and 2014 which involved the downing of Russian and Malaysian airliners respectively, said that Ukraine’s air defences have long had a bad reputation. Video footage regularly shows the consequences of Ukrainian air‑defence systems on residential homes. Despite evidence of Ukrainian and Polish provocation, many representatives of Western countries expressed the view that, even if the missiles were launched by Ukraine, the Russian Federation is still to blame for destroying critical infrastructure. “We would not find ourselves in this situation were it not for the fact that in 2014 in Kyiv, a bloody anti-constitutional coup had not taken place,” he said, adding that Ukraine’s leaders had set out to distort history and supplant the Russian language, provoking an acute internal civil conflict. If the West had not interfered and not supplied Ukraine with weapons and ammunition, but instead encouraged the Ukrainian leadership to make peace on realistic terms, the Russian Federation would not have had to carry out precision strikes on infrastructure in order to weaken Ukraine’s military potential, he said., Spotlighting the role of NATO member States, he pointed to a continuous supply of weapons, as well as teams of instructors and foreign mercenaries. He also noted the involvement of the United States military in the planning and de facto control of military activities, making Ukraine a testing ground for various kinds of weapons. It would be naïve to believe that all the military and financial support provided by the West is being used as intended, he said, citing evidence that many weapons end up in the hands of terrorists and criminals or is simply stolen. He added that Western countries are trying to shift responsibility for their transgressions onto the Russian Federation through the United Nations, emphasizing that the initiators of the General Assembly’s so-called reparations resolution were unable to provide a broader outline of what kind of mechanism they intend to create. Developing countries were forced to sign onto a legally dubious and politicized text aimed at the “illegal legalization” of the expropriation of foreign assets. Once again, the developing world can see that the Ukrainian crisis is mere political currency in the hands of the West, an instrument to punish undesirables and to retain global domination that is slipping away in favour of an emerging multi-polar world, he said., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), Council President for November, speaking in his national capacity, welcomed the Russian Federation’s return to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. That Initiative has recorded more than 10 million metric tons of grain shipment across the world, he noted, adding that he was counting on the good faith commitments of all stakeholders to renew it upon its expiration on 19 November for the sake of the almost 100 million people who suffer from high levels of food insecurity. He expressed deep concern over intensified missile and drone attacks on several Ukrainian cities - including renewed attacks on Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv yesterday - as the unrelenting assault on an already battered energy infrastructure amidst the upcoming winter threatens the livelihood of many civilians. He further voiced alarm over emerging reports of possible war crimes in Kherson. Such claims, including human rights violations and conflict-related sexual violence, must be submitted to thorough, transparent and independent investigations. The Council and the international community must work collectively to avoid impunity in Ukraine and secure justice for all victims of the war. Calling on the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally cease its aggression against Ukraine, and to seek a resolution of its concerns through diplomacy and dialogue, he warned that yesterday’s Polish missile incident, and the experience of history, reminds the international community of the risk that the continuation of this unnecessary war poses in its further spread., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), describing the Russian Federation’s permanent seat in the Council as a mockery of peace efforts, said that, as temperatures drop in his country, “these terrorists” are aiming to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, water and heating with the targeting of energy facilities and civilian infrastructure in at least 11 regions. Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian Federation war crimes, he said, adding that bodies of both civilians and military personnel have been found. The resolution for furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine, adopted by the General Assembly this week, is a message of hope for justice and an important step towards accountability. Echoing Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s statement to the “G19 Summit” this week, he said the Russian Federation must immediately withdraw all its fighters from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and transfer control to IAEA and Ukrainian personnel. To improve food security globally, he added, Ukraine proposes an expansion of the grain export initiative to other ports, particularly to the port of Mykolaiv and Olvia in the Mykolaiv region. Ukraine can export 45 million tons of foodstuffs this year, he said, adding that any country can contribute to ensuring that Ukrainian grain is supplied to those in need. On energy security, he urged greater efforts to ensure full protection from “Russian terrorists”., Turning to the situation of prisoners and deportees, he said that the only viable solution is the release of prisoners on an ""all‑for‑all"" basis. Ukraine will not compromise its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he said, stressing that Russian troops must withdraw and Ukrainian control over the entire border with the Russian Federation restored. Justice should immediately come next, he added. Stressing the need to immediately protect the environment, he said millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling and almost 200,000 hectares of land contaminated with unexploded landmines and shells. At the latest Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference, Ukraine proposed to create a platform for the assessment of environmental damage of war. To prevent escalation, his country requires effective security assurances, which should be an integral element of the post-war security architecture in the Euro-Atlantic space, he emphasized. When all anti-war measures are implemented, when security and justice begin to be restored, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties, he added. “Russia must be stopped and due to the courage of the Ukrainian army, due to the commitment of the Ukrainian people, due to international solidarity with Ukraine Russia will be stopped,” he said., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland), providing additional details about yesterday, said two Polish citizens lost their lives from the explosion of a missile that fell on their location 5 kilometres from the Polish-Ukrainian border. These two innocent people would not have been killed if there had not been a war in Ukraine. No matter what the particular course of events in Przewodów yesterday afternoon, their only fault was the fact that they lived close to civilian infrastructure which the Russian Federation keeps attacking as military targets. Acting with full restraint and responsibility, Poland immediately launched an extensive, multi-faceted investigation where initial findings support the hypothesis that the event was not a deliberate attack. It is also conducting intensive consultations on the incident with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and key partners, has increased the combat readiness of selected units and will continue to provide collective security guarantees for the region both as an individual country and a part of NATO, he added. However, notwithstanding the outcomes of the investigation, it is clear that the Russian Federation is responsible for menacing the world with its war of aggression and spill-over effects, he said., Despite recent setbacks, Moscow still wants to erase Ukraine from the map and cause innocent people to suffer, he continued. Nevertheless, the current situation will not change Poland’s approach, he emphasized, while spotlighting his Government’s ongoing support for Ukraine. The Russian Federation continues to attack Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in a deliberate attempt to aggravate the humanitarian crisis with the probable goal of causing another wave of refugees to destabilize the situation in other countries. “Russian imperialism needs to be treated as the thing it really is: a global threat, with far-reaching consequences,” he stressed, adding: “This global threat needs to be neutralized before it plunges the whole world further into chaos.” As the war must end with a just peace acceptable to Ukraine and accountability for war atrocities and the damages inflicted, States on the side of international law must persuade the Russian Federation to stop its aggression and withdraw from Ukraine. This is the only way to prevent further deaths, injuries and devastation and stop the escalation of this large-scale humanitarian and human rights crisis, he stated., REIN TAMMSAAR (Estonia), speaking on behalf of the Baltic States, commended the immense bravery of the Ukrainian defence forces that took back control of Kherson. “There is no doubt that sooner or later, Ukraine will liberate all the occupied territories within its internationally recognized borders.” He urged the Russian Federation to provide humanitarian access to occupied areas. It must also allow the United Nations and ICRC access to those places where civilians and prisoners of war are being held, and ensure access for the Organization’s fact-finding mission to Olenivka. Due to its blockade of Ukrainian ports and destruction of necessary infrastructure, the Russian Federation has caused a global food crisis, essentially weaponizing food and hunger as means of hybrid warfare, he continued, adding that the Black Sea Grain Initiative, alongside the European Union’s Solidarity Lanes action plan, has helped to stabilize the global food market. He went on to request the creation of a special tribunal for the Russian Federation’s actions., BJÖRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, noted that 15 November saw the largest missile attack by the Russian Federation since the start of the invasion. By disrupting energy and water supply, that country is trying to paralyse the population, he said. Further, actions targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure by the Russian Federation are unlawful and constitute war crimes. He also reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that Ukraine may need $4 billion a month to maintain water and electrical utilities. To that end, the European Union is working on a package to ensure macroeconomic stability, maintain essential public service and rebuild critical infrastructure. He also reiterated the need for full humanitarian access, including in areas not currently under the Ukrainian Government’s control. As well, it was of paramount importance to continue documenting all war crimes committed throughout Ukraine, as the International Criminal Court and the Ukrainian authorities worked to bring perpetrators to account., Monday’s adoption of a General Assembly resolution to recommend the creation of a register of damages and recognize the need for reparation of damage is another step to ensure accountability, he continued. In that regard, the Union will continue to support Ukraine within the framework of the International Court of Justice. He underscored that, by weaponizing food, the Russian Federation is solely responsible for the global food security crisis. According to United Nations data, two thirds of the wheat exported from Ukraine through the Black Sea Grain Initiative has gone to developing countries. In addition to export over sea via the European Union‑Ukraine Solidarity Lanes, 15 million tons of agricultural goods have also been exported from Ukraine to global markets over land. Among other efforts, the Union is stepping up global food assistance, including a new humanitarian aid package of €210 million for 15 countries, bringing its overall food security support up to €8 billion between 2021-2024. Calling on others to step up their humanitarian assistance, he added: “The war would end tomorrow if the Russian Federation withdrew, as requested by the General Assembly.”, RÓBERT CHATRNÚCH (Slovakia) said that images of civilians greeting Ukrainian soldiers with open arms in Kherson only confirms the Russian Federation’s “Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors” perception. He expressed grave concern at the humanitarian situation, as well as the large number of civilian deaths, attacks on critical infrastructure and sexual and gender‑based violence committed by Russian soldiers and occupiers. He also deplored in the strongest terms Russian missile attacks across Ukraine on 15 November which plunged 7 million homes into darkness. Reiterating concern about global food security, he urged the Russian Federation to listen to the United Nations and implement all relevant resolutions, including the one adopted by the General Assembly earlier this week., For information media.

"Third Committee Approves Six Draft Resolutions, Including Texts on Human Rights in Iran, Myanmar, Syria, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Crimea",News and Press Release,UN GA,Protection and Human Rights,16 Nov 2022,"SEVENTY-SEVENTH SESSION, 52ND & 53RD MEETINGS (AM & PM), GA/SHC/4369, The Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) approved six draft resolutions today, five of which focused on country-specific situations, while the last drew attention to the rising number of refugees and displaced persons in Africa., A draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol — approved by a recorded vote of 78 in favour to 14 against, with 79 abstentions — would have the Assembly condemn the ongoing temporary occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, as well as its unprovoked aggression against Ukraine., Ukraine’s delegate recalled that, since 2014, Russian occupying forces have been persistently turning Crimea into a gloomy island of fear and repression. Crimea has been used as a military base for Moscow’s attacks on other parts of Ukraine, including the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, he asserted, adding that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine brought nine months of unspeakable suffering, loss and devastation on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War., The representative of the Russian Federation described the draft as an example of Ukraine’s hate-based policy towards its own population. The current Kyiv regime — under external control — is engaged in anti-Russian activity, while an economic war is being waged against his country, he stressed. Voicing concern over the Russian Federation’s sovereignty, he said that a vote in favour is a vote in support of military escalation., Several delegations broadly rejected the use of country-specific resolutions, with Venezuela’s delegate noting that the practice of approving politically motivated drafts creates confrontation instead of promoting dialogue. Echoing his concerns, Singapore’s delegate underlined that country-specific resolutions have become selective and driven by politicization., Syria’s delegate described the approach of targeting one country as an exploitation of human rights for political purposes, as well as a waste of resources. Along similar lines, China’s delegate opposed the establishment of country-specific human rights mechanisms without the consent of the concerned country., In other action, the Committee approved a draft on the human rights situation in Iran by a recorded vote of 80 in favour to 28 against, with 68 abstentions. Under its terms, the Assembly would express concern at the alarmingly high frequency of the imposition of the death penalty in the country. Further, it would urge Iran to cease the use of excessive force against peaceful protesters, including women and children, such as in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini’s arbitrary arrest and subsequent death while in custody., Rejecting the draft, Iran’s delegate denounced that the co-sponsors, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Israeli regime and Germany, preach human rights despite their record of blatant hypocrisy, brutality, genocide and ethnic cleansing., A draft resolution on human rights in Myanmar — approved by consensus — would have the Assembly condemn all abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims perpetrated by Myanmar security and armed forces. It would call on the Myanmar military to end immediately all violations, provide justice to victims and end impunity, starting with an independent investigation., Myanmar’s delegate stressed that the military junta must be held accountable for its atrocities against the people of Myanmar, triggering a humanitarian crisis, and threatening regional peace and security. Condemning grave violations perpetrated against the Rohingya by the illegal military junta, he called for concrete actions to support their safe and dignified return., In other notable action, the Committee approved a draft on the human rights situation in Syria by a recorded vote of 90 in favour to 14 against, with 68 abstentions. By its terms, the Assembly would demand that the Syrian regime and Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) immediately desist from any further use of chemical weapons and grant unhindered access to the Commission of Inquiry on the country., Syria’s delegate, describing the process of presenting the deeply politicized draft as “less than transparent”, stressed that the United States has occupied Syrian territory and bombarded civilian infrastructure, preventing the Syrian people from having access to their most basic needs. Moreover, Washington and its Western allies are closing their eyes to the terroristic nature of the thousands of fighters that have infiltrated Syria’s land, he asserted., A draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — approved by consensus — would have the Assembly express deep concern at the grave human rights situation and pervasive culture of impunity in the country. It would condemn the country for diverting its resources into pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles over the welfare of its people., The delegate of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea categorically rejected the draft as a political plot aimed at destabilizing his country. Opposing politicization and double standards, he accused the West of abusing human rights issues to overthrow Governments in other countries., Also today, the Committee approved by consensus a draft resolution on assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa., The Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 17 November, to take further action on draft resolutions., Action on Draft Resolutions, At the meeting’s onset, the representative of Azerbaijan, speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, emphasized the role of the Human Rights Council for consideration of human rights situations in all countries, in the context of the Universal Periodic Review. She expressed deep concern over the selective adoption of country-specific resolutions in the Third Committee and in the Human Rights Council. She also rejected the ongoing practice in the Security Council of dealing with human rights issues in pursuit of certain States’ political objectives. Further, she reiterated the importance of ensuring the implementation of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council as an action-oriented, cooperative mechanism based on reliable information and interactive dialogue, with full involvement of countries under review and conducted in an impartial, non-selective, constructive, non-confrontational and non-politicized manner. The Committee then took up the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” (document A/C.3/77/L.32), which the Chair noted contained no programme budget implications., Introducing the draft, the representative of the Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said the draft reflects the bloc’s deep concern over the severe human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, noting that no improvements have been seen in the past year. He stressed that some updates in this year’s text are related to the COVID‑19 pandemic and cooperation on vaccines, while others reflect the new Special Rapporteur as of August. The text calls for continued actions and engagement by the international community, he said, adding that it is “crucial” that the draft sends a clear message to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to “take immediate steps to improve the human rights situation”. Also stressing the need to voice continued support for the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and its field office in Seoul, he said the bloc “pursues a policy of critical engagement with regard to that country”., The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea categorically rejected the draft as a political plot that has nothing to do with the protection of human rights. The adoption of resolutions targeting the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is repeated every year, aimed at destabilizing the country. He stressed the need to reject politicization, selectivity and double standards, and ensure impartiality and objectivity in activities to promote human rights. The United States and Western countries are abusing human rights issues to interfere and overthrow the systems of other countries and misuse the United Nations for their objectives. While his country is ready to make positive contributions to efforts promoting human rights, it will never tolerate the selective attempt of any force to attack its social system, he said. He strongly denounced and rejected the draft as “a grave infringement of the sovereignty of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea” and a hostile, provocative confrontation., The representative of Venezuela, speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations, said the presentation of country-specific resolutions, without the prior consent of the State concerned, goes against the principles of impartiality, objectivity, transparency, non-selectivity, non-politicization and non-confrontation, and is at odds with the spirit of the Charter. He expressed concern over “more and more unilateral mechanisms” being deployed, in which affected countries do not participate or have not given their consent to. His group is also against the ongoing practice of the Security Council to deal with human rights issues far beyond its mandate, he said, calling for an end to the politicization of human rights issues. He underscored the role of the treaty bodies, special Procedures of the Human Rights Council and Universal Periodic Review., The representative of Singapore said his country does not support country-specific human rights resolutions in the Third Committee. They have become highly selective and are driven by political considerations, while being divisive and making no difference to the lives of people on the ground, he added. Country-specific human rights resolutions should be addressed under the Universal Periodic Review process in the Human Rights Council. Noting that his country will maintain its position to abstain from country specific drafts in the Third Committee, if voted on, he stressed this should not be interpreted as taking a position on human rights issues raised in the texts., The representative of India said that human rights should be pursued with respect to the United Nations Charter, adhering to the principles of non-selectivity and non-interference. He stressed the need for constructive dialogue and cooperation instead. India does not promote country-specific human rights mechanisms without the country’s consent, he said, adding that the selective focus runs counter to the mission in the Charter., The representative of China said that her delegation stands for cooperation to settle conflicts and is opposed to provoking confrontation or exerting pressure on countries in the name of human rights, especially without the consent of the concerned country. Noting that targeting developing countries does not safeguard their right to development, she added that the draft ignores achievements in promoting human rights and the serious damage done by unilateral coercive measures imposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. She said her delegation would not join consensus., The representative of Zimbabwe said his country is committed to the United Nations Charter’s principles of non-selectivity, genuine dialogue and cooperation. All country-specific resolutions run contrary to those values, he said, adding that his delegation aligns with those countries that have similar positions. Should there be a genuine desire to address human rights gaps where they exist, there should be dialogue, he said. Zimbabwe will vote against all such resolutions that are open to a vote., The representative of the Russian Federation said that resolution “L.32” amounts to interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Adding that the Republic’s rejection of the draft is done in a “manner befitting a self-respecting State”, he said his delegation disassociates from consensus., The representative of Nicaragua said his country is opposed to the draft. Criticizing the text as non-objective and politicized, he said it does not address the needs of the concerned people. At a time when the country is recovering from consequences of the COVID‑19 pandemic, the international community should show solidarity, he said. He expressed strong opposition to the politicization of human rights., The representative of Iran said that the continuation of country-specific resolutions undermines the principles of non-selectivity and constructive dialogue. The Universal Periodic Review is the right venue for reviewing human rights situations, with meaningful participation of countries. His delegation disassociates itself from the draft and condemns all unilateral coercive measures against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, especially those implemented by the United States., The representative of Belarus said her country believes in the principles of objectivity and impartiality and for that reason distances itself from consensus on this draft resolution., The representative of Japan welcomed the draft resolution, recalling that “many” Japanese students were abducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in the 1970s. He welcomed reference in the draft text to the “abduction issue”. The families of victims have since advanced in age and many of them have passed away, he said, urging the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to resolve the abduction issue and return those who were taken., The representative of Syria said it is unfortunate that reports and resolutions have been established on certain countries without even consultations with those States. It is unacceptable, he said, adding that approving the text leads to confrontation and encourages division between States. It is an attempt to undermine a Member State within the United Nations, he added, disassociating himself from the draft text., The representative of Eritrea said that such country-specific resolutions are selective, slanted and unfair. They do nothing to help human rights on the ground, she said, adding that steps taken to address human rights should also respect national sovereignty., The Committee then approved draft text “L.32” by consensus., By its terms, the Assembly would be deeply concerned at the grave human rights situation, pervasive culture of impunity and lack of accountability for human rights violations and abuses in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It would condemn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for diverting its resources into pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles over the welfare of its people. It would stress with grave concern the urgency of the issue of international abductions and of the immediate return of all abductees., Also by the text, the Assembly would express serious concern about the persistence of continuing reports of violations of human rights, including the detailed findings made by the Commission of Inquiry in its report, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in its ongoing monitoring work and by the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Such violations include torture; sexual and gender-based violence; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons; public executions; extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of due process and the rule of law; and collective punishments., By further terms, the Assembly would express strong concern about the existence of an extensive system of political prison camps; enforced and involuntary disappearances of persons by arrest, detention or abduction against their will; the forcible transfer of populations; the situation of refugees and asylum-seekers expelled or returned to the country; and all-pervasive restrictions, further tightened by the COVID‑19 prevention measures, on the freedoms of thought, religion, expression, peaceful assembly and the right to privacy. It would also express deep concern about the prevalence of chronic and acute malnutrition among persons in the most vulnerable situations, which is exacerbated by a lack of access to basic services, including health care, clean water and sanitation., To this end, the Assembly would strongly urge the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to immediately put an end to systematic and widespread violations of human rights; close the political prison camps and release all political prisoners; and ensure that everyone within the territory enjoys the right to freedom of movement and is free to leave the country. It would decide to continue its examination of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea at its seventy-eighth session, request the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and request the Special Rapporteur to continue to report her findings and recommendations, as well as to report on the follow-up to the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry., The representative of Cuba, in explanation of position, said that her country disassociates itself from the text. This kind of resolution does not contribute to improving human rights on the ground. It only exacerbates division. “They are only targeting developing countries,” she said, recalling that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been a victim of unilateral coercive measures., The representative of Viet Nam said the Universal Periodic Review should be an opportunity to examine all human rights situations on the ground. On the issue of abduction, he called on parties to open a dialogue and find a mutually satisfying solution., The representative of the United Kingdom said the resolution sends a strong message to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s regime to take concrete action to end systematic and widespread human rights violations in the country. The government must uphold its responsibilities to its most vulnerable populations, such as women and girls., The representative of the Republic of Korea urged the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea “not to turn a blind eye” to the Committee’s repeated approval of the text. The human rights situation of vulnerable populations in the country has worsened during the COVID‑19 pandemic. It is therefore unacceptable that the country continues to spend on weapons rather than its people’s development. He also touched on the “absurd” remarks made by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea over recent events in Republic of Korea. The Government of the Republic of Korea is doing everything in its power to ensure that another incident like that does not happen again., The representative of the Philippines said his country disassociates from operative paragraph 12 and all others referring to the International Criminal Court. The Philippines withdrew from the Rome Statute in 2019, as a principled stand against those who politicize human rights. The Rome Statute should be a complementary tool, he said, adding that States have the first responsibility to prosecute crimes and violations. The International Criminal Court cannot substitute fully functioning domestic courts, he stressed., The Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar” (document A/C.3/77/L.33/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contained no programme budget implications., The representative of Saudi Arabia, introducing the resolution on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed that Rohingya refugees have been subjected to systematic violations of their human rights. Since August 2017, more than 2 million Rohingyas have fled into Bangladesh and hundreds of thousands live in internment camps. The situation of Rohingya refugees became even more dire due to the situation in Myanmar, he said, voicing concern about their voluntary return. This draft resolution aims to prevent human rights violations and help Rohingya refugees return to their homes, he added., The representative of Myanmar, appreciating the focus of the draft on the Rohingya people, condemned grave violations perpetrated against them by the armed forces of Myanmar, now at the direction of the illegal military junta. He called for concrete actions to support their safe and dignified return, ensuring their equal access to services and opportunities for representation, consistent with their fundamental rights. In this context, he underscored the importance of the International Court of Justice as well as current investigations of the International Criminal Court. However, he emphasized that the draft could have reflected more on deteriorating human rights situations of all people in Myanmar, following the illegal military coup. The military junta must be held accountable for its atrocities against the people of Myanmar, triggering a humanitarian crisis, and threatening regional peace and security. All people in Myanmar have been suffering from inhumane acts of the junta, he said, pointing to the military’s countless atrocities and human rights violations against innocent civilians. Issues related to the Rohingya cannot be addressed in isolation, he said, urging for a holistic approach. He called for decisive actions by the international community to end the military’s impunity., The representative of the Czech Republic, on behalf of the European Union in its capacity as observer, underlined that the indiscriminate use of violence by the Myanmar armed and security forces across the country and the breaches of international law are intolerable. The international community must act to stop the atrocities, he asserted, condemning the death sentences carried out by the junta in July. Furthermore, he expressed alarm at continued arbitrary detentions and unjustified restrictions to fundamental freedoms in Myanmar. The Rohingya and persons belonging to other minorities in Myanmar continue to face violations of their fundamental rights, he said, adding that the current situation in the country also supresses hopes for the safe and dignified return of 1.5 million Rohingya, who have found refuge in Bangladesh and across the region. He reiterated the urgency of the full implementation of the “Five-Point Consensus” of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)., The representative of the United States voiced concern over atrocities and human rights abuses in Myanmar, including against journalists and human rights defenders. Humanitarian and human rights catastrophes in the country are rapidly undoing the democratic progress achieved by the Myanmar people over the past decade. The worsening crisis has exacerbated situations for the country’s most vulnerable populations, including the Rohingya, he stressed, urging the international community to pressure the military to cease violence, release the unjustly detained, address human rights abuses, and promote justice and accountability., The representative of Canada condemned human rights and humanitarian law violations in Myanmar. Calling for accountability for the gravest crimes under international law, she expressed deep concern over the impact of the coup on minorities, including the Rohingya, and incidents of conflict-related sexual violence, particularly against women and girls. Warning against the sale of arms and military equipment and material to Myanmar, she called on the military regime to engage meaningfully with ASEAN in implementation of the “Five-Point Consensus”., The representative of Indonesia, stressing the importance of restoring peace and stability in Myanmar, noted that the “Five-Point Consensus” should remain a valid reference and be implemented in its entirety. In creating conditions for the safe and voluntary return of the Rohingya, cessation of hostilities and violence is necessary. She called for the delivery of humanitarian assistance without delay and discrimination as well as for women’s meaningful participation., The representative of Iran said indiscriminate attacks against Muslims have resulted in a significant loss of life and exacerbated a history of discrimination. He called for the cessation of violence, the delivery of humanitarian assistance and safe voluntary return of forcibly displaced persons., The representative of the United Kingdom observed that Myanmar is plunging even deeper into political, economic, and humanitarian crises. The resolution highlights the continued deterioration of human rights, he said, adding that all human rights violations must end immediately. Recalling the United Kingdom’s comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar, he called for an immediate end to violence., The representative of New Zealand condemned the coup in Myanmar and the ongoing violence against civilians and called for the release of all political prisoners. He further highlighted his country’s strong position on the death penalty and condemned the execution of prisoners in the country earlier this year. The coup has exacerbated the humanitarian situation of the most vulnerable, he stressed, expressing support for the role of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar as well as the International Court of Justice., The Committee then approved the draft resolution “L.33/Rev.1” without a vote., By its terms, the Assembly would condemn in the strongest terms all violations of human rights against civilians, including Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar, before and following the unjustified declaration of the state of emergency on 1 February 2021. It would be alarmed by the findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar of evidence of serious human rights violations and abuses suffered by Rohingya Muslims and other minorities, perpetrated by the security and armed forces of Myanmar, which amount to the gravest crimes under international law., The Assembly would further reiterate its deep concern at the excessive use of force by Myanmar security and armed forces, the continuing forced displacement of civilians, the recruitment of children, abductions, arbitrary detentions, killings and maiming, attacks on schools, hospitals and places of worship and large civilian gatherings. It would further express deep concern over the use of facilities functioning as hospitals and schools for military purposes, as well as the use of landmines, making conditions in Rakhine State unsuitable for the voluntary and safe return of all refugees and forcibly displaced persons, including the Rohingya., Also by the text, the Assembly would express deep concern that, in Rakhine, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims remain largely segregated and discriminated against in accessing citizenship and other fundamental rights, many of whom remain confined in camps with no freedom of movement. It would be also alarmed at the continued attacks on medical and humanitarian actors and the lack of safe and unhindered humanitarian access. Further, the Assembly would reiterate the urgent call upon Myanmar or the Myanmar Military to end immediately all violations of international law, to ensure the protection of the human rights of all persons in Myanmar, and to provide justice to victims, to ensure full accountability and to end impunity, starting with an independent investigation, and would call for the release of the report of the Independent Commission of Enquiry., The Assembly would also request the Secretary-General to extend the appointment of the Special Envoy on Myanmar and submit the report of the Special Envoy covering all relevant issues addressed in the present resolution to the General Assembly at its seventy‑eighth session. It would also request the Secretary-General to provide all assistance necessary to enable the Special Envoy on Myanmar to effectively discharge her mandate and to report to Member States every six months, or as warranted by the situation on the ground., Speaking after the approval, the representative of Singapore encouraged Myanmar to work with relevant United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to create conditions for safe and voluntary return of refugees from Bangladesh. ASEAN, including Singapore, has provided humanitarian assistance to refugees, he recalled. However, there must be political stability in Myanmar for stability in Rakhine State to occur, he noted, voicing deep concern over the dire situation in the country following the February 2021 coup. He also expressed disappointment at the lack of progress on implementation of the “Five-Point Consensus” and urged the military authorities to work with Myanmar to implement the Consensus., The representative of Thailand said his country joined consensus on the draft, emphasizing the need to keep a focus on the resolution’s original scope and include appropriate consultation with all parties, including ASEAN. He expressed concern over ongoing violence and called on relevant parties to engage in meaningful dialogue and ensure human rights are fully respected., The representative of the Philippines said his country joined consensus, yet dissociated himself from preambular paragraph 29 and operative paragraph 2, and from paragraphs in all resolutions that refer to the International Criminal Court., The representative of Belarus said country-specific resolutions are a way of exerting political pressure on States. These resolutions being adopted every year just “whip up” additional confrontation. Solutions that are mutually acceptable to all parties are needed. She dissociated herself from the draft., The representative of the Russian Federation said pressure is pointless, adding that support is necessary for Myanmar to resolve the situation. A depoliticized approach to reach a solution is necessary. Country resolutions do not resolve human rights problems. He dissociated himself from the text., The representative of Bangladesh thanked Member States, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, for their support. There are now 1.2 million Rohingya living in camps in Bangladesh. The presence of such a large number of people is not sustainable. A multilateral approach to enable their safe return is necessary. He welcomed the resolution’s approval, while stressing that the root causes of the crisis must be addressed and that a greater role of regional countries is necessary to avoid a regional crisis., The representative of Malaysia noted that the situation in Myanmar is deteriorating, expressing disappointment at the lack of real progress in the Five-Point Consensus and calling for its full implementation. He regretted that some Security Council members do not see the urgency of the situation, claiming to have spoken on the part of ASEAN and consulted with them when they have not. The Council should not delegate its responsibilities to ASEAN, he said, adding that the international community must address the root causes of the crisis., The representative of China said that, as a friendly neighbour, her delegation hopes Myanmar will maintain peace and stability. The international community must respect the sovereignty of the country, she said, adding that a proper solution under a legal framework is necessary. Since the political changes in Myanmar began, China has always been objective and impartial and engaged with all parties. She supported an ASEAN approach and implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. Her delegation is following the situation in Rakhine State and looks forward to continued dialogue between Myanmar and Bangladesh concerning the repatriation of people to Myanmar., The representative of Myanmar said his State will act on the recommendations of the draft resolution and urged the international community and stakeholders to render assistance in implementing it. He stressed that all efforts to protect the rights of civilians in Myanmar, including Rohingyas, will be in vain if root causes are not well addressed, emphasizing that “the military, as the main perpetrator of all crimes against humanity, must be held accountable as soon as possible”. He said the General Assembly should complement the resolution just approved with another one, addressing the junta’s actions and directing stronger requests at the international community aimed at advancing the people’s will and dismantling the criminal junta., The Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran” (document A/C.3/77/L.34), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications., Introducing the draft, the representative of Canada said that, despite “deplorable actions by Iranian authorities against protesters, mass peaceful protests continue into their eighth week”. The killing of Mahsa Amini is just one instance of human rights atrocities in Iran, he said, adding that violent implementation of the hijab and chastity laws undermine the human rights of women and girls. Calling for accountability, he expressed deep concern over the authorities’ use of force, expressed support for human rights defenders and expressed deep concern over the spreading application of the death penalty. He pointed to the systemic prosecution of minorities, alarming restrictions on the Internet and mobile data, and the generalized used of arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances. He encouraged delegations to vote in favour of the resolution., The representative of Iran rejected the text. The sponsors of the resolution, who “claim to be champions of human rights in Iran, have a long record of blatant hypocrisy, double standards and instrumentalization of human rights for their agenda” and are not fit to preach, she said. Some of those who pretended to protect human rights “should be reminded of their own crimes so they do not forget their true face, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Israeli regime and Germany”. One thing that all have in common is brutality, callousness, arbitrary killings, genocide and ethnic cleansing, she said. Women and girls in Iran are fully aware of their rights and how to interact with the Government, she emphasized, adding that there is no need for Western countries to advocate for them., A recorded vote was requested., Speaking before the vote, the representative of Australia called on Iran to “cease its oppression of women” and expressed concern over the circumstances surrounding the death of Mahsa Amini. She condemned the disproportionate use of force against protesters and supported calls for investigation and accountability. She called on Iran to establish a moratorium on all executions and to cease its long-standing oppression of the LGBTI community and its discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities. “Sovereignty is not a shield” for human rights violations, she added., The representative of Cuba said her country did not support the draft, which targets countries, especially developing countries, and imposes unilateral coercive measures. She rejected this kind of resolution. She said States must not isolate developing countries while maintaining silence on human rights violations by developed countries. When it comes to examining the human rights situation in Iran, this has been due to political interest, she said, adding that her delegation will vote against the draft., The representative of Venezuela returned to “L.32” briefly, distancing his delegation from the draft, which was approved by consensus previously. Turning to the text on Iran, he reaffirmed the declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement condemning country-specific mechanisms. Venezuela rejects any instrument or resolution against any country without the consent of its government, which are examples of selectivity, he said, adding that resolutions rely on third-party sources used for political purposes that undermine trust., The representative of the United Kingdom said the death of Mahsa Amini is a shocking reminder of the oppression faced by women in Iran, adding his condemnation of the enforcement of the hijab and chastity laws by the so-called morality police. Voicing concern that over 14,000 protestors have been arrested and that one has been condemned to death, he welcomed Germany and Iceland’s call for an emergency session of the Human Rights Council to investigate oppression in the country. Expressing support for the Special Rapporteur’s work on Iran’s oppression of minority groups and media freedom, he said “the Iranian people have suffered enough”, stressing the need to uphold their freedoms to assembly and free speech. Reports that Member States attempted to block access to the room today for non-governmental organizations is of further concern, he said. Adding that his delegation will vote “yes”, he invited the Committee to follow suit., The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea reiterated its position on country-specific resolutions, which have nothing to do with human rights and only interfere with internal affairs, hindering cooperation. His country rejects all politicized accusations by some countries “to overthrow governments by submitting politicized human rights resolutions under pretexts of human rights”, he said. His delegation will vote against the draft on Iran, he added., The representative of the United States highlighted the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran since last year and recalled listening to experts tell of egregious violations during a recent Security Council meeting. Detailing the torture of activists and protestors as well as a recent death sentence, she said that Iran obscures its acts by limiting access to the Internet, intimidation and refusing access to the Special Rapporteur. In approving the draft text, the international community will send a message of support to the Iranian people, she said, welcoming specific language on the death of Mahsa Amini. Detailing action inside the United Nations system, she said the United States and other countries will terminate Iran’s membership on the Commission on the Status of Women. She urged other States to vote “yes” on the resolution., The representative of the Netherlands, aligning with the European Union, voiced concern about the increasing repression of peaceful protestors in Iran. Reiterating the call for investigations into the death of Mahsa Amini and others who have stood up for human rights throughout the years, he said that violence and discrimination against women and girls must end. Voicing concern over the recent death sentence for a protestor and the increase in arbitrary detentions for lawyers, human rights defenders and dual nationals, he called on Iran to release arbitrarily detained prisoners immediately. His delegation will vote “yes”, he said., The representative of Pakistan said that consideration of human rights situations should be based on impartiality and non-politicization. Selective targeting of countries for economic and strategic objectives in the “garb” of promoting human rights continues, and Iran is simply another example of non-compliance with these principles, he added. He highlighted Iran’s efforts to improve the human rights situation for its people, even in the wake of the COVID‑19 pandemic and continued sanctions. Stressing that States have the primary responsibility to promote human rights in their countries through international obligations, he asserted that the best way to do so is through the Universal Periodic Review, rather than imposing country-specific mandates on developing countries. His delegation will vote against the resolution, he said., The representative of Nicaragua said these draft resolutions are selective, expressing concern that Iran, the country concerned, did not approve the practice. Any politicization of human rights must be rejected. Unilateral coercive measures are major contributors to human suffering. For the abovementioned reasons, Nicaragua will vote against the draft., The representative of New Zealand expressed concern over human rights violations in Iran. Bilateral approaches on human rights with Iran are no longer tenable, he said, urging that country to allow access to the United Nations so it can evaluate the situation on the ground. New Zealand is categorically opposed to the death penalty, he said, expressing alarm that an Iranian court recently issued a death penalty sentence to a protestor., The representative of China said the Committee’s work on human rights must be guided by impartiality. China opposes the politicisation of human rights issues. The international community should view the human rights situation in Iran in an objective light, stop interfering in Iran’s internal affairs and lift unilateral coercive measures that infringe on the rights of the Iranian people., The Russian Federation said it is very counterproductive to adopt country‑specific texts, which only discredit the reputation of the United Nations. Iran has been submitting exhaustive information regarding its actions to protect human rights. The Russian Federation will be voting against the text. Canada, as one of the main co‑sponsors of the draft text, has a long history of discrimination regarding its indigenous people. Five out of six prison suicides are committed by First Nations individuals, he said, adding that crimes against women and girls and the mass burials of indigenous children has not been sufficiently investigated., The representative of Syria said that diplomacy and dialogue are the best way to ensure human rights and rule of law. Iran has reiterated multiple times its willingness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms. The co‑sponsors of the draft are putting a dent in the United Nations human rights mechanisms. This draft resolution does not mention coercive measures that have been imposed on Iran. There are many injustices committed in Canada against the indigenous people, he added., The Committee then approved “L.34” with a recorded vote of 80 in favour, 28 against with 68 abstentions., By its terms, the Assembly would express serious concern at the alarmingly high frequency of the imposition of the death penalty and significant increase in carrying out of the death penalty in Iran; disproportionate application of the death penalty to persons belonging to minorities; and continuing disregard for protections under Iranian law or internationally recognized safeguards relating to imposition of the death penalty., By further terms, the Assembly would strongly urge Iran to eliminate all forms of systemic discrimination and other human rights violations against women and girls; ensure women’s and girls’ equal protection and access to justice, including by prohibiting so-called honour killings and child, early and forced marriage; lift restrictions on women’s and girls’ equal access to primary and secondary education; and remove legal and cultural barriers to women’s equal participation in the labour market and in all aspects of economic, cultural and political life., The Assembly would also express serious concern that the enforcement of the hijab and chastity law and its violent implementation by the Iranian morality police fundamentally undermines the human rights of women and girls. It would strongly urge Iran to cease the use of excessive force against peaceful protestors, including women and children, such as in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini’s arbitrary arrest and subsequent death while in custody., Also by the text, the Assembly would call on Iran to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the basis of thought, religion or belief, and launch a comprehensive accountability process, reiterating the importance of independent investigations in response to all allegations of human rights violations, including excessive use of force, arbitrary arrest, detention and torture. It would also call on Iran to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, including by accepting repeated requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit the country to carry out the mandate. Moreover, the Assembly would request the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session on progress made in implementation of the present resolution, and submit an interim report to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-third session., The representative of France, in explanation of vote after the vote and associating himself with the European Union, said the text outlined the unprecedented situation in Iran. Executions and death sentences are on the rise, which is “alarming”, he said, warning that the human rights situation in Iran has gone from bad to worse., The representative of the Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the European Union in its capacity as observer expressed concern that, despite repeated calls for restraint, Iran’s security forces’ efforts to quell protests have resulted in casualties. Iran must allow a full and impartial investigation on what has occurred. The European Union is particularly concerned with Iranian officials expressing willingness to use the death penalty against protestors. Iran must cease all executions. For all the above‑mentioned reasons, the European Union supported the approval of the text., The representative of Singapore said his delegation abstained to vote on the text. Such resolutions are highly selective and driven by political motivations. “We have always taken the position that all Member States of the United Nations have an obligation to protect and promote human rights,” he said. In response to Australia’s representative, who referred to the Committee’s approval of the draft on moratorium of the death penalty last Friday, he recalled that the Committee the same day also adopted the sovereignty amendment with a record number of votes, to reaffirm the sovereign right of all States to determine their own legal systems and legal penalties, in accordance with international obligations., The representative of Belarus said it is unacceptable for the Committee to approve country specific resolutions without the involvement and consent of the nation concerned. Progress can only be achieved through dialogue. Human rights issues exist in all countries to some degree. Belarus voted against the resolution., The representative of Germany, associating himself with the European Union, said his country was deeply disturbed by grave violations of the fundamental human rights of Iranians, scenes of violence and arbitrary detentions. Germany has requested a specific session of the Human Rights Council on the matter to be held in Geneva next week, he said, urging Iran to also put an immediate end to the unjust detention of journalists and human rights defenders, many of them women. The restriction of the internet is a form of repression, he said, emphasizing that Iranian people must be able to enjoy freedom of information and expression., The representative of Mexico said she voted in favour of the draft, due to the text’s substance and her country’s feminist foreign policy, which aims to promote a global and comprehensive agenda for human rights. Violence based on gender is incompatible with human dignity and value and should be eliminated in all its forms. Condemning other situations of human rights violations, she noted her country strives for coherence and impartiality in situations of obvious violations., The representative of Saudi Arabia, emphasizing that her vote in favour was due to the importance of “L.34”, also expressed regret over the drafting of operational paragraphs. No single paragraph should be interpreted as against the provisions of Islamic Sharia law, she stressed, while spotlighting the practices listed in operational paragraphs 15 and 24 as those of Iran alone. Contrary to the text’s suggestion, the hijab, she reiterated, has never been a problem of oppression, as millions of women choose to wear it voluntarily. On operative paragraph 9, she restated the sovereign right of States to apply capital punishment., The representative of Norway voiced her concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran. That country must heed this call from the General Assembly, ensure respect for women’s rights, protect peaceful demonstrators, safeguard the rights to peaceful assembly and freedoms of association and expression and release all those who have been arbitrarily arrested. She then expressed concern over the situation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) persons, ongoing prosecution and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity as well as Iran’s restrictive measures inhibiting communications and information access. Urging Iran to lift all restrictions on the access to and use of the Internet, she called on the Government to fulfil its human rights obligations., The representative for Nigeria said he abstained from the vote out of his country’s belief that issues must be addressed in a holistic manner through constructive dialogue and mutual respect. In condemning all forms of abuses, suppression and oppression which violate human rights, he said Nigeria opposes the selectivity, lack of objectivity and double standards that have characterized human rights regimes. All States have the responsibility and duty to protect the human rights of its citizens and hold violators to account, he stressed, before calling on Iran to assure that those responsible for the excessive use of force against protestors are brought to book., The Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights in the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine” (document A/C.3/77/L.35), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications., The representative of Ukraine, introducing the draft, recalled that Moscow’s aggression against Crimea started in 2014. Over the years, Russian Federation occupying forces have been persistently turning Crimea into a gloomy island of fear and repression, he said. Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is responsible for nine months of unspeakable suffering, loss and devastation on a scale not seen in Europe since the Second World War. Such heinous terror cannot be tolerated, he asserted, noting that the already grave human rights situation on the Peninsula has further deteriorated. Moreover, the worst Russian Federation practices and violations spread on an enormous scale to the newly occupied territories of Ukraine. As reflected in the last Secretary‑General’s report, Crimea has been used as a military base for Moscow’s attacks on other parts of Ukraine, including Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions., The representative of the Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the European Union in its capacity as observer, condemned Moscow’s full‑scale, unprovoked war of aggression and called on human rights institutions to continue to provide credible information on human rights situation in Crimea. He asked delegations to vote in favour of the draft resolution., The representative of Iran, noting that country-specific resolutions exploit the Committee for political ends, said his delegation will vote against the draft., The representative of the United Kingdom, expressing support for the draft, said that Moscow has brought untold suffering to the innocent people of Ukraine. Since 2014, the people of Crimea have been facing systematic human rights violations at the hands of the Russian Federation authorities, including unjustifiable restrictions on the freedom of movement. Since the February 2022 invasion, the human rights situation in Crimea has further deteriorated, he cautioned, condemning the conscription and mobilization of Ukrainian civilians in Crimea into the Russian Federation’s armed forces as well as the forced imposition of Russian legislation, further limiting the freedom of expression., The representative of Georgia, condemning Moscow’s premeditated full-scale aggression against Ukraine, said for years the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has been documenting numerous human rights violations and abuses in the temporarily occupied Crimea. He expressed alarm that a population residing in Crimea continues to suffer from discrimination of basic human rights, including torture, abductions, enforced disappearances, and sexual violence. Calling for full and unhindered access for international human rights monitoring mechanisms to temporarily occupied Crimea and other territories of Ukraine temporarily controlled by the Russian Federation, he supported the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. His delegation will vote yes, he added., The representative of Venezuela said the country does not support the resolution and rejects the politicization of human rights issues and creation of any instrument or resolution against a specific country without its consent. The practice of approving politically motivated draft resolutions violates the principles of transparency, creating confrontation instead of promoting dialogue. Human rights should be examined as part of the Universal Periodic Review, an essential instrument in this area, as are treaty bodies and dialogue., The representative of Azerbaijan said her country strongly condemns extremism in all its forms and opposes the acquisition of territories through use of force. She reaffirmed the sovereignty of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Her delegation’s position has been clear that the conflict in the territory of Ukraine must be resolved based on its sovereignty and within its internationally recognized borders, according to the United Nations Charter and relevant resolutions., The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said his country rejects the politicization of human rights and the draft resolution. This politicized text has nothing to do with human rights and creates mistrust between Member States. The work of the United Nations should be carried out in an objective and transparent manner. He said he will vote against the draft., The representative of the Russian Federation said the draft is not about human rights. It is a link in a series of desperate attempts by Ukraine to change the course of events by any means. This text, over the past few years, is an example of Ukraine’s hate-based policy towards its own population. The Kyiv regime acts with impunity. The current Kyiv regime is engaged in anti-Russian Federation activity, while under external control. An economic war is being waged against the Russian Federation. There is a real threat to the Russian Federation’s sovereignty. A vote in favour is a vote in support of military escalation., The representative of the United States, noting that the Russian Federation is employing the same playbook it used in Crimea in its attempt to illegally annex additional areas of Ukraine, said that today States have “an opportunity to reaffirm that Crimea is Ukraine and that Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and other parts of Ukraine’s territory will never be recognized”. She expressed deep concern over the Russian Federation’s repression of Crimean Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians and others who peacefully oppose its occupation. Further, she cited credible reports documenting abuses by Russian Federation forces and puppet authorities in parts of Ukraine under its temporary control. She urged States to support the draft., A recorded vote was then requested., The Committee then approved draft resolution “L.35” by a recorded vote of 78 in favour to 14 against, with 79 abstentions., By its terms, the Assembly would condemn the ongoing temporary occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, reaffirming the non-recognition of its annexation, as well as its unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter. It would also condemn the imposition and retroactive application of the legal system of the Russian Federation, the imposition of its automatic citizenship on protected persons in Crimea, and the deportation, regressive effects on the enjoyment of human rights and effective restriction of land ownership of those who have rejected that citizenship., Further, the Assembly would be deeply concerned about continued reports that the law enforcement system of the Russian Federation conducts searches and raids of private homes and businesses in Crimea, which disproportionally affect Crimean Tatars. It would condemn reported violations of international humanitarian law and human rights committed against residents of Crimea, in particular extrajudicial killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, politically motivated prosecutions, discrimination and violence. It would be deeply concerned about restrictions faced by Ukrainians, including Indigenous Peoples of Crimea, in particular the Crimean Tatars, in exercising their economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to work, the ability to maintain their identity and culture, and the right to education in the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages., In this context, the Assembly would demand that the Russian Federation bring an immediate end to all violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law against residents of the temporarily occupied Crimea, in particular reported discriminatory measures and practices; arbitrary detentions and arrests; violations within the framework of the filtration procedures; enforced disappearances; torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; sexual and gender-based violence; and compelling apprehended persons to self-incriminate or “cooperate” with law enforcement. It would also demand that the Russian Federation ensure fair trial, revoke all discriminatory legislation and hold accountable those responsible for those violations by ensuring independent investigation., The Assembly would request the Secretary-General to take all steps necessary to ensure the effective coordination of all United Nations bodies regarding implementation of the present resolution, to continue to pursue his discussions relating to the matter, and to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session on progress made in implementation of all provisions of the present resolution., In explanation of vote after the vote, the representative of Qatar said her delegation voted in favour of the draft, based on its principled position on the crisis in Ukraine, which has remained unchanged since the beginning. She reiterated the call for all parties in the conflict to demonstrate restraint and avoid military escalation “immediately and definitively”, given serious consequences on the rights of civilians., The representative of Kazakhstan said this draft leads to further aggravation of the situation in Ukraine, adding that his State does not oppose its substance, but the politicization of human rights. The Universal Periodic Review, treaty bodies and special procedures of the Human Rights Council are the most suitable mechanisms for assessing human rights situations, he said, affirming that the text is beyond the competence of the Third Committee. While his country voted against the resolution, this does not reflect its position on the status of Crimea, other territories and other conflict-related matters., The representative of Singapore, noting that country-specific human rights resolutions in the Third Committee have become selective and driven by politicization, said her delegation abstained from the draft. However, this should not be interpreted as reflecting a position on the substance of issues raised in the text or derogating from its principled position against the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, she added. The sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all countries, big or small, must be respected, she asserted., The representative of Syria said his delegation voted against the draft, which he defined as a political tool and an attempt to attack the Russian Federation. The approach of targeting one country in particular has negative consequences. Adding that this is an exploitation of human rights for political purposes and a violation of the principle of non-selectivity, he said this draft is a waste of resources. The examination of human rights situations must be carried out under the Universal Periodic Review, he added., The representative of China opposed politicization, selectivity, double standards, the practice of provoking confrontation and the establishment of country-specific human rights mechanisms without the consent of the concerned country. Based on China’s consistent position on country-specific human rights resolutions, her delegation voted against the draft., The Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic” (document A/C.3/77/L.36/Rev.1), which the Chair noted contained no programme budget implications., The representative of the United States introduced the annual draft resolution on the human rights situation in Syria, “L.36/Rev.1,” on behalf of the core group. She noted that, 11 years after the Syrian uprising, daily sporadic violence continues, with civilians caught in the crossfire. Some pretend that the conflict is over, but that could not be further from the truth, as chemical weapons use, bombardments, extrajudicial killings, torture, unjust disappearances, and gender‑based violence still take place. She welcomed the Secretary‑General’s report on the missing and its recommendations that measures should be coherent, inclusive, and centred around the victims and their families. The draft calls for the General Assembly to give attention to detainees and missing persons in early 2023, and includes strengthened language on how women and girls are disproportionally affected, also focusing on their meaningful participation in decision‑making and leadership roles. It highlights the humanitarian situation calls for unhindered aid and reauthorization of the cross‑border mechanism for at least 12 months. She urged all delegations to support this draft and stand up against these brutal atrocities., The representative of Iran said the submission of this draft indicates that the United States and certain other countries continue to exploit United Nations human rights mechanisms in line with their narrow political interests. Billions have been spent on funding terrorists to destabilize the legitimate Government of Syria, while the United States looted its reserves. The main sponsor is addicted to oil and uses human rights for its own political gain. The text touches on issues well beyond this Committee’s mandate. This politically motivated draft turns a blind eye to all achievements of the Syrian Government in bringing about stability, peace, refugee support, civilian protection, humanitarian assistance, and internally displaced persons’ safe return. In the text, Syria’s cooperation with the United Nations, its efforts against waves of terrorism, unilateral coercive measures, and resistance against aggressions by the Zionist expansionist regime are also not reflected. To preserve the credibility of this body, Iran will vote against this biased text., The representative of the United Kingdom said the text sets out the international community’s shared concerns and urged Syria to improve its human rights record. He condemned the decade of atrocities, and supported accountability for perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, human rights violations, arbitrary detention, ill‑treatment, torture, and sexual violence. Tens of thousands have disappeared or been displaced, and increased efforts are needed to ensure accountability and information. “The regime must provide answers,” he said. The humanitarian situation also deteriorated significantly since cross‑border aid is no longer possible, while, especially with the looming winter months, access is vital. The Syrians must not be forgotten and cannot solve this issue alone, he said., The representative of Canada voiced her strong support for this text, as a member of the core group, which serves as a reminder to those responsible that the world is watching and condemning human rights and international humanitarian law violations. Humanitarian needs are at the highest level and widespread sexual violence is taking place, she said, deploring the closing of the border crossings and reaffirming her commitment to accountability. The international community stands in solidarity with the women and girls in Syria and calls on women organizations to build a more peaceful future for all, she said. Welcoming the Secretary‑General’s report on missing persons, she also expressed grave concern over all cases of arbitrary detention and torture., The representative of Venezuela said he did not support this text, as he rejects dealing with human rights issues or creating instruments against a specific country without the consent of that State. This text undermines the credibility of the Human Rights Council. Human rights issues should be examined in the Universal Period Review on the basis of dialogue and cooperation with countries concerned. He reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration of the Non‑Aligned States, in which any mandate on human rights situations in specific countries is rejected, because it creates confrontational spaces and does not contribute to dialogue. Adopting politically motivated reports and mechanisms violates the principles of impartiality, transparency, objectivity, non‑politization, non‑confrontation, equality, and mutual respect, as well as political independence, sovereignty, and self‑determination of peoples., The representative of China said that, 10 years into the crisis, the Syrian people are still mired in poverty and the turmoil of war, for which the United States and other Western countries must take responsibility. Highlighting multiple United States’ military interventions resulting in mass casualties and its imposed sanctions, she added that Washington has also plundered oil and food stocks in Syria, to the general population’s detriment. A political solution that ensures sovereignty is the only way forward, she said, stressing that the international community must not ignore harm caused by illegal military intervention and unilateral coercive measures. She said her delegation would vote against the draft resolution., The representative of Cuba said that the United States introduced the text with political motives. Expressing concern over the United States’ many human rights violations, he said his delegation would vote against the draft. He noted that these resolutions only target developing countries, calling them punitive. He added that the resolution undermines the territorial integrity of Syria. If there is true will to help solve the conflict, then the international community must leave country‑specific resolutions like this one behind, he said., The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said that politicization and double standards have no relevance in promoting human rights and opposed attempts to interfere with the internal affairs of a sovereign country. Favouring constructive dialogue, he said his delegation would vote against the resolution., The representative of the Russian Federation said that the draft is far removed from reality and based on lies and conjecture. Adding that the baseless slander insults the Syrian people who suffer from unilateral coercive measures, he questioned the United States’ concern for Syria, pointing out that Washington attacked the country under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, occupies territory in Syria and loots natural and agricultural resources belonging to the Syrian people. He discouraged the Committee from going along with the United States — “the aggressor State” — and vote against “L.36”., The representative of Saudi Arabia noted that, after 11 years of crisis in Syria, the UNHCR continues to note increases in hundreds of thousands of civilian victims and over a thousand missing persons. Lamenting serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, he said his delegation would vote in favour of the resolution because Saudi Arabia is convinced that only a political solution under relevant resolutions and the Geneva Process will end such suffering., The representative of Syria said the draft was presented by the United States, which is “not surprising or even ironic”. The United States administration has occupied Syrian territory and bombarded civilian infrastructure, preventing the Syrian people from having access to their most basic needs. Moreover, the process of presenting the draft was less than transparent. “We were not able to have access to this draft resolution until several days after it was proposed, which is not professional,” he added. This is a deeply politicized draft and is very far from reality. It seeks to undermine Syria’s recent achievements toward peace. The United States and its Western allies are promoting a misguided approach. They are closing their eyes to the terroristic nature of thousands of fighters that have infiltrated Syria’s land. He categorically rejected the draft resolution, called for a recorded vote, and urged Member States to vote against the display of selectivity., The Committee then approved “L.36” by a recorded vote of 90 in favour to 14 against, with 68 abstentions., By its terms, the Assembly would strongly condemn the grave human rights situation in the country; the indiscriminate killing of civilians and continued indiscriminate use of heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, which have caused more than 500,000 fatalities, including the killing of more than 29,000 children; the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare; and the use of chemical weapons. It would note with grave concern that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has identified 306,887 civilians who were killed in the conflict in Syria between March 2011 and March 2022, including 26,727 women and 27,126 children., Further, the Assembly would express grave concern at the remaining presence of violent extremism and terrorist groups, and strongly condemn all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in Syria by any party to the conflict, in particular Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, armed groups and non-State actors, and the Syrian regime and its allies. The Assembly would be alarmed that more than 5.6 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million women and children, have been forced to flee the country, and that 11.1 million people, of whom 6.6 million are internally displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries and other countries in the region and beyond., Also by the text, the Assembly would demand that the Syrian regime and Da’esh immediately desist from any further use of chemical weapons. It would request that the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons consider additional procedures for stringent verification, pursuant to article IV, paragraph 8, and article V, paragraph 10, of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to ensure the complete destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons programme and prevent its further use. It would demand that the Syrian regime and all other parties to the conflict allow unrestricted humanitarian access, and call for the continuation of cross-border humanitarian support beyond January 2023 and for at least 12 months. The Assembly would also demand that the Syrian regime cooperate fully with the Commission of Inquiry, including by granting it immediate and unhindered access throughout the country., The representative of the Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the European Union in its capacity as observer, reiterated calls on the Syrian regime and all parties to the conflict to engage in talks in good faith. His bloc condemns serious breaches of international law by the Syrian regime and other parties. The European Union demands that all parties to the conflict, in particular the Syria regime, allow for the safe and secure transit of the Syrian people. Accountability remains of utmost importance, he stressed, reiterating calls to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court., The representative of Japan said his delegation voted in favour of the text with the hope that violence in Syria will end soon and human rights will be ensured. On the issue of missing people in Syria, he expressed hope that the text will help make progress on that matter., The representative of Argentina called on all parties to respect human rights. Solution to the Syrian conflict should be based on the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence. Lasting peace is not possible in Syria without justice, he added, calling on all parties to prioritize the full application of international law., The representative of Belarus said country resolutions do not solve problems, but rather promote divisiveness. Country specific drafts are unacceptable, she continued, adding that her delegation voted against the text., The representative of Singapore said her delegation abstained from the vote. Country specific drafts are highly selective and driven by political considerations., The representative of Brazil said that his delegation voted in favour of the draft, expressing concern that more than half of the Syrian population is in need of assistance. The cholera outbreak is yet another outcome of the precarious situation on the ground. He appreciated that the text included new paragraphs on the issue of missing persons. He regretted, however, that the text remains long and its negotiating process somewhat opaque. It should be made clear that multiple actors bear responsibility for human rights violations in Syria. Only a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led, United Nations-facilitated process can offer a lasting solution to the conflict., The representative of Türkiye said the resolution sends a strong message to the Syrian people that the international community is not indifferent to their pursuit of accountability. A sustainable solution can only be achieved through political means. With delays in the political process prolonging the Syrian people’s suffering, she urged the regime to advance on the political track and work with the Syrian Constitutional Committee, which should convene as soon as possible. The impact of Kurdistan Workers’ Party terrorist acts on security has never been more alarming than today. This terrorist organization prevents people, including Syrians and Syrian Kurds, from returning to their homes. The attack last week in Istanbul is another example of the threat to Türkiye posed by this terrorist group., Right of Reply, Exercising the right of reply, the representative of Iran said this body should be ashamed to use a discourse on human rights as a political weapon. Contrary to claims made by the United States, Iran continues to suffer from its sanctions. The United States, one of the only countries not party to conventions on the rights of children or persons with disabilities, is not qualified to educate others on human rights. Canada, which has exercised ethnic cleansing, should reconsider its policy of launching a smear campaign against Iran. The Universal Periodic Review is the proper instrument to address human rights issues. Women in Iran have the right to education and many other opportunities to advance themselves. The Third Committee’s work should be carried out in an objective, transparent and non-confrontational manner. She rejected falsehoods made by some delegations, particularly the United Kingdom and United States, regarding recent developments in Iran. Further, she expressed astonishment at comments made by the Saudi Arabian delegate, as well as the representative’s inaccurate reading and extensive interpretation of Islamic Sharia., Also exercising the right of reply, the representative of Canada noted that, when considering the resolution of the human rights situation in Iran, several delegations called out Canada’s long-standing treatment of indigenous people, including women and girls, and the residential school system. This characterization is accurate, he said, adding that the Canadian Government has recognized its wrongdoings. He noted that indigenous women and girls are affected disproportionately by all forms of violence and that the trauma is intergenerational. Canada is working to transform its relationship with indigenous peoples, he said, noting that work is ongoing and the Canadian Government is committed to partnerships to educate communities across the country about historical and present challenges. The Government welcomes scrutiny, he underscored, adding that it does not seek to avoid issues, suggest that others are making political attacks, deflect attention by red herrings or make counterattacks when its delegation works within the United Nations system., The Committee next took up the draft resolution titled “Assistance to refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa” (document A/C.3/77/L.55), which the Chair noted contains no programme budget implications., Introducing the draft, the representative of Libya, speaking on behalf of the African Group, said the draft contains technical updates. Moreover, he noted the African continent hosts more than one third of the world’s forcibly displaced persons, including more than 6 million refugees and asylum-seekers and almost 15 million internally displaced persons. Around 30 million internally displaced persons, refugees and asylum-seekers live in Africa, he said. The text reaffirms the importance of the Global Compact on Refugees and recognizes the centrality of the principle of burden- and responsibility-sharing, he underlined., The Committee then approved “L.55” without a vote, by which the Assembly would be gravely concerned about the rising number of refugees and displaced persons on the African continent. It would also be gravely concerned about funding gaps in the budgets of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme, leading to deteriorating living conditions in many refugee camps. Further, it would express concern regarding the decreasing trend in resettlement opportunities for displaced persons. It would call on the international community to take concrete action to meet the needs of refugees and contribute generously to projects and programmes to create durable solutions., Also by the text, the Assembly would condemn all acts that pose a threat to the security of refugees and asylum-seekers, such as refoulement or physical attacks. It would also call on UNHCR, the African Union and all African States to strengthen partnerships to support the protection system for refugees. Further, it would urge the international community to continue to fund generously the refugee programmes of UNHCR and others to ensure that Africa receives an equitable share of resources designated for refugees., The representative of Hungary expressed deep concern over the rising number of refugees and displaced persons in Africa. Noting that his delegation joined consensus, he pointed to operative paragraph 4, containing a reference to the Global Compact on Refugees, which his State does not endorse. He therefore disassociated from the paragraph., For information media.

REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON UKRAINE, New York, 16 NOVEMBER 2022, Mr President,, In the past few days, Ukrainians have been subjected to some of the most intense bombardments of the nine-month-old war. Russian missiles and drones have rained down on Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv, Lviv, Poltava and elsewhere, destroying or damaging homes and severely disrupting critical services., The impact of such attacks can only worsen during the coming winter months., As of 14 November, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 16,631 civilian casualties: 6,557 persons killed and 10,074 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine., The recent barrages will alas add to horrific toll the war has already taken., I must say it again: attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law., The military dynamics on the ground continue to evolve. In the past week, the city of Kherson returned to Ukrainian Government control. Heavy battles also continue in Donetsk and Luhansk regions., Indeed, there is no end in sight to the war. As long as it continues, the risks of potentially catastrophic spillover remain all too real., Yesterday’s incident in Poland near the Ukrainian border was a frightening reminder of the absolute need to prevent any further escalation., I wish to join the Secretary-General in extending condolences to the families of the two Polish civilians killed in the incident., Mr. President,, The ongoing bombardment of Ukraine has already damaged an estimated 40 per cent of the country’s power-generation capacity. Kyiv has been hit hardest. Most parts of the capital are now without electricity for 12 hours a day., As the Ukrainian Government focuses on repairing damaged infrastructure, the United Nations has made it a priority to ensure that the most vulnerable receive winter supplies and services. More than 185,000 people have already received essential basic winter supplies., Humanitarian partners are setting up “heating points” near the front lines. Some 525 generators were provided or are being distributed, to priority institutions, including hospitals, collective centers, clinics., Humanitarian access has resumed in the areas back under Ukrainian Government control, including in Kherson. However, it is still extremely difficult to reach people in need in areas of the east and south under the control of the Russian military and across the front line., Mine contamination - particularly in areas close to the front or where control has recently shifted – are putting more lives at risk, impeding the movement of civilians and hampering humanitarian efforts., I remind the parties that international humanitarian law requires them to facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for all civilians in need., Mr. President,, The allegations of atrocities and human rights violations in Ukraine during this war are extensive., Today I would like to highlight grave concerns about the rights, safety and security of the youngest Ukrainians. Over 400 children have been killed, and many more have been injured, lost their family members, or been forced to leave their homes., According to the Government portal “Children of War,” 279 children were considered missing as of 12 November., There are also disturbing reports of forced transfers of children, including of some under institutionalized care to Russian-occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation., OHCHR has documented several individual cases, including of unaccompanied children, that appear to amount to deportations to the Russian Federation – in violation of international humanitarian law., OHCHR also continues to document other types of human rights violations, including 57 verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence. Forty-eight of these cases are attributable to Russian armed forces and affiliated groups; nine are attributable to Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement authorities., The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine continues its work towards accountability for alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law with ongoing investigations in and out of Ukraine., The Commissioners are planning another visit to Ukraine before the end of the year., Another issue of concern is the conditions of prisoners of war. I welcome the continued prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, including most recently on 11 November. We encourage the sides to continue releasing POWs., I call on the parties to ensure humane treatment of prisoners of war, in line with their obligations under international law, in particular, the Third Geneva Convention. I also call on the Russian Federation to grant OHCHR and ICRC unimpeded access to detainees., Mr. President,, The extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative remains vital to help avert a food crisis for millions of people. More than 10 million metric tons of foodstuffs have now been moved under the Initiative, reaching, or on the way to, some 40 countries., The impact of the Initiative extends far beyond immediate ports of arrival, helping to lower global prices for key food commodities around the world., The Secretary-General has continued his engagement with all parties in support of the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative., He has also emphasized his commitment to removing remaining obstacles to Russian food and fertilizer exports. These products are not under international sanctions but suffer indirect impacts., It is important and critical to get them back to world markets – the sooner, the better., Mr. President,, The risk of a nuclear incident in the context of the open hostilities in Ukraine remains an unacceptable danger. I wish to echo the serious concerns expressed by numerous Member States in this regard., The IAEA Director-General has recently briefed this Council on the organization’s latest efforts, including ongoing discussions regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as well as assessments of activities and materials at other sites in Ukraine., The IAEA has reported that, in the coming weeks, it will send nuclear safety and security missions to three more operating nuclear power plants, as well as to Chernobyl, at the request of the Ukrainian Government., I reiterate the imperative to avoid any military activity that could risk compromising the safety and security of any nuclear facility., Mr. President,, Since before the invasion of 24 February, the United Nations and many others in the global community warned of the consequences of a wider war in Ukraine, for Ukrainians, first of all, but also for much of the world., Those fears have amply borne out., One significant casualty of the war has been the international collective security system we have all pledged to uphold., The damage to the structures built to resolve or manage tensions and conflict is significant, making it, in turn, even more difficult to chart a path out of the hostilities in Ukraine., There is only one way to stop the death, destruction and division. The war must end. And it must end in line with international law and the UN Charter, as called for by the UN General Assembly.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/risks-potentially-catastrophic-spillover-russia-ukraine-war-remain-all-too-real-under-secretary-general-dicarlo-tells-security-council
Update 127 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (16 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,16 Nov 2022,"Ukraine's Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP) lost all access to the electricity grid yesterday due to military attacks in the country, forcing it to temporarily rely on diesel generators for back-up power, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, citing information he had received from Ukrainian authorities., The KhNPP’s grid connection was completely lost at 18:35 local time on 15 November, after the site’s four operating power lines were progressively lost over a two-and-a-half-hour period because of missile attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure, Ukraine told the IAEA. During this period, the plant’s two reactors were shut down, halting their delivery of electricity to households, factories and others., More than nine hours later – at 03:45 this morning – the plant regained off-site electricity through two 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power lines, and the diesel generators were stopped. One of those lines was again lost about an hour later and only restored at 11:25. The two reactor units remain in shutdown mode., Another nuclear power plant also located in western Ukraine – Rivne – lost the connection to one of its 750 kV power lines yesterday afternoon. As a result, the plant reduced its power output, and one of its four units was automatically disconnected. At 04:00 today, the plant increased the power of one of its other units to continue supplying electricity to the Ukrainian network, While Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant – Zaporizhzhya – has lost off-site power several times during the current military conflict in the country, yesterday’s events underlined the fragile nuclear safety and security situation also at its other nuclear facilities. Ukraine has 15 reactors at four nuclear power plants, as well as the Chornobyl site., “This was a very concerning development. It shows the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. While off-site power is now back at the Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plant, yesterday’s power loss clearly demonstrates that the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine can suddenly take a turn for the worse, increasing the risk of a nuclear emergency,” Director General Grossi said., Reactors need power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions also when they are in shutdown and do not produce electricity anymore. In the case of an external power loss, they have emergency diesel generators that can provide back-up electricity for a limited period of time, usually at least for several days., The power loss at the KhNPP came just a day after the IAEA announced it would in the coming weeks send nuclear safety and security missions to this plant, Rivne and the South Ukraine nuclear power plant as well as to Chornobyl. The missions are being organized at the request of Ukraine., “We will be at these nuclear power plants in the near future as part of our steadfast assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict,” Director General Grossi said., The IAEA already has a team of experts continuously present at the ZNPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-127-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-16-nov-2022
"Surge of violence in Ukraine a stark reminder of human cost of upcoming winter, warns IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,Shelter and Non-Food Items,16 Nov 2022,"Kyiv, Ukraine, November 16, 2022 — The new wave of airstrikes hitting Ukraine’s key infrastructure continues to raise serious protection concerns for civilians,who are paying the highest cost for the ongoing war. Yesterday, more than seven million Ukrainians were left with no access to electricity. This is all the more concerning for the 17.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country as temperatures plummet., IRC teams report that the most recent wave of violence which has swept across the country, coupled with the prediction of a severe winter, threaten to displace even more people, intensifying the crisis and exacerbating already dire humanitarian needs. Shelling has decimated key infrastructure, with Ukraine's power grids and supplies sustaining significant damage, resulting in blackouts becoming a daily reality for Ukrainians. Against this backdrop, the IRC reiterates that civilians and civilian infrastructure are not targets and humanitarian organizations struggle to meet critical needs and save lives under a barrage of missile attacks., Marysia Zapasnik, Country Director at the International Rescue Committee, said,, “The recent intensification of conflict has caused significant damage to public infrastructure in many parts of Ukraine, leaving civilians across the country without access to gas, electricity or centralized heating systems. With winter arriving, many Ukrainians are living in damaged homes without insulation or access to power or heating, or in buildings which cannot sufficiently protect them from harsh winter weather and temperatures., “In response to the upcoming winter needs in the country, together with our local partners, the IRC has started distributing essential winter items, including blankets and heaters.”, The IRC launched an emergency response to the crisis in Ukraine in February 2022, working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. In Ukraine, we are focusing our response in the conflict-affected areas in the east and southeast. We are distributing essential non-food items, providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households, improving access to health care, and providing a variety of tailor-made protection services, including safe spaces for women and children. The IRC is supporting people fleeing Ukraine in Poland, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Bulgaria. We are also running programmes targeting Ukrainian refugees in Germany, Italy, Greece and the UK., For questions or to arrange interviews, please contact Joanna Nahorska at joanna.nahorska@rescue.org or James Sussman at james.sussman@rescue.org., MEDIA CONTACTS, IRC Global Communications

While search and rescue teams are still operating, authorities have confirmed that over 30 civilians have been killed or injured in the three localities., Humanitarians in Ukraine are working to support people facing the challenges imposed by the energy crisis. Over the past weeks, more than 430,000 people have received some sort of direct winter assistance, and nearly 400 generators have been distributed to ensure energy in hospitals, schools, and other critical facilities., SITUATION OVERVIEW, A new wave of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this afternoon has left millions of people in all regions of the country without electricity, adding to the already grave energy crisis faced by millions of Ukrainians. The emergency power outages – which come on top to the ongoing scheduled cuts – also affect access to water and heating, at a time when temperatures are below zero in many parts of the country. Today’s strikes happened just a few hours after the European Parliament passed a resolution declaring the Russian Federation a “state sponsor of terrorism”, stating that deliberate attacks and atrocities committed against Ukraine violate human rights law and international humanitarian law., Following the attacks, some Ukrainian regions like Lviv in the west, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south and **Chernihiv **in the north have been completely disconnected from electricity. Blackouts are also affecting large parts of the central regions of Vinnytsya and Dnipro, westernKhmelnitsk, northern-eastern Kharkiv and Sumy, southern Mykolaiv and the capital Kyiv. According to the Ministry of Energy, temporary power outages have affected all Ukrainian nuclear power plants., In **Kyiv, **the entire population – estimated at around 3 million people – was left without water today, and authorities stated they are working around the clock to restore the supply. The attacks caused delays in trains and metro, and hours of traffic jams were reported across the city as people tried to rush to their homes when the air raid alarms were lifted, around 3 p.m., more than two hours after being activated. People in some parts of the city are also facing challenges with the heating system, with temporary cuts of internet and mobile data also reported in the past hours. In addition to energy infrastructure, residential buildings were also hit in Kyiv and in Chabany and Vyshhorod towns, in the outskirts of the capital. While search and rescue teams are still on operating, authorities have confirmed that over 30 civilians have been killed or injured in the three localities., In Kharkiv, people had to be evacuated from metro stations, as the power cuts forced all electric transport to stop. In Odesa, the heating system stopped working, and the lack of electricity also led the stoppage of the region’s water pumps. In Dnipro, water supply has been affected, and in Dniproand Lviv, internet stopped working for several hours., The strikes targeting energy infrastructure were not the only attacks affecting civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine over the past 24 hours. In the Zaporizhzhia region, there have been reports of a new-born killed due to an airstrike that hit a maternity ward of a hospitalin Vilniansk, close to the front line. Children were also killed and injured due to hostilities in the Kherson and Berislav districts, of the Kherson region. Attacks also impacted people trying to receive assistance, as a Government facility in Zaporizhzhia used by volunteers to distribute supplies to people affected by the war was hit, killing and injuring some civilians who were there when the attack happened., HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, Humanitarians in Ukraine continue to work to support people affected by the war, including with winter supplies to help those facing the challenges imposed by the energy crisis. Over the past weeks, more than 430,000 people have received some sort of direct winter assistance, including thermal blankets, clothes, heating appliances, and repairs to their homes or centres hosting those displaced. In addition, the United Nations has been supporting the authorities with generators to ensure energy supply to critical facilities such as hospitals, schools, and heating points, where people can keep warm if their homes are disconnected from heating systems or electricity. Nearly 400 generators have already been delivered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNICEF, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS), and the World Health Organization (WHO), with thousands more in the pipeline. The Government has informed the population that over 4,000 heating points have been established across all Ukraine’s regions, and the United Nations and humanitarian partners are providing supplies to these facilities., For more information, please contact OCHA Ukraine:, Saviano Abreu*, *deabreuisidoro@un.org, HIGHLIGHTS, Continuing attacks on energy infrastructure are leading to a major energy crisis in the country, with repeated cuts and power outages, including in the capital Kyiv., Over 165,000 people in villages retaken by Ukraine, including the city of Kherson, face dire humanitarian situation due to extensive damages and destruction of infrastructure., The priority of the humanitarians remains timely and critical assistance to recently retaken areas of Ukraine and addressing challenges related to winter and power cuts., During last four weeks, humanitarians sent at least seven convoys to support the people in retaken areas of Kharkivska and Khersonska oblast, including the city of Kherson., ANALYSIS, The humanitarian situation, including in recently retaken areas of Kharkivska and Khersonska oblasts. Almost nine months into the full-scale war, hostilities and attacks persist across Ukraine, particularly in the east and south of the country, damaging critical civilian infrastructure – especially energy – and increasing the urgent needs of millions of people. Over the past weeks, waves of attacks on energy infrastructure have forced the country to adopt emergency power outages in all Ukrainian regions. Millions are facing constant power cuts, and the lack of energy is also affecting water pumping, adding to the previous challenges faced by millions of people to access clean water or run their heating systems at home. On 15 November, for example, a new wave of missile attacks – the largest on energy infrastructure since the start of the war, according to the Ministry of Energy – left millions of people in Ukraine without electricity, water or heating. This came at a critical time when the temperature is dropping below zero, raising concerns about a serious humanitarian crisis during the harsh Ukrainian winter if people are unable to heat their homes., The attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure came just a few days after the Government recovered control of the city of Kherson and dozens of other towns and villages in this southern region of the country, which had been taken by Russian forces in the first weeks of the war in early March. The security situation in this part of the country remains highly volatile, with fighting and attacks reported across the new frontline and some of the areas which remain outside the control of the Ukrainian Government. Civilian infrastructure is being devastated, adding to an already complex situation on the ground., In Kherson city, for example, people have not had water and electricity for over two weeks, while markets are running low on food, most shops are empty, pharmacies and health facilities have no medicines, and people can only rely on locally produced fruits and vegetables, according to humanitarians who visited the city over the last days. Khersonska oblast Military Administration urged residents of the city and other recently retaken areas to evacuate to safer regions of Ukraine, informing that the levels of destruction and limited access to essential services will make it nearly impossible for the Government to ensure people in these areas can meet their basic needs., In other parts of the oblast recently retaken by Ukrainian forces, including Novovorontsovka, Novooleksandrivka, Velyka Oleksandrivka and Vysokopillia, humanitarians have reported a dire situation, as people face similar challenges as in Kherson city. Local authorities report that a large part of the infrastructure of the retaken areas has been damaged, including up to 70 per cent in Novovoskresenske village, where new attacks were recorded on 8 November. Local authorities also report very limited functional social services, with pressing needs in various humanitarian sectors.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-16-nov-2022-enruuk

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (5-11 November 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,11 Nov 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Ukrainian forces retook control of the city of Kherson amid the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Fighting intensified along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, coinciding with the anniversary of the end of the 2020 war on 9 November. Meanwhile, climate grievances and the opening of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), rising living costs, and the death of Mahsa Amini sparked demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Following the successes of Ukrainian forces during their southern counteroffensive operation, Russian authorities announced the withdrawal of Russian forces from the west bank of the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine on 9 November (BBC, 10 November 2022). During the retreat, Russian forces blew up all bridges across the Dnipro river in the Kherson region to slow down the Ukrainian offensive (Ukrinform, 9 November 2022; New York Times, 11 November 2022). By 11 November, the Ukrainian army reclaimed the territories on the west bank side of the Dnipro, establishing control over the whole Mykolaiv region, except for the Kinburn Spit, and around 40% of the Kherson region, including its administrative center in the city of Kherson (CNN, 11 November 2022)., Meanwhile, in the Donetsk region, Russian troops continued offensive military operations in the direction of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, as well as in the southwestern part of the Donetsk region (ISW, 7 November 2022; ISW, 8 November 2022)., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure across Ukraine with shelling and airstrikes last week, reportedly killing over a dozen civilians in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhia regions., In Russia, Kursk and Belgorod regional authorities reported the shelling of villages close to the Russian-Ukrainian border, blaming Ukrainian forces. This violence contributed to the 123% increase in average weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks. Meanwhile, government-linked private military company Wagner Group announced the recruitment of volunteers to join territorial militia units in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, where they will reportedly receive basic military training (Activatica, 6 November 2022). The recruitment follows President Vladimir Putin’s martial law decree in mid-October, which imposed a ‘medium-level’ of preparedness in the border regions., Following the decrease in ceasefire violations in the weeks prior, fighting intensified along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact last week. The escalation coincided with the anniversary of the end of the 2020 war on 9 November. Clashes were recorded throughout the week and resulted in the wounding of one Armenian serviceman. These trends drove the 164% increase in average weekly violent events in the Gegharkunik region of Armenia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker; the tool also warned of increased violence in Gegharkunik during the preceding four weeks. Additionally, Azerbaijani forces reportedly opened fire at civilian farmers in the Askeran region in Artsakh,1 though no casualties were reported., Climate and environmental protests continued to take place across Europe last week, coinciding with the UN COP27 in Egypt, which began on 6 November. Police intervened in demonstrations in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, arresting activists who blockaded roads and staged hand-gluing stunts and sit-ins. Further demonstration activity related to COP27 and climate and environmental isues was recorded in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation_,_ and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests held in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In France, more than 85 demonstration events were recorded as part of a national strike day on 10 November – the third such day in less than a month – called by one of the country’s main trade unions to demand salary and pension increases (TF1 Info, 11 November 2022). National strikes over similar grievances were also observed in Belgium and Greece, with large marches held in Athens and Thessaloniki. In both cities, demonstrators briefly clashed with police., Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity gatherings across Europe last week for an eighth consecutive week. Rallies in support of ongoing protests and women’s rights in Iran were recorded in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the latest four weeks of data released by ACLED.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 Nov 2022,"Israeli humanitarian group is among the first to reach the Ukrainian city with urgent humanitarian aid after Russian troops withdrew on Friday., Wednesday, November 16, 2022. For immediate release:, Israel’s leading non-governmental humanitarian aid organization, IsraAID, is sending a shipment of urgently needed medical supplies to three hospitals in Kherson on Thursday, entering the city for the first time since Russian troops withdrew on Friday. Russian forces overtook the capital of Kherson Oblast in March. Throughout the city’s occupation, humanitarian groups could not access Kherson. IsraAID is among the first organizations to provide much-needed aid supplies, as large swaths of the city remain without power and water., The shipment includes vital medications worth over $2 million, donated by Heart to Heart International, and will be distributed to three branches of Kherson City Clinical Hospital. The donation was received, processed, and shipped through IsraAID’s Tulcea Humanitarian Logistics Hub, located just across the border in Romania. From the first weeks of the fighting, the hub has been a crucial player in delivering aid to Ukrainian cities, securing one of the only humanitarian corridors into the country’s southeast. With the support of a vast network of local NGOs, municipalities, and governmental partners, the hub has procured and shipped over 1,900 tons of essential relief items. These include 5.6 million food rations, bedding, clothing, medications, medical supplies, generators, and hygiene items., With renewed access to Kherson, IsraAID is looking to expand its work of restoring access to safe drinking water in southern Ukraine. Since June, IsraAID has been working to address the water crisis in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv. The city’s main water source, which originates in the Kherson region, was cut off after the infrastructure suffered widespread damage in the fighting. The presence of Russian troops in Kherson had prevented water engineers from reaching the source of the damage., In September, IsraAID launched a mental health program alongside the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and with the support of the Office of the First Lady of Ukraine. In partnership with the Ukrainian NGO Barrier Free, IsraAID is training psychologists who will work in Ukrainian hospitals, providing mental health support and psychological first aid to doctors and patients amid the ongoing fighting., IsraAID began working within the borders of Ukraine in July, expanding on its emergency response missions in Moldova and Romania. IsraAID has since established offices in Kyiv and Odesa. In addition to its work in mental health and psychological support, IsraAID partnered with the Ukrainian-Israeli NGO Frida to provide medicine and medical supplies to mobile clinics that are operating in Kyiv and the surrounding areas., IsraAID launched its response to the ongoing Ukraine crisis on February 26th, two days after the Russian invasion, dispatching an Emergency Response team to Moldova to provide urgent support to the thousands of Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country. IsraAID’s team was one of the first international groups to reach the border crossing at Palanca, in southern Moldova, around 50km from Odesa. In Moldova, IsraAID has been working on protection, education, and medical support for refugees at the border and in formal and informal shelters around the country., IsraAID’s Head of Emergency Operations, Michal Bar, said:, “IsraAID is proud to send our first shipment of humanitarian aid to Kherson. After so long without access to the city, we were able to send these much-needed medications thanks to the strong partnerships we’ve built with local organizations, municipalities, and government officials. It’s amazing to see so many people come together and undertake these huge logistical efforts to support the Ukrainian people’s awe-inspiring resilience. We feel honored to be a part of it.”, -ENDS-, Further information is available on request, including interviews with IsraAID CEO Yotam Polizer and other individuals involved in this operation., CONTACT:, Shachar May Email: smay@israaid.org Phone/Whatsapp: +972586664969",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/israaid-sends-medical-supplies-newly-liberated-kherson

Given decentralization reform in Ukraine, local authorities have taken the lead in meeting the needs of their communities,"" said Cilliers. ""With millions uprooted from their homes and migrating across the country, they now need to learn how to adapt, integrate, unite and explore new and more inclusive trajectories of economic growth.”, The online course will help municipalities in their complex and ever-changing realities amidst the crisis, focusing on the integration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) under martial law. The course is free and readily available on the Prometheus educational platform. Internet access is the only thing required to enroll in the course, which can be done at any time – studying is not connected to calendar deadlines, so users can work on the course at their own pace.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 Nov 2022,"The Government is moving ahead on a winter package to Ukraine. The package is the largest to date and includes military and humanitarian support and support for rehabilitation of critical infrastructure., The military support package is larger than all the eight previous military materiel support packages combined, and the humanitarian package is the largest sent to date., “We are now sending a record support package to Ukraine, with both humanitarian and military support. The defence of Ukraine’s freedom is the most crucial foreign policy task of our time,” says Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson., The new military support package is expected to contain an advanced weapons system for air defence including advanced ammunition, and also advanced ammunition for additional air defence systems, light all-terrain vehicles, personal equipment including winter equipment and body protection, gun laying equipment, tents and camouflage netting., The contents of the planned military support package amount to a total of about SEK 3 billion. This is SEK 1 billion more than the sum of all previous military materiel support packages combined (about SEK 2 billion)., The new humanitarian and emergency aid support covers Ukraine and Moldova, and amounts to about SEK 720 million. The support is intended to help Ukraine and Moldova get through a winter which by all accounts will be difficult for the countries. It is intended to provide the most vulnerable with access to food, water and sanitation, winter equipment, blankets and heating sources. The support will also help start laying the foundations for the enormous reconstruction of social infrastructure that waits in Ukraine., The emergency aid package will be paid through well-established partners to Sweden such as the World Food Programme, the World Bank and the Red Cross Movement. This will be done by means of central grants specifically earmarked for initiatives in Ukraine., The emergency aid will be allocated as follows:, World Food Programme – SEK 250 million World Bank funds for Ukraine and Moldova respectively – SEK 140 million + SEK 40 million Nordic Environment Finance Corporation’s Ukraine Green Recovery Programme – SEK 110 million Ukrainian and Moldovan Red Cross – SEK 50 million + SEK 20 million Mine clearance through the Danish Refugee Council – SEK 10 million Energy fund at the donor conference for Moldova – SEK 100 million Sweden will also continue to support Ukraine within the framework of our membership of the EU.

Sweden is also pushing to ensure that the eight packages of sanctions adopted to date are implemented and respected, and that the EU is able to agree on a ninth sanctions package., Of great future importance is to ensure the functioning of the solidarity corridors for export of Ukrainian agricultural products. So far, 15 million tonnes of cereals and other agricultural products have been exported.

Buffett Foundation, headed by the long-time supporter and former Goodwill Ambassador of WFP, Howard G. Buffett, will enable food assistance to be distributed to 100,000 people targeted by WFP for immediate support in the area. It adds to previous donations already received from the Foundation to support WFP’s humanitarian operations in Ukraine, including contributing to the first humanitarian shipments of Ukrainian wheat as part of the Black Sea Grain Initiative., Last month WFP delivered food assistance for more than 200,000 people in newly accessible areas in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Luhansk regions. Humanitarian agencies typically access these areas within a week, just after they are secured and demined., WFP’s food assistance in Ukraine consists of 30-day food rations, typically including wheat flour or rice, pasta, canned meat or beans, and sunflower oil, or ready-to-eat rations and locally baked bread. 80% of this assistance is delivered in frontline or newly accessible areas that are directly affected by fighting. WFP has also distributed more than US$320 million in cash assistance to 2 million of the most vulnerable Ukrainians across the country, and supported the resumption of grain exports through Black Sea ports – directly benefiting Ukrainian farmers and the agricultural sector., WFP’s food assistance in Ukraine is generously funded by USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Iceland, The Republic of Korea, Kuwait, the Federated States of Micronesia, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor Leste, as well as private donors such as the Howard G.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Nov 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Millions of people in Ukraine are without electricity, water or heating today following a wave of missile attacks that hit critical infrastructure in at least 16 of the country’s 24 regions, and in the capital Kyiv., The new wave of missile attacks – the largest on energy infrastructure since the start of the war according to the Ministry of Energy – has also caused widespread delays in trains across the country and left millions of people without telecommunications., In the capital Kyiv, authorities informed that many homes have been destroyed in the centre of the city, just a few kilometres from the Government and United Nations offices, leaving a still unconfirmed number of people killed and injured., The damage to civilian infrastructure comes at a critical time when the temperature is dropping below zero, raising concerns about a serious humanitarian crisis during the harsh Ukrainian winter if people are unable to heat their homes., Humanitarians in Ukraine are working around the clock to support people with winter supplies, including through providing heating systems to centres hosting those displaced by the war., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Millions of people in Ukraine are without electricity, water or heating today, following a wave of missile attacks that hit critical infrastructure in at least 16 of the country’s 24 regions and in the capital Kyiv. According to the Government and Ukrainian Air Force, approximately 100 missiles were launched on the country this afternoon, mainly targeting energy infrastructure but also leaving some civilians injured or killed and homes destroyed in the capital Kyiv. The new wave of attacks on Ukraine comes just a few hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the G-20, calling on the group to support its plan to end the war, and one day after his first visit to Kherson, from where Russia withdrew its troops last week. Kherson and dozens of other towns and villages in this southern region of the country had been under Russian control since the first weeks of the war in early March., The new wave of missile attacks – the largest on energy infrastructure since the start of the war according to the Ministry of Energy – has caused widespread delays in trains across the country and left millions of people without telecommunications. Power outages are affecting between 80 and 90 per cent of people in the regions like the western Ternopil or Lviv and affecting water pumping systems in the western Ivano-Frankivska region and eastern Kharkiv region. People in other regions and cities across the country face similar challenges. The damage to civilian infrastructure comes at a critical time when the temperature is dropping below zero, raising concerns about a serious humanitarian crisis during the harsh Ukrainian winter if people are unable to heat their homes., In the capital Kyiv and across the region, authorities informed that many homes have been destroyed in the centre of the city, just a few kilometres from the Government and United Nations offices, leaving a still unconfirmed number of people killed and injured. Rescue and search operations are still ongoing. Emergency power outages have been introduced in the capital, where the population has already been dealing with regular power cuts since the wave of attacks on energy in Ukraine started on 10 October.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no6-15-nov-2022-enruuk
"More than 8 months into Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine and the ensuing escalation in hostilities the UN reports widespread abuse, torture of prisoners of war [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,OHCHR,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",15 Nov 2022,"The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), through its Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (the Mission), has been documenting the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) and the conditions of their internment through interviews with POWs, as well as with witnesses and relatives of captured servicepersons. So far, OHCHR has interviewed 159 POWs (139 men and 20 women) held by the Russian Federation (including by affiliated armed groups), and 175 POWs (all men) held by Ukraine., OHCHR has identified patterns of torture and ill-treatment of POWs held by the Russian Federation (including by affiliated armed groups), particularly during internment. OHCHR has also documented violations committed by Ukrainian state agents towards POWs, which revealed a pattern of ill-treatment at initial stages of capture and evacuation, and sporadic cases of torture and ill-treatment at later stages of internment., This statement does not focus on the violations documented by OHCHR from open sources, such as through analysis of videos depicting POWs and persons hors de combat being harmed or killed. This information has already been included in OHCHR’s reports, which are available online. OHCHR bases its findings in this statement on information mainly received through confidential interviews of persons who were or had been captured, as well as others with direct knowledge thereof, and applies OHCHR’s methodology and standard of proof of ‘reasonable grounds to believe’., The Government of Ukraine provided OHCHR confidential access to POWs in places of internment. However, OHCHR has not been granted confidential access to POWs interned by the Russian Federation (including by affiliated armed groups), despite repeated requests. On one occasion, OHCHR was allowed to meet with a group of Ukrainian POWs interned in a pre-trial detention facility in Luhansk. However, no confidential interviews were allowed. The Mission saw thirteen POWs and confirmed that they were alive., The majority of POWs captured by both parties to the conflict are held in pre-trial detention facilities and penal colonies, in violation of international humanitarian law (IHL) which prescribes that POWs shall not be held in closed confinement and must be quartered under conditions as favourable as the forces of the Detaining Power. The Government of Ukraine established a camp in April 2022, where a number of POWs are held. That camp meets most of the standards required by IHL, as verified by OHCHR during a visit in June 2022., Treatment of POWs in the power of the Russian Federation, including through affiliated armed groups, Treatment of POWs upon capture, OHCHR has documented serious violations of IHL and gross violations of international human rights law committed by Russian forces or affiliated armed groups upon capture of Ukrainian servicepersons. In one case, members of what appeared to be a group of private military contractors, fighting on behalf of the Russian Federation, dressed in Ukrainian uniforms and used two captured Ukrainian POWs to approach and attack Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut. Those who reported the case to, OHCHR believed that the two POWs and private military contractors were killed during the attack. In another case, a member of the same group of private military contractors shot dead a Ukrainian POW in the Donetsk region during questioning, when he learned that the POW had voluntarily joined the army after 24 February., OHCHR also documented treatment that may amount to torture or inhumane treatment. For example, several Russian servicemen forced two wounded Ukrainian servicemen with broken legs to crawl about 500 meters to the closest Russian position, filmed them and posted the videos online., OHCHR documented another case of a wounded Ukrainian POW who died in an improvised detention facility three days after his capture because he was not provided with adequate medical assistance. OHCHR is also examining allegations that several wounded Ukrainian POWs from Mariupol died in a makeshift transit camp in Sartana due to a lack of medical assistance in April., At the same time, the majority of former Ukrainian POWs interviewed by OHCHR did not complain about physical violence upon capture. Although some were beaten, most stated that Russian soldiers had treated them with respect at the time of surrender and officers protected them from any attempts to humiliate, threaten or beat them. However, most of the servicepersons complained about the pillaging of their belongings, including money, bank cards, jewellery, military clothes, boots and watches. The POWs were then transported to places of internment in a manner that raises concerns. They were often transported in overcrowded trucks or busses, and sometimes lacked access to water or toilets for more than a day. Their hands were tied and eyes covered so tightly with duct tape that wounds were left on their wrists and faces that continued to bleed for up to several days., Some former Ukrainian POWs recounted sporadic incidents where Russian soldiers who had captured, transported or guarded Ukrainian POWs beat them in apparent retribution for military setbacks or in the immediate aftermath of battle., Conditions in places of internment and detention, Places of internment of Ukrainian POWs are located both in the Russian Federation and in Russian-occupied territory of Ukraine. In almost all facilities, Ukrainian POWs were held in cells, sometimes overcrowded, without any time outside for exercise. Among the major places of internment are the penal colony near Olenivka; penal colonies in Horlivka, Berdiansk and Dovzhansk (formerly Sverdlovsk); pre-trial detention facilities in Donetsk, Luhansk, Taganrog, Rostov-on-Don, Kursk, Novozybkov, Staryi Oskol and Briansk; and penal colonies in Kursk and Belgorod regions. Smaller groups of Ukrainian POWs were interned at military bases and guardhouses, police stations (in arrest cells) or buildings of other law-enforcement bodies, as well as in improvised places of detention such as garages, barns, and factories, lacking sanitation and adequate living conditions. Based on information from interviews, OHCHR has identified only two places of internment used for Ukrainian POWs by the Russian Federation where most IHL requirements related to internment conditions seemed respected - a former naval school in Sevastopol and a tent town in Belgorod region., More than 80 per cent of former Ukrainian POWs interviewed by OHCHR complained about the insufficient amount or poor quality of food. They said they were given, for example, undercooked bread, meals with rotten ingredients, or porridge or spaghetti with sand or small rocks in it. In one improvised place of detention in Luhansk region, POWs only received 250 grams of canned food (grains with fat and meat by-products) and a pack of military stale biscuits per person daily, for up to three months. Some identified hunger as the most severe hardship suffered while in captivity. One man said: I was hungry all the time. All my thoughts, even about my family, would come to food.”, OHCHR also heard how food became an instrument of humiliation. A former Ukrainian POW held in a makeshift place of detention - at an abandoned factory - told us “... there was one guard. He would mock the leanest guys, giving them a pack of hard biscuits saying, ‘with this, you must gain two kilograms by the end of the week.’”, POWs held at the penal colony near Olenivka and the Donetsk pre-trial detention facility (SIZO) in April and May said that the little amount of water that was provided to them had unpleasant odour and insects in it. In a makeshift place of internment in the Luhansk region, POWs told OHCHR that they received only half a litre of water per day at some point, including during hot summer months., Several POWs released from various places of detention described being forced to consume their food in a harmful or humiliating manner. In some cases, POWs had only 45 seconds to 2 minutes to eat, including very hot food that would burn their mouths and throats. Others told OHCHR that they had to eat from dirty dishes or dishes with detergent residue, which caused them digestive problems., The poor quality of food, water and sanitation led to the spread of intestinal infections among POWs who were then not provided with adequate medical care. Some POWs interviewed by OHCHR described having lost up to a quarter of their body weight as a result of the lack of food, poor hygiene and sickness. Many frequently fainted in captivity. A man told OHCHR: “There were always people who ‘blacked out’. During my interrogation, they [officers of the Federal Penitentiary Service of the Russian Federation] slapped me and one of them asked ‘Will you faint if I punch you in the face’. I replied that I will black out even if I stand up fast.”, In relation to the conditions of internment, OHCHR found that Ukrainian POWs were held in overcrowded cells, most particularly in the DIZO (disciplinary isolation ward) in a penal colony near Olenivka, Donetsk pre-trial facility and a guardhouse in or near Donetsk. POWs spoke of lack of beds, toilets, showers, and hygiene items such as toothbrushes and toothpaste, and denial of access to daily walks in the fresh air. Furthermore, most POWs who were released from places of internment in the occupied parts of Donetsk region reported that Russian armed forced and affiliated armed groups had placed artillery pieces near their place of internment, sometimes only 100 meters away, thereby placing them in danger., The majority of former Ukrainian POWs interviewed by OHCHR were not required to perform work while in internment. However, in one case documented by OHCHR POWs were used to load artillery ammunition in Alchevsk city in violation of IHL norms on the labour of POWs. The Third Geneva Convention allows a detaining power to utilize the labour of POWs, but only under certain conditions and for work that is not dangerous, humiliating, or military in nature., Violations of the right to maintain contacts with the outside world affected both POWs and their relatives. Only a handful of Ukrainian POWs with whom OHCHR spoke were allowed to call or text their relatives, on an informal basis, and none were given a chance to send letters. In one of the hundreds of stories heard, the wife of a Ukrainian POW reportedly held in the Russian Federation told OHCHR: “I cannot explain how hard it is for me. But the hardest part of this all is to continue explaining to our small daughter why her father stopped calling….” Most relatives know the exact number of days they lost contact with their loved ones at any given time and described to us the pain of uncertainty that they live through., Treatment in places of internment, The vast majority of Ukrainian POWs with whom OHCHR spoke described how they were subjected to torture and different forms of ill-treatment while held by the Russian Federation, including through, affiliated armed groups. Their accounts revealed a practice of the use of torture or ill-treatment both to extract military information or testimony for tribunals in occupied territory, and as a widespread daily practice to intimidate and humiliate POWs. POWs with pro-Ukrainian tattoos, members of artillery and tank crews, snipers and sappers, and servicemen that took part in the military operations in eastern Ukraine prior to 2022 were at higher risk of being subjected to the most violent forms of torture or ill-treatment., The most widespread forms of torture or ill-treatment were beatings by hand (usually wearing tactical gloves), batons or wooden hammers, and kicks to various parts of the body, but usually avoiding the head and other vital areas. Electric shocks were also used, both with tasers and the so-called “TAPik” field military telephone TA-57. A man who was tortured in the DIZO of the penal colony near Olenivka told OHCHR how members of Russian-affiliated armed groups, “attached wires to my genitalia and nose, and shocked me. They simply had fun and were not interested in my replies to their questions.”, Other common forms of torture or ill-treatment reported to OHCHR included stabbing, strangling, attacks or threats of attacks by dogs, shooting with stun guns, threats with weapons, mock executions, placement in a hotbox or a stress position, hanging by hands or legs, burns with cigarettes or lighters, exposure to cold temperatures, threats of sexual violence coupled with actions such as stripping, and the twisting or breaking of joints or bones., In a few cases, OHCHR documented other forms of torture or ill-treatment, such as inserting burning cigarettes in a victim’s nostrils, applying a tourniquet to cause pain, with the victim fearing loss of limb due to constriction of blood circulation, and forms of sexual violence such as pulling a victim by a rope tied around his genitalia., OHCHR observed that, while in some places of internment POWs were subjected to torture mainly during interrogations, in other places the POWs were systematically tortured. The most common examples were the so-called ‘admission procedures’ (“приёмка” in Russian) which involved prolonged beatings, threats, dog attacks, tasering, stripping and use of stress positions upon a POW’s arrival at a place of internment. OHCHR heard accounts indicating that members of the Federal Penitentiary Services systematically engaged in this practice against POWs and civilian detainees from Ukraine in pre-trial detention facilities in the Russian Federation. OHCHR also documented the same type of mistreatment in Donetsk pre-trial detention facility, and received complaints about this practice in the penal colony near Olenivka in April 2022. Witnesses told OHCHR about the death of at least one POW during an ‘admission procedure’ in the penal colony near Olenivka in mid-April 2022. OHCHR has reports from other POWs and civilian detainees about eight such deaths there in April 2022, and is working to corroborate them. In these places of internment, POWs were subjected to daily sessions of painful acts of ill-treatment. POWs told OHCHR, for example, how they were forced to stay in stress positions - squatting or in ‘star position’ (leaning on a wall with arms and legs widely spread) - for up to 90 minutes during daily searches of their cells or barracks. Some were beaten randomly or if they moved., Even though perpetrators did not usually target vital areas of the body during episodes of torture or ill-treatment, OHCHR documented three cases where victims died after infliction of such harm. OHCHR has also received reports about dozens more cases, which are pending corroboration., Guards in several places of detention also employed humiliating practices, like forcing POWs to sing Russian patriotic or children’s songs or shout slogans, followed by violence in form of beating them if they refused to do so or made mistakes. OHCHR was told repeatedly about the so-called ‘tiny train’, form of torture, which was widespread in one pre-trial detention facility, in which POWs were forced to line up, one bent over another to form a train, and beaten by guards while “the train” moved along., OHCHR interviewed 20 female POWs upon their release from internment in the facilities near Olenivka, in Donetsk and the Russian Federation., Several women in pre-trial facilities in the Russian Federation and Donetsk region told OHCHR that during interrogations, they were beaten, subjected to electric shocks and threatened with sexual violence. Moreover, some female POWs were forced to undress and walk naked from one room to another to take a shower, or were subjected to invasive examinations during admission procedures, in the presence of male guards. These women were frequently forced to walk in a stress position through the hall, bent over almost to their feet, while being beaten by guards with batons., In the penal colony near Olenivka, female POWs were not subjected to physical violence. However, they were constantly psychologically tormented by the screams of male POWs being tortured or ill-treated in nearby cells. Such episodes lasted up to hours, and took place at all times of the day and night. One POW told OHCHR, “I still cannot stand the sound of duct tape. Guards used it to immobilize their victims and start torturing them.”, Women also suffered from dire conditions of detention. They were held in close confinement in overcrowded cells, and permitted walks outside their cells on rare occasions. Up to 30 persons could be held in a six-bed cell. They lacked bedlinen and hygiene items, and generally suffered from constant digestive problems and extreme weight loss as a result of the poor quality and quantity of food and water., Fair trial rights, In relation to fair trial rights, OHCHR documented numerous cases where Ukrainian POWs were subjected to coercive interrogations and forced confessions and testimony obtained by torture or ill-treatment was used in trials. A Ukrainian POW who was interrogated in Donetsk told OHCHR. “I went from a witness to a suspect and then to a defendant within a moment. At some point, he [the investigator] asked me, ‘Who shot at civilian buildings in Mariupol?’ I replied: ‘Russians did’. He then said: ‘Oh, you are going in the wrong direction’. Immediately two men in masks stormed into the room and dragged me to a toilet to beat me.” He endured three such sessions that day. During the next sessions, he was also shocked with a taser., OHCHR also spoke with foreign nationals serving with the Ukrainian armed forces who were accused of crimes in Donetsk. They described to OHCHR being tortured to make them confess, denied access to a lawyer of their own choosing, denied adequate interpretation during proceedings, and that they were tried by biased judges., None of the POWs with whom OHCHR spoke described being visited by any human rights or other independent monitors – either international or national – while held by the Russian Federation. The lack of access by independent monitors to places of internment significantly augments risks of ill-treatment of POWs and deprives them of protection., Accountability for violations, OHCHR is not aware of any investigations of allegations of violations against POWs by the Russian authorities that have led to prosecutions. Several former POWs reported that they were questioned by either prosecutors or military police in a hospital about signs of beatings on their bodies, but they were not aware whether any investigations have been launched., Treatment of POWs in the power of Ukraine, Treatment during initial capture and evacuation, OHCHR documented cases of torture or ill-treatment, mostly during initial capture, first interrogations or movement to transit camps and places of internment. In many cases, POWs (from Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups) complained of physical violence towards them, such as being punched in the face, and punched and kicked in the torso after surrendering and during their first interrogations by Ukrainian armed forces. In several cases POWs were stabbed or subjected to electric shocks with ‘TAPik’ by Ukrainian law enforcement officers or military personnel guarding them. One POW recalled: We were most afraid of the military phone. The feeling was awful. Your whole body froze and then you would fall to your side. In another case, a POW told OHCHR that the Ukrainian servicemen who captured him did not let him sleep, tied him to something, kicked him and beat him on the head with some hard object the whole night. Several POWs said that officers of Security Service of Ukraine punched and beat them with a rifle butt right before their interrogation, often on camera., Many POWs reported poor and often humiliating conditions during their evacuation to transit camps and places of internment. Often naked, they were packed into trucks or minivans, with their hands tied behind their backs. On some occasions this was filmed and placed online. The humiliation of POWs and their exposure to public curiosity are prohibited under IHL. Beatings during evacuation occurred in many documented cases, either during transport or at checkpoints. One Russian POW told OHCHR: “On the way from the evacuation point to a transit camp, the car stopped at seven or eight checkpoints and at each one, the Ukrainian servicemen accompanying us offered the military at the check point the chance to beat us. Some agreed and punched us.”, Treatment in places of internment, OHCHR documented cases of ill-treatment of POWs in a penal colony in the Dnipropetrovska region and in several pre-trial facilities, including so-called ‘welcome beatings’ and afterwards during internment. Such treatment was used as a tool to maintain discipline. Guards forced POWs to kneel for several hours, and beat them with sticks or shocked them with tasers if they moved. In one case, a POW told OHCHR about being suffocated with a piece of fabric placed over his mouth and nose during an interrogation by law enforcement officers., OHCHR also received allegations of extended internment of POWs in informal places of detention, such as the basements of guardhouses or military headquarters., OHCHR acknowledges the measures implemented by the Government of Ukraine to ensure the rights of POWs to communicate with their loved ones, by providing the opportunity to call in addition to sending letters as required by the Third Geneva Convention. However, OHCHR continues to receive information that some POWs have not been able to contact or sustain regular contact with their loved ones., Fair trial rights, OHCHR remains concerned that Ukraine continues to prosecute Ukrainian nationals for their membership in Russian-affiliated armed groups. OHCHR recalls that in international armed conflicts, POWs enjoy combatant immunity and may not be prosecuted for mere participation in the hostilities., In court proceedings involving these POWs, OHCHR has documented a pattern of poor or untimely legal aid. One Russian POW on trial before a Ukrainian court told OHCHR: “I saw my legal counsel for the first time during the court hearing via videoconference, with no possibility to even discuss the case, in private.” OHCHR also documented a pattern of rushed proceedings where guilty verdicts were pronounced on the same day or the next day after the preliminary hearing. During interrogation, prosecutors usually tried to pressure POWs to plead guilty, saying that it was the only way to get ‘exchanged’., Accountability for violations, OHCHR is deeply concerned about the credible allegations of summary execution of persons hors de combat, and several cases of torture, reportedly committed by members of the Ukrainian armed forces. While Ukraine has launched criminal investigations in at least two cases, OHCHR has not seen progress in these proceedings. OHCHR urges the authorities to conduct thorough investigations into all allegations, regardless of the affiliation of the alleged perpetrators, and to bring those responsible to justice., Conclusion, In the nearly nine months of intensive conflict since Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have captured a high number of POWs. It is crucial to note that the fundamental obligation of a state is to treat all POWs in their power humanely at all times, from the moment they are captured until their release and repatriation. Both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties to the Third Geneva Convention that sets out requirements relative to the treatment of prisoners of war., The parties have had sufficient opportunity to ensure that their detention/internment operations are fully in line with their obligations under international law, in particular the Third Geneva Convention. Detention operations are a reality of armed conflict, and the parties to the conflict must allocate the appropriate and required resources to fulfil these obligations. Third states, in particular those providing support to the belligerents, have an obligation under Common article 1 of the Geneva Conventions to ensure respect of IHL by the parties to the conflict., OHCHR emphasizes that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment is absolute, even – indeed especially – in times of armed conflict. The prevention of torture starts with ensuring that independent monitors have access to detainees. The Russian Federation must allow, on a regular basis, full and unimpeded access to places where POWs may be, in particular places of internment, including by allowing confidential interviews with POWs. OHCHR renews its calls on the Russian authorities to do so promptly., Accountability also is key to deterring and preventing further violations. Both parties to the armed conflict have clear legal obligations to investigate and prosecute all allegations of violations of IHL in relation to the treatment of POWs within their control, regardless of their affiliation. Both parties must do so, fairly, promptly and impartially., Speech by Matilda Bogner

Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Nov 2022,"Starting on 24 February 2022, a large-scale armed conflict in Ukraine triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across the country, characterised, among other elements, by the displacement of a significant proportion of the Ukrainian population., As early as April 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began observing significant return movements. Conditions of return vary widely, as returnees arrive back to areas not directly affected by the war, but which have experienced a significant influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as to conflict-affected and recently de-occupied areas which have sustained severe damage. Due to the volatility of the current situation, it is impossible to determine what proportion of the returns observed at present are permanent or temporary. Existing data shows, however, that the returnee population in Ukraine is characterized by a unique set of needs and vulnerabilities which set it apart from those who had never been displaced and from the population of IDPs., To support partners in providing targeted, evidence-based assistance to those returning to their areas of habitual residence following a period of forced displacement, IOM presents the Ukraine Returns Report. This publication will strive to analyze IOM’s latest data on the situation and needs of the returnee population and on the conditions of return, collected through the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessments conducted in the country., This October 2022 edition of the Ukraine Returns Report presents a detailed analysis of data collected through the ninth round of IOM’s General Population Survey (GPS), conducted between 17 and 27 October among the adult population in Ukraine. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula and the non-government-controlled-areas of Ukraine (NGCA). The general population survey was conducted using a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,002 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-returns-report-2-october-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",15 Nov 2022,"GA/12470, ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION,　　 15TH & 16TH MEETINGS (AM & PM), As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly today recommended Member States create an international register of damage to serve as a record of evidence and claims information., By the terms of the text, titled “Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine” — adopted by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions — the Assembly recognized that the Russian Federation must be held to account for any violations of international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law in or against Ukraine. The Assembly further recognized the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation for damage, loss or injury arising from the Russian Federation’s internationally wrongful acts., The Assembly also reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine and demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from that country’s territory., Many delegates expressed their support for the establishment of a registry while others voiced their concern over the resolution’s divisiveness and dangerous precedent in allowing the establishment of a mechanism that is not accountable to the Assembly. Several delegations spotlighted the hypocrisy and double standards of the resolution’s sponsors., Introducing the text (document A/ES-11/L.6), the representative of Ukraine noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Ukraine’s recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federation’s war, he underscored while emphasizing that the resolution is concerned with ensuring an appropriate response that averts any aggressor’s temptation to start a war. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned., As an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery, the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the Assembly’s authority, Guatemala’s minister noted., It is very straightforward, Albania’s speaker explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability., “It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars,” Poland’s speaker stressed., “The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,” the Russian Federation’s delegate countered, noting that the United Nations would have no role in the establishment of a mechanism created by a group of States which will decide its functioning. The West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery intended to draw out the conflict. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations., Elaborating on the text’s flaws, the speaker for China noted that the invoked articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts have no legally binding status as the research products of the International Law Commission. The Assembly is not a judicial body, he stressed, while his colleague from Eritrea agreed on behalf of a group of like-minded countries. Its resolutions cannot go beyond its mandate and responsibilities to serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts, she emphasized. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she added., Will Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory?, that country’s speaker asked. What about Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine? he continued. Creating a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and well-documented demands is unjust, morally unacceptable and damaging to the Assembly’s credibility, he emphasized., Echoing the concern over the “message of exceptionalism”, the representative for South Africa pointed out the lack of clarity on the mechanism’s composition and eventual legal status., Also speaking today were the representatives of Latvia (on behalf of Nordic-Baltic countries), Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council), United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Australia, Canada, Slovakia, Italy, Ireland, Syria, Nicaragua, Romania, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, France, Netherlands, Belarus, Iran, the United States and the European Union, in its capacity as observer., An observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also spoke., The representatives of the Bahamas (on behalf of the Caribbean Community), Mexico, Venezuela, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Pakistan, Kenya, Brunei Darussalam, Argentina, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Bahrain spoke in explanation of vote., The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 15 November, to consider the election of members to the Committee for Programme and Coordination and appointment of members of the Committee on Conferences, the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the Joint Inspection Unit. The Assembly will also take up the related reports of those bodies and the reports of its Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary)., Introduction of Draft Resolution, SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), introducing the draft resolution titled “Furtherance of remedy and reparation for aggression against Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.6), noted that the Soviet Union demanded and received reparations 77 years ago as the moral right of a country which has suffered war and occupation. Today, the Russian Federation is doing everything it can to avoid paying the price for its own war and occupation, he said, before referencing that country’s words and stance on the creation of the United Nations Compensation Commission for any damage, loss or injury arising out of Iraq’s unlawful invasion and occupation of Kuwait. From day one of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has thrown bombs, missiles and shells at Ukrainian cities and villages; destroyed roads, bridges and railways; demolished almost half of Ukraine’s power grid and utilities; and committed murder, rape, torture, forced deportation and looting. Ukraine’s recovery will never be complete without a sense of justice for the victims of the Russian Federation’s war, he said, while urging the Assembly to hold that country accountable. The Russian Federation prefers impunity to accountability and knows only two things — lies and veto — when it comes to the Security Council’s processes, he said., The proposed resolution, he noted, calls for Member States to build the legitimate international infrastructure which addresses the consequences of the Russian Federation’s aggression against his country, records evidence of atrocities and preserves the hope for justice for millions whose lives have been forever changed. It is about an appropriate response which averts the temptation of any aggressor in starting a war, he emphasized. He then reaffirmed his country’s commitment to a transparent, impartial and objective process managed and overseen by the international community and expressed his hope for cooperation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in assessing damages. A vote against this proposal will be a vote in favour of impunity and lawlessness, he cautioned., MARIO ADOLFO BÚCARO FLORES, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, said that, as a country that in its own history has experienced a lot of conflict, Guatemala acknowledges the importance of peace and respect for human rights. The draft resolution is a step towards reconciliation among the parties. Considering that the text includes civilian claims, it is an important step towards peace and post-conflict recovery. As a country that strongly believes in multilateralism, Guatemala is convinced that the Assembly has the mandate and authority to adopt the draft, as set out in Chapter Four of the United Nations Charter. The language of the text is very carefully drafted and does not exceed the authority of the General Assembly. He called on all Member States to support the initiative, because “it is the right thing to do”. The Assembly cannot remain paralyzed or inactive., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), offering to correct gaffes in Ukraine’s statement, called the draft resolution a classic example of a rules-based order in which a narrow group of States attempts to consecrate something that is illegal while also positioning the Assembly as a judicial body, which it is not. “The flawed nature of this initiative is obvious,” he said, emphasizing that the draft resolution tries to legalize something which, from the point of view of international law, cannot be legalized. Moreover, if adopted, the text will have consequences for the co-sponsors which, like a boomerang, will go back on them. The “so-called international mechanism” would be created by a group of States that will decide its functioning and designate the guilty parties and the amount of reparations. The United Nations will play no role in that process, there will be no accountability to the Assembly and most Member States will have no right to any control over the mechanism, he added., The Russian Federation has no doubt that the funds for damage compensation will be drawn from frozen, or rather stolen, Russian assets worth billions of dollars, he said, adding that the West is attempting to use the Assembly as a smokescreen to conceal an act of open robbery that is intended to draw out the conflict. This will increase global tensions and instability, but the beneficiaries will be Western military corporations that have already made billions of dollars from the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Neither the Assembly nor any other mechanism can annul sovereignty immunity, which States assets have under international law, he emphasized. Those delegations which support the draft resolution will be implicated in the illegal expropriation of sovereignty assets. He went on to say that most developing countries probably think it is ludicrous or insulting for Western countries to demand reparations, as the draft resolution is being put forward by States with a rich record of looting the rest of the world through colonialism, slavery and the exploitation of natural resources. The countries of the West never considered reparations as a way of atoning for their own sins, he said, adding that if adopted, the draft resolution will have systemic consequences for the Organization., OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, recalled how, on 2 March, the General Assembly with an overwhelming majority confirmed that the Russian Federation committed an aggression against Ukraine in violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. “Damage inflicted on Ukraine is huge,” he said. Under international law, the responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful act. The draft resolution recommends the creation by Member States and Ukraine of a register of damage. That register will serve as a repository of evidence of all types of damage., The resolution also recognizes the need for the establishment of an international claims mechanism for reparation for damage as a second step, he continued. Rather than charging the domestic legal system of Ukraine and other States with a potentially very high number of individual litigations, a centralized and specialized system would be more appropriate. “Russia must be held to account for its wrongful acts and wanton destruction,” he stressed. Every country enjoys the right to document crimes committed against its population, territory or cultural property in order to secure a proper investigation., SOPHIA TESFAMARIAM (Eritrea), speaking on behalf of a Group of Like-Minded Countries, stressed that the Assembly is not a judicial body. Its resolutions represent the political will of States and can in no way serve as the legal basis for defining internationally wrongful acts as such an action would go beyond its mandate and responsibilities, she said. As such, the draft resolution does not have sufficient legal basis, is not in line with the established practice and would only promote a divisive agenda within the Assembly. The text’s adoption, she warned, would set a dangerous precedent that would allow for the Assembly’s “blessing” to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed nor accountable to the organ responsible for creating it. States suffering from foreign interference, colonialism, slavery, oppression, unilateral coercive measures, illegal blockades and other internationally wrongful acts also deserve the right for remedy, reparation and justice, she noted., As national positions must be respected, the Assembly must play a positive role in ensuring the conflict in Ukraine is resolved through diplomatic efforts and means while avoiding any initiative that might further aggravate the situation on the ground and escalate tensions, she emphasized. Sovereign States must not be forced to take specific sides in the conflict. Any attempt to entrench a cold war‑era mentality and block politics based on confrontation, deepening divisions and the imposition of disparate visions and agendas must be rejected by all, she urged., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), speaking on behalf of the eight Nordic‑Baltic countries, recalled that the Russian Federation’s brutal invasion has created Europe’s largest humanitarian tragedy since World War II. More than 17 million people have been displaced, while three million must get by without water, electricity, sanitation and heating. Russian armed forces have deliberately attacked critical infrastructure, including energy grids, power interconnectors and water stations. Collecting and preserving evidence is important because the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its internationally wrongful acts against Ukraine and its people, he emphasized., He quoted the President of Ukraine as having told journalists a few hours earlier that investigators had uncovered more than 400 war crimes in the Kherson area after it was abandoned by Russian forces. There must be no impunity for these crimes and perpetrators must be held to account. Reiterating the Nordic‑Baltic countries’ firm support for Ukraine, he urged the Russian Federation to abide by international law and uphold its international commitments. He also called for the Secretary‑General and the United Nations to continue efforts to restore respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence., KRZYSZTOF SZCZERSKI (Poland) underscored the need for an unambiguous and comprehensive response from the international community. As accountability must remain the priority as the war continues, the Russian Federation must be held responsible for the consequences of all its violations, including reparations for the injury and damage caused by its glaring and large‑scale violation of its international obligations, he stressed. Poland supports the creation of an international register of damage, he said while calling for all damages to be always and appropriately compensated. “It is not enough if the perpetrators only admit their wrongdoings. It is not enough if they express remorse. Moral gestures are welcome but never enough. It is material compensation which is needed to rebuild damages caused by wars”, he stressed. The proposed register, he continued, will not only assist Ukraine in rebuilding itself but will also bring justice to the victims of the Russian Federation’s barbaric acts., MOHAN MAITHRI PIERIS (Sri Lanka), noting that the most urgent step is to engage in talks for a ceasefire, stressed that an attempt to provide justification through a General Assembly resolution to seizure sovereign assets of one party would amount to an overreach of the application of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Further pointing out that the Assembly is a political body for deliberation, he underscored that it cannot determine State responsibility or usurp the sovereign immunity of State property under international law. Highlighting that the register initiative creates a dangerous precedent, he emphasized that it may result in compelling the parties to resort to a more lethal and sophisticated method of engaging in the conflict., ABDULAZIZ M. ALWASIL (Saudi Arabia), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said the Council is very concerned with the crisis in Ukraine and its humanitarian, economic and political consequences. The Council aligns itself with the fundamental principles of respect for international law and the United Nations Charter that govern relations between countries, he said, urging all parties to respect their obligations under international law. The best course is to reach a settlement by diplomatic means that serves the interests of all parties. The draft resolution is based on the main principles and guidelines of redress adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 147/60 in 2005, he noted, adding that any mechanism must be based on procedures and standards that are internally accepted and under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide redress and reparations in a fair manner. He expressed the Council’s hope of finding a satisfactory solution and supported all humanitarian initiatives that achieve this purpose and bring peace to the region., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) spotlighted the continued damage and loss to Ukraine and its people caused by the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and illegal invasion. The scenes of relief and joy as Ukrainian civilians in Kherson greet Ukraine’s liberating armed forces, she noted, should leave the international community with no doubt about the cruel and destructive nature of the Russian Federation’s invasion. It will take a broad international effort to support Ukraine’s recovery and construction in order to build a safe and prosperous future for its people, she continued. Only one country is responsible for the damage to Ukraine, must pay for that damage and must be held to account for actions that are in clear violation of international law, she said before expressing her support for establishing a register of damage as an important first step towards justice., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan) recalled that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime and that responsibility for these actions must be held. “Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force must not occur in any corner of the globe,” he said, adding that the draft resolution, if adopted, should contribute to reparations for the serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter. The Russian Federation must immediately stop its war of aggression, withdraw all its troops and military equipment from Ukraine, and respect Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, he added., CAROLYN SCHWALGER (New Zealand) said that it is the General Assembly’s responsibility “to do all we can” to avoid the deadly consequences of war. “We see accountability and reparation processes as an important element in avoiding and forestalling further perpetuation of grave atrocities,” she added. New Zealand is strongly committed to supporting international mechanisms that seek accountability for the Russian Federation’s clear breaches of international law. In addition to mechanisms that seek accountability, New Zealand believes that future reparation processes can play a critical role in the rebuilding of communities, he said. Those that are responsible for causing damage and injury by breaching international law must make full reparations for rebuilding and compensating Ukraine. “The principles at stake in Ukraine are deeply significant to New Zealand as a small State acting in the world,” she said, urging the Russian Federation to commit to dialogue and act in the interests of peace., DANG HOANG GIANG (Viet Nam) expressed concern over recent developments in the situation in Ukraine, with few prospects for an early resolution. “We cannot let cooperation and dialogue take the back seat,” he emphasized. While noting the importance of resolving the “war legacies” for reconstruction, maintenance of peace, stability and prosperity for the livelihoods of the people of Ukraine, he stressed that the immediate task is to respond adequately to the urgent humanitarian needs of those impacted by hostilities in the country. He further pointed out that the international community should refrain from actions that may drive the parties further apart and delay the prospects of a peaceful settlement., MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia), emphasizing that “we will not be fooled by Russia’s misinformation and obfuscation,” said the draft resolution does not overstep the Assembly’s powers in any way. Rather, it simply recognizes fundamental principles of international law by which all States, including the Russian Federation, must abide. A register of damage and a reparations mechanism, appropriately constructed, will be an important component of a fair, impartial and just framework for determining the reparations that the Russian Federation must make to ensure lasting peace. He urged all Member States to continue to support this and all other efforts to ensure that the Russian Federation ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and to make reparations for the injury and damage it has caused., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) spotlighted the Russian Federation’s footprint of destruction. While the United Nations and other organizations have reported continuously on the significant and widespread damages caused by the Russian Federation’s aggression, there is a need to have a detailed map of what has happened to have a full picture of this man-made catastrophe, he emphasized. In expressing his support for the resolution, he called on all Member States to vote in favour as an act of justice and dignity. It is very straightforward, he explained: aggression has happened; extensive damage has been inflicted; and it must be documented for the purposes of reparation and accountability. The Russian Federation must silence the guns, withdraw completely and unconditionally from Ukraine and engage in negotiations. “Ukraine is home to Ukrainians. It does not have to become the graveyard of Russian soldiers,” he said., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said the resolution is not about seizing assets or dealing with State sovereignty; rather, it is about saying there must be a registry for there to be an eventual reckoning for the damage and destruction that has been caused. When one country attacks another country, it is a breach of the law, and it is against the rules. The Russian Federation has prevented the Security Council from functioning and has tried to tie up the General Assembly and the Council in knots because it cannot bring itself to admit that its Special Military Operation is not that at all but rather a systematic attack on Ukraine. The Russian Federation is attempting to freeze and starve the people of Ukraine. “Of course, we need to find peace,” he said, but the one and only country that can secure peace refuses to accept responsibility for its own aggression. The Assembly is not being asked to perform the function of judge or jury or to go too far, it is simply saying there should be a registry and Ukraine and other countries should be allowed to support that registry., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating himself with the European Union, and recalling the Assembly’s demand for the Russian Federation to cease its aggression against Ukraine and to withdraw from its internationally recognized borders, said today is an opportunity to address Moscow’s second obligation under customary international law. He asked delegates to imagine that their countries’ neighbour had launched a brutal and illegitimate military aggression that resulted in enormous damage against them. Would they not want the international community to hold the aggressor to account with an obligation to pay reparations, he wondered. “I believe the answer is clear,” he said, urging delegates to vote in favour of the draft resolution., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union delegation, said that, despite strong condemnations, the Russian Federation’s violent actions continue to cause suffering and destruction in Ukraine. “The picture that is emerging after Russia’s recent withdrawal from Kherson is once again one of destruction and pain inflicted on the local population,” he said. The draft resolution does not establish any standing United Nations reparation or compensation mechanism. It is instead aimed at providing global legitimacy by recommending to Member States the creation of an international register of damage. Such register will coordinate and organize evidence‑gathering efforts, including those carried out in the context of various investigations by United Nations bodies. “Ukraine needs reparations to have the possibility of rebuilding itself after the war ‑ housing for its people, schools, hospitals, roads, railways and bridges, as well as its industry and power grid ‑ all that was destroyed by Russia during its invasion and occupation,” he added., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland), associating himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation faces legal consequences arising from its continued breaches of international law. Explaining that the draft resolution recognizes and affirms Moscow’s clear obligation to cease its wrongful acts and to make reparations, he said that an international register of damage would not only preserve evidence of damage, loss and injury but also shed light on atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people. It would be an important first step towards accountability, he said, adding that reparations will alleviate some of the long‑term consequences of this horrific war., BASSAM SABBAGH (Syria), aligning himself with the Group of Like‑Minded Countries, pointed out that “Western countries” are promoting political polarization within the United Nations to deepen the divide among its Member States. He stressed that the organ should avoid any initiative which exacerbates the conflict and prevents its peaceful resolution. Noting that the draft resolution is part of a series of “unbalanced bias and provocative resolutions” pushed by the United States and its Western partners, he stated that its real objective is to pay for the increasing purchases of weapons by Ukraine. In this regard he asked the Assembly: “Who will compensate my country for the destruction of the Syrian infrastructure by the so‑called international coalition?”, JASSER JIMÉNEZ (Nicaragua), echoing the statement of the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the resolution is an example of the hypocrisy and double standards of certain countries. Nicaragua supports a robust multilateralism and a new international order with a deep transformation between countries, he said, calling for an end to double standards and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. This resolution shamelessly seeks to politicize the Organization by setting up an international mechanism that is not administered by the body that established it, he said. This is a mechanism for a single case and ignores the painful history that imperialist countries have left behind. It does not recognize the genocide against the original peoples of countries. He supported his brethren in the Caribbean and Africa that are seeking reparations for these losses. Sanctions are direct aggressions against people, and during the pandemic, they have become crimes against humanity, he said, calling for reparations for damage caused by Western countries. He said that in 1986 the International Court of Justice condemned the United States for hostilities against Nicaragua and ordered $17 billion in compensation. It is a decision that the United States has not complied with. Developing countries have been demanding a reparation mechanism for the damage created by climate change. The resolution is a divisive act in the Assembly and does not promote dialogue. It sets a dangerous precedent as it is not administered by the Assembly and his delegation will vote against it., CORNEL FERUȚĂ (Romania), aligning himself with the European Union, said the resolution is an additional step towards accountability for the Russian Federation’s blatant violations of international law. Its provisions, he noted, complement existing international efforts concerning individual criminal responsibility by adding the missing dimension of the State’s responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts. Ukraine’s case for reparations, he continued, is a moral and legal imperative which constitutes an important deterrent to the benefit of the entire community. If the aggressor is left unsanctioned, this could lead to an irreversible decay of the international order which generations have strived to build in the aftermath of the world wars, he warned. As its provisions do not establish any new entities, the resolution undertakes a modest and principled step by recognizing the need for an international mechanism for reparation and recommending the creation of an international register of damage, he emphasized., SONG KIM (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) stressed that the draft resolution is “nothing more than a politically motivated document” to shift all responsibilities of the crisis in Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Pointing out that the text is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, he further noted that the Assembly is not a judicial organ and has no mandate to judge the internationally wrongful acts and to provide the legal ground for remedy and reparations. Voicing concern over the possibility of abusing this draft resolution as a basis to illegally seize property and assets of a sovereign State, he opposed the text as a “product of a unilateral and double standard practice.”, GENG SHUANG (China) said that the draft resolution contains obvious flaws and loopholes. Elaborating, he said that the Assembly is not an international judicial body, and therefore it cannot define or hold accountable international wrongful acts. Moreover, the draft resolution aims to invoke articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, but these articles are only the research products of the International Law Commission, an expert body, and they are not legally binding. In addition, creating a register of damage outside the framework of the United Nations is a diversion from past practice that makes no sense and has no precedent. Such draft resolutions should be subjected to full consultations with a view to achieving a consensus that can stand the test of history. Regrettably, the co-sponsors of this text did not organize consultations in earnest, pushing instead for the Assembly to take unconstructive, hasty action. Declaring that China will vote against the draft resolution, he called on the parties to the crisis to return to dialogue and negotiation, with the Assembly working actively towards that end instead of aggravating divisions., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France), associating herself with the European Union, reiterated her country’s commitment to Ukraine and its people in ensuring justice for all victims of the Russian Federation’s illegal war. Victims must be respected in terms of their dignity and rights, she emphasized while spotlighting her country’s support for Ukraine legal actions and to the international efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. As the Russian Federation must be held responsible for its crimes, its flagrant violations of international law and the legal consequences of its wrongful actions, she called on the Assembly to support the draft resolution., MATHU JOYINI (South Africa) said that the impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt all over the world. South Africa reiterates that the territorial integrity of all States, including that of Ukraine, must be respected and rejects all actions that undermine principles laid out in the United Nations Charter. The Security Council should play a constructive role in resolving this conflict, she added, expressing regret that the Council continues to fail the people of Ukraine. The General Assembly, for its part, should create conditions conducive to dialogue, mediation and diplomacy. That, after all, is the only path to peace. The United Nations should do more to devote equal time to the resolution of all conflict situations that threaten international peace and security. She expressed concern that the General Assembly was “sending a message of exceptionalism” and that reparations matter in some situations but not others. Member States must refrain from double standards. The draft resolution places the United Nations in uncharted waters. The General Assembly is being asked to grant its authority to the setting up of a reparations mechanism, but there is no clarity on what the mechanism will look like or what its eventual legal status will be. “We are uncomfortable” with the draft text, she said, noting that South Africa will abstain from today’s vote., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), aligning herself with the European Union, stressed that the evidence of damages caused by the Russian Federation might disappear or get lost under the fog of war, therefore pointing to the need for a registry as outlined in the draft resolution. The text establishes that the aggressor is liable for the damages, she added, which must be documented in a register to allow for compensations. Recalling that the Assembly has established a register for damages in the past, she underscored that it is within its competence to recommend establishing one for this case. She called on Member States to “vote for justice for all those who have suffered damages in the unprovoked conflict”., VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, said the draft resolution introduced today once again shows that Western States have given up on principles of multilateralism and cooperation with the United Nations. Through the Minsk agreements, his delegation did all it could to organize negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Yet the Western States, the guarantors, did not really want to have the situation resolved, he said. Instead, they endorsed the fomenting escalation in the Donbas region in 2014, supported Ukraine and pumped weapons into it, creating the pre-conditions for today’s situation, in which both countries have become an existential threat to each other. The draft does not stand up to the cross-scrutiny of international law. It does not mention the crimes of imperialists and the consequences of slavery, he said, pointing out that no one has paid reparations for these types of damages, which are not even possible to assess. The draft does not mention the economic terrorism of sanctions that suffocate whole peoples. The war in Ukraine is one of 30 armed conflicts in the world. The Assembly should not make an exemption for one country, he stressed. The text will not bring the situation one step closer to peace; it will just polarize the Assembly. As such, his delegation will vote against it, he said., PEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA (Cuba), calling on all parties to protect civilians, their property and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, rejected the double standards, partiality, discriminatory selectivity and opportunistic approaches before the Assembly. Spotlighting the hypocrisy of its main promoters, he urged States to listen and address the compensation claims of Caribbean Community (CARICOM), developing countries and small island developing States among others. The Assembly, he noted, has never established a reparations mechanism for Member States suffering from unilateral coercive measures. Will Cuba be compensated for the damage accumulated over six decades of an economic, commercial and financial blockade; the lives lost; and the illegal occupation of its national territory, he asked before turning his attention to Mexico, Viet Nam, the Pacific Islands, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria and the State of Palestine. To limit and accelerate the creation of a reparation mechanism for one specific conflict while ignoring many other historical, legitimate and well‑documented demands is unjust and morally unacceptable, he said. It also severely damages the Assembly’s credibility, he added., AMIR SAEID JALIL IRAVANI (Iran), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, noted that the draft resolution contains language outside of the Assembly’s purview. If agreed upon, the proposed mechanism would have no actual contribution to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and would only serve as a political tool, he cautioned. The main sponsors of the draft resolution, he explained, apply different criteria in other conflicts in a blatant double standard. If an international mechanism is to be established, then it must have a broad mandate that could address any international wrongdoing, including military aggressions, looting, blockades, unilateral sanctions, occupation and the provision of weapons of mass destruction, he contended. Objecting to any mechanism which undermines international law, he pointed out that any acts or decisions of the mechanism in operative paragraphs 3 or 4 would have no legal status and thus be null and void., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States) said that it is clear what the issue is before the Assembly, namely that the international community must hold the Russian Federation to account for its violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the ensuing damage and abuses. “This resolution represents a critical step towards accountability,” he said, describing as tremendous the mounting cost of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unlawful invasion of its neighbour and fellow United Nations member. Pointing to Chapter IV of the United Nations Charter, he said that it is well within the Assembly’s authority to adopt the draft resolution and create a damages register that will be an important first step towards a claims adjudication mechanism. This is a matter of justice, not geopolitical competition, and by adopting the text, the Assembly will send a strong message to would-be aggressors worldwide that violations of international law, including the Charter, will have consequences. A vote in favour of the draft resolution is a vote for accountability and for the defence of the Charter, he said, emphasizing that Member States cannot sit on the sidelines when fundamental principles of international law are at stake., SILVA LEANDER, representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, in its capacity as observer, pointed out that Ukraine will require assistance for further strengthening its democratic institutions, which will be essential for successfully countering corruption and achieving its reconstruction. Noting that the Russian Federation has targeted not only strategic military infrastructure but also civilian targets, public services, supply networks and sectors, she stressed the need to include political and civil society institutions and actors at the local level in Ukraine as “critical infrastructure”. Emphasizing that the coming process of reconstitution and recovery needs to place democracy at its centre, she deemed it vital to allocate resources to support the reconstruction and improvement of the country’s democratic institutions., Action, The representative of Bahamas, speaking on behalf of CARICOM in explanation of vote before the vote, said CARICOM subscribes to the principle that for every wrong, there is a remedy. This is a fundamental principle of law and equity and an equally fundamental principle of international law. Ukraine has experienced injury and the burden of compensation should be imposed on the perpetrator. CARICOM recognizes that the United Nations is vital to resolving international matters. While supporting Ukraine’s legitimate claims for reparations, he said such a process must be pursued through an appropriate mechanism. The proposal in the resolution contemplates that the Assembly should endorse a process over which it would have no control, oversight or any role. As drafted, the resolution asks Member States to give approval and then trust the process will be continued fairly and objectively., Referring to language in operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, he said CARICOM will abstain from a vote. Yet the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all its wrongful acts for any violations of international law and/or for any violations of international humanitarian law in or against Ukraine. He reiterated his strong support for the principle that Member States have a legitimate right to claim reparations and compensation for injury, loss and damage caused by the wrongful actions of other Member States. This principle is to be applied in the present case as well as other similar cases worldwide. CARICOM has made this broader point regarding several issues before the international community, including climate action and reparations in connection with the transatlantic slave trade and native genocide. “There will always exist a moral and/or legal obligation to correct injustice including the legacy of past injustice,” he said., The representative of Mexico, reiterating his country’s defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty, national unity, independence and territorial integrity, noted the ongoing judicial processes which could lead to the establishment of reparation mechanisms. The reparations stage is still far away, he pointed out, since the conflict is ongoing and in a state of flux. Nevertheless, he said he will vote in favour of the resolution since the resolution limits itself to recommending the creation of a register of damages., JOAQUÍN PÉREZ (Venezuela), aligning himself with the Group of Like-Minded Countries, rejected attempts to impose a draft resolution that does not receive any consultations or take into account the views of all States involved. Such a methodology will not bring the international community closer to its goal of achieving peace. Rather, it will bring the Assembly closer to a point of no return. The draft resolution represents double standards and is not a peaceful solution. It attempts to use the Assembly to confiscate the properties and assets of other States and advances dubious aims. He said his country knows first-hand the looting of its sovereign resources. The text does not include measures for accountability, and there are no details on how it would be implemented. It does not follow a rules-based order. The proponents of the draft are shamelessly ignoring the crimes committed by colonial powers. The same members taking the lead on the resolution ignore the developing world’s demand for reparations. “It is moral amnesia,” he said. He appealed to other delegations to vote against the text, which would create a serious precedent for the Assembly., The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 94 in favour to 14 against, with 73 abstentions., The representative of Egypt, in explanation of vote after the vote, noted that he abstained from the vote since the proposal sets a dangerous precedent in asking for the development of a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the United Nations without clarifying the mechanism’s rules, working methods or subsequent measures. The role of the Organization and the Assembly has unprecedentedly not been specified, he added. He then turned his attention to the divergent views on the International Law Commission’s draft articles. This topic should not have been considered before the achievement of consensus in the Sixth Committee(Legal), he emphasized. In noting the double standard approach of certain States, he expressed his preference for the Assembly to abstain. The Assembly, he cautioned, must undertake a coherent approach going forward on its practices, ability and willingness to create similar reparation mechanisms for other countries., The representative of Brazil said he abstained since the resolution does not foster constructive dialogue nor recognize the central role of the United Nations in the process. The text brings a high level of uncertainty regarding the legal parameters of such a register to be created outside the framework of the United Nations and without its supervision, he noted. In recommending the creation of such a mechanism without a specified scope, the Assembly is encouraging the fragmentation of its collective responsibility in promoting peace. It undermines the United Nations and ignores the efforts of the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court, he emphasized before voicing his regret over the insufficient time for discussion. The emergency special session must be capable of acting in a more transparent and democratic fashion, he urged while referencing the deadlock in the Security Council., The representative of Chile said her country’s vote in favour of the resolution is representative of its respect for human rights. She also expressed concern that some delegations in the Sixth Committee (Legal) have been unwilling to negotiate a convention on a binding framework to provide legal certainty regarding the international responsibility of States. Chile calls on those delegations to modify their position. Chile also recognizes that Assembly resolutions have a non-binding character. Further, she said she hopes a reparations fund will be established for relatives of victims of femicide and other violent deaths of women. Chile calls on all parties to continue negotiations and find a peaceful solution to the conflict., The representative of Indonesia called the resolution “divisive”, while also recognizing the efforts of the facilitators to provide room for some consultation. The underlying message of the resolution should have been that war must stop and that sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. On the recommendation to establish a registry of damage and a reparations mechanism, he highlighted that such mechanisms must be built upon a foundation of due process. “The General Assembly resolution at this stage may lead us to a slippery slope,” he warned. For these reasons, Indonesia abstained from the resolution., The representative of India, emphasizing the conflict’s impact on the Global South, said delegations need to consider whether a reparation process, initiated through the Assembly, will contribute to resolving the conflict. Such a mechanism must not be established without adequate legal vetting, she said, adding that Member States must avoid steps that might preclude or endanger the possibility of dialogue and negotiations which could bring the conflict to an end. For that reason, India decided to abstain, she said., The representative of Singapore said his delegation supported the resolution on the understanding that it is without prejudice to, nor does it seek to undermine or prejudge, the outcomes of ongoing judicial and investigative processes related to the war in Ukraine. Moreover, in Singapore’s view, the approach contained in the resolution is not automatically applicable to other conflicts, as every situation should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law into account, he added., The representative of Pakistan, noting that while his country supports the establishment of a claims commission, stressed that any such mechanism must be based on sound legal foundations. Double standards in the application of international law are counterproductive, he emphasized, underscoring that it would be unprecedented to establish a remedy and reparation mechanism that is neither managed by nor accountable to any of the United Nations principal organs, including the Assembly. Irrespective of the origin of the conflict, he added, the highest priority at this moment is immediate cessation of hostilities and dialogue for peace., The representative of Kenya stated that, while Ukraine has a sovereign right to make claims for damages and losses caused by the current conflict, so do all peoples and countries that have sought reparations for colonial violence, slavery and other acts of aggression. Noting that this text will pave the way for more concrete discussions, decisions and resolutions on reparation, he emphasized that all Member States should be ready to hear other countries’ calls for accountability for historical injustices., The representative of Brunei Darussalam condemned violations of the sovereignty or territorial integrity of any country and firmly upheld the principles for the respect of international law. Regarding the establishment of a register of damage, she said similar mechanisms have been established under the ambit of the United Nations. Any such independent mechanism should be established according to due process and consultations. She reiterated the importance of diplomacy and called on all parties directly involved to de‑escalate and resolve the situation by peaceful means, stressing the need to refrain from force and maintain international peace and stability., The representative of Argentina said her delegation’s clear and consistent position has been to defend territorial integrity as a fundamental principle of international law. Any damages must be subject to reparations under international law. She supported the draft resolution as it would achieve accountability for wrongful acts that violate the Charter. She stressed the importance of indicating the damages for such wrongful acts and discussing appropriate means for accountability, bearing in mind that accountability for unlawful acts must apply to all acts that need reparations, without prejudice. For this reason, her delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution., The representative of Qatar, in calling on parties to show restraint and stop the war, said he voted in favour of the resolution since it is in line with his country’s position on the protection of civilians and the provision of reparations for material and psychological damages. Reparations and the mechanisms to implement them, however, must be conducted in accordance with the principles of international law and established international precedents, he stressed., The representative of the United Arab Emirates, associating himself with the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he abstained due to the text’s unclear and imprecise nature. The resolution offers the Assembly’s support for reparations and evidentiary processes that have yet to be defined by a group of Member States still to be determined, he pointed out while expressing his concern over the resolution’s implications for sovereign equality and sovereign immunity., The representative of Nigeria called on all parties to the conflict to end hostilities and begin negotiations. Nigeria is committed to the principles of the United Nations and calls on all countries to refrain from actions that will worsen the conflict. Current efforts should focus on resuming peace. Nigeria is open to working with all countries on these goals, he said, adding that for such reasons Nigeria abstained from the vote., The representative of Sierra Leone reiterated grave concern about the conflict in Ukraine, which has had widespread repercussions all over the world. Sierra Leone is committed to the United Nations Charter and its principles, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, he said. Noting that his delegation’s prior votes on the issue of Ukraine have been based on the Charter principles, he said today Sierra Leone abstained from the resolution and was guided by its belief in the Charter and the consistent application of international law. The General Assembly is not an adjudicative body and cannot set out legal consequences; it must recognize all victims of historical injustices, including racism, colonialism and slavery. “Reparations concern both the past and the present,” he added., The representative of Bahrain, renewing support for all efforts to use diplomatic means to de-escalate tensions and conflicts, reiterated that any mechanisms for settling disputes should follow the rules of the United Nations and the multilateral system. Hopefully, work will continue towards a peaceful settlement that meets the needs of all parties and avoids further repercussions, he added.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/general-assembly-adopts-text-recommending-creation-register-document-damages-caused-russian-aggression-against-ukraine-resuming-emergency-special-session
Update 126 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (14 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,14 Nov 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will in the coming weeks send nuclear safety and security missions to three operating nuclear power plants in Ukraine as well as to the country’s Chornobyl site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Following a request from Ukraine, an agreement has been reached between the government and the IAEA to dispatch teams of Agency nuclear safety and security experts to the South Ukraine, Khmelnytskyi and Rivne Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). Under the agreement, the IAEA will also send its third such expert mission to Chornobyl during the current conflict in Ukraine. The IAEA already has a team of experts continuously present at the country’s largest such facility, the Zaporizhzhya NPP (ZNPP). At all these facilities, the IAEA is also regularly carrying out safeguards activities, and has just completed in-field verification activities at three other locations in Ukraine at the request of its government, following allegations by the Russian Federation about activities there., Initially, each mission will last for about a week, Director General Grossi said, adding that they may be followed by others if needed. The Director General has earlier during the conflict led IAEA safety, security and safeguards missions to the South Ukraine and the Chornobyl NPPs – in March and April, respectively – as well as to the ZNPP in September to establish the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) there. IAEA experts carried out a second mission to Chornobyl in late May and early June., “From the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the IAEA has been doing everything it can to prevent a nuclear accident with potentially serious consequences for public health and the environment. We have delivered nuclear safety and security equipment, produced impartial assessments of the situation, and provided technical expertise and advice. We are doing this important work in close cooperation with – and at the request of – the Ukrainian authorities,” Director General Grossi said., “Immediately after I received this latest request from Ukraine, we developed concrete proposals and began preparing the technical and logistical details and we are now ready to deploy these new missions soon. While the world is focused on the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, we must not forget the other nuclear facilities located in a country at war,” he said., At the ZNPP, the six reactors are continuing to receive the off-site electricity they need for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions from the one remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line. The area has been relatively quiet recently, with reduced shelling at the site and in the industrial area near the town of Enerhodar., “However, our experience shows that this can change at any time and suddenly take a new dangerous turn. This is not the time to relax. I’m continuing my determined efforts to agree and implement a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant as soon as possible. It remains urgently needed,” Director General Grossi said., Four of the plant’s reactors remain in cold shutdown, while the two others are in hot shutdown to provide steam for the plant and also heating for people living in Enerhodar, many of them workers at the plant and their families., Last week, Ukrainian operating staff proposed to start operating reactor unit 6 at low power to provide more steam, while still not producing electricity. The Ukrainian regulator subsequently approved the request. However, the Russian operating organisation did not give its permission on the grounds of the site’s unreliable connections to the power grid and therefore this unit remains in hot shutdown., Director General Grossi expressed concern about the decision-making situation as it showed open contradictions regarding the chain of command at the plant, Europe’s largest., With the creation of a Moscow-based Russian state operating organization for the site, the Russian Federation has announced it has taken control of the facility, including now taking significant operational decisions, and more Russian technical staff are present at the site. However, Ukrainian plant staff continue to undertake day-to-day operations of the ZNPP facility, under high and relentless stress., “The Ukrainian staff are carrying out their vital tasks under constant pressure. This can have a negative impact on nuclear safety and security and increase the risk of a nuclear accident, and it must stop. Exacerbating the situation, they are now also faced with conflicting instructions on how to run the plant,” he said., In another sign of this, a Russian contractor has been undertaking modifications of the physical protection system of the plant’s dry spent fuel storage facility, which were not authorized by the competent Ukrainian authority., Last Friday, the IAEA team visited the dry spent fuel storage facility and saw that IAEA safeguards seals on the spent fuel casks were in place, and no immediate safeguards issues were identified., Separately, a convoy of 24 trucks from Zaporizhzhya town arrived at the plant yesterday with supplies and spare parts, including chemical agents, electrical components, and electric heaters for the winter.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-126-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-14-nov-2022

Over a two-week period, Salesians were able to distribute approximately 48 boxes of rice to the people connected to these organizations., Salesians have been working with the Korostyshiv Catholic Church since 1994 and have worked at Vsesvit Salesian school for the last five years. While Salesians are not working directly with the Teterivka Orphanage and Boarding House, the children there have disabilities and need specialized care.

This latest funding will provide specialised energy equipment to keep critical national infrastructure up and running – a priority request from the Government of Ukraine., Since October 2022, Russia has carried out widespread missile and drone strikes, particularly targeting Ukraine’s power supplies. More than 40% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including transmission lines, power stations and pipelines, has been damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks. This has left millions of Ukrainians across the country living without electricity or experiencing rolling blackouts., Recently the UK has also provided £7 million for over 850 generators so that vital facilities, such as hospitals, have power and a further £5 million for safety and security equipment for the civil nuclear sector. In addition, the UK has put up a $50 million guarantee for financing for Ukraine’s state-owned energy provider, Ukrenergo, through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which will help Ukraine continue to supply electricity to its citizens., The Foreign Secretary is due to sign the agreement today with Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, alongside Energy Community Secretariat Deputy Director Dirk Buschle, to transfer the first £5 million of the UK’s £10 million commitment to the Energy Community’s Ukraine Energy Support Fund., Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said:, Russia’s attacks on vital infrastructure show that Putin is resorting to desperate measures. But even in the face of missile attacks and blackouts, the resolve of the Ukrainian people remains unbroken. > > The Government of Ukraine said it needed specialised energy equipment to repair critical national infrastructure, and the UK is delivering on their request. > > The UK has made the largest donation to date to this Fund. We need all partners to step up their support and show Putin that his attempts to destroy Ukraine will be met with fierce resistance., Ukrainian Minister of Energy Herman Halushchenko said:, Russia is trying to break us by shelling the energy infrastructure to leave Ukrainians on the eve of winter without heat and light. These days the support of international partners is more important than ever. > > UK has been helping Ukraine’s energy sector since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Today it is making a significant contribution to the Energy Support Fund. > > This will make it possible to purchase the necessary equipment for our energy companies, which is difficult to do as a part of humanitarian aid. > > Many thanks to our British partners and the Energy Community Secretariat for the help in the fight against Russia on the energy front., The private sector also has an important role in supporting Ukraine’s reconstruction. That’s why the Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps is issuing a call to action to UK industry today to consider supplying emergency energy equipment, such as power generators, transformers, and cables-wires and connectors., Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps said:, We cannot stand by and watch millions of innocent Ukrainian citizens continue to suffer due to barbaric Russian air strikes. Today’s intervention from the UK Government will be critical in helping to get Ukraine’s power back up and running. > > But this alone simply won’t suffice. In Ukraine’s hour of need, I call on the generosity of the UK industry to join the government in donating emergency energy equipment and resources through the Energy Support Fund. This will help rebuild what has been damaged by Putin’s illegal invasion as we continue to stand with the people of Ukraine., The Department for International Trade is also working with relevant UK trade associations and Ukrainian energy companies to identify areas where UK expertise and equipment can be provided to help with vital maintenance of Ukraine’s energy supply infrastructure., The Director of the Energy Community Secretariat, Artur Lorkowski, said:, With hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian families without electricity, heating and hot water as winter sets in, support to Ukraine is needed more than ever. The Ukraine Energy Support Fund is a transparent and efficient vehicle for international donors seeking to help Ukraine repair and rebuild its energy infrastructure which has been brutally damaged by Russia. > > The donation of the United Kingdom is a great show of solidarity and will bring essential aid to Ukraine by allowing the purchase of much needed tools and critical equipment needed to restore essential electricity and gas services to Ukrainian citizens.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/uk-funding-help-repair-ukraines-damaged-energy-systems-and-get-power-back-ukrainian-people

This is the first time that aid workers have been able to enter Kherson with humanitarian aid since Russian forces took control of the city in the first weeks of the war in early March 2022., “The people of Kherson are struggling to meet their basic needs, only adding to the trauma of having endured months of constant bombardments, being forced to flee their homes, and seeing their loved ones being killed or injured,” Ms Brown said. “The people need urgent support, and we must act quickly to help them.”, The city faces a shortage of water and electricity, while markets are running low on food and health facilities lack medicines., Today’s humanitarian convoy brought food, water, hygiene kits, shelter materials and critical household items, including bedding, thermal blankets and solar lamps, to more than 6,000 people in Kherson. A health centre in the city will also receive medicines to treat more than 1,000 patients over the next month., The International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) took part in today’s convoy., The humanitarian community will continue to mobilize resources and supplies over the coming days to expand their operations and bring more aid to people in all areas of the Kherson region, which are now back under Ukrainian control. In recent weeks, life-saving items have already been delivered to more than 12,000 people in other towns and villages retaken by Ukraine in the Kherson region, including Novovorontsovka, Novooleksandrivka, Velyka Oleksandrivka and Vysokopillia., So far this year in the Kherson region, humanitarian organizations have reached 100,000 people, most of them with cash assistance., “With the support of our partners, particularly the local organizations, I am confident that we will be able to do much more in the days and weeks ahead,” Ms. Brown said. “We must stand with the people of Kherson in their hour of need.”, For further information, please contact OCHA Ukraine:

At present the NZDF has two infantry training teams totalling 120 personnel training Ukrainian personnel in the UK., Intelligence: Extend the NZDF’s existing intelligence contribution of up to 12 personnel in the UK, as well as New Zealand-based open source intelligence staff, from 30 November 2022 to 30 June 2023. In addition the NZDF will provide two additional support positions to the UK for the same period., Command and administration support: The deployment of up to eight NZDF personnel to Europe from 30 November 2022 to 31 July 2023 to assist deployed NZDF personnel throughout Europe supporting Ukraine’s self-defence efforts., Logistics: Recommence the deployment of four personnel from 30 November 2022 to 30 June 2023 to a logistics hub in Europe to support Ukraine., Liaison: Extend the NZDF’s existing liaison officer contributions in the UK and Europe from 30 November 2022 to 30 June 2023., *Global food security support: *$1.85 million to the World Food Programme to help address global food insecurity, which has been exacerbated by the crisis in Ukraine., *NATO Trust Fund: *Additional $1.85 million contribution for non-lethal military equipment and supplies for Ukraine’s self-defence during the northern winter., “We are pledging further support to the NATO Trust Fund. This will provide non-lethal military support like winter clothing, food rations, mobile generators, ambulances, medical and first aid kits, shelters, and other vital supplies over the coming northern winter,” Nanaia Mahuta said., “I am pleased the NZDF infantry can offer the skills and experience for further training. This deployment also provides an opportunity for NZDF personnel to gain valuable experience,” said Peeni Henare., “The infantry training demonstrates the core skills and capabilities of our defence personnel. Utilising them in an offshore location, alongside key partners, helps encourage retention of frontline personnel. However I want to be clear that the NZDF will not be entering Ukraine., “I have been informed that the Ukrainian recruits have responded well to our training personnel, and have said that the NZDF personnel are working hard for them., “While the New Zealand military contribution to our bigger partners and Ukraine is small compared to what others are doing, we are contributing in a targeted way and I am confident that our contributions are having a continued impact,” says Peeni Henare., More information about sanctions, travel bans, and export controls against Russia; as well as diplomatic, military and economic support to Ukraine can be found on the MFAT site here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/assistance-ukraine-extended-and-enhanced

Ukraine: Preserving evidence of war crimes as Ukraine retakes its territory key for victims of war crimes,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,11 Nov 2022,"Responding to the latest military developments on the ground in Kherson Region, Denis Krivosheev, Regional Director, Eastern Europe and Central Asia said:, “Following Russian troops’ withdrawal from Dnipro’s right bank in Kherson, it is important to prioritize preservation of evidence of war crimes committed there. Justice is owed to victims of Russian crimes under international law against Ukraine, and all those responsible must be held to account in fair trial proceedings., “While this is a major military development, the experience of recent weeks indicates we can expect to see further Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure as Ukraine continues to retake its territory. Just today, the civilian death toll continues to rise from an overnight Russian missile strike which devastated a residential building in Mykolaiv., “Although we understand that Ukrainian authorities and civilians will want to rebuild and reinhabit the region as soon as possible, preserving evidence of war crimes must be a priority. This is essential to ensure comprehensive accountability and enable the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation and other national and international justice mechanisms to prosecute perpetrators of the most serious crimes under international law committed on Ukrainian soil.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-preserving-evidence-war-crimes-ukraine-retakes-its-territory-key-victims-war-crimes

Shelter and Non-Food Items",11 Nov 2022,"Context, Since the start of the Russian invasion on the 24th of February 2022, Chernihiv City (282,000 inhabitants), a settlement in the northern part of Ukraine (66 km to a state border with Belarus), has suffered numerous damages to residential buildings and infrastructure. The most intensive destructions were caused during February-March siege when Chernihiv was encircled and shelled.1 The siege ended in the beginning of April, after which images emerged showing extensive damage to residential buildings in the city's outskirts and neigbouring villages . Local authorities reported that 70% of buildings of all types had been damaged.To support the humanitarian response, IMPACT Initiatives has conducted a residential damage analysis to estimate the number of affected residents in Chernihiv City. The analysis is based on recent high-resolution satellite imagery (acquired on 28 April, 2022) and follows a similar approach as the one used for the Irpin City damage assessment conducted in July 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-residential-building-damage-assessment-chernihiv-february-april-2022
Update 125 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (11 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,11 Nov 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has this week carried out a joint safeguards and nuclear security expert mission to a nuclear research facility in Ukraine’s north-eastern city of Kharkiv and found it had been heavily damaged by shelling during the current military conflict in the country, but without any indication of radiological release or diversion of declared nuclear material, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The 8-10 November mission to the Kharkiv Institute of Technology (KIPT) – the IAEA’s first to this research site since the conflict began more than eight months ago – also visited the RADON radioactive waste management facility in the same city which so far remains intact., “Our three nuclear security and safeguards experts have been able to successfully complete this very important mission to Kharkiv, which has suffered greatly during the tragic war in Ukraine. We had previously received information from Ukraine about extensive damage to the city’s nuclear research facility, but this was the first time we could see the facility for ourselves and inform the world about the difficult situation there. Although radiation levels were normal, the extent of damage to this nuclear research facility is dramatic and shocking, even worse than expected. The sheer scale and intensity of the sustained targeting of KIPT violate all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars I outlined at the beginning of the conflict” Director General Grossi said., The aim of the mission was to assess the extent of the damage to the KIPT site as a result of heavy shelling hitting the facility, including on 6 March and again on 25 June, and to see whether these attacks had impacted its physical protection system. This also met the Agency’s commitment to perform such a mission once the security situation allowed travel to the site., KIPT’s subcritical Neutron Source installation, used for research and development as well as radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications, was transferred to a deep sub-critical state at the start of the conflict on 24 February, and its radioactive inventory is low. The IAEA has previously reported that there was no increase in radiation at the site despite damage to its infrastructure, cooling system and diesel generator building., During this week’s mission, the IAEA expert team observed even greater damage to the site than it had previously reported, with nearly all buildings on the site affected, many of them probably beyond repair., KIPT’s Deputy Director General told the IAEA team that the site had endured around one hundred instances of missile attacks and shelling during the first three weeks of the conflict alone, and it had been without power and water for more than a month., Many buildings and facilities at the site still have no heat or power, and most windows are broken. Staff are working to cover windows and restore heat and power before winter., Throughout the period of heavy attacks earlier in the conflict, KIPT’s security staff remained on duty and managed to maintain the site’s physical protection system, implementing contingency measures to counter and compensate for damage to individual security systems, structures, and components., The RADON facility, in contrast, has so far not been damaged during the conflict, but the IAEA team heard the sound of repeated shelling in the distance when it visited the site., Regarding safeguards, the IAEA team was able to verify the inventory of nuclear material at KIPT’s fuel fabrication R&D facility – which holds most of the site’s nuclear material – noting that there had been no changes since last year., At KIPT’s Neutron Source Research Reactor – which was heavily damaged on the outside of the building housing the reactor but with no damage inside – the IAEA inspectors performed design information verification and noted no changes to the design of the facility, though they were not able to access the nuclear material for verification due to lack of power. The IAEA will conduct additional verification activities of this nuclear material once the facility’s power has been restored, Director General Grossi said., In addition, the team conducted a complementary access (CA) while at KIPT, visiting all onsite hot cells and finding no indication of undeclared nuclear material or activities., At the same time, the experts checked the entire site area with a radiation monitor and did not identify any sources of radiation, with measurements at or around background levels.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-125-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-11-nov-2022
WHO promotes action on urgent mental health needs of Ukrainian refugees,News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Nov 2022,"The mental health needs of refugees were brought into focus at a workshop, organized by WHO, where lessons were shared by refugee-receiving countries and strategies discussed on how to handle the rising numbers of refugees arriving from the war in Ukraine. Experts from receiving countries shared best practices for the provision of urgently needed mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to arriving refugees., Held under the aegis of the pan-European Mental Health Coalition and as a follow up to the high-level meeting on health and migration held in Istanbul in March 2022, participants included members of civil society, international organizations and mental health and migration experts, members of the refugee community and representatives of refugee-receiving countries as well as WHO representatives working on the mental health response., “The Russian aggression in Ukraine came as a great shock to Poland but also the whole region,” said Poland’s Deputy Minister of Health, Waldemar Kraska. He noted that initially support had focused on covering refugees’ basic needs, but that now the focus needed to be on addressing mental health, particularly for the “young mothers and children who have to flee knowing that their husbands and fathers are still in Ukraine, fighting.”, Supporting mental health, War, armed conflict and other man-made or natural disasters cause profound distress and can in some cases ignite or inflame existing mental health conditions. Most people will recover without help; however, an estimated 1 in 5 people will have a mental health condition in the next 10 years, and 1 in 10 will have a severe condition like post-traumatic stress disorder or psychosis., This makes good quality MHPSS essential for the recovery of countries affected by war. For Viktoria Mariniuk, who works for the League for Mental Health in Slovakia and herself had to leave Ukraine, good MHPSS is nothing without the involvement of the people affected: “Let me tell you about the right MHPSS: people want to be listened to, and in most cases no medical procedures and no medications are needed.”, Participants at the workshop agreed that refugee populations needed to be better engaged in future MHPSS work. Furthermore, it was agreed that mental health support sensitive to refugees needed to be integrated into national emergency preparedness, response, and recovery plans ahead of an emergency taking place., Best practice examples included the creation of easy to access MHPSS service desks in Slovakia and the loosening of regulations to allow Ukrainians with relevant qualifications to provide mental health support for refugees without needing to be re-licensed in Poland., Refugees in Ukraine, Millions of people have been forcibly displaced since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Over 7 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries and beyond. Millions more are displaced within the country's borders. About 4,4 million refugees registered for Temporary Protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe (as of 25 Oct 2022)., WHO experts were deployed to Ukraine and the surrounding countries, within days of the war starting, to address immediate health needs and to begin the process of coordinating mental health and psychosocial support. This involved informing refugees arriving with pre-existing mental health conditions where to get help, whether psychotropic medication or counselling., WHO is making MHPSS resources available, coordinating MHPSS and providing surge support. Supporting countries in this effort is one of the main priorities of the pan-European Mental Health Coalition, which will hold its second meeting on 23-24 November 2022 to continue the work begun at this meeting.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-promotes-action-urgent-mental-health-needs-ukrainian-refugees
Return to Zaporizhzhia: a journey home in war-torn Ukraine,News and Press Release,OCHA,Protection and Human Rights,11 Nov 2022,"War. Nobody is prepared to go through war. Even I, who work for a UN humanitarian response organization (OCHA), was not ready when it arrived at our doorstep in Kyiv. On 24 February, when Russian Forces attacked multiple cities in Ukraine, my husband woke me up at 6 a.m. saying, “They attacked us.” Back then, I was unaccustomed to listening for explosions or sirens, so I somehow slept through all the noise. The rest of the day was a blur of packing, and that afternoon we crossed the country by car, driving for over 20 hours and ending up in Chernivitsi oblast., Unlike me, my mother who lives in Zaporizhzhia oblast in southern-eastern Ukraine, decided not to leave. Like hundreds of thousands of others, she said: “My home is here, and I will not go anywhere.” She did briefly consider fleeing when missiles hit the shopping mall next to her apartment building in May, shattering her windows. Instead, she covered the windows with plastic sheeting. “I do not see the point, they can shatter again,” she said, and carried on with her life., Read more on Exposure.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/return-zaporizhzhia-journey-home-war-torn-ukraine
Joint Declaration - 1 billion euro mobilised for Solidarity Lanes to increase global food security and provide a lifeline for Ukraine's economy,News and Press Release,EBRD,Agriculture,11 Nov 2022,"On behalf of the European Commission, Czechia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank Group*, As part of the European Union's response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the European Commission and bordering EU Member States established on 12 May 2022 the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes. The Solidarity Lanes are essential corridors for Ukraine's agricultural exports, as well as the export and import of other goods., As one of the world's largest grain producers, Ukraine normally supplied around 45 million tonnes of grain to the global market every year. However, in its brutal war against Ukraine, Russia deliberately targets agricultural production and exports, blocking safe passage to and from Ukrainian Black Sea ports and building up stocks in grain silos. This has driven up world cereals prices, created food insecurity globally and put at risk the livelihoods of millions of people who rely on those grains., Since the inception of the Solidarity Lanes, more than 15 million tonnes of Ukrainian agricultural goods (grain, oilseeds and related products) have been exported, by road, rail and through Black Sea and Danube ports. In addition, since August, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has helped relaunch grain shipments from Ukraine's Black Sea ports, thereby further reducing food prices globally., Together these initiatives have allowed the export of about 25 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain, oilseeds and related products between May and end of October to world markets, including to the countries most in need., The Solidarity Lanes are currently the only option for the export of all other, non-agricultural Ukrainian goods to the rest of the world and for importing all the goods it needs, such as fuel and humanitarian assistance. As such, the Solidarity Lanes have become the lifeline of Ukraine's economy, bringing back more than EUR 15 billion of much-needed income to Ukrainian farmers and businesses., The EU has been working with Member States, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, international partners and companies, as well as transport operators, to improve the functioning of the Solidarity Lanes. As bordering EU Member States, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, have made tremendous efforts and investments to facilitate these trade routes., The Solidarity Lanes have become an indispensable link for deepened relations with Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova, and are essential to establish a more stable connectivity with the EU in view of future accession. They bring Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova closer to the EU single market, while keeping both countries connected to the rest of the world., However, the Solidarity Lanes are reaching their capacity limits, bottlenecks persist and logistics costs are high. To sustain and further increase the capacity of the Solidarity Lanes, we have been mobilising significant investments through various existing EU and national programmes. Administrative and operational facilitation needs to continue, including on streamlining border crossing procedures, and more funding is needed., The European Commission will urgently dedicate EUR 250 million of grants to boost the Solidarity Lanes. For the short-term, we will support quick improvements, in particular with mobile equipment, to reduce waiting times and improve movement through the border crossing points and their access routes. For the medium-term, we are mobilising the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) and EUR 50 million to support the infrastructure developments needed to increase further the capacity of the Solidarity Lanes., Working with partner Financial Institutions such as the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank we want to ensure liquidity for operators, and funding of repairs and capacity increases. Notably:, The European Investment Bank plans to invest up to EUR 300 million by end-2023 on projects that respond to the Solidarity Lanes objectives. This is on top of the activity already announced and financed [1] in Ukraine, a significant part of which is dedicated to road and railway upgrades. In addition, the European Investment Bank and the European Commission are making available the technical expertise of Jaspers (Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions) for the identification and preparation of cross-border transport projects to be financed under the CEF, which can attract potential EIB co-financing., On the basis of the work undertaken for several months on the ground with the European Commission and all relevant stakeholders, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development intends to invest EUR 300 million in favour of Solidarity Lanes over 2022-2023 - part of which will go to projects already identified and in the process of being approved., The World Bank Group, in addition to its regional transport modelling, rapid damage assessment to identify priority repairs and recovery investments as well as ongoing work on trade and logistics, is preparing an emergency project to undertake repairs of the railway and road infrastructure damaged by the war with up to USD 100 million targeted for disbursement in 2023. Rehabilitation of railway infrastructure and multi-modal logistics in Romania and the Republic of Moldova to Ukraine's borders is under discussion to support Ukrainian critical exports and imports, and lay foundations for reconstruction., We also call on our international partners to provide further financial support to these actions, which are essential for Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and for global food security., [1] : https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2022-400-another-eur550-million-from-the-eib-group-supported-by-an-eu-guarantee-reaches-ukraine-for-immediate-assistance",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-declaration-1-billion-euro-mobilised-solidarity-lanes-increase-global-food-security-and-provide-lifeline-ukraines-economy

The CSM is a multisectoral monthly assessment that aims to inform a wide range of partners with basic information on key sectoral indicators related to the shelter and protection of IDPs in Ukraine. Data is collected through a combination of in-person and remote interviews with site managers (key informant interviews, or KIIs). One key informant is interviewed per site., This comparative analysis brief highlights the main trends identified over the three rounds of CSM: June, July, and August-September.
The CSM follows up from a consolidated mapping of collective sites across Ukraine. Through the support of CCCM cluster partners, as of 30 September, the master list contained 7,234 collective sites.
The sites assessed over the three rounds of the CSM (n=2,907) correspond to 40% of all the sites mapped., Findings across three rounds were compared to provide additional insights on changes in site-level needs over time, as well as the effectiveness of the response in meeting those needs. Sites were sampled purposively, thus findings should be read as indicative rather than representative., Sites assessed in Round 3, interviewed in previous rounds, answered a shortened version of the CSM questionnaire (with a focus on IDP population demographic characteristics, vulnerabilities, movement intentions, and top priority needs).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-collective-site-monitoring-csm-comparative-analysis-brief-june-september-2022

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (29 October - 4 November 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,10 Nov 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations and targeted the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea amid the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine. Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, ceasefire violations continued to decrease. Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini, rising living costs, and climate grievances continued to spark demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. In the Luhansk region, Ukrainian forces continued their counteroffensive military operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line (ISW, 31 October 2022). Amid the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in southern Ukraine, Russia moved its Kherson regional occupation administration from Kherson to Skadovsk last week (General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 1 November 2022). Additionally, Russian forces started forcibly relocating civilians from occupied parts of the Kherson region to occupied Crimea and Russia (RFE/RL, 3 November 2022)., Meanwhile, on 29 October, Ukrainian forces attacked the Russian naval base in Sevastopol in Crimea with unmanned surface vessels and aerial drones, damaging several Russian warships (Naval News, 30 October 2022). Later that day, Russia suspended its participation in an agreement signed in July that guaranteed the safe passage of commercial ships carrying Ukrainian grain, citing the attack (CNBC, 29 October 2022). After Russia’s withdrawal, Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of violating the agreement since September by blocking the movement of over 170 commercial ships from Ukrainian ports (Odesa Regional State Administration, 29 October 2022). Despite Russia’s withdrawal from the agreement, the shipment of Ukrainian grain continued, with Russia rejoining the deal on 2 November following negotiations with Turkey (Reuters, 31 October 2022; Al Jazeera, 2 November 2022)., Russian forces continued to target critical infrastructure across Ukraine with missile and drone strikes, damaging over 40% of all energy infrastructure in Ukraine as of 1 November (RFE/RL, 1 November 2022). Russian shelling and missile strikes also reportedly killed dozens of civilians last week in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Vinnytsia regions. Landmine explosions in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv regions left at least seven more civilians dead., Last week in Russia, authorities of the Belgorod and Kursk regions reported 14 incidents of cross-border shelling, which damaged civilian infrastructure in villages close to the Russia-Ukraine border. This violence contributed to the 195% increase in average weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Ceasefire violations continued along the** Armenia-Azerbaijan** Line of Contact last week, though at a lower level compared to the week prior. Additionally, an Azerbaijani civilian was wounded in a landmine explosion in the Jabrayil district of Azerbaijan., Climate and environmental protests continued to take place across Europe last week. In France, more than 60 police officers and 50 demonstrators were wounded in violent clashes that broke out during a demonstration in Sainte-Soline against the deployment of new water storage infrastructure for agricultural irrigation. Elsewhere, police intervened in demonstrations in Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, arresting activists who blockaded buildings and roads and staged hand-gluing stunts and sit-ins. Further demonstration activity related to climate and environmental issues was recorded in Switzerland, Germany, and Spain., Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity gatherings across Europe last week for a seventh consecutive week. Rallies in support of ongoing protests and women’s rights in Iran were recorded in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, San Marino, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, three unknown individuals with covered faces attacked the participants of a pro-democracy vigil outside the Iranian embassy. The assailants tore banners and flags from a vehicle parked in front of the building and attacked the occupants inside., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests held in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Moldova, the** Netherlands**, Spain, and the United Kingdom., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the latest four weeks of data released by ACLED.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",10 Nov 2022,"Introduction, Ukraine has the largest percentage of older people affected by conflict in a single country in the world with approximately one quarter of the population in Ukraine being over 60 years old at the beginning of 2022. Eastern Ukraine has a particularly high proportion of older people as many of the working age population left during the previous eight years of conflict., Following the escalation of the conflict in late February, millions of Ukrainians fled their homes, with the number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) reaching close to three million by early May. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reported that 57% of displaced households had an older person as a member. However, many older people were also unable or unwilling to leave their homes., An assessment of older people in Donetsk and Luhansk during early March found that 99% of them did not want to be evacuated from their homes. International press such as the Guardian highlighted the conditions faced by many older persons who stayed behind. Several factors reduce the ability or willingness of older people to flee their homes in conflict-affected areas, including physical capacity/mobility issues, the risk of illnesses during long journeys, the reduced access to medication during journeys, the lack of finances to travel and the strong sense of belonging to their home and community., The more recent mandatory evacuations led by the government has enabled many older people to escape from cities heavily impacted by the armed conflict. Older IDPs now represent almost 20% of the displaced population.
However, the largest IDP populations now reside in Eastern Ukraine, areas closer to, and more impacted by the armed conflict than the western areas of Ukraine where the majority of IDPs fled during the early months of the current crisis (IOM 06/10/2022, OCHA 07/09/2022, Health Cluster 01/08/2022, Dorcas Aid International 28/06/2022, HelpAge 06/06/2022, HelpAge 31/05/2022, IOM 09/05/2022, HelpAge 13/04/2022, MSF 11/03/2022, HelpAge 04/03/2022)., The analysis contained in this report does not cover current response efforts as these are not tracked by DFS (avoiding duplication with OCHA situation reports). Local Government, emergency services and local volunteer collectives sustain much of the response efforts in conflict affected areas, and certainly support to at risk households is taking place, but it appears less humanitarian aid is getting to the villages or to the raions 1 outside the big cities (ACAPS 07/10/2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-analysis-brief-humanitarian-conditions-older-people-conflict-affected-ukraine-07-november-2022
"""Like a Prison Convoy”: Russia’s Unlawful Transfer of Civilians in Ukraine and Abuses During ‘Filtration’ [EN/RU]",Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,10 Nov 2022,"Ukraine: Russia’s unlawful transfer of civilians a war crime and likely a crime against humanity – new report, Russian authorities forcibly transferred and deported civilians from occupied areas of Ukraine in what amounted to war crimes and likely crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said in a new report published today., The report, “Like a Prison Convoy”: Russia’s Unlawful Transfer of Civilians in Ukraine and Abuses During ‘Filtration’, details how Russian and Russian-controlled forces forcibly transferred civilians from occupied Ukraine further into Russian-controlled areas or into Russia. Children have been separated from their families during the process, in violation of international humanitarian law., Civilians told Amnesty International how they were forced through abusive screening processes – known as ‘filtration’ – which sometimes resulted in arbitrary detention, torture, and other ill-treatment., “Separating children from their families and forcing people hundreds of kilometres from their homes are further proof of the severe suffering Russia’s invasion has inflicted on Ukraine’s civilians,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “Since the start of their war of aggression against Ukraine, itself an international crime, Russian forces have indiscriminately attacked and unlawfully killed civilians, destroyed countless lives, and torn families apart. No one has been spared, not even children., “Russia’s deplorable tactic of forcible transfer and deportation is a war crime. Amnesty International believes this must be investigated as a crime against humanity., “All those forcibly transferred and still unlawfully detained must be allowed to leave, and everyone responsible for committing these crimes must be held accountable. Children in Russian custody must be reunited with their families, and their return to Ukrainian government-controlled areas must be facilitated.”, Amnesty International documented cases in which members of specific groups – including children, older people and people with disabilities – were forcibly transferred to other Russian-occupied areas or unlawfully deported to Russia. In one case, a woman was separated from her 11-year-old son during filtration, detained, and not reunited with him, in clear violation of international humanitarian law., People detained during filtration told Amnesty International they had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including being beaten, electroshocked and threatened with execution. Others had been denied food and water, with many held in dangerous and overcrowded conditions., Amnesty International interviewed 88 people from Ukraine. The majority were civilians from Mariupol, as well as civilians from the Kharkiv, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Most, especially those from Mariupol, described coercive conditions that meant that they had no meaningful choice but to go to Russia or other Russian-occupied areas., Amnesty International considers Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, including the so-called ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ (DNR) in the Russian-controlled part of Donetsk Region, to be illegal., Forcible transfer from Mariupol, In early March 2022, the southeastern city of Mariupol was completely surrounded by Russian forces, making evacuations impossible. The city was subjected to near-constant bombardment, and civilians lacked access to running water, heat or electricity., Thousands of people were able to evacuate the city towards Ukrainian government-held areas in mid-March, but as Russia gradually occupied the city, it forcibly transferred some civilians in neighbourhoods under its control, cutting them off from other escape routes. Civilians said they felt coerced to go on ‘evacuation’ buses to the DNR., Milena, 33, told Amnesty International her experience while trying to flee Mariupol: “We started to ask questions about evacuation, where it is possible to go… I was told [by a Russian soldier] that it was only possible to go to the DNR or to Russia. Another girl asked about other possibilities [to evacuate], for instance to Ukraine… The answer came straight away, the soldier interrupted and said, ‘If you don’t go to the DNR or the Russian Federation, you will stay here forever’.”, Milena’s husband, a former marine with the Ukrainian military, was detained soon afterwards while crossing the border into Russia, and has not yet been released., Forcible transfer of children and other at-risk groups, The laws of armed conflict prohibit the individual or mass forcible transfer of protected persons, including civilians, from occupied territory. In several cases, children fleeing without parents or other guardians towards Ukrainian-held territory were stopped at Russian military checkpoints, and transferred into the custody of Russian-controlled authorities in Donetsk., As mentioned, an 11-year-old boy was separated from his mother during filtration, which violates international humanitarian law. The boy and his mother were captured and detained from the Illich Steel and Iron Works in Mariupol in mid-April by Russian forces., He told Amnesty International: “They took my mom to another tent. She was being questioned… They told me I was going to be taken away from my mom… I was shocked… They didn’t say anything about where my mom was going… I have not heard from her since.”, The report also details the forcible transfer to Donetsk of all 92 residents of a state institution for older people and people with disabilities in Mariupol. Amnesty International documented several cases in which older people from Ukraine appeared to have been placed in an institution in Russia or Russian-occupied areas after fleeing their homes. This practice violates the person’s rights, and makes it difficult for them to leave Russia or to reunite with family members in Ukraine or elsewhere., Once in Russia, several people said that they felt pressured into applying for Russian citizenship, or said their movements were restricted. The process of obtaining Russian citizenship has been simplified for children who are alleged to be either orphans or without parental care, and for some people with disabilities. This was meant to facilitate the adoption of these children by Russian families, in violation of international law., These actions indicate a deliberate Russian policy related to its deportation from Ukraine to Russia of civilians, including children, suggesting that in addition to the war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer, Russia has likely committed the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer., Abusive screening processes, detention, and torture, Civilians from Ukraine who fled or were transferred to Russian-occupied areas or to Russia were usually forced through an abusive screening process when entering the DNR, when crossing the border into Russia, and also when leaving Russia for a third country. This process violates their rights to privacy and physical integrity., At filtration points, officials took photographs of people, collected their fingerprints, searched people’s phones, forced some men to strip to their waists, and interrogated people at length., Amnesty International documented seven cases where people suffered torture and other ill-treatment during detention. One case involved a 31-year-old woman, another a 17-year-old boy, and five were men in their 20s or 30s., Vitalii, 31, was detained when he tried to leave Mariupol on an evacuation bus on 28 April. After Russian soldiers declared there was an issue with his documentation, he was forced onto a bus with several other men. He was driven to Dokuchaevsk, a town close to Donetsk, and placed in a cell with 15 men, before being taken for interrogation., He told Amnesty International: “They bound my hands with tape and put a bag over my head and put tape around my neck… Then they said, ‘Tell us everything… Tell us where you serve, which base?’… [When I said I wasn’t a soldier] they started beating me in the kidneys very hard… I was on my knees, they were mostly kicking me. When they took me back to the garage, they said, ‘Every day, we will do this to you’.”, Amnesty International documented other cases that amount to enforced disappearances under international human rights law, and to the war crimes of unlawful confinement, torture and inhuman treatment., Hussein, a 20-year-old student from Azerbaijan, was detained while fleeing Mariupol for Zaporizhzhia in mid-March, and held for almost a month. He was accused of being a member of the Ukrainian military, and beaten while being interrogated., Hussein told Amnesty International: “One of the soldiers said, ‘He won’t talk like this, bring the electric shocker’… There were two wires, they put them around my big toes and started shocking me repeatedly… They beat me repeatedly… I lost consciousness. They poured a bucket of water on me, and I woke up again. I couldn’t take it anymore, I just said, ‘Yes, I’m a soldier’. They continued beating me, I fell off the chair and they pulled me back up. There was blood coming out of my feet.”, Hussein was threatened with execution, beaten and electroshocked every day, until just a few days before his release on 12 April., “Russia and Russian-controlled forces must immediately stop their violent abuses against detainees,” said Agnès Callamard., “The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and other relevant authorities must investigate these abhorrent crimes, including those against victims from at-risk groups. All those responsible for deportation and forcible transfer, as well as torture and other crimes under international law committed during filtration, must face justice.”, Methodology, Amnesty International interviewed 88 women, men and children from Ukraine for the report. At the time of the interviews, all but one were in Ukrainian government-controlled areas or were in a safe third country in Europe. One person remained in a Russian-occupied area., Accountability for war crimes, Amnesty International has been documenting war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine since the conflict began. All of Amnesty International’s outputs are available here., Amnesty International has repeatedly called for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for the aggression against Ukraine and for violations to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/prison-convoy-russias-unlawful-transfer-civilians-ukraine-and-abuses-during-filtration-enru

Our colleagues say they received reports of at least five incidents in the first two days of November alone, all in the Kharkiv region, compared to four similar cases in the second half of October. Since the beginning of the war, hundreds of civilians have been killed, injured or maimed due to accidents involving explosive ordnance. Yesterday, for example, two people were killed and two others injured while doing repair work on a road in Chuhuivskyi District, in the part of the Kharkiv region recently retaken by Ukraine., Accidents involving farmers that are trying to get back to their land — until recently under Russian control — are becoming increasingly common, our colleagues say. Aid organizations are supporting authorities to increase awareness about the risk of mines in Ukraine, which was already one of the world’s most mine-contaminated countries even before February. Together, the UN and our partners have reached more than 3 million people with critical information about the risk of mines, in addition to demining and services to support survivors. Authorities tell us that more than 150,000 explosive devices have already been removed and destroyed since March 2022, but there are millions more. Clearing landmines in Ukraine could take decades, they say., Central African Republic, From the Central African Republic now, our peacekeeping colleagues tell us they are continuing to support the national authorities in preventing and reducing violence at the community level. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) says that preparations for the next phase of the programme to reduce violence at the community level are under way. The Mission has registered more than half of the 4,300 people — including 1,200 women — who will take part in it. This programme offers people, including young people, an alternative to violence through vocational training, income-generating activities, and voluntary surrender of weapons. Separately, the Mission is also helping to organize the Bangui Court of Appeal’s second criminal session of the year. Overall, the security situation in the country has remained relatively calm in the past few days, though tense in certain parts of the country. UN peacekeepers are patrolling to protect the population and to secure fragile areas, with nearly 1,700 patrols carried out over the past week, including some jointly done with the Central African armed forces.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/daily-press-briefing-office-spokesperson-secretary-general-9-november-2022-ukraine-central-african-republic

As of today, more than 400,000 Ukrainians have sought shelter in the province, fleeing from violence in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine following the Russian invasion and full-scale war. At least 6.2 million people remain internally displaced within Ukraine, living far from their homes., To help the community of Pidhorodne host the new arrivals, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the financial support of the European Union, and in partnership with Pidhorodne City Council, renovated a school building at Lyceum No. 3 so that it could provide temporary shelter for people who had to escape from Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Since the start of the full-fledged war, the lyceum, with the capacity to accommodate 400 people at a time, has hosted over 2,000 IDPs., The renovations included a partial repair of the food block premises and installation of kitchen equipment; repair of bathrooms and installation of sanitary appliances; repair of shower rooms and hot water supply, installation of a boiler for heating water; equipping a laundry room with a washing machine and dryer; and partial replacement of electrical wiring. The city council provided furniture, including beds, desks and tables., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine said the European Union is working on all fronts to support Ukraine with emergency assistance to respond to the Russian war. “I am very pleased that in cooperation with UNDP and Pidhorodne City Council we are contributing to improving basic living conditions for people escaping the full-scale Russian aggression,” he said. “Everyone deserves to have access to a safe haven.”, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Christophoros Politis said UNDP and the international community are working hard to ensure that everyone who needs a safe place to live can find it. “The shelters must provide more than just a roof over people’s heads,” he said. “They should also provide opportunities for childcare, contain health clinics and allow people to live with dignity.”, Andriy Horb, Pidhorodne city mayor, thanked the partners: “We appreciate very much any help we can get in providing displaced people with everything they need: food, clothing, and basic necessities. Also, thanks to the support of our partners, we've been able to create proper sanitary conditions for IDPs. But what's most important is that people now can stay in safe temporary shelters.”, When the displaced are able to return home, the school will return to its original purpose. More than 700 students, 74 teachers and administrators will benefit from the new facilities. Currently, many students across Ukraine attend classes online., Background: Renovation of a temporary shelter for displaced people in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is supported by the EU funding for technical assistance (TA) as part of the EIB’s Ukraine Early Recovery Programme. TA was repurposed to meet the emergency needs of the people of Ukraine after the start of the full-scale war in February 2022. Ukraine Early Recovery Programme is a EUR 200 million multi-sectoral framework loan from the European Investment Bank to local authorities to rehabilitate social infrastructure and improve living conditions for internally displaced persons and their host communities in nine oblasts of Ukraine: the Ukrainian government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Odesa, Kherson, and Kyiv oblasts., Media enquiries, Yuliia Samus, Head of Communications at UNDP Ukraine; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-and-eu-renovate-temporary-shelter-displaced-people-dnipropetrovsk-oblast
Commission proposes stable and predictable support package for Ukraine for 2023 of up to €18 billion,News and Press Release,EC,Recovery and Reconstruction,9 Nov 2022,"Following the European Council meeting of 20-21 October 2022, the Commission has today proposed an unprecedented support package for Ukraine of up to €18 billion for 2023. This will come in the form of highly concessional loans, disbursed in regular instalments as of 2023., This stable, regular and predictable financial assistance – averaging €1.5 billion per month – will help cover a significant part of Ukraine's short-term funding needs for 2023, which the Ukrainian authorities and the International Monetary Fund estimate at €3 to €4 billion per month. The support put forward by the EU would need to be matched by similar efforts by other major donors in order to cover all of Ukraine's funding needs for 2023., Thanks to this package, Ukraine will be able to keep on paying wages and pensions and maintain essential public services running, such as hospitals, schools, and housing for relocated people. It will also allow Ukraine to ensure macroeconomic stability, and restore critical infrastructure destroyed by Russia in its war of aggression, such as energy infrastructure, water systems, transport networks, roads and bridges., Support under the instrument will be accompanied by reforms, to further enhance the rule of law, good governance, anti-fraud and anti-corruption measures in Ukraine. Therefore, while taking into account the evolution on the ground, financial support will be framed by policy conditions, geared towards strengthening Ukraine's institutions and preparing the ground for a successful reconstruction effort, as well as supporting Ukraine on its European path., How will this package work?, Building on previous Macro-Financial Assistance packages, this Macro-Financial Assistance+ (MFA+) instrument offers high flexibility and very favourable terms for Ukraine, catering to the country's current situation and ensuring swift action to support the Ukrainian people., The funds will be provided through highly concessional loans, to be repaid in the course of maximum 35 years, starting in 2033. In a further expression of solidarity, the EU also proposes to cover Ukraine's interest rate costs, through additional targeted payments by Member States into the EU budget. EU Member States and third countries will also be able to add more funds to the instrument, to be used as grants, should they wish to do so. The funds will then be channelled through the EU budget, allowing Ukraine to receive the support in a coordinated manner., The MFA+ instrument will be accompanied by reforms to help Ukraine advance on its path to becoming a member of the EU. This means that the Ukrainian government will have to complement the financial support with sectoral and institutional reforms, including anti-corruption and judicial reforms, respect of the rule of law, good governance, and modernisation of the national and local institutions. We will check that these reforms have been effectively put in place when paying out the instalments., How will the package be financed?, To secure the funds for the loans, the Commission proposes to borrow on capital markets using the diversified funding strategy. This would enable the Commission to use the full portfolio of funding instruments to secure market funding on the most advantageous terms, when these are needed., To guarantee this borrowing for Ukraine, the Commission proposes to use the headroom of the 2021-2027 EU budget in a targeted manner for Ukraine, limited in time. The headroom is the difference between the own resources ceiling (i.e. the maximum amount of resources that the Commission can ask Member States to contribute in a given year) and the funds that it actually needs to cover the expenses foreseen by the budget. The headroom, which is already used to guarantee the borrowing for financial assistance programmes to Member States, will guarantee bond investors that the amounts lent to the EU to finance Ukrainian loans borrowing will be repaid under all circumstances., Next steps, To ensure a smooth delivery of the package, the Commission is putting forward three legislative proposals. These will need approval by the European Parliament and EU Member States in the Council before entering into force., As always, the Commission will be working hand in hand with all EU institutions concerned for a swift adoption., Background, Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine has inflicted horrific human pain and mass-scale destruction of towns and communities. The European Union and its Member States have shown unwavering solidarity with people fleeing the war. The Union has immediately mobilised support to the Ukrainian government to keep its essential functions going, on top of the emergency and humanitarian assistance, and military aid provided to Ukraine., Since the start of the war, Team Europe has mobilised €19.7 billion to support Ukraine, a large part of which comes in the form of macro-financial assistance (MFA). We have already disbursed €4.2 billion in MFA and will disburse further €2.5 billion by the end of the month as second disbursement of EUR 5 billion emergency MFA. Another €620 million in grants as budget support has also been disbursed to help Ukraine cover urgent needs on the ground., In addition, Member States have shown unprecedented solidarity by welcoming millions of people fleeing the war in Ukraine. To support these efforts, the EU has activated the Temporary Protection Directive, granting access to jobs, housing, education and healthcare across the EU to over 4 million people fleeing the war., The Commission is also coordinating its largest ever operation under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism for a wide array of support measures for Ukrainian citizens, including in the health, energy, food and agriculture sectors, and providing shelters, machinery as well as vital medical and energy equipment and evacuations., Furthermore, the Commission, together with the Member States and the Energy Community, has been providing support for the Ukrainian energy system since this spring, and stepped up its efforts following the targeted shelling of vital energy infrastructure. The EU's Civil Protection Mechanism has facilitated the shipment of generators, transformers and cables, among others. Under the Ukraine Energy Support Fund established by the Energy Community at the request of the European Commission, €25.5 million have been made available to cover the immediate needs in the energy sector. The Commission also delivered more than €40 million worth Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear threat countermeasures and equipment from the EU reserves and allocated €13 million for the restoration of laboratories damaged by the Russian occupiers at Chornobyl., To support Ukraine, the Commission has also put forward measures to facilitate trade, notably the suspension of import duties on Ukrainian exports, and to establish solidarity lanes to help Ukraine export agricultural goods., In addition, military assistance measures amounting to €3.1 billion have been provided under the European Peace Facility. This will be used to reimburse Member States for their in-kind military support to Ukraine., The EU's efforts to support Ukraine come on top of the comprehensive set of actions put forward to tackle the dramatic consequences of Russia's war of aggression. The invasion has led to the ramping up of energy prices and of the overall cost of living for citizens in the EU. In this context, both the EU and Member States have been taking concrete measures to support businesses and households, especially vulnerable ones, in their ability to pay their energy bills and to ensure access to energy supplies., For More Information, Questions and Answers: Commission proposes a support package of up to €18 billion for Ukraine for 2023, Communication of 18 May 2022 on Ukraine relief and reconstruction, Macro-Financial Assistance to Ukraine, EU Delegation to Ukraine, Ukraine: International Expert Conference hosted by the Commission and G7 Presidency reaffirms unwavering commitment to support Ukraine's recovery, European Council conclusions, 20-21 October 2022, Quote(s), We are presenting this new financial package for Ukraine at a time of acute needs for the country, as Russia's relentless attacks continue to batter key infrastructure. Our financial assistance must be stable, structured and predictable. This is why we are proposing an €18 billion package for 2023 consisting of long-term loans on highly favourable terms. This emergency funding will help cover the country's urgent financial needs. There is no time to lose, so we hope to secure final approval with co-legislators still this year so that we can make the first disbursement in January. We also will continue to work closely with international partners and institutions to coordinate all our financing efforts.
-Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, The EU continues to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. Today, we propose an 18 billion euros support package for 2023. This will ensure the Ukrainian state can keep on functioning, citizens can receive essential public services, and critical infrastructure destroyed by Russia can be rebuilt. The package comes top of all existing EU support – welcoming over 4 million refugees, humanitarian aid, civil protection, trade facilitation, and military assistance. We will ensure Ukraine emerges from this war as a prosperous country, on the path to European integration. We will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.
-President Ursula von der Leyen, With this package of proposals, the EU can use its financial standing in capital markets to deliver substantial financial support to Ukraine in a structured and predictable format. The diversified funding strategy is a winning formula and the template for all future EU issuance programmes.
-Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Budget and Administration, The European Commission has stood by Ukraine since the beginning of Russia's brutal war of aggression. We will remain unwavering in our solidarity come what may. Today we are proposing to provide up to €18 billion in highly concessional loans to support Ukraine through what will be another immensely challenging year. This financing will help Ukraine to keep funding essential services, as well as repairing critical infrastructure and beginning the task of reconstruction. And may every euro provided to Ukraine mark another step along its road to EU membership.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Nov 2022,"Press Release For Immediate Release, Tuesday, November 8, 2022, The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing an additional $25 million to support vulnerable people in Ukraine during the harsh winter. Ongoing attacks by Russian forces on critical infrastructure and housing in Ukraine have undermined the civilian population’s ability to survive cold winter temperatures, which are expected to increase humanitarian needs, particularly among those living in damaged housing or who have fled due to conflict., U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the announcement today during a visit to a collective center in Irpin, where conflict-affected internally displaced persons, including older persons and other vulnerable groups, are sheltering., With these new funds, the United States will expand upon its existing winterization planning and response efforts, scaling up assistance to nearly 75,000 of the most affected households, primarily in eastern Ukraine where Putin’s unprovoked invasion has decimated infrastructure and essential services. USAID partner the International Organization for Migration will surge additional humanitarian assistance to help vulnerable Ukrainians survive the winter, including multi-purpose cash assistance, shelter support, and water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance, with more assistance on the way in coming months., This additional support follows USAID Administrator Samantha Power’s announcement of a $55 million investment in Ukraine’s heating infrastructure in Kyiv during her visit in early October, as well as $216 million in winterization-specific humanitarian assistance, bringing USAID’s total contribution to winterization assistance to date to approximately $271 million. USAID and our humanitarian partners continue to rapidly scale up winterization assistance to at-risk populations in Ukraine, including the provision of winter-specific household items, thermal blankets, and warm clothing, as well as key heating appliances and fuel supplies to address the immediate and long-term needs of vulnerable households., As one of the largest humanitarian donors to Ukraine, the United States has supported humanitarian partners in the country since 2014. During Fiscal Year 2022, the United States provided more than $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to support conflict-affected people inside Ukraine and those fleeing to neighboring countries, including more than $1 billion from USAID.

Through this assessment of new and nuanced security threats exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, UNICRI launched this research to assist all key stakeholders involved in justice, crime prevention, and security-related matters in the region., The multiple and evolving challenges outlined in this report call for urgent common action. Regional cooperation is key as the challenges are common across the region. As transnational crime groups are increasingly outpacing national criminal justice responses, border law enforcement agencies need to improve cooperation and communication across borders and in the region to share real-time information and intelligence on criminal activities and trafficking routes., UNICRI will continue to leverage its expertise with the aim of advancing knowledge and capacities to tackle new crimes and security-related trends and to tailor appropriate interventions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-and-its-impact-organized-crime-and-security-november-2022
Challenging winter approaches Ukraine. The PCPM foundation delivers indispensable aid along with the CARE organization,News and Press Release,PCPM,Shelter and Non-Food Items,8 Nov 2022,"The Polish Center for International Aid and CARE recently delivered financial aid to 6,000 people and made 11 transports with materials to internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the eastern part of the country. Thanks to economic resource distribution, we were able to finance the next set of aid, which will help them survive the upcoming winter., ‘At the end of October, together with 500 families in the most critical situation (a large family without living resources, disabled people, and the elderly), we signed 3-month financial aid agreements. We delivered adult diapers for 51 elderlies with walking difficulties. The next 500 families will receive blankets and thermal comforters. The aid is given within the framework of the ‘winter assistance’ program, financed from financial resources from CARE’s assistance program’ – said Anna Radecka., ‘The help is significant because we already know there will be heating limitations, and if the attacks will be more frequent, heater-system shutdown in Ukraine is likely. In a scenario where the power infrastructure gets damaged, we will not be able to plug in the portable air heater fan’ – explains Anna Radecka from PCPM., The war gradually contributes to the damage to Ukraine’s strategic infrastructure. The Russian attacks on heat and power plants have increased in the last month, and continuously given damage to this kind of infrastructure could call into question the deliveries of such services., It’s estimated that Kyiv’s households’ heating systems connected to the heating plant will be limited. The temperature could go down to approx. -10 or -12 degrees Celsius. From Monday (October 17th, 2022), the PCPM and the CARE organization are providing additional assistance in a CARE-funded multi-segmented help program., In Kyiv, Darnytskyi, and Dnipro regions, you can count IDPs from the Russian-occupied territories (or war-zone territory) in dozens of thousands., The actions in Kyiv constitute additional assistance within a broader program. The first and most significant part is financial assistance to help the most in-need families get 'back on their feet. They were selected accordingly to the guidelines of the Ukrainian Cash Working Group, coordinated by the UN. These include large families without means, single mothers with children, seniors over 65, or families where there are people with disabilities or chronic illnesses., Each aid package is for several months, and in the first phase of implementation, we distributed them from June to July 2022. Such assistance has already gone to 6,500 people in more than 2,900 families., A significant component of the project is material assistance to people forced to leave their homes, centered around food and hygiene products. In total, we organized 11 shipments, the last of which went to Lutsk in western Ukraine, which we wrote about HERE. In addition to donations, we organized a holiday camp for displaced children in Krasnobrod from September 16 to 26., Not only did our PCPM staff in Ukraine participate in the material aid activities, but above local volunteers and authorities. Thanks to their help, we c reach the right people with donations and be sure that those are disposed impartially., We publish up-to-date information about our actions on Twitter., Instagram – @fundacjapcpm, Facebook – Polish Center for International Aid(PCPM)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/challenging-winter-approaches-ukraine-pcpm-foundation-delivers-indispensable-aid-along-care-organization
"Ukraine: Cold Spot Risk Assessment Winterization 2022/23, Factsheet - November 2022",Assessment,REACH,Shelter and Non-Food Items,7 Nov 2022,"Introduction, In their flash update from 17th October 2022, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) highlighted the ongoing winterization efforts to help at least 2.4 million Ukrainians prepare for the upcoming cold conditions. Overall capacity to cope with cold temperatures is being further impaired by ongoing destruction and failure of infrastructures (e.g., electricity, water, heating) (UNOCHA 2022). The combination of more severe climatic conditions and considerable damage to infrastructure and private houses caused by hostilities can potentially further aggravate vulnerabilities of the affected population exposed to low winter temperatures., Conflict escalation and ongoing hostilities has caused significant damage to public utilities, gas and energy infrastructure in most oblasts putting the population at risk of losing access to heating due to potential war-related damage to centralized heating systems or energy infrastructure. In addition, hostilities lead to the inability to repair damage, thus further impacting functionality of these systems (REACH 2022a). Those impacts have been putting a growing number of people at risk of having insufficient heating or insulation to cope with cold temperatures. The approaching winter conditions are particularly concerning for IDPs living in collective centers and people living in damaged homes or homes needing renovation, especially in rural areas (ACAPS 2022). Winterization needs therefore include but are not limited to repairing damaged buildings (e.g., broken windows) and bomb shelters, restoring infrastructures, providing cash assistance and supporting preparations for an influx of new IDPs. 6.2 million Ukrainian are already internally displaced and some oblasts expect that many more could arrive before winter. This expected wave of displacement before the start of the winter could increase the impacts of winter-related hazards on vulnerable people and amplify the severity of humanitarian needs (UNOCHA 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cold-spot-risk-assessment-winterization-202223-factsheet-november-2022

It may be, for example, that an international humanitarian organization is not able to effectively arrange work on the repair of houses but is good at implementing cash support programs. Then it is better to direct efforts to cash support programs. It is better to pay people real money than to drown in endless needs assessments. A good example is cash support projects in the de-occupied territories. In these areas Ukrposhta distributes UAH 1200 from the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and UAH 2200 from the International Organization for Migration,” said Iryna Vereshchuk., She also gave an example of effective cooperation between the Ministry of Reintegration and the UN World Food Program and informed that in the coming days 40 tons of food support for IDPs with limited mobility will be delivered to Ivano-Frankivsk Region from this organization., The Deputy Prime Minister called on the representatives of international organizations to simplify their internal approval procedures since the speed of humanitarian response often does not meet the challenges., “If we embark on a project together and say “yes” to each other, then everything has to be done on time,” summed up Iryna Vereshchuk.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iryna-vereshchuk-message-international-humanitarian-organizations-simplify-procedures-and-keep-focus-key-things

Briefing Note: Conflict-Related Environmental Damage in Ukraine,News and Press Release,PAX,Climate Change and Environment,7 Nov 2022,"Armed conflicts continue to have devastating direct and reverberating effects, with destructive impacts on ecosystems and civilian lives and livelihoods. Since February 2022, Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine has raised serious concerns about damage to the environment, with both immediate and long-term consequences to civilians and the ecosystems they depend on. The increasing risks posed by military actions to civilians and their environment demonstrate the need for a more coherent, coordinated UN-system-wide approach through the establishment of an Environment, Peace and Security (EPS) agenda to improve international prevention, mitigation, and response efforts to environmental damage in conflicts, such as in Ukraine and beyond. Such an EPS agenda must prioritize: (1) preventing and minimizing the environmental and derived humanitarian consequences of conflicts; (2) identifying, monitoring and responding to environmental consequences; and (3) the inclusion of the environment as an essential component of sustainable peacebuilding programs. An EPS agenda would also complement and strengthen existing normative agendas discussed at the UN Security Council (UNSC), such as the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict, Sustaining Peace, and Women, Peace and Security agendas, among others. The UNSC has increasingly recognized the important links between the environment-climate-conflict nexus in the last decade, including in an increasing number of Council briefings and open debates, as well as through inclusion in a growing number of UN field mission mandates., The UNSC should also strategically integrate and account for conflict-related environmental degradation in its briefings and consultations concerning the situation in Ukraine, exploring linkages between the environment and international peace and security, as well as more holistic approaches to protecting civilians in conflict and upholding international humanitarian and human rights law. A system-wide EPS agenda could be utilized as a foundation from which the international community could formulate a coherent and actionable response to conflict-related environmental degradation in Ukraine, coordinating with various UN agencies currently working on environmental issues within their own respective mandates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/briefing-note-conflict-related-environmental-damage-ukraine

The report summarises the PDM results for the distribution of cash in March-June 2022. Within the reporting period 153,641 households (372,525 persons of concern (PoC) have been reached with MPCA., The purpose of this PDM Survey is to assess the appropriateness, effectiveness and coverage of the cash assistance distributed as well as capture feedback from cash assistance beneficiaries. Data collection for this assessment was carried out by R2P in June 2022, employing a quantitative methodology. Telephone interviews were conducted with randomly selected UNHCR MPCA beneficiaries. The sample size was calculated using confidence level of 95 percent and 5 significance level. To account for non-response and for errors in data collection calculated sample size was increased by 10 percent. As such, a total of 417 MPCA beneficiary households were interviewed about their use of cash, the impact of cash assistance, and on potential non-compliance issues they may have faced during the process of cash collection., KEY FINDINGS, ● A sizeable proportion of the respondents (86 percent) reported that MPCA enabled them to cover all or most of their priority needs., ● Most of the interviewed beneficiaries (95 percent) reported that the cash assistance reduced the financial burden on their households, reduced their feeling of stress (91 percent), and improved their living conditions (98 percent)., ● Most respondents (93 percent) reported spending cash assistance on food, 52 percent reported spending on rent, and 47 percent spent on hygiene items., ● Most beneficiaries (94 percent) were able to find the needed items on the market and with the required quality (97 percent). However, 61 percent reported increased prices of purchased items (mainly with reference to food and rent)., ● A total of 61 percent of beneficiaries needed to resort to one or more harmful coping strategies in the four weeks preceding the interview to cover their most pressing needs. The most frequently adopted strategy was reducing expenditure on hygiene items, water, baby items, health, or education to meet household food needs (adopted by 47 percent of the respondents)., ● Most beneficiaries (97 percent) did not need any help to withdraw or spend the cash assistance. Among those who needed help the main cited reasons were limited mobility and difficulties with reading instructions due to disabilities, medical conditions, or old age., ● Almost all (except one person) felt physically safe at all times while withdrawing, holding, and spending cash assistance., ● Among the interviewed beneficiaries, 72 percent could identify at least one local channel for reporting complaints or feedback on UNHCR cash assistance., ● Over 30 percent of PoC households are on a pathway to sustainable solutions: 12 percent of the respondents now have items (productive/livelihood assets) to earn a living and 20 percent have access to micro-credit. Also, 18 percent of households who received money via post service now have a bank account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/multi-purpose-cash-assistance-2022-post-distribution-monitoring-report

Update 124 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (5 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,5 Nov 2022,"External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) two days after it lost all access to off-site electricity in the latest incident highlighting the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at Europe’s largest such facility, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., Both the ZNPP’s external power lines, a 750 kilovolt (kV) line and a 330 kV back-up line used for electricity supplies from the grid, were repaired, and reconnection started on Friday afternoon. At around 22:00 the 750 kV power supply to all six units of the ZNPP had been re-established, and the eight operating emergency diesel generators turned off and put into standby mode, Director General Grossi said, citing information he had received from the team of IAEA experts present at the plant., The 750 kV line is therefore now once again providing the electricity the ZNPP’s six reactors need for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions, including unit 4 which had earlier lost its connection to the 750 kV line in a landmine explosion late last month. The 330 kV external power line to the nearby thermal power plant switchyard is also available to provide back-up power to ZNPP., This 750 kV line was disconnected from the entire ZNPP site following shelling late on Wednesday and the 330 kV line was also lost just a few hours later, with both sustaining physical damage around 50-60 kilometres from the plant in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The ZNPP’s emergency diesel generators automatically started generating back-up power until external power was restored. At that time, the plant had fuel for around 15 days of diesel generator operations. The IAEA team has been informed that supplies of diesel fuel continue to be delivered to the site, and today plant staff plan to refill the tanks of all the diesel generators., There is no change in the operational status of all units. Units 5 and 6 are in semi-hot shutdown providing steam to the site and arrangements are being made to further heat-up both units to a hot shutdown state. The other four units remain in cold shutdown., The ZNPP had already lost external power several times during the current conflict in Ukraine, forcing it to rely on the diesel generators until off-site electricity became available again., “The repeated power outages all too clearly demonstrate the extremely serious nuclear safety and security situation this major nuclear power plant is facing. So far, the brave staff of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant have always managed to maintain the safe operation of the six units. But it can’t go on like this. I have repeatedly called for the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant to prevent a nuclear accident. We can’t afford to lose any more time. We must act before it is too late,” Director General Grossi said., In recent weeks, Director General Grossi has engaged in high-level talks with both Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-124-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-5-nov-2022
ACTED in Ukraine: repairing windows before winter arrives,News and Press Release,ACTED,Recovery and Reconstruction,4 Nov 2022,"As critical infrastructure facilities, residential buildings, schools, hospitals are increasingly affected by air strikes in Ukraine every week, more and more residents from Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Chernihiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions continue to evacuate to safer cities like Bukovyna. Local authorities predict a new wave of Internally Displaced Persons for the winter and appeal to international humanitarian organizations for help., The crucial role of collective centers in Ukraine, Currently, 88 collective centers have been set up in Bukovyna, Chernivtsi oblast, accommodating 5258 Internally Displaced Persons in regional and municipal institutions and 5676 in private ones., Ms. Raisa lives in one of the collective centers for internally displaced persons in Bukovyna, in the western part of Ukraine, near the border with Romania. She came here with her daughter and grandson, having evacuated from Mariupol in May this year. Their family is accommodated in one small room of the dormitory of the educational building, where a space is dedicated to accommodating internally displaced persons is located on a separate floor. The simple furnishing consists of three beds, a wardrobe and a table. But the most important piece of this new room is the brand-new intact window, installed with the assistance of ACTED., “During air strikes, windows are the first to suffer”, recalls Mrs. Raisa. From peaceful times, before February, Mrs Daisa recalls memories, pieces of her grandson’s childhood., Raisa V. seems to be reliving those moments, as she tries to describe the unique sound of glass shattering from the shockwave of explosions. “It is not necessarily the rocket fragments, but the glass fragments that cut into your body with force that can be dangerous,” warns Mrs. Raisa, as if this information was now etched in her mind forever. “We were taught by our neighbours not to close the window tightly, but when the rocket hit the house and pierced the wall, it no longer mattered whether the whole window was broken or not.”, With the assistance of ACTED, new windows and doors have been installed in 6 collective centers from Bukovyna, where more than 1500 people live., “A good window that does not let in the cold, from which you can see the peaceful sky, gives a sense of security,” says Valeriy from Zaporizhzhia, who found refuge in Bukovyna. “From such a window you notice the autumn landscape, calm down, and faith in tomorrow comes. Thank you ACTED“., Before the escalation of the conflict, it could have been considered an interior renovation, now that we are in wartime, it is merely a way to survive the difficult winter ahead. With disappointing forecasts of possible power cuts and lower heating temperatures in the premises, reliable windows that retain heat are an answer to the challenges of war., In the framework of the project “Emergency response in Ukraine”, implemented by Alliance2015 partners, ACTED installed 143 windows and 16 door metal-plastic blocks in Chernivtsi Oblast in September-October this year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acted-ukraine-repairing-windows-winter-arrives

As of today, close to 7.8 million refugees from Ukraine are present across Europe. Close to 4.5 million refugees from Ukraine have registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes., The security and humanitarian situation remains dire across Ukraine including the ten of Ukraine's 24 oblasts that were affected by the waves of attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure that started on 10 October. According to the authorities, up to 40 per cent of the Ukraine’s energy system has been destroyed, causing emergency blackouts and major disruptions in electricity supply in several regions., The UN Humanitarian Coordinator warned on 20 October that millions of Ukrainians are beyond the reach of humanitarians, and that assistance to newly accessible areas was also complicated due to landmines and explosive remnants., As of 30 October, OHCHR recorded 16,295 civilian casualties in the country including 6,430 killed and 9,865 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-34-4-november-2022

Ukraine: FAO reinforces its presence to optimize technical and humanitarian assistance [EN/RU],News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",4 Nov 2022,"New agreement with the Government of Ukraine aims to bolster support for farmers, Rome - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has reinforced its presence in Ukraine by signing an agreement with the Government to set up a Project Office that will facilitate and expand the provision of technical and humanitarian assistance to the country's most vulnerable communities, especially in rural areas., Ukraine joined FAO in 2003 and since 2015 the Organization has been operating in two strategic directions: emergency humanitarian response in conflict-affected oblasts and agricultural development across the whole country., ""Following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, FAO has scaled up its activities in the country to support agricultural production and food systems with the aim of protecting the food security of vulnerable households and communities across Ukraine,"" said Laurent Thomas, FAO Deputy Director-General and signatory to the agreement on behalf of FAO. ""This agreement will extend our cooperation in the country, increase Ukraine's agricultural capacity and protect the food security of the most vulnerable Ukrainians, leaving no one behind."", ""On behalf of the Ukrainian people and our producers, I would like to thank FAO for the support that has been provided since the beginning of the large-scale invasion by Russia. The production and export capacities of the Ukrainian agricultural sector are being restored and the lives of the people to whom FAO provides assistance are also improving. I am convinced that, with the opening of the Project Office, the cooperation between FAO and Ukraine, which has been going on for many years, will gain new dynamics,"" said Yulia Svyrydenko, First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister for Economic Development and Trade of Ukraine, and signatory to the agreement on behalf of the Government of Ukraine., Disrupted supply chains and rising prices, The impacts of the war in Ukraine have severely disrupted the country's agricultural production and food exports, jeopardizing both local and global food security., FAO's Humanitarian Response Update points to the growing evidence that food supply chain disruptions and increasing prices in conjunction with reduced incomes have significantly affected access to and the affordability of food resulting in growing dependence on food assistance. The prices of basic goods, including food, have increased significantly across the country, particularly in areas that have witnessed active fighting. More than half of the rural households surveyed by FAO reported that, over the past three months, food has accounted for over half of their total household expenditure., Major difficulties expected in the coming months in relation to agricultural production include low returns from the sale of products, access to fertilizers and pesticides, access to fuel and electricity with which to power agricultural and farm equipment, and access to animal health products such as veterinary drugs, animal feed and feed additives. Storage for harvested produce is also in critically short supply., FAO's ongoing support to Ukraine, ""FAO is actively supporting smallholders and rural families who play a vital role in local food value chains,"" noted Raimund Jehle, FAO Regional Programme Leader. ""Smallholder farmers are currently being supported with winter wheat seeds to enable them to sustain production levels for the 2023 harvesting season, as well as grain sleeves with which to ensure that harvests from this season are suitably stored and protected. FAO is also supporting rural households with animal feed, multipurpose cash assistance and vouchers with which to purchase other essential agricultural inputs and tools""., FAO's revised Rapid Response Plan (RRP) requires USD 115.4 million to assist almost one million people in rural Ukraine up to the end of 2022. FAO's response includes providing crop and livestock inputs along with cash to support the most affected smallholder farmers and livestock holders to meet seasonal deadlines. This support will enable households to produce vegetables, cereal crops, milk, meat and eggs to feed their families., To address the grain storage crisis, FAO has developed a Grain Storage Support Strategy (GSSS) requiring an additional $65 million. This extension to the RRP aims to deliver more than 4 million tonnes -- or 25 percent of the estimated overall need -- of grain storage capacity in Ukraine. The Strategy also includes the support of the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection by strengthening government capacity for food commodity testing and certifications necessary for export at border facilities., To date, FAO has raised almost $80 million against the combined total requirement of around $180 million under the RRP and GSSS. Additional resources are urgently needed to support vulnerable rural households, particularly in preparation for the approaching winter season.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fao-reinforces-its-presence-optimize-technical-and-humanitarian-assistance-enru
UNICEF and Ukraine’s First Lady unite experts to support children's mental health [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,31 Oct 2022,"Ukraine’s First Lady Olena Zelenska has taken part in a strategic session dedicated to the development of mental health and psychosocial support service models for children and adolescents in Ukraine., Mental health specialists, experts, representatives of ministries and departments, local governments, international and public organizations, and businesses joined the event, organized by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Ukraine. The strategic session was held in support of the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support, which was initiated by Zelenska., ""Thousands of Ukrainian children witness death, their lives are threatened, they face danger and fears, and they all unexpectedly become mature,” said Zelenska. “But they remain children and vulnerable. Our task is to protect both the physical and mental health of our children. We can't allow the burden of their experience to ruin their future. We should support them mentally and ensure as much assistance as possible.”, ""Protecting childhood is a key priority for UNICEF,” added Head of UNICEF Ukraine Murat Sahin. “Children and young people who are at home, at a playground or at school, often fear for their lives and run to shelters multiple times each day. Children who are exposed to trauma, separated from their daily routines, impacted by war and scared from constant air raid sirens need mental health support. What happens in childhood can last a lifetime. We are committed to scaling up the national efforts led by the First Lady and building the capacity of teachers, communities, social workers and frontline health workers so that people learn self-help techniques for mental health issues, seek quality and affordable psychological and psychosocial support, and are not ashamed or hesitant to do it."", Participants of the strategic sessions worked in groups, sharing ideas on ways to develop services to provide psychological support. For example, the groups explored optimal ways of providing help and support, ways of receiving services, and the role of family, school, community, psychologists, doctors and businesses in these processes. Various areas related to children were analyzed to create a comprehensive system of care for the mental health of the younger generation., The analytical team from the project office for the establishment of the National Program of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support will analyze all the ideas developed during the strategic session., Information The National Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Programme is an initiative of First Lady Olena Zelenska that aims to help Ukrainians overcome war-related stress and the consequences of experiencing traumatic events, as well as prevent the development of mental disorders. The development and implementation of the programme are coordinated by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, in cooperation with Ukrainian and foreign professionals. The initiative is implemented with the support of the World Health Organization., UNICEF continues to help Ukrainian children affected by the war. Since February 24, the organization has provided psychological and social support to more than 1.4 million children and caregivers. Around 422,000 people have also received financial assistance., Media contacts, Olha Pryshko, Communications Specialist, UNICEF in Ukraine, Email: opryshko@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-and-ukraines-first-lady-unite-experts-support-childrens-mental-health-enuk

This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro regions (East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random digit dial (RDD) approach, and 2,002 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. For further notes on method and limitations, including IOM’s definition of internally displaced persons used for the purpose of this assessment, see page 12 In addition to this General Population Survey, data on recorded IDP presence at hromada level in Ukraine are available from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix Baseline Assessment (Round 14, October 16, 2022, HDX, registration required).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-10-27-october-2022-enukr
Update 123 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (3 Nov 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Nov 2022,"A new team of four experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) today to replace the four experts who had been on the site for the past four weeks, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., It was the second rotation of IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts since the Director General travelled to Europe’s largest nuclear plant on 1 September to establish the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) as part of efforts to prevent a nuclear accident during the current conflict in Ukraine. The new IAEA team will be third at the ZNPP in the past two months., “Thanks to the support of all concerned parties, we were able to successfully carry out a rotation of staff at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant a few hours ago. Their presence means that the world knows what is happening at this major nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone. I’m deeply grateful to all our experts, both arriving to and leaving the site today, for their determination and courage in carrying out their important safety, security and safeguards activities at the plant,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General earlier reported that the ZNPP’s main external 750 kilovolt (kV) power line was disconnected following shelling at around 10pm local time yesterday, and a 330 kV line providing back-up electricity was also lost shortly after midnight. Repair work on the 330 kV line is under way. The ZNPP is currently receiving power for essential nuclear safety and security functions from its diesel emergency generators., Ukraine’s South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant also lost its connection to the same 750 kV line, one of three 750 kV lines used by this plant to provide power to the grid, prompting the site to reduce the power of one of its three operating reactors by 50%, Ukraine informed the IAEA., Separately today, the Director General said IAEA inspectors had completed their in-field verification activities at three locations in Ukraine at the request of the Government of Ukraine. Based on the evaluation of the results available to date and the information provided by Ukraine, the Agency did not find any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the locations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-123-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-3-nov-2022
