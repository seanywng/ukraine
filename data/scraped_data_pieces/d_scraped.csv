Ukraine: Ukrainian fighting tactics endanger civilians,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",4 Aug 2022,"Military bases set up in residential areas including schools and hospitals, Attacks launched from populated civilian areas, Such violations in no way justify Russia’s indiscriminate attacks, which have killed and injured countless civilians, Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm’s way by establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including in schools and hospitals, as they repelled the Russian invasion that began in February, Amnesty International said today., Such tactics violate international humanitarian law and endanger civilians, as they turn civilian objects into military targets. The ensuing Russian strikes in populated areas have killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure., “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.”, Not every Russian attack documented by Amnesty International followed this pattern, however. In certain other locations in which Amnesty International concluded that Russia had committed war crimes, including in some areas of the city of Kharkiv, the organization did not find evidence of Ukrainian forces located in the civilian areas unlawfully targeted by the Russian military., Between April and July, Amnesty International researchers spent several weeks investigating Russian strikes in the Kharkiv, Donbas and Mykolaiv regions. The organization inspected strike sites; interviewed survivors, witnesses and relatives of victims of attacks; and carried out remote-sensing and weapons analysis., Throughout these investigations, researchers found evidence of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from within populated residential areas as well as basing themselves in civilian buildings in 19 towns and villages in the regions. The organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab has analyzed satellite imagery to further corroborate some of these incidents., Most residential areas where soldiers located themselves were kilometres away from front lines. Viable alternatives were available that would not endanger civilians – such as military bases or densely wooded areas nearby, or other structures further away from residential areas. In the cases it documented, Amnesty International is not aware that the Ukrainian military who located themselves in civilian structures in residential areas asked or assisted civilians to evacuate nearby buildings – a failure to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians., Launching strikes from populated civilian areas, Survivors and witnesses of Russian strikes in the Donbas, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions told Amnesty International researchers that the Ukrainian military had been operating near their homes around the time of the strikes, exposing the areas to retaliatory fire from Russian forces. Amnesty International researchers witnessed such conduct in numerous locations., International humanitarian law requires all parties to a conflict to avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas. Other obligations to protect civilians from the effects of attacks include removing civilians from the vicinity of military objectives and giving effective warning of attacks that may affect the civilian population., The mother of a 50-year-old man killed in a rocket attack on 10 June in a village south of Mykolaiv told Amnesty International: “The military were staying in a house next to our home and my son often took food to the soldiers. I begged him several times to stay away from there because I was afraid for his safety. That afternoon, when the strike happened, my son was in the courtyard of our home and I was in the house. He was killed on the spot. His body was ripped to shreds. Our home was partially destroyed.” Amnesty International researchers found military equipment and uniforms at the house next door., Mykola, who lives in a tower block in a neighbourhood of Lysychansk (Donbas) that was repeatedly struck by Russian attacks which killed at least one older man, told Amnesty International: “I don’t understand why our military is firing from the cities and not from the field.” Another resident, a 50-year-old man, said: “There is definitely military activity in the neighbourhood. When there is outgoing fire, we hear incoming fire afterwards.” Amnesty International researchers witnessed soldiers using a residential building some 20 metres from the entrance of the underground shelter used by the residents where the older man was killed., In one town in Donbas on 6 May, Russian forces used widely banned and inherently indiscriminate cluster munitions over a neighbourhood of mostly single or two-storey homes where Ukrainian forces were operating artillery. Shrapnel damaged the walls of the house where Anna, 70, lives with her son and 95-year-old mother., Anna said: “Shrapnel flew through the doors. I was inside. The Ukrainian artillery was near my field… The soldiers were behind the field, behind the house… I saw them coming in and out… since the war started… My mother is… paralyzed, so I couldn’t flee.”, In early July, a farm worker was injured when Russian forces struck an agricultural warehouse in the Mykolaiv area. Hours after the strike, Amnesty International researchers witnessed the presence of Ukrainian military personnel and vehicles in the grain storage area, and witnesses confirmed that the military had been using the warehouse, located across the road from a farm where civilians are living and working., While Amnesty International researchers were examining damage to residential and adjacent public buildings in Kharkiv and in villages in Donbas and east of Mykolaiv, they heard outgoing fire from Ukrainian military positions nearby., In Bakhmut, several residents told Amnesty International that the Ukrainian military had been using a building barely 20 metres across the street from a residential high-rise building. On 18 May, a Russian missile struck the front of the building, partly destroying five apartments and damaging nearby buildings. Kateryna, a resident who survived the strike, said: “I didn’t understand what happened. [There were] broken windows and a lot of dust in my home… I stayed here because my mother didn’t want to leave. She has health problems.”, Three residents told Amnesty International that before the strike, Ukrainian forces had been using a building across the street from the bombed building, and that two military trucks were parked in front of another house that was damaged when the missile hit. Amnesty International researchers found signs of military presence in and outside the building, including sandbags and black plastic sheeting covering the windows, as well as new US-made trauma first aid equipment., “We have no say in what the military does, but we pay the price,” a resident whose home was also damaged in the strike told Amnesty International., Military bases in hospitals, Amnesty International researchers witnessed Ukrainian forces using hospitals as de facto military bases in five locations. In two towns, dozens of soldiers were resting, milling about, and eating meals in hospitals. In another town, soldiers were firing from near the hospital., A Russian air strike on 28 April injured two employees at a medical laboratory in a suburb of Kharkiv after Ukrainian forces had set up a base in the compound., Using hospitals for military purposes is a clear violation of international humanitarian law., Military bases in schools, The Ukrainian military has routinely set up bases in schools in towns and villages in Donbas and in the Mykolaiv area. Schools have been temporarily closed to students since the conflict began, but in most cases the buildings were located close to populated civilian neighbourhoods, At 22 out of 29 schools visited, Amnesty International researchers either found soldiers using the premises or found evidence of current or prior military activity – including the presence of military fatigues, discarded munitions, army ration packets and military vehicles., Russian forces struck many of the schools used by Ukrainian forces. In at least three towns, after Russian bombardment of the schools, Ukrainian soldiers moved to other schools nearby, putting the surrounding neighbourhoods at risk of similar attacks., In a town east of Odesa, Amnesty International witnessed a broad pattern of Ukrainian soldiers using civilian areas for lodging and as staging areas, including basing armoured vehicles under trees in purely residential neighbourhoods, and using two schools located in densely populated residential areas. Russian strikes near the schools killed and injured several civilians between April and late June – including a child and an older woman killed in a rocket attack on their home on 28 June., In Bakhmut, Ukrainian forces were using a university building as a base when a Russian strike hit on 21 May, reportedly killing seven soldiers. The university is adjacent to a high-rise residential building which was damaged in the strike, alongside other civilian homes roughly 50 metres away. Amnesty International researchers found the remains of a military vehicle in the courtyard of the bombed university building., International humanitarian law does not specifically ban parties to a conflict from basing themselves in schools that are not in session. However, militaries have an obligation to avoid using schools that are near houses or apartment buildings full of civilians, putting these lives at risk, unless there is a compelling military need. If they do so, they should warn civilians and, if necessary, help them evacuate. This did not appear to have happened in the cases examined by Amnesty International., Armed conflicts seriously hamper children’s right to education, and military use of schools can result in destruction that further deprives children of this right once the war ends. Ukraine is one of 114 countries that have endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, an agreement to protect education amid armed conflict, which allows parties to make use of abandoned or evacuated schools only where there is no viable alternative., Indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces, Many of the Russian strikes that Amnesty International documented in recent months were carried out with inherently indiscriminate weapons, including internationally banned cluster munitions, or with other explosive weapons with wide area effects. Others used guided weapons with varying levels of accuracy; in some cases, the weapons were precise enough to target specific objects., The Ukrainian military’s practice of locating military objectives within populated areas does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks. All parties to a conflict must at all times distinguish between military objectives and civilian objects and take all feasible precautions, including in choice of weapons, to minimize civilian harm. Indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians or damage civilian objects are war crimes., “The Ukrainian government should immediately ensure that it locates its forces away from populated areas, or should evacuate civilians from areas where the military is operating. Militaries should never use hospitals to engage in warfare, and should only use schools or civilian homes as a last resort when there are no viable alternatives,” said Agnès Callamard., Amnesty International contacted the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence with the findings of the research on 29 July 2022. At the time of publication, they had not yet responded.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-ukrainian-fighting-tactics-endanger-civilians
"Atrocity Alert No. 311: Ukraine, Central African Republic and China",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,3 Aug 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., UKRAINE ORDERS THE EVACUATION OF OVER 200,000 CIVILIANS REMAINING IN DONETSK, On 30 July Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered the mandatory evacuation of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in Ukraine-controlled territory in the eastern region of Donetsk. Up to 220,000 civilians, including approximately 50,000 children, are estimated to be in Donetsk, where months of Russian shelling – as part of its campaign to control the region – has begun to destroy the infrastructure to deliver heat and electricity. President Zelensky warned that “the more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill.” As of 31 July the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) had verified over 12,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine since the 24 February invasion. This figure includes the deaths of at least 5,327 people, including 352 children. Half of the civilian casualties documented by the HRMMU were recorded in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk., The unprecedented mass evacuation directive was issued as Russian strikes continue across Ukraine, causing daily civilian casualties. Cities in the southern region of Ukraine have been hit particularly hard in recent days as Russia attempts to capture more territory while reinforcing its defensive positions. In Nikopol, at least 40 Russian GRAD rockets hit residential areas on 31 July alone. Following an apparent Russian cluster bomb attack on 29 July that killed at least seven civilians at a bus stop in Mykolaiv, the city withstood its fiercest bombardment yet on 31 July when 12 missiles hit scores of homes and two schools., Ukrainian and Russian authorities have traded blame over the 29 July explosion at the Olenivka prison in the Russian-backed separatist-controlled part of Donetsk region, which killed at least 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war. The International Committee for the Red Cross has requested access to the prison to conduct an investigation and emphasized in a statement that “all prisoners of war, wherever they are held, are protected under international humanitarian law. They are no longer part of the fight and should not be attacked.”, Meanwhile, as part of the grain export deal brokered by Türkiye and the UN, the first shipment of Ukrainian grain since Russia’s invasion left Odesa on 1 August. The grain export deal – signed separately by Russia and Ukraine on 22 July – aims to restore the flow of grain from Ukraine, as well as fertilizer and grain from Russia to help ease shortages around the world., As the war in Ukraine enters its sixth month, civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict. All parties must honor the grain deal to ensure the export of grain, fertilizers and other food products. The international community must continue to work toward a comprehensive ceasefire agreed by all parties to the conflict, as well as support Ukraine in upholding its responsibility to protect its civilians., EVIDENCE OF ATROCITY CRIMES IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, On 25 July the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released two reports detailing likely war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic (CAR). The reports examined atrocities perpetrated since December 2020, when an alliance of armed groups – including the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique (FPRC) and Unité pour la paix en Centrafrique (UPC) – launched an offensive to overthrow the government. The Central African Armed Forces (FACA) – working closely with Russian-linked forces – responded with counter-offensives. Since then, the UN has documented a dramatic increase in serious human rights violations and abuses, particularly targeted attacks against minority communities and conflict-related sexual violence., FACA troops and allied forces have reportedly recruited, trained and armed former combatants of the predominantly Christian anti-Balaka militias, as well as dozens of young Christians, to use as auxiliaries in their offensives against the UPC in Ouaka prefecture. The first report highlighted how one of these militias carried out a “well-coordinated” and “premeditated” attack against the village of Boyo between 6-13 December 2021. The armed fighters killed 20 civilians and looted more than 540 homes. An estimated 700 civilians were held for three days in the village mosque as the attackers threatened to detonate grenades. OHCHR determined that the militia had the “intention” of punishing the Muslim community in Boyo, who they perceived to be supporters of the UPC. The acts perpetrated in Boyo may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity., According to the second report, members of the FPRC and UPC committed widespread and systematic conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, gang-rape and sexual slavery, in Mbomou and Haute-Kotto prefectures between December 2020 to March 2022. At least 245 women and girls were victims of recurrent sexual violence during this period. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said, “this unprecedented level of sexual violence in CAR is shocking and heart-breaking. The brutal stories we heard from victims of sexual slavery and sexual violence depict crimes that should never have happened… These atrocities are utterly unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately.” The UN peacekeeping operation in CAR (MINUSCA) continues to document cases of sexual violence in areas under the control of the FPRC and UPC, indicating that this pattern of sexual violence is ongoing., It is imperative that FACA and its allied forces ensure the protection of all populations during military operations and stop using militias to carry out attacks against civilians. CAR authorities must guarantee that MINUSCA can effectively carry out its mandate, including its human rights investigations. Armed groups must cease their attacks and reprisals against civilian populations. All individuals directly or indirectly involved in atrocity crimes in CAR should be held legally accountable, regardless of their rank, affiliation or nationality., XUAR PARAMILITARY CORPORATE GROUP CLOSELY TIED TO UYGHUR GENOCIDE, The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), also known as the Bingtuan, is more deeply involved in the regional government’s repressive and genocidal policies toward Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China than previously thought, according to a new report from the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice. The XPCC was established in the 1950’s and is considered by the Chinese government as a “special system of integration of government, military and enterprise.” According to the report, the XPCC was dispatched by top levels of the Chinese government to act as powerful paramilitary corporate conglomerate to suppress the Uyghur population. The group is responsible for myriad abuses targeting Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), including systematic forced migration, forced labor, mass internment, land expropriation, repressive policing and religious persecution. These abuses could constitute crimes against humanity., One of the primary repressive strategies utilized by the group is land expropriation, often involving the destruction of existing structures. XPCC authorities pressure Uyghur landowners to transfer their land ownership to non-Uyghurs, and then coerce them to work in factories or other industries. In one village, 70 percent of the land was transferred from Uyghur farmers and at least 200 people were moved to other sectors. This process contributes to the destruction of Uyghur culture, traditions and ways of life. The XPCC has also been directed by the Chinese government to increase XUAR’s population of Han Chinese people – the country’s majority ethnic group – as a way to dilute the proportion of Uyghurs in the region. Since 2016 the group has increasingly served an integral role in forced labor programs, including labor transfers to factories across XUAR and other regions of China., The group controls a quarter of XUAR’s arable land and has corporate holdings that may be linked to over 850,000 entities around the world, including a majority stake in at least 2,800 companies. Although XPCC’s supply chains are difficult to trace, there is evidence that its products reach global markets. According to the report, some of the XPCC’s most important products and services, including tomatoes, cotton, chemicals and construction, can be traced through global supply chains and investments., Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “following the grave revelations uncovered in this report, member states must do more to uphold their responsibility to protect Uyghurs and other majority-Muslim ethnic groups in XUAR. To begin with, member states should sanction the XPCC and its subsidiaries and prevent the import of goods that may be tied to forced labor in XUAR.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-311-ukraine-central-african-republic-and-china

Olenivka penal facility: Prisoners of war and ICRC's role,News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Aug 2022,"The reports from Olenivka are devastating. Our thoughts are with the families in their pain and heartbreak that someone they love could have been killed in this horrific and unacceptable attack. The ICRC strongly condemns this, and all attacks, on prisoners of war (POWs) and other protected people., We have received many questions about the ICRC's role in the international armed conflict in Ukraine, our work in helping POWs and what the Geneva Conventions say about their rights. Here are some answers to those questions., What has the ICRC been doing since the Olenivka attack? Have you been to the site? Have you visited the POWs injured or killed?, We learned about the alleged attack on Friday 29th July, at which point we immediately requested access to the Olenivka penal facility and to all places where victims are being treated or where the bodies may have been transferred, as well as to facilities where other PoWs might have been moved to. We also offered to support the evacuation of the wounded and to donate medical supplies, protective equipment, and forensic material., As of yet, we have not been granted access to the PoWs affected by the attack nor do we have security guarantees to carry out this visit. Our offer to donate supplies remains unanswered., We will keep requesting access to POWs who are or were held in Olenivka, and any other sites where PoWs are held, guided by our humanitarian commitment and our mandate under the Geneva Conventions., If allowed to visit the scene, is the ICRC prepared and ready to go? What would you do there?, We are ready to deploy to Olenivka. We already have teams with medical and forensic expertise working in the vicinity since we have been present in Donetsk since 2014. We need immediate access to the PoWs who are or were held at the Olenivka facility, wherever they may be, and the necessary security guarantees by parties to the conflict for our teams to access the site(s)., In addition to helping with the wounded and the dead, the ICRC would also meet with POWs, to register them and discuss with them in private the conditions of their internment and the treatment they receive – states have a legal obligation to allow us to have such meetings with PoWs under international humanitarian law (IHL) and the Third Geneva Convention., We would also try to ensure that we will be permitted to revisit these PoWs as often as necessary, to determine whether they are being treated in accordance with the standards laid down under IHL. Through these visits, we would also undertake steps to facilitate contact between POWs and their families., Did the ICRC have access to Ukrainian POWs in Olenivka previously? If so, when and what were you able to do there?, The ICRC visited this location once, in May this year, to deliver water tanks for the facility. But we did not have access to POWs held there on an individual basis – as per ICRC's modalities of work in detention facilities – and that continues to be the case. Under the Third Geneva Convention, during international armed conflicts, the ICRC must be granted access to all PoWs, wherever they are held. We also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit. Since February 2022, our teams have been able to have access to some PoWs, but not all., Does the ICRC conduct public investigations into IHL violations or war crimes?, Public investigations can help determine the facts behind an attack and bring clarity to what happened. However, the ICRC does not carry out investigations into alleged IHL violations for public accountability purposes, as this is not our role or mandate. Moreover, the ICRC does not take part in judicial processes. This means that the ICRC will neither testify, nor provide information for legal proceedings to any judicial or investigative mechanism – and this is a right that has been reaffirmed and granted protection under international law., We actively work to promote adherence to and respect for international humanitarian law (IHL) by the parties to the conflict, including through holding bilateral and confidential dialogue with them. Linked to this dialogue, we may document allegations of IHL violations, so that we can address any concerns we have in relation to the respect of IHL obligations directly and privately with the parties to the conflict. In this way, we attempt to influence how parties behave during an armed conflict, with the end goal of preventing suffering and loss of life. Ultimately, however, it is the obligation of the parties to the armed conflict to safeguard the life, dignity, and integrity of persons under their power who are protected by IHL, including PoWs., Did the ICRC guarantee the safety of POWs leaving the Azovstal plant? Is the ICRC able to guarantee that parties to the conflict will abide by the Geneva Conventions?, As a neutral intermediary, the ICRC facilitated the safe passage of combatants out of the Azovstal plant, in coordination with the parties to the conflict. Given they were then PoWs we registered their information. This was done on the understanding that the ICRC would later be allowed to visit these PoWs – in accordance with the relevant IHL rules – to check on their conditions and help them keep in touch with their families., We did not guarantee the safety of the PoWs once in enemy hands because it is not within our power to do so. We had made this clear to the parties in advance. It is the obligation of parties to the conflict to ensure POWs are protected against acts of violence, intimidation, and public curiosity, as well as against the effects of hostilities. Only parties to the conflict can definitively ensure the safety and security of PoWs. You can read more about what POWs are entitled to under the Third Geneva Convention here., While we have managed to visit some POWs held by the parties, we have repeatedly stated that we still do not have access to all POWs, including those held at Olenivka. The ICRC must be allowed to visit and revisit the PoWs and in particular those it has still not been granted access to and to carry out its humanitarian mandate. Ultimately, the ICRC's capacity to deliver on its mandate depends on parties' willingness to abide by their obligations under IHL., What is the ICRC's role under the Geneva Conventions to protect and assist POWs?, The Third Geneva Convention grants the ICRC the right to go wherever POWs are held and we shall also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit. Specifically, this means that we have a legal right to speak to POWs repeatedly and in private to understand how they are being treated and to visit all facilities where they are being interned, to determine whether they meet the standards laid down by IHL. The aim of these interviews and visits is to make sure that the integrity and dignity of POWs are respected, and that their conditions of internment are in line with laws and internationally recognized standards., In addition, the Third Geneva Convention confers upon the ICRC Central Tracing Agency a specific role, namely, to collect and centralize all information it can obtain on POWs, whether through official or private channels, for onward transmission to the parties to the conflict and to the families of the persons concerned. This system helps prevent PoWs from going missing, by accounting for those in hands of adversary and providing information to their families., Families of the PoWs tell us they are trying to get through to ICRC but cannot reach you. What do you say to that?, We are receiving many calls and emails from families and we are doing all what we can to respond as quickly as possible. We know that families are terrified for the safety of their family members who may have been affected by the attack on Olenivka and that the wait for information can feel interminable. Families can contact us on various channels, and we are replying as soon as we have information about their loved ones. Many families still need answers., Under the Geneva Conventions, the relevant party must inform the ICRC Central Tracing Agency, within the shortest possible time, the fate of each PoW, survivors, wounded and killed, to allow the provision of answers to the families. Contact the ICRC Central Tracing Agency here or by email (ctabureau@icrc.org).

Ukraine: 2022 Flash Appeal Funding Snapshot - 1 August 2022,Infographic,OCHA,Contributions,1 Aug 2022,,https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-2022-flash-appeal-funding-snapshot-1-august-2022
CP sub-cluster Ukraine national level MoM 29 July 2022 [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,3 Aug 2022,"Kateryna Martynenko, CP Sub-cluster, The topic of the presentation was taken during one of the meeting that we had in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The following question was raised that there are challenges in the communities because everybody is going through difficult times. But unfortunately the funding of projects is designated only for the IDP's. At the same time, the local communities also have some needs. Often we don't have the possibilities to cover those needs and then the conflicts arise. That's why we would like to have a discussion around this topic to hear your experience., Stener Vogt, CP Sub-cluster, The issue of conflicts between internally displaced people and the local community is well known and unfortunately it turns up most places. And it’s important for us in the humanitarian community to be aware of that. We have an obligation to do no harm. There are four humanitarian principles: humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence. Everyone has a right to receive assistance and we are neutral in any conflict. Impartiality implies that humanitarian aid must be provided solely on the basis of need, without discrimination. Humanitarian action must never discriminate according to other criteria such as gender, religion, ethnic background or political orientation., Humanitarian action differs from other supports given according to other criteria. Development aid is guided by political interests and not solely by human need., Background for conflicts between IDPs and local communities:, • Strain on local resources, • Differencing assistance, Strategies to avoid conflicts:, Assistance to IDPs in host families/in their hosts:, • Cash-based, • Non-cash based, Assistance to host communities: community infrastructure and/or services;, • Support to information or, • Social development centers ( Quick impact Projects QIPs) and A combination of assistance to individual families and host communities, Alona Kryvuliak, La Strada Ukraine, We have requests to the hotline when people said they were not able to get access to some services or to some distribution of help because they don't fit a category. Indeed, we see this situation and not in one region. Mostly these are the regions that have accepted the largest numbers of displaced people.

Ministry of Justice gains support for the development of IT infrastructure and electronic registers [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,3 Aug 2022,"Lack of modern computer equipment and outdated digital infrastructure hampering efforts, Kyiv, 3 August 2022 – All Government bodies, public institutions, businesses and organizations rely on electronic registers to keep functioning. Keeping data only in paper form, however, puts them at great risks of loss from fire, natural disasters and in Ukraine’s case, war. This is why the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Digital Transformation and with support from the Government of Sweden, has prioritized supporting the development of electronic registers of public bodies., The Ministry of Justice of Ukraine is making significant progress in updating its IT infrastructure and digitalizing access to its most important documents. Serhii Orlov, Deputy Minister of Justice of Ukraine for Digital Development, Digital Transformations, and Digitalization, said Ukraine is simplifying access to a large number of public service by moving to a paperless regime.“For ourselves, we define this as there being no extra unnecessary papers issued to citizens when they are communicating with the state. This is especially important, as many Ukrainians have lost documents due to the war, or their documents were damaged.”, Serhii Orlov said the ministry recently, for example, simplified the procedure for obtaining duplicate certificates of the registration of civil status acts and extracts from the State Register of civil status acts of citizens by making them available on the Diia portal. In addition, the Ministry is improving the quality of the Unified Register of convicts and detainees data – central to the development of a probation system., The Ministry was hampered in its efforts by outdated IT infrastructure and a lack of modern computer equipment. Most workstations were equipped with aging desktop computers that civil servants could not bring with them during frequent trips to bomb shelters. To help them overcome these challenges, UNDP, with funding from the Government of Sweden, provided new equipment and technical support., The support provided will help the employees of the penitentiary system perform their duties more quickly and efficiently, and will ensure the uninterrupted management and maintenance of the Register, Deputy Minister of Justice Olena Vysotska said., Speaking at a press conference today in Kyiv, Serhii Orlov said that while the Ministry has made great progress, there are still many tasks ahead. “It is necessary to digitize many services, update the legislative framework, streamline the work of state registers, constantly improve the level of data protection, and further upgrade our technical capabilities,” he said. “It is with the latter part that international partners help us a lot.”, Mstyslav Banik, Head of Electronic Services Development at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, echoed his colleague’s statement, adding that the goal of the Government of Ukraine is to eventually provide online access to all public services, without exception. “But for all electronic services to work correctly, and for state bodies to be able to provide them effectively, appropriate equipment is needed,” he said., “Computer equipment purchases made with the help of our international partners will allow us to strengthen the ability of public bodies to transfer their work to electronic form, and improve internal working processes,” he said. “This will facilitate the work of employees and, as a result, simplify the life of Ukrainians, who will be able to receive the necessary services quickly and conveniently.”, Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative, said the Government’s effort to upgrade and modernize its IT infrastructure began a few years ago and has intensified in recent months as it seeks to expand the range of public support and services in the war. “*The Government is committed to reaching and supporting all Ukrainians in these difficult times, leaving no one behind,” she *said. “At the same time, due to the war, the burden on the budget does not allow sufficient financing of all areas, and so international partners like UNDP and the Government Sweden are here to help.”, *“Exemplary partnerships like this between the Ministry of Digital transformation, the Ministry of Justice, UNDP and Sweden demonstrate that by working together, we can overcome many obstacles in our efforts to better serve the people of Ukraine,” *Manal Fouani said., Background, All the mentioned purchases were made within the Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalization of Public Services in Ukraine Project (DIA Support project), implemented by UNDP in Ukraine with the financial support from Sweden.The DIA Support Project was launched in 2021 and aims to bridge the digital divide between different generations and different social groups. Its main goal is to increase the accessibility of new digital solutions so that every man and woman in the country can use public electronic services and no one is left behind., Media inquiries, Yuliia Samus, Communications Team Leader, UNDP in Ukraine, Yuliia.Samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ministry-justice-gains-support-development-it-infrastructure-and-electronic-registers-enuk

They discussed the United States’ and the WHO’s coordinated response to support Ukraine and the country’s health system recovery and announced that USAID is providing an additional $1.8 million in funding to WHO to strengthen infectious disease surveillance and reporting in Ukraine, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable, including people with special needs, those living in remote areas and internally displaced people (IDP). With this additional support, USAID has now provided $15.5 million to WHO, for critical health support, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February., “For almost six months now, Ukraine’s health system has been facing numerous and serious challenges due to the ongoing conflict. We are beginning to see a rise in COVID-19 cases, with a corresponding rise in hospitalizations and deaths, driven by the BA.5 sub-lineage of Omicron which has quickly spread through Europe since early June,” said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., “On top of that, the war has affected routine immunization activities for highly infectious and potentially life-threatening diseases like measles, polio and diphtheria. A cholera outbreak remains a real and serious risk. And the rapid and unexpected spread of monkeypox in the European Region could further challenge the Ukrainian health system, when the virus reaches Ukraine. The only way to get a handle on these health threats is to have robust and agile surveillance systems that are able to function amid the current conflict and well beyond,"" continued Dr Kluge., Working closely with the Ukrainian MoH, the overarching objectives will be to:, “On behalf of WHO, I thank USAID for this generous and timely donation to help protect the health and well-being of the Ukrainian people.

Oxfam reaction to first shipment of grain leaving Ukraine,News and Press Release,Oxfam,Food and Nutrition,1 Aug 2022,"In response to reports that the first shipment of grain left Ukraine today, Eric Munoz Oxfam America Food and Agriculture expert said:, “Oxfam welcomes this news but warns that lifting the grains blockade alone will not solve the global hunger crisis. The recent hostilities in Odessa and Mykolaiv show that the exports agreement is still fragile and we call on all parties to ensure the swift delivery of grains., “What the world is facing today is not a new crisis. While the war in Ukraine has contributed to skyrocketing food prices, global hunger was already on the rise– as many as 828 million people were hungry in 2021., “We need to rethink how we feed our world. Governments must build a sustainable and just food system that does not harm the planet or already vulnerable people, and that can withstand similar economic shocks. Leaders must scale-up investments that support small-scale farmers who already feed one-third of the world’s population., “They must also provide lifesaving aid to meet the UN global appeal to help those already on the brink of starvation., “International law protects civilian infrastructure, such as ports and silos for storing food. They should never be subject to attack as moving food in conflict zones is essential to saving lives.”, Notes to editors, FAO’s “State of Food Insecurity and Nutrition in the World 2022” report stated that as many as 828 million people were hungry in 2021, an increase of 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic., FAO research states that small family farmers produce a third of the world’s food., Contact information, Jade Tenwick | EU Media Officer | jade.tenwick@oxfam.org | mobile +32 473 56 22 60",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/oxfam-reaction-first-shipment-grain-leaving-ukraine
European Commission disburses first tranche of the new €1 billion macro-financial assistance for Ukraine,News and Press Release,EC,Contributions,1 Aug 2022,"The European Commission, on behalf of the EU, has today disbursed the first half (€500 million) of a new €1 billion macro-financial assistance (MFA) operation for Ukraine. The second tranche (another €500 million) will be disbursed tomorrow, 2 August. The decision about this new exceptional MFA was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 12 July 2022., This additional MFA of €1 billion is part of the extraordinary effort by the EU, alongside the international community, to help Ukraine to address its immediate financial needs following the unprovoked and unjustified aggression by Russia. It is the first part of the exceptional MFA package of up to €9 billion announced in the Commission's communication of 18 May 2022 and endorsed by the European Council of 23-24 June 2022. It complements the support already provided by the EU, including a €1.2 billion emergency MFA loan paid out in the first half of the year. Taken together, the two strands of the programme bring the total MFA support to Ukraine since the beginning of the war to €2.2 billion., The MFA funds have been made available to Ukraine in the form of long-term loans on favourable terms. The assistance supports Ukraine's macroeconomic stability and overall resilience in the context of Russia's military aggression and the ensuing economic challenges. In a further expression of solidarity, the EU budget will cover the interest costs on this loan. As for all previous MFA loans, the Commission borrows funds on international capital markets and transfers the proceeds on the same terms to Ukraine. This loan to Ukraine is backed for 70% of the value set aside from the EU budget., This financial assistance comes in addition to the unprecedented support provided by the EU to date, notably humanitarian, development and defence assistance, the suspension of all import duties on Ukrainian exports for one year or other solidarity initiatives, e.g. to address transport bottlenecks so that exports, in particular of grains, could be ensured., Members of the College said:, Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People said: “This €1 billion payment is a first part of our €9 billion macro-financial assistance package to help Ukraine meet its emergency financial needs caused by Russia's brutal war. At the same time, we are working closely with EU Member States and our international partners on the next steps to rebuild Ukraine for the longer term. The EU will provide all political, financial, military and humanitarian support required to assist Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia's continued illegal aggression – for as long as it takes.”, Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said: “Our support to Ukraine is unwavering. We will continue to support the Ukrainian people -politically, financially and with military means - in facing the adversity and challenges caused by Russia's aggression. Ukraine is defending its sovereignty and right to exist with determination and dignity. The EU is standing by Ukraine in these endeavours and will continue to do so”., Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said: “The Commission's quick disbursement of the first tranche of the exceptional MFA loan of €1 billion shows the EU's unwavering solidarity with Ukraine and its people. The EU budget plays a central role in this solidarity by backing these funds for 70% of their value and covering the interest costs of this loan. A further example that the EU budget delivers also for our partners in times of crisis.”, Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: “With this disbursement the European Commission continues to support Ukraine in shoring up its public finances. In the face of Russia's unrelenting and brutal aggression, the EU must remain unwavering in its solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Work is ongoing on a proposal for the second part of this exceptional macro-financial assistance, as announced in May and endorsed by the European Council.”, Background, The EU has already provided significant assistance to Ukraine in recent years under its MFA programme. Since 2014, the EU has provided over €5 billion to Ukraine through five MFA programmes to support the implementation of a broad reform agenda in areas such as the fight against corruption, an independent judicial system, the rule of law, and improving the business climate. In addition, earlier this year the Commission granted an MFA emergency loan of €1.2 billion, for which the Commission raised funds in two private placements in the first half of 2022. On 18 May, the Commission set out plans in a Communication for the EU's immediate response to address Ukraine's financing gap, as well as the longer-term reconstruction framework. On 25 July, the Board of the EIB, the EU bank, approved €1.59 billion in financial assistance, supported by guarantees from the EU budget, to help Ukraine repair the most essential damaged infrastructure and resume critically important projects addressing the urgent needs of Ukrainian people., To finance the MFA, the Commission borrows on capital markets on behalf of the EU, in parallel to its other programmes, most notably NextGenerationEU and SURE. The possible borrowing for Ukraine is foreseen in the Commission's funding plan for the second half of 2022. More information on the aid that the EU has provided to Ukraine since the start of Russia's war of aggression is available online., Macro-financial assistance (MFA) operations are part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring countries and are intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. They are available to EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems. In addition to MFA, the EU supports Ukraine through several other instruments, including humanitarian aid, budget support, thematic programmes, and technical assistance and blending facilities to support investment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/european-commission-disburses-first-tranche-new-eu1-billion-macro-financial-assistance-ukraine

This update adds depth to the information presented in the previous version, tracks changes in the situation, considers additional threats, and incorporates data from assessments., Health Cluster Ukraine continues to serve as the coordinating link between over 149 partners engaged in humanitarian health activities in Ukraine. This Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) is one of the resources developed by the Health Cluster secretariat to promote a common understanding of the public health situation in Ukraine., The invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has caused massive civilian displacement and casualties. An estimated 6.6 million people are internally displaced,2 and approximately 6.2 million have fled from the conflict and registered as refugees across Europe. 3 As of 24 July 2022, 12 272 civilian casualties were recorded, with a reported 5237 killed and 7035 injured. 4 The number of attacks against health facilities and the use of heavy weapons to commit the incidents is extremely high given the short period of time. As of 27 July 2022, there were verified 414 attacks on health care, which took the lives of 85 people and injured 100 people.5, Health status and threats, With large population movements, increased social mixing, and disruption of vaccination services and surveillance, there is an increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable and other outbreak-prone diseases. Prior to the war, vaccination coverage was particularly low for polio, measles and hepatitis B (HBV), and COVID-19 vaccine uptake was among the lowest in Europe.Tuberculosis (TB), HIV and viral hepatitis programmes have been disrupted, impeding access to medicines and potentially interrupting testing and delaying treatment. In 2020, Ukraine had the second highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the WHO European Region7 and had been identified as one of the top 20 countries with the highest estimated number of drug-resistant TB cases.8, Ukraine also has a very high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their behavioural and biological risk factors, especially in men.9 Access to essential health services and medications are crucial for the treatment of NCDs, particularly prevalent in older persons, many of whom have been unable to flee due to reduced mobility., There have been increasing reports of gastrointestinal infections and bacterial diseases; 10 in the in first six months of 2022, there has been a 40% increase in the number of cases of acute intestinal infections compared to the same period in 2021. 11 Botulism cases, linked to the consumption of contaminated meat and fish, have been reported in several oblasts. In addition, waterborne diseases are likely to become widespread in conflict zones, particularly over the summer months.
A lack of access to water due to disruption to services and damage to distribution systems has resulted in increased reliance by the population on well water, rainwater, and water run-off. 12 As a result, thousands of civilians are at risk of contracting illnesses such as cholera and dysentery, due to damaged water and sanitation systems, especially in areas around the Azov Sea., Ukraine’s maternal mortality ratio remains among the highest levels compared to neighbouring countries, nearly 10 times that of neighbouring Poland, and the war is likely to worsen the situation. 13 It is estimated that there were around 265 000 women pregnant in Ukraine at the time of the invasion, and that roughly half (132 500) of these pregnant women will deliver by the end of July 2022. 14, Vulnerable groups affected, Vulnerable groups are disproportionately impacted by health threats and barriers to accessing health care. Vulnerable groups in the conflict-affected regions include people over the age of 60, people with disabilities, children and youth, women and girls, victims of human trafficking, Roma, health care workers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The majority of the displaced population are women and girls, increasing the need for woman-, adolescent- and child-specific services. However, men both on and off the battlefield are at a high risk of war-related injury and death, as well as psychological trauma, increasing the need for, among others, rehabilitation as well as mental health and psychosocial support., Infrastructural damage, The war has caused significant infrastructural damage, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity or water. 15 Around six million people either have limited or no access to safe water, with active hostilities preventing repair teams from fixing damaged systems and restoring access., The ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt local supply chains. Nationally, one third of households were found to be food insecure. 16 Oblasts in the eastern and southern parts of the country recorded the highest level of food insecurity, with one in every two households being food insecure., Health system needs, According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health (MOH), as of 24 July, more than 746 health care facilities are in need of restoration, and more than 123 destroyed, since the beginning of the war.17 WHO’s/Health Cluster’s Attacks on Health Care Team has verified 414 attacks on health care, including 350 reports of attacks affecting health facilities, as of 27 July. 18 Many health care workers have had to leave their health facilities due to the conflict.
The supply chains for medicines and medical supplies have been disrupted, creating urgent need in conflict-affected areas. The availability of pharmacies has improved across the country, but regional differences remain, particularly in places where there is active conflict on the ground., Humanitarian response, The Health Cluster, led by WHO, currently links 149 partners (NGOs, UN agencies, national authorities, donors, and observers) engaged in the humanitarian health response in Ukraine. The majority of implementing partners are national NGOs., Meeting health needs and ensuring that reconstruction efforts are successful will continue to be shaped by the duration and nature of the war.

Multilateral efforts needed to stem rising costs of global food staples and decline of livelihood in Ukraine,News and Press Release,ICRC,Food and Nutrition,29 Jul 2022,"(New York) – The rising costs of food staples in conflict-affected countries and the dramatic decline of livelihoods for the people of Ukraine were priority topics during a discussion between the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group of New York-based UN correspondents on Thursday 28 July 2022., The following is on-record information provided to attending journalists and can be attributed to Ms. Laetitia Courtois, ICRC's Permanent Observer to the United Nations:, Concerning the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, I want to touch on some recent findings we have and divide them in two parts – one focused on Ukraine and the other on the wider repercussions of this crisis in a world facing other major challenges., The main message here is that the Ukraine crisis is exasperating pre-existing trends and with global inflation hitting record highs, people in areas affected by conflict and instability – as well as impacted by climate change – are feeling the brunt of it. Multilateral efforts are needed to respond to humanitarian crises, prevent further fragmentation, manage economic distress, tackle climate change, and end the global pandemic., Keep in mind that the Ukraine situation is not unique. Armed conflict is a terrible disruptor. People living in places affected by conflict experience similar hardships. I am highlighting Ukraine and other situations of armed conflict because we have these figures today., First on Ukraine:, The ICRC Economic Security Analysis section conducts monitoring surveys and interviews in the areas of the world where we operate – all affected by armed conflict and violence. We look at market conditions and what people face in their daily lives when they go to the market or need to access essential services. The analysis is done on a quarterly basis. These figures are from the first and second quarters and compare the same time frame from the year before., In Ukraine, we have found that:, The second part to this is what is happening outside of Ukraine. On this we cannot link solely to the Ukraine crisis since there are other factors at work, including inflation, recovery from the ongoing pandemic., If we look at places where we operate and where we conducted these surveys, we see some stark trends. Again, this is a market price review where we look on a monthly basis at an average of 20 food and non-food commodities per country, disaggregated by location and market., These are basic commodities needed by the affected people to survive. We have found percentages increases across the board with:, Sudan at 187%
Yemen 60%
Ethiopia 54%
DRC 42%
Afghanistan 36%
Burkina Faso 34%
Myanmar 33%
Somalia 30%, Each of these show a crisis-level increase in the price of their respective minimum food baskets over the past year., Additionally, countries in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel have seen a sharp decline in their conditions in the past six months, linked to a combination of poverty, food insecurity and limited livelihoods opportunities, aggravated by conflict escalation and environmental fragility.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/multilateral-efforts-needed-stem-rising-costs-global-food-staples-and-decline-livelihood-ukraine
GIEWS Country Brief: Ukraine: 1-August-2022,News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",1 Aug 2022,"FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT, Total cereal production in 2022 forecast 40 percent lower year on year and 30 percent below five-year average level, Unless significant volumes shipped from maritime ports resume, exports likely to be well-below average in 2022/23, About 15.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, Total cereal production in 2022 forecast 40 percent lower year on year and 30 percent below average, The 2022 winter crops (wheat and rapeseed), sown last October, are currently being harvested. Weather conditions during the season were overall favourable, but the escalation of the conflict in late February 2022 cast uncertainty over the final crop output. Between 20 and 30 percent of the area planted to the 2022 winter crops may not be harvested as a result of direct destruction, constrained access to fields, labour shortages and lack of economic resources. 1, Planting of sunflower and spring cereal crops, including maize, finalized in mid-June on fields without the remnants of the war, despite being constrained by fuel shortages. According to estimates by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, maize crops were planted on about 4.6 million hectares, 15 percent below the 2021 area and 7 percent below-average. Sunflower crops were sown on 4.7 million hectares, 30 percent below the level of the previous year and 25 percent below the five year average level. 2 The aggregate area sown with spring crops is about 20 percent less than the 2021 above-average level., Overall, in 2022, the reduced area harvested and the decline in yields due to hampered access to inputs, caused by limited access to financial services and high prices, are expected to result in a reduction of cereal production by 40 percent compared to the previous year's exceptional results 3 and by about 30 percent compared to the five-year average level. The current forecast for the 2022 cereal harvest indicates a production of about 51 million tonnes: 20 million tonnes of wheat, 24 million tonnes of maize and about 7 million tonnes of other coarse grains. Similarly, the harvest of oilseeds is likely to decrease as production of sunflower seed is expected at 7.5 million tonnes (45 percent below the previous year's level), while production of soybeans and rapeseed is expected at 2.0 million and 1.7 million tonnes, respectively. 4, Higher than expected carryover stocks resulting from the sudden halt of exports in February 2022 remain stored in local storage facilities. While there is enough capacity to store the currently harvested wheat production, there are serious concerns for the maize crop, to be harvested in October, and it is likely to be a decisive factor shaping farmers' harvesting decisions., Unless significant volumes shipped from maritime ports resume, exports likely to be well-below average in 2022/23, As of end of July, closures of maritime ports and damages to transport and storage infrastructure are expected to continue to limit exports in the 2022/23 marketing year (July/June). Currently, grain and other agricultural commodities are mostly transported by rail and river routes, whose capacity is well below those of cargo ships, also due to logistical challenges, partially caused by different railway gauges.Total cereal exports in 2022/23 are tentatively forecast to be about 40 percent below the five-year average volume; exports of maize and wheat are forecast at 15 million and 10 million tonnes, respectively, the lowest levels in the last 10 years. 5 However, reopening of some Ukrainian marine ports on the Black Sea would allow for larger quantities to be exported., In early March 2022, the government suspended the exports of some food products, including oats, buckwheat, millet, rye, barley, rapeseed, meat, sugar and salt. The decision was taken to safeguard domestic food supplies amid the ongoing conflict. In addition, export licensing requirements were introduced for other commodities, including wheat and meslin ( FPMA Food Policy ). On 1 July, the government adopted Resolution 759 , which cancels wheat and meslin export licenses, lifts the export ban on oats and introduces export licenses., About 15.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, Already prior to the start of the war, about 1.5 million people had been displaced as a result of the near eight‑year conflict in the eastern areas and about 1.1 million people were in need of food and livelihood assistance. The ongoing conflict is increasing humanitarian needs within the country as well as in neighbouring countries where displaced populations are seeking refuge. As of 19 July 2022, about 9.5 million people, 6 mostly women and children, had been forced to abandon their homes and flee across borders to find safe shelter, with almost 4.8 million refugees crossing borders with Poland., According to the April Update of the Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022 issued by the United Nations, about 15.7 million people are estimated to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection, including 7.7 million internally displaced people. Although some people have recently returned to their homes, there are still large numbers of IDPs located in the western parts of the country., It is extremely difficult to predict the evolution of the war and its effect on lives, livelihoods, food security and nutrition in coming months. 7 Food security conditions remain particularly concerning in besieged cities, where often humanitarian access is severely constrained., The prevalence and severity of food insecurity will depend on the length and scale of the conflict and urban areas are likely to be more affected as most rural dwellers typically cultivate some land to produce food to supplement their household's diets., According to the May 2022 WFP Food Security Report , at national level, one third of households were food insecure, of which 5 percent were severely food insecure.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/giews-country-brief-ukraine-1-august-2022

The ship is bound for the port of Tripoli, Lebanon, carrying a cargo of 26,527 tons of corn, and is the first vessel to depart under the Black Sea Grain Initiative signed in Istanbul on 22 July.

Since then, the parties, with the assistance of the United Nations, have been working tirelessly to implement the agreements reached in that Initiative. The Secretary-General salutes their efforts and he is grateful to Türkiye for its leadership., The Secretary-General is pleased that, thanks to the tireless efforts, general oversight and coordination of the Joint Coordination Centre, the ship departed safely from the port of Odesa., The Secretary-General hopes that this will be the first of many commercial ships moving in accordance with the Initiative signed, and that this will bring much-needed stability and relief to global food security especially in the most fragile humanitarian contexts., In line with the humanitarian spirit of the Initiative, the World Food Programme (WFP) is also planning to purchase, load and ship an initial 30,000 metric tons of wheat out of Ukraine on a United Nations-chartered vessel.

We strongly urge all parties to uphold their commitments in the agreement, ensure the safety of personnel, commodities, and infrastructure, and to continue to build towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine., The re-opening of supply routes is an important step towards mitigating hunger for an estimated 50 million people worldwide on the brink of famine.

Globally, underlying inequalities affecting women and girls, disabled people, indigenous communities, and minority groups mean that these groups are disproportionately impacted by hunger. However, by investing in gender-equitable, localized, and sustainable systems change, the international community can ensure there is no place for famine in the 21st century., CARE calls on the international community to commit to policy measures to ensure conflict does not exacerbate hunger by taking the following four concrete actions outlined in the May 2022 Call to Action signed by 40 international NGOs:, The international community must act now if we are to stave off famine.

Humanitarian security reports say Mykolaivska oblast has been impacted by attacks at least 184 times in July, and that, besides damaging and destroying infrastructure, they have killed a total of 22 civilians and injured 86 others., Fighting on the ground remained focused in the east, especially in Donetska oblast. The city of Sloviansk, located in Government-controlled areas, has become a renewed focus of the hostilities – amid growing concerns about the humanitarian conditions there. The mayor of Sloviansk said that current damage to infrastructure could cause the water supply system to freeze and cease to function as soon as temperatures drop below zero later this year. The mayor also reported that the gas supply system has been damaged and may not be repaired before winter. He repeated calls for residents to evacuate while they still could. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities reported continuing water shortages in Mariupol, which is located in areas outside of Government control, with limited or no access to safe water for many residents., Also, in eastern Ukraine, there continued to be daily reports of shelling in Kharkiv and Kharkivska oblast, resulting in damage to civilian infrastructure and multiple civilian deaths and injuries. The oblast Governor noted that the shelling sometimes sparks fires that destroy crops, including, in one case, 30 hectares of wheat. And on 26 July, shelling was reported to have damaged a gas pipeline, cutting off the supply to about a thousand homes. UN colleagues, including from OCHA, have been conducting missions to Kharkiv more regularly recently, observing firsthand the extensive damage to the city and oblast., Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, pointed to another worrying development on 21 July when it reported that more military equipment, explosives, ammunition and weapons had been stored inside the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – representing a serious risk to public health and the environment. The plant is located in a part of the south-eastern Zaporizka oblast that has been beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine since early March.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-27-jul-2022-enruuk

This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro regions (East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random digit dial (RDD) approach, and 2 000 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. For further notes on method and limitations, including IOM’s definition of internally displaced persons used for the purpose of this assessment, see page 14 In addition to this General Population Survey, data on recorded IDP presence at hromada level in Ukraine are available from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix Baseline Assessment (Round 7, July 18 2022 HDX, registration required).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-7-23-july-2022-enuk

Encouraging Young Voices that Break through the Rumble of War in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IOM,Recovery and Reconstruction,28 Jul 2022,"Western Ukraine, 28 July 2022 – In their most fervent dreams, the war ends tomorrow. They wouldn’t wake up to the sounds of explosions and the crumpled ruins of their cities. If everything depended only on them, tomorrow they would return to rebuild their hometowns or fulfill their pre-war dreams. These dreams nourish the soul as war rages unabated., But Ukraine’s youth – with all the optimism, courage, strength, and energy that adolescence brings – are beginning to hope for a brighter future., Even in war, the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) annual summer schools continue to provide a safe space where young voices can be heard and supported. Over 60 youth leaders aged 18 to 25, either displaced persons from Donetsk, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Kharkiv, and other affected regions, or members of their host communities, recently spent time in beautiful natural reserves in Western Ukraine. Here they learned about safe migration and employment, civic participation, soft skills, volunteering and leadership, while having the opportunity to be sporty and creative. The summer schools were made possible with funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID)., “I want to open a theatre studio for children in Ukraine where nothing will limit their imagination”, Karyna is a young Ukrainian linguist. The war obliterated her home city of Mariupol, but not her dreams. Currently displaced in Vinnytsia, itself the scene of carnage from Russian shelling, she teaches children Ukrainian language and literature online, and conducts drama classes. She draws power from the words of well-known Ukrainian writers. The most inspiring for Karyna are those of poet Lina Kostenko: “It’s true that those who have wings don’t need the ground. If there is no land, there will be sky. If there is no field, there will be freedom.”, “I don't want to go abroad,” says Karyna without a shadow of a doubt in her voice. “I want to stay here, support Ukraine, and teach children. I do my best to succeed and never stop learning new things.”, Besides gaining knowledge, she received another valuable opportunity – for the first time, she spoke about the war, her life and worries about her family members who remain in Mariupol, with a psychologist working at the school., “I believe in diplomacy”, Nineteen-year-old Liubomyr was always the first in sports competitions at the IOM school in Ivano-Frankivsk. He is a professional sportsman and, in his village, he trains other young people. But there’s more to him than his muscles., “At the beginning of the war, I felt like I wasn't doing enough. When a volunteer centre was set up in my village, I began to unload and sort humanitarian aid for those who need it,” he says., But his true passion is international relations. He is studying diplomacy and participating in training on communication with internally displaced persons (IDPs) to engage with people who have found a new home in his native region., As displaced persons from Eastern and Southern parts of Ukraine mostly speak Russian, language barriers pose a challenge for integration within host communities in the West, where people commonly speak Ukrainian. However, Liubomyr believes that despite different languages, people can cooperate and respect each other. The IOM schools have become a place where IDPs and locals learn how to support one another and work in teams to solve acute social problems by leveraging their different life experiences., Liubomyr is convinced that the ability to listen to others and communicate proactively can not only develop communities, but also prevent major crises: “Although I live in western Ukraine, where there are no active hostilities, my life has changed a lot since the beginning of the war: from routine to mentality. I studied history at the university and can’t even imagine that war could happen in the 21st century. Yet here we are. I believe that such crises can be prevented in the future if people learn how to negotiate properly,” he says., “I want to change the public perception of displaced persons in Ukraine: they are not victims of the situation, but strong and resilient people.”, Sofia invites the participants of the IOM school in Lviv into the hall to share her experience of displacement. Her peers already know that she is from the city of Rubizhne in Luhansk Region, over which Ukrainian authorities lost control . Half of the young people do not know what it means to be displaced, while others want to support the peer with whom they have a shared experience., “I was in the city to the bitter end. But it kept getting worse. Our windows were blown out. We melted the snow to have water. Then we moved to the basement to hide from fierce shelling. My grandmother has diabetes and when we ran out of insulin, her legs began to rot,” she says., The audience listens carefully to 21-year-old Sophia. “When there was no more food, water or medicine, we realized that we had to leave the city. On 30 March, we left the basement. It was a difficult and unsafe journey with my grandmother and my younger brother. He has a severe form of cerebral palsy and cannot walk, sit, or even hold his head. We pulled them out of the basement through tears and pain. When you understand that you have to save a life, there are no more emotions and worries left. You have to do it."", In sharing her story, Sophia hopes to show that displaced persons are seen as strong and courageous. She is a true leader and has many goals. Now she volunteers at the Lviv railway station in the medical and psychological service, and plans her future in the military sphere., “I want to open a rehabilitation centre for people with disabilities in Ukraine”, Polina listens attentively to Sophia’s story, as she has a similar tale. She was forced to flee her hometown, Sievierodonetsk, in February., It is still hard for Polina to talk about what happened to her native city over the past months. Sievierodonetsk has witnessed some of the fiercest fighting, with 80 per cent of the houses damaged or destroyed., After the full-scale invasion, she began to work in a children’s camp near Kyiv. On the second day of the war, 160 children, mostly orphans from Donetsk, arrived. Despite active hostilities around Kyiv in the first weeks, it was safer than in Eastern Ukraine., “In the distance we heard explosions, and the children watched for our reaction. Therefore, we tried not to show that we were afraid, and to support them,” recalls Polina., It was her previous experience and willpower that helped Polina care for others in a time of crisis. A rehabilitation specialist by training, for several years she led a group of volunteers working in a school for blind children., Polina says that when she works with people with disabilities, she understands why she has chosen her profession: “These people are truly inspiring and know how to appreciate every moment of life.”, At the IOM school, Polina learned more about social project management. This knowledge will be useful to her, because she has already set herself a goal., “I want to open my own rehabilitation centre for people who were born with or acquired a disability. In a country where there is a war and constant shelling, it is very important.”, Text by Alisa Kyrpychova, IOM Ukraine.

Attacks on health care include those against health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses. These attacks deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health-care providers, and undermine health systems., • WHO has supported the health response in Ukraine by providing, among other things: training on COVID-19, chemical preparedness and response and mass casualty management; technical expertise on the national immunization strategy; trauma and burn kits, and support for medical evacuation (medevac) after the attacks on Vinnytsya; technical expertise on environmental health issues, including water-related preparedness and response measures, in view of a potential cholera outbreak., • The WHO team visited western Ukraine (Lviv, Zakarpattya and Rivne oblasts) with the Deputy Minister of Health and partners from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). In Lviv they carried out an assessment of readiness to respond to a poliomyelitis (polio) outbreak, which included a surveillance and vaccination review. The risk of polio is currently high in Lviv due to the large number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) currently residing there. The assessment concluded that there was a need to spread information on polio preparedness and vaccination in rural areas of Ukraine, particularly those with the lowest vaccination rates, where distrust in vaccines may be more common.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emergency-ukraine-external-situation-report-18-published-28-july-2022

In Odesa, for example, missiles hit the port area one day after the signature of the UN supported Black Sea Grain Initiative, formalizing agreement on the resumption of grain exports by sea., While people are returning home, new waves of displacement are anticipated due to insecurity and a lack of gas and water supply in affected areas.

In France, marches continued to be organized by the Tibetan community to demand justice following the stabbing of one of their members., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Donetsk region, particularly in the areas of Siversk and Bakhmut, but have not secured any significant territorial gains (ISW, 22 July 2022). Ukrainian forces destroyed several Russian ammunition depots and military bases in the Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions last week (Zaxid.net, 21 July 2022). In Kherson, Ukrainian forces struck and seriously damaged the Antonivskyi bridge, a key for supplying Russian troops in southern Ukraine (Reuters, 20 July 2022)., Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling and missile strikes last week. More than 50 civilians were killed by Russian forces in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia regions last week.1, Separately, on 22 July, Ukraine and Russia signed a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey aimed at resuming shipments of Ukrainian grain and mitigating the global food crisis. The agreement includes security assurances from Russia and Ukraine to ensure the safe passage of commercial ships from three Ukrainian ports in the Odesa region (Washington Post, 22 July 2022). Less than 24 hours after signing the deal, Russian forces struck the port’s infrastructure in Odesa with two missiles, while two other missiles were shot down by Ukrainian forces (Washington Post, 23 July 2022)., In Russia, the governors of Belgorod, Bryansk, and Kursk regions continued to report fire on villages and checkpoints in the border area, resulting in the death of one civilian. This violence contributed to the 38% increase in violence in Russia last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month. The Russian government also continued its policy of ‘hidden mobilization’ of troops to make up for the losses suffered by Russian forces in Ukraine. Although further troop mobilization has not been officially announced, the Federal Service for Labour and Employment advertised in mid-June around 22,000 military contractor positions through its employment platform (Caucasian Knot, 21 July 2022). Additionally, an inmate of a penal colony in Adygea was beaten up by other inmates on orders of the administration as a punishment for having passed information about military recruitment in prisons to human rights groups (RFE/RL, 17 July 2022). Moreover, at least 234 Russian soldiers, who refused to fight and have demanded the termination of their contracts since February, were placed in illegal detention centers in the Luhansk region in Ukraine to prevent them from returning to Russia (Meduza, 21 July 2022)., Rallies against the Russian invasion and in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Belarus, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and the United Kingdom last week., In Greece, activists staged several demonstrations last week against the release on bail of a prominent director and stage actor convicted of raping minors. During a demonstration on 22 July, members of anarchist groups clashed with riot police in the central Athens neighborhood of Exarchia during a march against the release of the director and other recent cases of attempted rape (To Pontiki, 23 July 2022). Local residents accuse police of using excessive force against the demonstrators, including beating and deploying tear gas, water cannons, and stun grenades; over 50 demonstrators were detained (To Pontiki, 23 July 2022b)., Demonstrations prompted by the consequences of the unprecedented heat wave rippling through Europe were also observed across the region last week (New York Times, 18 July 2022). Environmental protests were recorded in France, Germany, the **Netherlands, **and the United Kingdom, where activists condemn the lack of government action to mitigate climate change, which would help prevent extreme temperatures. In **Italy **and Spain, protest actions were organized to denounce state management of the drought emergency and wildfires, respectively (Il Resto Del Carlino, 21 July 2022; The Guardian, 25 July 2022). Climate protests were also recorded in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden., In the United Kingdom, nine anti-racist demonstration events against the Rwandan asylum plan were recorded last week. The government’s five-year trial scheme previously sparked a wave of countrywide protests after it was announced in April and ahead of the scheduling of its first deportation flight, which was ultimately canceled due to legal challenges on 14 June. Critics argue that the policy, which provides for the deportation of some asylum seekers to Rwanda for the processing of their claims, constitutes a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and has contributed to spreading racism against asylum seekers in the country (BBC News, 18 July 2022; Morning Star, 24 July 2022)., In France, for the second consecutive week, members of the French and several other European Tibetan communities gathered in Paris and in Normandy to demand justice for a Tibetan hospitality worker who was stabbed to death by his Chinese employers. While the reasons for the attack are still being investigated, a spokeswoman for the French Tibetan community said the crime had ‘revived old wounds’ among the community (Le Figaro, 18 July 2022). Meanwhile, rioting, which first began around French National Day celebrations, continued to be recorded across the country. Last week, rioters threw various projectiles, including mortar fireworks, at law enforcement officers and buildings, and set garbage bins and vehicles on fire in some instances., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the most recent data release.

More action is needed, not just to meet their basic needs, but also to develop a long-term humanitarian assistance strategy., The Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 escalated a war simmering since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Europe’s biggest conflict in decades sent millions of people fleeing into neighbouring countries. Within Ukraine, more than six million displaced persons are now living in central or western regions like Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk., Communities and civil society were quick to supply the uprooted people with food, shelter and other basic necessities, often filling gaps in the state’s response. Their charity and volunteer labour was crucial in coping with the immediate emergency, but it is not sustainable. As the war drags on, donor nations and the international organisations they fund will need to shoulder more of the task of assisting displaced Ukrainians. They should prioritise long-term approaches to assistance, in which local civil organisations take the lead, but which lay the groundwork for government services to pick up the challenge in the future., In June 2022, Crisis Group visited several towns in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. We spoke to the aid workers on the front lines of the response, as well as to displaced people, about how to meet basic needs and build a sustainable humanitarian strategy.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/picturing-humanitarian-response-western-ukraine
Sustainable recovery? First sustain interest in Ukraine’s environment,News and Press Release,CEOBS,Climate Change and Environment,28 Jul 2022,"Will the visibility of environmental damage in Ukraine translate into action to address the risks it poses to human health and ecosystems?, An unprecedented volume of environmental data is being gathered on the invasion of Ukraine. In this post, Doug Weir explores what kind of data is being gathered, and by whom, as well as the environmental narratives that are developing and the implications of this level of documentation., The environmental dimensions of all armed conflicts are becoming ever more visible. There are a number of reasons for this: improved access to earth observation data; new monitoring methodologies; more organisations and individuals actively collecting data; communication pathways becoming more immediate; and all amid growing societal interest in environmental protection., Should the current level of attention be sustained, the invasion of Ukraine may well prove to be the most highly observed conflict in history. The sheer volume of data, be it from satellite imagery, social or traditional media, is overwhelming. Both within and alongside this deluge is environmental data, and data that provides clues to the environmental conditions in affected areas., This post examines the conflict's data collection landscape, and the potential implications of this dynamic but before doing so it is worth revisiting the what, why and how of environmental data collection in conflicts., Conflicts cause and contribute to a wide range of environmental problems. This is particularly true when the fighting is prolonged, intense and affects a large geographical area. And, as is also the case in Ukraine, when war impacts urban, industrial, agricultural and terrestrial and marine natural areas. There are many ways to characterise the damage. It may be direct or indirect, transient or permanent, widespread or localised, cumulative or unique, deliberate or incidental., Typically, several of these characteristics apply simultaneously. For example, where weeks of Russian bombardment of a steelworks with a diverse range of weapons remobilises existing pollution linked to the site's former use, and disperses heavy metals and energetic compounds from the munitions. Or where Ukraine targets a former coal mine to destroy a Russian ammunition stockpile concealed there, creating a similar outcome., But why is it important to document and publicise these incidents, particularly in the face of so much human suffering? Both human rights and ecosystems depend on a healthy environment, irrespective of the hopefully temporary conditions created by conflict. However, the environment is typically under-prioritised during conflicts. Addressing this requires advocacy, indeed awareness-raising is the foundation upon which much else depends. This includes creating the political or financial conditions for assistance and technical assessments on the ground, and for subsequent remedial measures to reduce harm. Advocacy can promote accountability, whether for financial reparations or criminal prosecutions. It is also vital for the norm development that can help reduce future harms. In the case of Ukraine, one such legacy may be the way the conflict has foregrounded the necessity of strengthening protection for nuclear sites during conflict and occupation., However, conflicts create considerable barriers for environmental data collection. Chief among these is the loss of access to affected areas, and the disruption of peacetime monitoring, whether automated or simply through the day to day activities of the state, academics or civil society. Even though environmental protection tends to be viewed politically as a low priority, at times the fate of the environment, or components of it, can become acutely politicised, or data about it subject to manipulation, distorted into disinformation or even weaponised., Overcoming the barriers that conflicts create for environmental data collection has encouraged the growth of remote monitoring. This has been facilitated by increased access to satellite imagery, and the widespread use of social media channels, such as Telegram, in Ukraine's case. When combined with a range of sources, be it grey literature, traditional media reporting or local knowledge and, often, the wisdom of the crowd, it becomes possible to begin to remotely map the contours of environmental harm., However, assessments based solely on remote monitoring have limitations. The precise characterisation of health or ecological risks still requires dedicated studies or sampling on the ground. Similarly, the window that remote monitoring provides can just be a snapshot of wider temporal or geographic trends, or may not aid understanding of the role of pre-existing issues at a given site, nor allow the observer to fully understand complex environmental relationships., The observer must also be mindful of bias, some environmental incidents are just more visible than others, whether you are at ground level or in orbit. Fires, oil spills and deforestation can be easy to track, their health or ecological consequences far less so; causal relationships are often complex. And as noted, sources must be closely scrutinised, environmental issues are not immune from being manipulated for propaganda or disinformation purposes. Equally, there are often imbalances in who is reporting, be it on social or traditional media, and this can easily distort the relative coverage of particular issues, or how they are framed., The initial pace, intensity and geographic scope of the invasion posed a huge challenge to all individuals and institutions tracking the invasion's consequences, be they environmental or humanitarian. In this it's not simply a question of the data that you can gather, but how that data is stored and verified, and for what purpose., New databases were created, or existing systems repurposed; we scrambled to rekindle or make new connections with local experts. Many of those Ukrainian environmental experts found themselves displaced, and the invasion rapidly disrupted automated monitoring systems, be they on air quality or radiation. Cloud cover proved a persistent problem, particularly between February and May, and government calls to restrict sharing of the locations of images and videos impacted the identification and verification of incidents. With future legal cases a very real prospect, and with social media posts notoriously ephemeral, we partnered with Mnemonic, an NGO with a detailed social media archiving system, to ensure important data was not lost., As was expected, many of the most visible incidents have received the most attention, but we have also seen how popular narratives displaced attention on the environment. For example, the siege of the Azovstal steelworks focused on the forces fighting to hold it, and the civilians sheltering below it. The environmental implications of the siege were scarcely mentioned.1 Meanwhile, the struggle for control of Snake Island became one of resistance and national pride with no room for consideration of the impact on the island's ecology, or that of the marine protected area that surrounds it., In spite of these challenges, the environmental dimensions of the invasion are comparatively well documented thanks to a confluence of factors. The invasion has built on a pre-existing environmental narrative that developed in response to the conditions and concerns documented in the Donbas region and Crimea. This narrative drew attention to the risks of environmental emergencies linked to damage or disruption to industrial facilities and remains highly relevant, with nuclear facilities now added to the list of sites of concern., Since February, further environmental narratives have been developed and amplified by the Ukrainian authorities, both domestically and through international environmental diplomacy. This has included weekly publications on incidents which, in an unprecedented move, have also been circulated to national delegations to the UNEP in Nairobi. Ukraine's network of environmental organisations, researchers and experts have also greatly contributed to data collection and dissemination, adding important contextual information based on their situated knowledge., However, as the conflict has gone on, we have seen a divergence in this narrative. Between February and early April, all parties focused on the immediate damage and shock. For the Ukrainian authorities, this has subsequently been subsumed into an almost singular focus on the financial cost of damage, and on the question of reparations. At the behest of Ukraine's parliament, experts were gathered to urgently develop damage valuation methodologies; a process that may be of limited utility in the medium to long-term: should a future reparations mechanism be found, it will decide on how different components of the environment can be valued. Far better, many advised, to focus on gathering and preserving the data itself., Ukrainian civil society experts have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of this approach, the financial cost of harm alone can tell you precious little about the true consequences for ecosystems, species or for health. Ukrainian NGOs have also been vocal in their scrutiny of emergency laws that could prove environmentally damaging, and of plans for post-conflict reconstruction and recovery. They argue that the war should be a turning point that facilitates Ukraine's transition away from its industrial past, leaving it with stronger environmental governance and more sustainable development., Those Ukrainian NGOs, like Ecoaction, are now part of a wider data collection ecosystem for the conflict. This also includes organisations like Environment People Law, that have been documenting harm in the Donbas for many years, the biodiversity-focused Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group, which has reoriented to the consequences of the conflict, and new arrivals formed by experts from Ukraine and neighbouring countries such as the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Work Group., In many cases, these organisations can call on local domestic expertise, with experts also contributing to the Ministry of the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources efforts to track and value damage. This has included innovative approaches to incident reporting, including an app and a dedicated Telegram channel. Staff of the Ministry's State Inspectorate of the Environment have been collecting and storing samples from sites attacked by Russia., In addition to these domestic initiatives are those by international NGOs with a focus on the environment or humanitarian issues, such as Zoï Environment Network, PAX, the REACH initiative and ourselves, to name just four, as well as academic institutions around the world. All are taking different but potentially complementary approaches. For example, our incident database focuses on depth and risk assessment, and is primarily supported by social media reporting and remote sensing. We are collaborating closely with Zoï Environment Network, whose Ecodozor platform is primarily fed by governmental information and local and national traditional media reporting, thus providing breadth., The data we collect supports our media work, and feeds into our communication products, which includes a joint series of thematic briefings, or presentations at events such as that below., International organisations like UNEP and OCHA have deployed specialised staff and, in UNEP's case are trialling the integration of data collection by NGOs, including ourselves, Zoï and PAX as part of its efforts to monitor the environmental situation. Others like the OSCE have longstanding environmental activities in the country, which it intends to sustain despite current political challenges., This characterisation of the increasingly diverse data collection ecosystem is far from exhaustive., Compared with many countries affected by armed conflicts, Ukraine has a relative abundance of environmental data, and actors gathering it. Six months into the invasion is perhaps a good time to reflect on how data coverage could be made more comprehensive. For example, through creative ways to connect remotely gathered data with locally collected information. This would require closer cooperation between international and local expertise, and experimentation with methodologies such as ""civilian science"". There is also the question of data coordination. It seems likely that an independent but centralised repository with a publicly accessible online portal could greatly benefit advocacy, analysis, response and recovery, and help avoid duplication. However, this would need to be adequately resourced, and thought would be needed on its outputs, if it were to avoid becoming a big data graveyard., Work should begin on analysing longer-term changes and trends, for example concerning biodiversity and damage to Protected Areas. The same goes for indirect environmental impacts, where causal relationships may require a greater degree of analysis to understand, as well as any new changes to sites where damage has been reported, for example where initial containment or other remedial actions have taken place. It would also be wise to scrutinise what is happening to potentially damaged sites in occupied areas, given what we know from the past governance of areas of the Donbas outside Ukrainian control., Another important task is to revisit the why of data collection, and how it will be used. Is the focus chiefly political? Is it on the future prospect of compensation? Is it to inform the protection of civilians or ecosystems, or to inform assessment or remediation? Interrogating the why and how help ensure that we get the basics of data collection, verification and storage right., As the war goes on, and alongside the direct and indirect damage being caused by the physical effects of the fighting, it will be increasingly important to monitor changes in domestic environmental governance that may have implications for the environment. It is a constant of conflicts that governance suffers, and in many cases, this can create a ""tail"" of environmental harm that can be national in scope and continue for years., Since February, media interest in the environmental consequences of the invasion has been unprecedented. Just as unprecedented is the number and range of organisations that are collecting environmental data., But what, if anything, will that increased visibility translate into? Will it, as is hoped by the Ukrainian authorities, eventually contribute to the launch of a UN General Assembly mandated claims commission? Will it, as is hoped by many Ukrainian NGOs, help ensure that the resources are made available for a sustainable recovery? Will it help ensure that donors contribute to a post-conflict environmental assessment and urgent remedial measures? Will it mean that environmental risks are addressed? One study on the Donbas region, with its numerous industrial hazards, found that a strong narrative and visibility did not readily translate into actions on the ground to mitigate those hazards., Or will the high degree of attention simply contribute to environmental fatigue? Catastrophic single incidents may not happen, they rarely do. Instead wartime environmental degradation takes place across thousands of incidents across hundreds of square kilometres. This is a tougher sell for the media and the public and, when combined with the drift of attention away from Ukraine as the war grinds on, will make advocacy increasingly difficult., This perhaps points to another priority for all those working to document the environmental dimensions of the conflict. We will need to find and communicate new and relevant stories to keep the environment on the national and international agendas, indeed doing so will be vital for Ukraine's sustainable recovery. This can be challenging when the media sometimes demand soundbites or sensationalism but is another reason why we need to study, untangle and articulate the environmental stories that go beyond the immediately obvious., Doug Weir is CEOBS' Research and Policy Director, this post is based on a recent presentation for the conference on ""The impact of hostilities on Ukraine's environment and human rights -- a civilizational challenge for humankind"" in Lviv.

Displacement in Ukraine: Insights from survey data,Assessment,IDMC,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",27 Jul 2022,"Αs a result of Russia's military offensive against Ukraine, 6.2 million people are currently displaced within the country. To go beyond the numbers and provide more insights into their needs and living conditions, IDMC partnered with RIWI to conduct a countrywide online survey. Between April and early July 2022, thanks to RIWI's innovative methodology, we obtained over 8,000 survey responses. Here are some of the key findings., Of the people surveyed, 32.5 per cent reported having been forced to leave their home and/or otherwise displaced as a result of the ongoing conflict., The percentage of displaced respondents cannot be used to estimate the total number of IDPs in Ukraine, since many respondents may have subsequently returned to their homes. Neither can it be used to calculate the total number of displacements, or movements, because there is no way of knowing how many times respondents were displaced. What the figure does provide, however, is insight into the proportion of Ukrainians who may have experienced displacement., The percentage is lower for respondents aged 55 and above, at 20.7 per cent. This does not mean that older respondents are less affected by the current conflict: rather, it points towards particular barriers to movement for elderly Ukrainians, who are likely to face increased protection risks in their areas of origin., A slight gender imbalance is also observed, with 35.2 per cent of female respondents having been displaced compared to 31.3 per cent of men. This is likely to reflect attempts to curtail men's freedom of movement; most recently, on July 5, those liable for military service have been ordered to remain in their home districts., Finally, poorer households in the sample appear to be displaced at a slightly lower rate, suggesting that cost of transportation may be restricting opportunities for those with limited financial resources to seek safety elsewhere: 30.7 per cent of respondents with an annual household income of up to 60,000 hryvnia (approximately 1,600 USD) have been displaced, versus 34.7 per cent of wealthier respondents., Host families were the most common type of shelter reported by IDPs at the time of data collection: 30.7 per cent were staying with relatives or friends, and 10.1 per cent with other host families. A further 20.7 per cent were renting a house or apartment, while 5.8 per cent were staying in a hotel or hostel. Others were facing greater shelter challenges: at the time of the survey, 4.5 per cent of displaced respondents were staying in a basement or improvised bomb shelter, 3.9 per cent in a tent or makeshift shelter, and 3.7 per cent in collective shelters., There is great variation in shelter needs across the country. Regions with the highest proportion of displaced respondents living in basements, improvised bomb shelters, tents or other makeshift shelters were Luhansk (17 per cent), Kherson (14.8 per cent), Odessa (12.7 percent) and Crimea (also 12.7 per cent)., IDPs with higher income appear to fare somewhat better in terms of shelter: among those surveyed, 22.3 per cent of those with an annual household income superior to 60,000 hryvnia were living in a rented house or apartment, compared to 19.2 per cent of those with lower incomes., Little difference was observed in terms of shelter for displaced men and women. However, it is worth highlighting that 12.6 per cent of female IDPs surveyed were living in collective shelters, basements or improvised bomb shelters, or in tents and other makeshift shelters, possibly exposing them to a higher risk of sexual and gender-based violence., Displaced respondents faced greater challenges accessing basic goods and services in the seven days prior to the survey than non-displaced respondents. Access to money and personal income is the most common challenge, reported by 32 per cent of IDPs surveyed, followed by transportation (17 per cent) and food (15 per cent)., Access to goods and services, unsurprisingly, was a particular challenge for respondents in areas experiencing some of the heaviest fighting. The regions where displaced respondents most struggled to access goods or services were Mykolayiv, where 75 per cent of IDPs surveyed had struggled to access some goods and services in the week prior to data collection, followed by Kherson, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Donetsk., Needs varied across regions. In Luhansk, 25 per cent of displaced respondents had struggled getting enough food in the week prior to data collection; in Kharkiv, 44.2 per cent of displaced respondents reported challenges accessing money and personal income., Among displaced respondents, 66.6 per cent reported their final destination to be somewhere else in Ukraine, with very little variation observed between men and women. Among those who intended to seek refuge abroad, Poland was the most popular destination, followed by Russia., Needs varied across regions. In Luhansk, 25 per cent of displaced respondents had struggled getting enough food in the week prior to data collection; in Kharkiv, 44.2 per cent of displaced respondents reported challenges accessing money and personal income., TWO THIRDS OF DISPLACED RESPONDENTS PLAN TO REMAIN IN UKRAINE, Among displaced respondents, 66.6 per cent reported their final destination to be somewhere else in Ukraine, with very little variation observed between men and women. Among those who intended to seek refuge abroad, Poland was the most popular destination, followed by Russia., Needs varied across regions.

The war in Ukraine: Dutch support for investigations into war crimes,News and Press Release,Govt. Netherlands,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",26 Jul 2022,"Since 24 February 2022, we have seen large-scale human rights violations in Ukraine: murders, sexual violence and the destruction of homes and hospitals. These war crimes cannot be allowed to go unpunished. That is why the Netherlands has been offering support to Ukraine, for an example by sending a forensic investigation team to Kyiv., It is important for victims of the war in Ukraine and their next of kin to establish the truth and obtain justice. For these purposes, it is vital to have sound evidence that can be used in court and in investigations. In response to a request from Ukraine, the Netherlands sent a forensic investigation team to Kyiv to assist the local authorities., Ruined houses and burnt-out buildings, The consequences of the war were clearly evident in Ukraine, according to Bela Kubat. As a forensic pathologist, Bela works to establish the cause of death and the identity of deceased persons. ‘Everywhere you looked you could see ruined houses and burnt-out buildings, and these houses were not even close to military targets – they were in residential areas.’, Bela stresses the importance of making this kind of war crime visible. ‘The people of the world have agreed that war crimes are forbidden. If I can play a role in exposing and prosecuting such acts, then I want to do that. It’s what I am trained to do as a forensic pathologist and I see it as my duty to help.’, Multidisciplinary team, Operating under the banner of the International Criminal Court, around 30 Dutch specialists travelled to Kyiv. Besides Bela, the team included detectives from the Royal Military and Border Police (KMAR), medical personnel, an interpreter and a team from the Special Security Operations Brigade., ‘The multidisciplinary team gave us a lot of advantages’, says Bela. ‘You never know what you’re going to encounter in a war zone. It’s great to have an expert at hand. For example, we found pieces of metal at a crime scene. In such cases, you want to know: is this relevant to our investigation? Are they from a bomb or a missile? To find out, you need to be able to recognise things and that’s not always easy. Because we had the team there, we were able to ask an explosive ordnance disposal expert right away.’, Evidence, In Kyiv, Bela was mainly observing her Ukrainian colleagues, checking on behalf of the International Criminal Court that the local authorities’ investigations are aligned with international standards. All findings that are used in criminal proceedings at the International Criminal Court must meet certain quality safeguards. These rules enable all cases to be handled in the same way. ‘Everything was being done properly, so I was able to report back that the findings can be safely used.’, The team of investigators also gathered evidence on site and digital information via cameras and computers. ‘I looked at items that could be significant. For example, food supplies: what did people eat, what medicines did they have?’, The International Criminal Court, Never before has the International Criminal Court (ICC) sent out an investigative team of this size. The speed at which the team was able to gather evidence is very important, as it means the evidence will be viewed in court as more reliable and genuine. On the team’s return to the Netherlands, the findings were presented to the ICC in The Hague. The evidence collected is intended to show whether it is possible to try the perpetrators., Bela hopes that this mission can serve as a blueprint for the future, so that such investigations can be initiated in this way more often. That should assist efforts to avoid impunity and ensure that justice is done for the victims. It should also deter the commission of further serious international crimes., Dutch support, There are other ways too that the Netherlands is involved in fighting impunity and investigating war crimes in Ukraine. For example the Netherlands is providing financial support to the ICC and has backed the establishment of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which is focused on evidence gathering., In addition, on 14 July 2022 the Netherlands hosted the Ukraine Accountability Conference*,* which was specifically aimed at international cooperation in the area of fact-finding and justice. During the conference Wopke Hoekstra, Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that the Netherlands will be providing extra financial support to the ICC and the UN Human Rights Office in Ukraine. Mr Hoekstra also pledged extra funding for psychosocial help for victims of sexual violence., Fragile freedom, Bella believes that the mission to Ukraine confirmed that freedom cannot be taken for granted. ‘When we left Ukraine we stopped just over the border in a beautiful part of the Polish countryside. Imagine it: you're sitting there and looking around you, you've just come out of a war zone full of ruined houses and burnt-out buildings. You know that you no longer have to take refuge in an air-raid shelter. But you also know that bombs could still fall 80 kilometres down the road in Lviv. I could feel in my whole body just how fragile our freedom actually is.’, Bela Kubat was a guest during the morning talk show at the Ukraine Accountability Conference in the World Forum, The Hague (14 July 2022).

The exact timing of these disbursements will depend on the state of advancement of underlying projects., The package will provide much-needed immediate support to the Ukrainian economy., EIB President Werner Hoyer said: “Today, with the crucial support of the European Commission, we have approved another €1.59 billion under the EIB Ukraine solidarity response package to address Ukraine’s most urgent funding needs and ensure the country can continue to perform its most critical functions, including the rapid reconstruction of social infrastructure facilities. With this emergency package, as part of Team Europe, we are sending a strong message — the European Union and its Bank remain unshakeable in our solidarity with Ukraine and its people, in its hour of need and in the longer-term support of its reconstruction.”, “This will provide the necessary funds to cover urgent needs and ensure the operation of critical infrastructure. We continue to keep in regular contact with Ukraine's government to help flexibly as needed. This is a question of investment in the future of Ukraine, the future of Europe and the future of the free world,”added EIB Vice-President Teresa Czerwińska, who is responsible for operations in Ukraine., Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People, said:“The European Union continues to stand by Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s brutal aggression. This EIB support will keep strategic public sector companies financially viable and able to carry out urgent repairs of critical infrastructure, resume the provision of essential services and address other immediate needs of the Ukrainian people, including those displaced by Russia’s war. The European Commission will keep working with EU Member States and our international partners to support Ukraine on every level — for as long as it takes.”, Sergii Marchenko, Minister of Finance of Ukraine, said:“To rebuild Ukraine, we need strong global support and growing financial assistance. I am grateful to the EIB and the European Union for the long-standing cooperation and financial support and for standing with Ukraine for as long as it takes. This €1.59 billion is a further meaningful contribution to the country's immediate financing needs, which are under unprecedented pressure due to Russia's invasion. With this financial support, we will keep working on restoring damaged infrastructure, resuming the provision of municipal services, including transport services, and preparing for the coming heating season.”, Since Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression started, the EU, Member States and European financial institutions have been united in their unwavering support to Ukraine, consistent with a Team Europe approach.

How the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine is influencing COVID-19 Misinformation in Ten Humanitarian Contexts: Five Data Trends,Analysis,Internews,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Jul 2022,"Internews – Rooted in Trust
Alejandro Posada, INTRODUCTION, Rooted in Trust (RiT) is a global pandemic information response program countering the unprecedented scale and speed of the spread of rumors and misinformation related to COVID-19 in Lebanon, Mali, Colombia, Sudan, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Zimbabwe (see the website). Within Internews we define rumors as an unverified qualitative piece of information documented from a first-hand source within the community. Our rumor tracking methodology allows us to analyze community feedback to understand and respond to the hopes, fears, questions and concerns that often propel the spread of misinformation., The Russian invasion of Ukraine, beginning on February 24th, received substantial media coverage which some could argue partly shifted global public attention away from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the geographic distance between Ukraine and RiT’s countries of focus, we have documented a noteworthy influence of the Ukrainian invasion on the COVID-19 rumor data that we are collecting. Between late February and late May 2022, we collected social media posts and comments consisting of COVID-19 related rumors with a direct mention of the Russian invasion in Ukraine throughout our countries of focus. In response to the collected data, some of our teams have identified and highlighted this new intersection of war and pandemic related rumors (See community bulletins from Lebanon, Iraq, and Sudan)., The purpose of this piece is to present an analysis of the ways in which the Russian invasion of Ukraine has influenced COVID-19 misinformation in several humanitarian contexts based on the data we collected. Though, the data is not meant to be representative of all online conversations or sentiments, rumors can tell us a lot about community concerns, questions, perceptions, and information voids. For this purpose, we analyzed the posts and identified five rumor trends about the intersect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. The trends collected argue that the Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates that:, COVID-19 has disappeared or is no longer a priority, COVID-19 is, and always was a hoax, there is a strategy to divert attention involving COVID-19, there are US biological weapons labs in Ukraine, there are inconsistencies with the state of COVID-19 infections in Ukraine, These findings are meant to be useful for organizations working on health-related topics with vulnerable communities in humanitarian contexts. The findings give light to community concerns, which organizations can use to create responsive programming and fill information gaps. Additionally, the findings can also contribute to the field of “infodemic” management by setting the stage for future research looking at the implications of current events on a misinformation ecosystem., A common and recurrent sentiment across all of the trends identified was a concern over the sudden shift in media coverage from COVID-19 to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which sparked debate within our communities and raised accusations of double standards and disproportionate media coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in comparison with other conflicts or issues, particularly in non-western settings (See pieces by Aljazeera and NPR). In many instances, this was accompanied by recurrent critiques of the role of the West, and particularly the United States, in the global pandemic response., We also identified two particularities of this subset of rumors. The first is that most of the rumors about the Ukraine invasion came from Twitter (51.2%), Facebook (39.5%), and Telegram (3.7%). Whereas, when analyzing the full collection of rumors (including those related and unrelated to Ukraine) during the same period, most rumors came from Facebook (51.1%), Twitter (34%) and YouTube (2.9%). The second is that despite our regular social media and face to face rumor collection we only found cases of rumors about the invasion of Ukraine within our social media data. For more details about the data you can visit our Google data studio., In this report, we will not identify the origins of the rumors or single out cases of disinformation. However, it is important to mention that there is growing evidence about COVID-19 conspiracy theorists readily adopting pro-Russian disinformation about the invasion (See piece by European Digital Media Observatory and NDTV). The remainder of this report goes into a detailed analysis of each of the aforementioned five major trends identified.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/how-2022-russian-invasion-ukraine-influencing-covid-19-misinformation-ten-humanitarian-contexts-five-data-trends

Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",23 Jul 2022,"I want to thank First Lady Zelenska for inviting me to participate, it is truly an honor., I want to express my admiration to the people of Ukraine for its immense bravery, courage, and resiliency., Education is the most powerful force for a peaceful and prosperous future., It is completely unacceptable to deny the right to education to millions of children. To rob children of their dreams. Of their childhood. Of their future., Before the pandemic, children and youth around the world were already experiencing a learning crisis. In fact, over half of children in low-and middle-income countries were living in learning poverty: they were unable to read and understand a simple text by age 10, by the end of primary education., Then came the pandemic, the biggest global shock to education of the century. And children faced unprecedented school closures, which led to immense learning losses. Most countries, including Ukraine, have to face this silent crisis., But Ukrainian children are facing an unthinkable, even deeper crisis. Because in addition to the COVID-related shock, they have now to deal with another shock: the Russian invasion. It is a dreadful tragedy., This crisis must be addressed immediately. Every passing minute counts. Unless we act now, the war will have lasting and massive impacts on the future welfare and productivity of this generation., The war in Ukraine is displacing students and teachers, destroying schools, and harming education delivery., Almost 700,000 students and over 25,000 educators have been displaced. Over 2,000 education institutions have been damaged by bombing and shelling, and more than 200 of these have been completely destroyed. This is an unimaginable attack to education., The Government of Ukraine and the Ministry of Education have taken bold actions to provide learning continuity., They haveexpanded access to online learning platforms, provided psychosocial support for students, and simplified the university admissions process., Also, thanks to the All-Ukrainian Online School digital platform that was established during the pandemic, around 85% of schools were able to complete the 2021-2022 school year., The Government has facilitated academic mobility for higher education students, internally and across Europe., But despite these efforts, the impact of the war on learning is severe, as the war decreases both the amount of instruction time children receive, and the quality of that instruction., To safeguard the future of Ukrainian students, the World Bank is supporting education in Ukraine through various initiatives., We are supporting the government to pay teachers’ salaries., Second, we are dedicating US$100 million to the provision of scholarships for students in higher education., Third, we are supporting an online tutoring program for displaced students in Ukraine. The program aims to recover learning losses and provide psychosocial support., But, this is not enough. We estimate that the costs of recovery and reconstruction of the education sector in Ukraine amount to more than US$9 billion. To address the crisis, we need different ways to deliver the education services., Damaged schools need to be reconstructed., Remote learning must complement in-person instruction, to guarantee the continuity of learning., Recovery must include remedial programs to help children catch up. Many children will be far behind grade-level expectations., Psychosocial support is also imperative. Children have been isolated.

Update 87 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (22 July 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,22 Jul 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, said recent reports about the Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) indicate an increasingly alarming situation there and he called for maximum restraint to avoid any accident that could threaten public health in Ukraine and elsewhere., “These reports are very disturbing and further underline the importance of the IAEA going to the Zaporizhzya plant. I’m continuing my determined efforts to agree and lead a safety, security and safeguards mission to the site as soon as possible. It is urgent,” Director General Grossi said., The IAEA has not been able to visit the Russian-occupied facility in Ukraine's south since before the conflict began five months ago. It is therefore not in a position to confirm or deny the reports about the country's largest nuclear power plant (NPP), with six reactors., “However, we take them very seriously. From the beginning of the military conflict in Ukraine, the IAEA has warned about the risk of a severe nuclear accident in a country with 15 reactors at four operational NPPs. In view of the recent unconfirmed reports about events at or near the Zaporizhzya NPP, I am gravely concerned about this very real danger, with potentially serious consequences,” Director General Grossi said., “It is extremely important that no action is taken that could in any way jeopardize the safety of this plant, which is also Europe’s largest. During a conflict of this nature, a nuclear facility can be damaged unintentionally. It must be avoided at all costs.”, In recent weeks, there have been a series of reports – both in the media and in the form of official communications received by the IAEA – suggesting that the already difficult and stressful conditions facing Ukrainian staff at the plant have deteriorated further, an issue that the Director General has previously spoken about. In addition, there have been reports in recent days indicating other potential dangers for the plant’s safety., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that the IAEA must be able to send a mission to the Zaporizhzya NPP to conduct essential safety, security and safeguards activities at the facility., As an independent and impartial organization, the presence of the IAEA would also be crucial for having a better understanding of the situation at the NPP, which has been controlled by Russian forces since 4 March but continues to be operated by its Ukrainian staff, he said., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the four operational NPPs, but it is still experiencing a partial loss of safeguards data transfer from Chornobyl, the Director General said., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including three at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The other reactors have been shut down for regular maintenance. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-87-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-22-july-2022

"Black Sea Grain Initiative ‘a Beacon of Hope, Relief’ for World, Says Secretary General, as War Coninues in Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN SG,Food and Nutrition,22 Jul 2022,"SG/SM/21381, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks at the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, in Istanbul today:, Today, there is a beacon on the Black Sea. A beacon of hope — a beacon of possibility — a beacon of relief — in a world that needs it more than ever., I want to recognize and thank all those who helped make it happen. To our hosts, President Recep Erdoğan and the Government of Türkiye: Your facilitation and persistence have been essential through every step of this process. To the representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine: You have overcome obstacles and put aside differences to pave the way for an initiative that will serve the common interests of all., Promoting the welfare of humanity has been the driving force of these talks. The question has not been what is good for one side or the other. The focus has been on what matters most for the people of our world., And let there be no doubt — this is an agreement for the world. It will bring relief for developing countries on the edge of bankruptcy and the most vulnerable people on the edge of famine. And it will help stabilize global food prices which were already at record levels even before the war — a true nightmare for developing countries., Specifically, the initiative we just signed opens a path for significant volumes of commercial food exports from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea — Odesa, Chornomorsk and Yuzhne., The shipment of grain and food stocks into world markets will help bridge the global food supply gap and reduce pressure on high prices., This agreement did not come easy., Since the war started, I have been highlighting that there is no solution to the global food crisis without ensuring full global access to Ukraine’s food products and Russian food and fertilizers. Today, we took important steps to achieve this objective. But it has been a long road., In April, after being received by President Erdoğan, I met with President Vladimir V. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to propose a plan for solutions. We have been working every day since., It took immense efforts and commitment by all sides and weeks of around-the-clock negotiations. That commitment and dedication are even more vital today., This initiative must be fully implemented, because the world so desperately needs it to tackle the global food crisis. We count on the Government of Türkiye to maintain its critical role going forward., I am here to pledge the full commitment of the United Nations. We will remain closely involved in working for the agreement’s success. We are ramping up efforts to ensure the United Nations is positioned to deliver on its commitments., I am grateful for the work of the two United Nations task forces that developed a parallel, coherent and coordinated approach. One led by Martin Griffiths — Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and including the International Maritime Organization — focused on the shipment of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea., Today, we are announcing the establishment of a Joint Coordination Centre to monitor implementation of the Black Sea initiative., The other task force led by Rebeca Grynspan — Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) — centred on facilitating the unimpeded access to food and fertilizers originating in the Russian Federation to global markets — and it also resulted in an agreement., I urge all sides to spare no effort to implement their commitments. We must also spare no effort for peace., This is an unprecedented agreement between two parties engaged in bloody conflict. But that conflict continues. People are dying every day. Fighting is raging every day., The beacon of hope on the Black Sea is shining bright today, thanks to the collective efforts of so many., In these trying and turbulent times for the region and our globe, let that beacon guide the way towards easing human suffering and securing peace., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Jul 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Last week again saw one of the deadliest single attacks, when at least 25 civilians were killed in Vinnytsia on 14 July, Eastern Donetska and southern Mykolaivska oblasts were affected by hostilities daily, causing damage to residential buildings and infrastructure facilities and killing civilians., Over 11,800 civilian casualties, including more than 5,100 killed, have been verified as of 17 July. However, the actual number of casualties is likely much higher, While people continue to return home, new waves of displacement are anticipated due to insecurity and lack of gas and water supply in affected areas, Despite significant challenges, including access to the hardest-hit locations, humanitarian actors have reached 11 million people across Ukraine, ANALYSIS, General security and humanitarian situation, About to enter its sixth month, the war in Ukraine the past week again featured what has become a worrying trend – missiles striking residential and commercial areas of a city and causing dozens of civilian casualties in a single incident. Reported missile strikes in Vinnytsia in central-west Ukraine on 14 July resulted in the deaths of 25 people, and over 200 others sought medical attention, 68 of whom were hospitalized. Among those reported to have been killed was a 4-year-old girl with Down syndrome, while a woman who died five days later from her injuries was identified as a neurologist and a mother of three. The attack on Vinnytsia is the third deadliest single attack recorded in Ukraine since 24 February. This incident also followed a missile strike on 9 July on Chasiv Yar in Government-controlled areas of eastern Donetska oblast that destroyed a municipal dormitory for vulnerable people, killing 48 civilians and injuring 9 and the shelling of a residential building and recreation centre in Serhiivka in southern Odeska oblast on 1 July that killed at least 21 people. The United Nations (UN) and other humanitarian actors have condemned the indiscriminate use of weapons in civilian areas, as the UN Chief António Guterres did following the attack on Vinnytsia in his statement, calling for “accountability for such violations.”, Meanwhile, the main fighting remained focused along the front line in eastern Donetska oblast. Authorities in Government-controlled-areas, entities in non-Government-controlled areas of the oblast and humanitarian partners, continued to report the shelling of residential areas, damage to civilian infrastructure, and civilians being killed and injured. In Government-controlled areas, the cities of Kramatorsk and especially Sloviansk – currently both on the front line – were reported to be under attack daily, with remaining residents being urged to evacuate. On 18 July, six civilians were reportedly killed when a missile struck a building further south in Toretsk, while two others were rescued from the rubble. More shelling and casualties in central Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were reported on 19 July. And photos taken in Sloviansk on 19 July for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) show damaged residential buildings and, in one case, an older man wearing bandages. Another photo shows a woman trying to clean up her balcony in a badly damaged apartment building – lacking windows and with the next apartment completely gutted and blackened by fire and smoke. These images vividly illustrate the conditions in which people live in many parts of Donetska oblast and the level of support required to help them prepare for the upcoming winter. In non-Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast, cities and towns including Donetsk, Horlivka, Makiivka and Yasynuvata were also reported to be under fire daily. Just on 15 July, 12 civilians were reported to have been killed and 64 injured in 10 settlements, while several buildings, including schools and health-care facilities, have been damaged., Similar to previous weeks, fighting and shelling were reported in other parts of the country. There were reports of daily missile attacks on Mykolaiv city and Mykolaivska oblast in southern Ukraine, as well as of only slightly less frequent attacks in neighbouring Odeska oblast. On 19 July alone, 43 people were reportedly injured in Mykolaiv, while hundreds more were already hospitalized with injuries received earlier. City authorities are reportedly considering “closing” the city for security-related reasons, which might prevent people from evacuating and put them at additional risk when the next attack happens. Closer to the Donbas region, there were also more reports of missile strikes and casualties in the city of Dnipro and Dnipropetrovska oblast on 14-16 July and in south-east Zaporizka oblast on 14 July. Eastern Kharkivska and north-eastern Sumska oblasts also continued to be impacted by shelling, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-20-jul-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Jul 2022,"It has been more than five months since the conflict in Ukraine erupted, causing mass destruction, and upending the lives of millions. As a result, more than 15 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance. The Red Cross is committed to providing long-term support for those in need. More than just delivering aid, the Red Cross is committed to offering safety, support and community amid the heartache., Global Red Cross Response, Around the clock, global Red Cross teams continue providing critical service to the people of Ukraine. Thus far, Red Cross teams have supported the following:, In Ukraine: Aid Amidst Violence and Uncertainty, More than 6.3 million people are currently displaced within Ukraine. Under danger to themselves, Ukrainian Red Cross team continue to help people and communities impacted by conflict. These teams have reached more than 2 million people within Ukraine through shelter, housing and relief support. Red Crossers are offering health care support and migration assistance to those in need., Teams from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are in the country and working to assist the most vulnerable, particularly in the eastern part of Ukraine where many face loss of electricity, difficulty accessing drinking water and severe shortages of medicines and available medical assistance. Thus far, ICRC teams have delivered more than 2,000 tons of food, medical supplies and relief items. Teams are providing Ukrainians with water treatment chemicals, water tanks and working to repair water and electrical infrastructure damaged in the fighting., Within the country, more than 200 health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Many pharmacies are closed, stocks of medicines are low, at least 73 health care workers have died, and many have left, leaving people without access to health care and critical medicines needed. The lack of income and the disruption in financial services are also contributing to the rise in the need for basic necessities., Damaged roads have disrupted supply chains, leaving communities cut off from food and basic supplies. Today, many civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely. The ICRC remains committed to the safe passage of these civilians and thus far has supported and coordinated humanitarian corridors and evacuations, including the evacuation of more than 10,000 civilians., Red Cross volunteers will continue to increase their work reuniting separated families, providing food and other household items and increasing awareness about areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance. The current needs are tremendous, critical among them include water delivery, support to health facilities and medical care for wounded families., In Neighboring Countries, Challenges Remain, Across Europe, Red Cross volunteers are supporting more than 5.9 million refugees who have fled Ukraine in a variety of ways to address both immediate and long-term needs., Families who have fled are debating their next moves beyond an emergency mindset. Some people are starting to return to Ukraine to check on loved ones, homes left behind and the state of their communities. Others are crossing the border into Ukraine multiple times to seek specific services as resources dwindle. Many families are uneasy about planting firm roots far from home because their ultimate goal is to return., It is summer and tourism season has arrived, placing pressure on businesses and communities including hotels, guest houses and host families where many people who have fled the conflict have sought shelter. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Red Cross Societies in Ukraine and neighboring countries are providing emergency cash to people to use for rent and any other purpose they see fit, as well as support to host families to ease financial strains., People who have been displaced need longer-term support. Many people face difficulty securing longer-term housing without employment contracts, creating a ripple effect of needs. Language barriers complicate the likelihood of getting hired. The Red Cross is offering language courses in some countries to help, as well as facilitating connections between government partners and job seekers., Healthcare needs for displaced people remain high. To help alleviate immense pressure on Ukraine's healthcare system as well as in neighboring countries, the IFRC and Red Cross Societies are operating multiple healthcare facilities, including clinics at the border, mobile health teams in Ukraine and first aid posts across several countries. Chronic illnesses remain a concern for people who have fled home and have been unable to receive treatment, as do growing mental health needs., The Red Cross is already planning for seasonal challenges like winter when needs will likely look different. From the beginning of the conflict, frontline workers have provided tangible relief like food, water, blankets, hygiene items and SIM cards to reconnect families. Those needs still exist and are shifting toward seasonal support. Warm shelter and clothing are among the many items people will need when the weather gets colder. Red Cross teams are working with local partners and authorities to prepare and anticipate the upcoming needs for people in need., Role of the American Red Cross, For its part, the American Red Cross has contributed over $50 million to Ukraine crisis relief efforts. This includes $40.3 million to the IFRC to support the most vital humanitarian needs of those affected, including food, shelter, critical care items and first aid. The American Red Cross has also contributed $2 million to the ICRC to support their life-saving efforts within Ukraine and contributed $8.8 million to the Danish Red Cross to provide food and non-perishable food items, first aid kits, blankets and hygiene kits to people displaced within Ukraine., Additionally, the American Red Cross has contributed an additional $7.5 million to partners on the ground --- including $6 million to World Central Kitchen to provide meals for those in Ukraine and surrounding countries and $1.5 million to International Medical Corps to provide medical supplies within Ukraine., The American Red Cross has also deployed several international crisis responders to Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania to provide humanitarian relief in support of the international Red Cross operation helping families who fled their homes. These highly trained crisis responders---who are lending skills such as information management, cash assistance programming, GIS systems, communications and crisis leadership --- are supporting on-the-ground relief efforts alongside local teams, including the Polish Red Cross, Moldovan Red Cross and Romanian Red Cross., Additionally, in line with its work supporting military families, the American Red Cross has sent trained staff to Europe to support emergency communication needs of U.S. military members, so they can stay in touch with family members back home. The Red Cross Hero Care Network is a Congressionally-chartered program that connects service members and their families in times of need. Red Crossers are also distributing comfort kits, containing hygiene items and other necessities to service members and U.S. State Department staff., Blood Services, At this time, the American Red Cross is not shipping blood products to Ukraine. The American Red Cross does not ship blood products outside the U.S. without a specific request from the U.S. Department of State, from the United Nations, or unless we have a request from affected Red Cross or Red Crescent societies abroad., Can I Volunteer or Donate Goods?, In countries around the world, Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations have their own staff and volunteers who are trained to respond to large-scale disaster operations. The American Red Cross sends highly specialized and experienced professionals with technical skills and expertise abroad only after the Red Cross or Red Crescent team requests assistance. Those not already on the Red Cross's international disaster roster will not have the opportunity to deploy at this time. We encourage you to connect with your local Red Cross chapter for future opportunities or to visit redcross.org/volunteer for more information., While we are grateful for the outpouring of support, it's important to know that neither the American Red Cross, nor our global Red Cross partners, are accepting the donation of in-kind goods such as food, clothing, blankets or toys at this time. These items can be difficult to manage on the ground and divert resources from our mission. Other charitable organizations are better suited to manage such donations., International Humanitarian Law, ICRC called on authorities to adhere to international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and infrastructure delivering essential services, including power and water facilities, schools and hospitals. In Ukraine, over 200 health facilities and 1,635 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC, requested protection for humanitarian action so that aid agencies can maintain access to civilians. ICRC has also called for parties to agree to terms so safe passage of civilians is possible., Protecting Red Cross Workers, The Red Cross emblem is strictly regulated under humanitarian law. In armed conflict, it may be used by medical staff and facilities, including army medics and vehicles. It may also be used by Red Cross and Red Crescent workers, vehicles, facilities and the humanitarian relief they bring.
Resources for People Affected by the Conflict, How to Find a Missing Loved One, If you are trying to locate or get in touch with a U.S. citizen, please contact the U.S. Department of State Overseas Citizens Services Office online or call 1-888-407-4747. However, if you are looking for a family member who is not a U.S. citizen but is located in either Ukraine or Russia, the Red Cross may be able to reconnect you through our Restoring Family Links program., In neighboring countries where Ukrainians have fled, the Red Cross is distributing SIM cards for cell phones, so people can get in touch with their loved ones. Some family members have maintained contact with each other, but the situation is rapidly changing. As of now, most have maintained their own family connections via cell phones, but it is important to note that the telecommunication systems in the region have been affected. The ICRC and Ukraine Red Cross will continue to work together to help reconnect families, despite considerable challenges on the ground., How can I learn more about the Red Cross response?, ICRC and IFRC have a comprehensive list of resources, including maps, press releases, videos, photos and stories, further expanding upon Red Cross efforts in the region. For more information about the American Red Cross support, visit redcross.org/ukaine., About the American Red Cross:, *The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to victims of disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families. The Red Cross is a nonprofit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to deliver its mission. *For more information, please visit redcross.org or cruzrojaamericana.org, or visit us on Twitter at @RedCross.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-red-cross-support-unwavering-conflict-continues
"Ukraine: Torture, Disappearances in Occupied South [EN/RU/UK]",Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jul 2022,"Apparent War Crimes by Russian Forces in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia Regions, (Kyiv, July 22, 2022) – Russian forces have tortured, unlawfully detained, and forcibly disappeared civilians in the occupied areas of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, Human Rights Watch said today. Russian forces have also tortured prisoners of war (POWs) held there., “Russian forces have turned occupied areas of southern Ukraine into an abyss of fear and wild lawlessness,” said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Torture, inhumane treatment, as well as arbitrary detention and unlawful confinement of civilians, are among the apparent war crimes we have documented, and Russian authorities need to end such abuses immediately and understand that they can, and will, be held accountable.”, Human Rights Watch spoke with 71 people from Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Skadovsk and 10 other cities and towns in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. They described 42 cases in which Russian occupation forces either forcibly disappeared civilians or otherwise held them arbitrarily, in some cases incommunicado, and tortured many of them. Human Rights Watch also documented the torture of three members of the Territorial Defense Forces who were POWs. Two of them died., The purpose of the abuse seems to be to obtain information and to instill fear so that people will accept the occupation, as Russia seeks to assert sovereignty over occupied territory in violation of international law, Human Rights Watch said., People interviewed described being tortured, or witnessing torture, through prolonged beatings and in some cases electric shocks. They described injuries including broken ribs and other bones and teeth, severe burns, concussions, broken blood vessels in the eye, cuts, and bruises., A formerly detained protest organizer, who requested anonymity, said Russian forces beat him with a baseball bat in detention. Another protestor was hospitalized for a month for injuries from beatings in detention. A third said that after seven days in detention he could “barely walk” and had broken ribs and a broken kneecap., The wife of a man whom Russian forces detained for four days, following a house search in early July, said his captors beat her husband with a metal rod, used electroshock on him, injured his shoulder, and gave him a concussion., Describing the pervasive fear, one journalist in Kherson said: “You don’t know when they’ll come for you and when they’ll let you go.”, Former detainees described being blindfolded and handcuffed for the entire duration of their detention and being held with very little food and water and no medical assistance. Russian personnel forcibly transferred at least one civilian detainee to Russian occupied Crimea, where he was forced to carry out “corrective labor.”, In several cases, Russian forces released detainees only after they signed a statement promising to “cooperate” with the authorities or recorded a video in which they exhorted others to cooperate., In all but one of the detention cases, Russian forces did not tell families where their loved ones were being held, and the Russian military commander’s office provided no information to families seeking it., The laws of war allow a warring party in an international armed conflict to detain combatants as POWs and to intern civilians in noncriminal detention if their activities pose a serious threat to the security of the detaining authority. Arbitrary detention, unlawful confinement, and enforced disappearances are all prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to or involve multiple war crimes. Torture and inhuman treatment of any detainee is prohibited under all circumstances under international law, and, when connected to an armed conflict, constitutes a war crime and may also constitute a crime against humanity., For civilians, the risk of arbitrary detention and torture under occupation is high, but they do not have a clear option to leave to Ukrainian-controlled territory, Human Rights Watch said. For example, the journalist in Kherson told Human Rights Watch, “I have my own Telegram channel, I’m in their database, I had to go into hiding. I’ve been warned that they can come for me at any time. I don’t risk leaving because I’m on their [blacklist].” Thirteen people who did leave described harrowing trips through numerous Russian checkpoints and detention., In an interview with Human Rights Watch, Tamila Tasheva, permanent representative of the Ukraine president in Crimea, who also monitors the situation in newly occupied areas in southern Ukraine, said that Ukraine’s authorities cannot verify the exact number of enforced disappearances in Kherson region. She said that human rights monitors estimated that at least 600 people had been forcibly disappeared there since February 2022., “Ukrainians in occupied areas are living through a hellish ordeal,” Gorbunova said. “Russian authorities should immediately investigate war crimes and other abuses by their forces in these areas, as should international investigative bodies with a view to pursuing prosecutions.”, Russian forces invaded Kherson region, on the Black Sea and Dnipro River, on February 25, 2022, and on March 3 claimed to control its capital, Kherson. It was part of a broader invasion and occupation of Ukraine’s coastal south, which includes Melitopol and Berdynsk, cities in Zaporizhzhia region, and ultimately Mariupol, in Donetsk region., Ukrainian forces have started preparing a counteroffensive to retake occupied coastal areas, Ukraine’s defense minister said in July. On June 21, an official in the Russian occupation administration stated that a “referendum” on Kherson region “joining Russia” was planned in the fall., From the start of the occupation, Russian military targeted for detention or capture not only members of Territorial Defense Forces, who should be treated as POWs under international humanitarian law, but also local mayors and other civil servants, police officers, as well as participants in anti-occupation protests, journalists, or others presumed to have security-related information or to oppose the occupation., Over time Russian forces also started to detain people, apparently at random, according to numerous sources. They also targeted community volunteers who distributed food, medicines, diapers and other necessities, all in very short supply in Kherson, to people in need., For this report, Human Rights Watch interviewed people in person in Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia, and also conducted interviews by telephone., Torture of Prisoners of War, On March 27, Russian forces captured, held, and repeatedly tortured three members of Kherson’s Territorial Defense Forces, Vitali Lapchuk, a commander; Denis Mironov, his deputy; and a Territorial Defense Forces volunteer “Oleh” together with a civilian, “Serhii,” whose real names are withheld for their protection. Mironov, 41, died from injuries inflicted during beatings in detention. Lapchuk’s body was found on May 22 in the bay in Kherson, his arms bound, and a weight tied to his legs. Oleh, who was injured from torture, was part of a prisoner exchange with Russian POWs held by Ukraine on April 28., Denis Mironov and Oleh, “Oleh,” a Territorial Defense Forces volunteer, said that he was to meet Mironov and Lapchuk on the morning of March 27, but when he went to the appointed place, he did not see them. As he was about to leave, two men in civilian clothes approached him. They knocked him down and handcuffed him, then led him around the corner, where he saw three more men, whom he believed to be Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents, uniformed, heavily armed, and wearing balaclavas. Mironov and Lapchuk were standing against a wall, in handcuffs., The FSB agents took the three men to the former National Police Directorate building in Kherson on 4 Liuteranska Street (formerly Kirova Street)., Oleh said that on the first day, he was blindfolded and interrogated for 12 hours, and that the agents beat him, gave him electric shocks, and tried to suffocate him with a plastic bag. “It’s impossible to say how many times they tortured me, because you lose all track of time,” he said. Eventually, he, Mironov, and Serhii, ended up in the same room. The agent knocked Oleh down. He said his blindfold shifted, and he could see the agents hit Mironov several times in the face and kick him in the groin. They took off Mironov’s trousers and beat him with a rubber club. “His body just turned into a blackened mess,” he said., After more questioning, the agents took Oleh to a basement cell, where, approximately 30 minutes later, three men brought in a detached door and thew it on the floor. Two soldiers “practically carried in Denis [Mironov] … he was very badly injured … They lowered him down onto the door. He lay down and didn’t move anymore.”, The next day the men were taken to another building in the complex, which had been a temporary detention facility, and placed them in different cells. After about four days, Oleh was transferred to a larger cell. He had seen the date on an FSB agent’s watch, which he recognized as his own. He kept track of time by sticking pieces of chewed chewing gum on the wall., On April 6, Oleh was transferred to yet another cell, together with Mironov., “Denis was in pitiable state ... He spoke in a whisper, one word at a time … could not finish a sentence. He groaned, he could not cough, it was obvious that his chest was pierced, and his ribs were pressing on his lungs. He could not lie down properly … he could only sit.”, Russian personnel brought three cans, 250 grams each, of army rations every two days, for all five people in the cell. “They always took out chocolate and meat beforehand so only gave us these cans and some dry biscuits,” Oleh said. “I have not seen a piece of bread once that whole time. We all lost a lot of weight. Denis could eat only apple sauce … We spoon-fed him … For 22 days without any medical attention, he was slowly dying.”, At one point, Oleh’s captors forced him and two others to state on camera, with the flags of Ukraine and the far-right wing militant group, Right Sector, in the background that “the Territorial Defense Force in Kherson no longer exists, but there are still patriots, and everyone should fight.” “Later I realize they posted this video on social media, to see who would post likes and comments, [to entrap people],” he said., On April 18, Oleh, Mironov, and the other cellmates were transferred to Sevastopol, in occupied Crimea. The next day, Mironov was taken to a hospital. “I was relieved … but it was too late for him,” Oleh said. Oleh was exchanged on April 28., He said that seven of his ribs had been broken and were not yet healed when he spoke with Human Rights Watch on July 9. Most of his teeth were broken and at least six were missing: “I have a concussion. I continue to have severe headaches. All of our limbs were beaten … All of our backs, hips, buttocks, shoulders … were blue [from beatings]. Everyone’s kidneys had been beaten, so we peed pink.”, In a separate interview, Ksenia Mironova, Denis’s wife, told Human Rights Watch that on April 8, after Mironova left Kherson, an acquaintance called her and said a man had brought her Denis’ watch, and said that he was being held at the facility on Liuteranska Street (formerly Kirova Street), that he had chest injuries, could not walk, and had to be spoon-fed. Mironova wrote to the facility, which responded that no such person was there. After she learned he had been transferred to Sevastopol, she tried unsuccessfully to get information from Crimea about him., On May 24, Mironova said, the Mykolaiv police phoned her to say Denis had died in the hospital. Oleh identified the body, upon Mironova’s request. He said that “the date of death was written in green antiseptic on his leg: 23.04.” The death certificate, issued by Ukrainian authorities who received the body and which Human Rights Watch reviewed, states the cause of death as “blunt trauma to the rib cage – pnemothorax."", Oleh also said that Serhii, who had been detained with him, and the two other men, on eof them also a civilian, were severely beaten in detention, and that he saw Serhii with bruises and cuts on his head. He was released on April 5., Death of Vitali Lapchuk, Lapchuk, 48, was not taken to the basement with the others on the day they were detained. Lapchuk’s wife, Alyona, a local businesswoman, said that at around 1 p.m. on March 27, she was at her mother’s house with her mother and her eldest son, when three vehicles emblazoned with the letter Z drove up to the house., “My husband called me, and said ‘Open up, they’re going to take the weapons.’ I opened the door, and I almost passed out. His jaw was all black, broken, his eyes’ blood vessels were broken. His face was striped with rifle blows. … There were nine armed men with him. Vitali told one of them, ‘You gave me your word as an officer that [if I gave up the weapons] you won’t touch my family.’”, The armed men took Lapchuk to the basement, where the weapons were. Alyona could hear them beating her husband. Her mother, she said, got a Bible and started praying and weeping. When they brought Lapchuk back up from the basement, she said she could see blood coming out of his cheek and based on her previous experience as a medical worker, believed that he had a cheekbone fracture., The armed men put bags over the heads of Lapchuk, Alyona and her son, and took them to the police station on Liuteranska Street (formerly Kirova Street), where they held them for several hours. “They asked me if I was a fascist … I told them that my grandfather was Jewish and that I was Ukrainian. They said, ‘there is no such country.’”, All the while Alyona and her son could hear them beating and interrogating her husband in the next room. “I told them if they thought he did something wrong, there are courts for that, but you can’t just beat a man to death,” she said. “I could not believe what was happening.”, Russian soldiers put Alyona and her son in a car and said that Vitali “was a terrorist and would answer to Russian Federation law.” The soldiers dumped Alyona and her son under a bridge, and they walked home, arriving at approximately 4 a.m., Starting on March 28, Alyona searched for Lapchuk. After she learned of Oleh’s release, from Crimea, she said she searched all over Crimea, and also Rostov and Taganrog, through her friends and connections in Russia., On June 9, a pathologist sent her a text, asking her to call the next day. “I knew immediately. I sobbed all night, then I called the prosecutor [in charge of Lapchuk’s case] and said, ‘I won’t survive this, call [the pathologist] yourself.’” The prosecutor later called Alyona, telling her that on May 22, a young man who had been catching crayfish found her husband’s body floating, his arms tied, a weight tied to his legs., “All that time I had been praying that he was alive,” she said., Protesters, Journalists, Activists, Media reported public protests against the occupation in Kherson, Berdyansk and Melitopol, in March, April and early May. Russian forces put some down violently, including in Kherson, using live bullets and wounding some protesters. Two witnesses said that Russian troops aimed for people’s legs; one said that he saw a man who was hit in the legs. Russian forces also hunted down community volunteers who distributed aid to people in need., Human Rights Watch spoke to nine people who organized, participated in, or witnessed the protests or were community volunteers, all of whom had been detained by Russian forces., Protesters, Kherson, Arkadiy Dovzhenko, 29, a marine biologist from Kherson, said that people in Kherson started protesting in large numbers from the beginning of the occupation and that he joined:, I was just a regular Ukrainian guy. But one day at a protest I picked up the microphone to say: ‘Russians, go home.’ That’s how they heard my voice … and decided I was the organizer. Then Russian journalists started coming, and we made the decision: that we will stop them from getting a pretty picture for their propaganda TV., Dovzhenko described his detention on April 21:, That day they [began] throwing grenades with teargas. They shot people with real bullets. They aimed at people’s legs. I saw several guys who had to be carried away, who were shot. There was blood on the pavement., Russian forces detained Dovzhenko as he tried to run from the scene, and took him, blindfolded and hands bound, to the basement of a police building, and from there to another room:, They hit me with clubs, punched and kicked me. It lasted for several hours … In about three hours they took me back to the basement. Then they brought me back up. They asked me the same questions. Who organized this protest rally? Who organized other protest rallies? They asked me if I knew anyone at ATO [Ukrainian military and security force operations in Donbas] [and] for addresses [of other] protesters. They also asked me questions about my religion … told me that Ukrainian Orthodox Christians were terrorists and renegades., Russian forces held Dovzhenko for seven days, handcuffed and blindfolded for the entire time, interrogating him repeatedly every day. “They gave me water, but it was very bad … They fed us from their food rations. It was almost nothing.”, When they released Dovzhenko, he said, he could barely walk: “I had a brain concussion. I had several broken ribs and a broken kneecap.”, Dovzhenko left Kherson in May, but it took three days of harrowing travel through numerous Russian checkpoints to get 200 kilometers to safety in Kryvy Rih., City in Kherson Region (name of the city withheld for security reasons), A local municipal deputy from a city in Kherson region who participated in protests said that around June 7, Russian forces searched his home, beat him for two hours with a baseball bat, and held him, blindfolded, for 36 hours in a cell at a makeshift detention center at a children’s summer camp. They filmed him against his will stating he had agreed to become an FSB informer. They released him 24 hours later, threatening to hold him indefinitely if he did not stop protesting and doing volunteer work. After they returned to his home several more times to harass him, he fled the country., “Anton,” Berdyansk, On March 18, Russian forces detained a protest organizer “Anton” in occupied Berdyansk at a traffic intersection, while he was delivering aid to people in the community. Anton told Human Rights Watch that they drove him, blindfolded and handcuffed, to what he believed was a local police station. The Russian forces asked him whether he was a protest organizer, and when he said no, they hit him with his shoe, knocking him over, and kicked and punched him for several minutes. “I told them I was not a protest organizer, just a patriot of my country, Ukraine. They said, there is no such country.”, The Russian forces made him take off his jeans, taped his legs together and continued beating him. They administered electric shocks through clips they attached to his earlobes, at first for a few seconds, then for up to 20 seconds, while asking questions about protests and his volunteer work. “Everything went dark and I saw orange spots,” he said. “They took an automatic [weapon] and pointed it at my groin and told me to prepare to die.”, After 90 minutes, they led him to a cell, where, he said, he coughed up blood for three hours. On his third day in custody, Russian security personnel blindfolded him and took him to the facility’s second floor, where they made him read on camera a statement they had written, that he had organized protests, urging people not to attend protests, and to trust the new authorities., They warned that if he did not do the recording, they would detain his son and grandson. “One man held the [text], one filmed, and a third stood behind the camera with his automatic pointed at me. They made me read it twice, as they didn’t like the first one.” After three days in detention the Russian forces released him., He sought medical help for numerous bruises, broken blood vessels in his eyes, and leg injuries. He left on April 5 for a city under Ukrainian control, where he was hospitalized and treated for the injuries, mainly to his ankles. “The soft tissue was crushed. I had about 20 centimeters of [swelling] under the skin and [was at risk of] gangrene. The [doctors] removed it and I had a skin graft. I lay in bed for 22 days without getting up [and] was discharged on May 18.”, Journalists and Volunteers, Novaya Kakhovka, On March 12, Russian forces detained and held incommunicado Oleh Baturin, a journalist from Kherson region. Baturin told Human Rights Watch that on the morning of March 10, he received a message apparently from his friend, Serhyi Tsyhypa, a former Donbas veteran, asking to meet. When Baturin did not see Tsyhypa at the rendezvous point in Kakhovka, a nearby town, he started walking away. Several men in military garb ran toward him: “They screamed for me to get on the ground, handcuffed me and pulled a hood of my jacket over my head so I could not see anything. They didn’t say who they were, did not tell me what I as accused of or why I was being abducted in this manner.”, The military took Baturin to a local administrative building, where they questioned and beat him: “They told me I was done with [journalism] and threatened to kill me.” Then they took him to the Kherson city police station, where he was questioned again. “All the while I could hear people screaming somewhere nearby and I heard shooting from automatic weapons.” Baturin spent the night in an unheated room at the police station, handcuffed to a radiator. The next day he was taken to a pretrial detention facility in Kherson, where he was questioned every day until his release on March 20., Tsyhypa is still missing. His wife, Olena, said that witnesses saw him being detained at a checkpoint. A passerby found Tsyhypa’s dog, who was with him the day he disappeared, tied up outside city hall., Snihurivka, On April 6, Russian forces detained Yurii, a Baptist pastor, at a checkpoint in Snihurivka, in Mykolaiv region, near the administrative border with Kherson region, where he had purchased food, medicines, and other basic items for the community in Kherson. After finding several photos on his phone of Russian military equipment, taken in the first days of the invasion, they drove him to a police lock-up., The held him for six days, in a small freezing cell with no electricity, little food, and barely any water. They questioned him about his involvement in protests and his role as a priest in encouraging people to protest. They confiscated his car, with US$2,000 worth of medicines and humanitarian aid, and what he said was $6,000 of his own money. Russian soldiers at the checkpoint told Yurii that his car was with the FSB in Kherson. He was released under condition that he continue delivering aid to Kherson and pass on information about Ukrainian checkpoints to Russian forces., Yuri fled Kherson with his wife the next day., Local Officials, Civil Servants, In newly occupied areas, Russian authorities arrested numerous elected officials, business owners, community activists and people with influence, including the mayor of Melitopol, the mayor of Kherson city, and heads of local administrations. Tasheva, the Ukraine president’s representative, said that as of June 28, among the 431 cases of unlawful detention that Ukrainian law enforcement agencies had opened were six involving mayors of cities in the Kherson region, the heads of three local territorial administration units, 17 regional and local council members, and 43 law enforcement officials. She said 162 were still in detention., Human Rights Watch documented cases in which a former municipal volunteer, a former policeman, and a head of a regional administration were either detained, or whose family members were unlawfully detained, apparently to pressure them. One remains in custody., Russian forces in Kherson detained a 36-year-old former policeman on May 27, after they searched his house and found his police uniform and his father’s hunting rifle, his wife said. The man had worked on the police hotline., The man’s family went every day to the military commandant’s office but were given no information on his whereabouts. “They told us that … that someone was ‘working on him,’” his wife said. Eventually she started going to the pretrial detention center, where on the 28th day of her husband’s detention, a guard accepted the food parcel she had brought for him. Her husband was released on July 12. His wife did not wish to discuss his physical condition, aside from noting that he bore “marks of physical violence.” “You know how they torture people there,” she said., On April 8, Russian forces detained Vladyslav (Vlad) Buryak, 16, at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, about 70 kilometers from Melitopol, as he was attempting to get to Zaporizhzhia, said his father, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional administration. The father had left Melitopol earlier fearing for his safety, but his son refused to leave because his grandfather was ill and could not travel., As the soldiers checked passengers’ documents, one of them saw Vlad looking at his phone. They demanded to see it and found several pro-Ukraine Telegram channels on it. One of the soldiers told Vlad to get out of the car, pointed a gun at him and asked if he should shoot him on the spot. The military interrogated Vlad for three hours and, upon discovering who his father was, took him to a police holding facility in Vasylivka, where they kept him in a solitary cell. Buryak told HRW that while in detention, his son was forced to wash the bloodied floors in the facility, including in empty cells, “where Ukrainian [military] were tortured.”, After Vlad spent 48 days in detention, the Russian military transported him to a hotel in Melitopol, where he was held for an additional 42 days, but had regular access to a phone and was able to contact his family. On July 7, Vlad was released., On June 30, armed Russian forces detained 40-year-old “Alina” and her ex-mother-in-law at Alina’s former husband’s house near Kherson, where they all had been staying since the invasion, Alina’s sister said., The sister said she believes they were detained because of Alina and her former husband’s participation in the Kherson municipal guard, a community police force set up for a short period of time following the Russian occupation to address looting and destruction. The sister said she believes that the Russian forces have a list of all the participants and have detained many of them., The soldiers detained Alina and her ex-mother-in-law and forced Alina to leave her 6-year-old son with a neighbor. The authorities released Alina the following evening, but her ex-mother-in-law remained in detention at the time of the interview. Alina delivers clean clothes and medicine to the facility for her ex-mother-in-law’s diabetes and liver problems. She said her ex-mother-in-law’s soiled clothes have blood stains., Alina told her sister that she believes they are holding her ex-mother-in-law until her son, Aiyna’s former husband who managed to leave Kherson, returns to Kherson and they can detain him., Other Enforced Disappearances, Unlawful Detentions of Civilians, Human Rights Watch documented 13 additional cases in which Russian forces apparently forcibly disappeared civilians, 12 men and a woman, in Kherson region. Russian forces in most cases did not tell families where their loved ones were being held and provided no information when the relatives inquired. Several were beaten in detention and one was unlawfully transferred to Crimea for “corrective labor.” Family members said none of them participated in the military., Failure to acknowledge a civilian’s detention or to disclose their whereabouts in custody with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period, constitutes an enforced disappearance, a crime under international law, and when committed as part of an attack against the civilian population can constitute a crime against humanity., Still Forcibly Disappeared, “Yurii,” 43, Kherson, On May 26, Russian forces detained a local businessman “Yurii,” 43, in the parking lot of Kherson’s central market. His stepdaughter said that on July 14 her mother filed an appeal with the Russian military administration, who told her that Yurii was alive and that his case was “under review” but did not say where he was held., At the end of June, a man contacted her mother, the stepdaughter said, and said he had been Yurii’s cellmate in a makeshift pretrial detention facility in Kherson, and that Yurii had spent several weeks in solitary confinement before being placed in the shared cell. He said there were plans to transfer Yurii to Crimea and then to Rostov, in Russia, supposedly on weapons possession charges., His wife has visited the facility every few days with packages of food and clothing, which guards at the facility accepted but without confirming he was there., “Bohdan,” 39, Ivanivka, Russian forces detained “Bohdan,” 39, a warehouse manager on April 29 in the town of Ivanivka in Kherson region. He remains missing. His family contacted the Russian occupying authorities but were given no information., His wife said she had fled the town with their children in mid-March after Russian soldiers searched their house, questioned Bohdan and detained him for several hours. The next-door neighbors called her in late April and said that Russian soldiers came to the house in two cars and took Bohdan with them. Bohdan had called his wife the day before and told her Russian soldiers had taken his car, promising to return it., “Dmytro,” 54 Ivanivka, On May 5, Russian forces detained Dmytro, 54, in Ivanivka, Kherson region. His daughter said that Dmytro called on May 4 to say he would be staying with neighbors for a while. Other neighbors told her that they saw Dmytro visiting his house on May 5 to feed his cattle, when soldiers arrived, handcuffed Dmytro, and took him away. The neighbors said that Russian forces had taken over the house, who said they knew nothing about Dmytro’s whereabouts and that “as long as we are here, he cannot come here.”, According to his daughter, Dmytro did not participate in the Territorial Defense Forces and was not a veteran of the war in Donbas.., ""Stepan,"" 49, Oleshky, In the early morning of April 7, a group of approximately 10 armed Russian personnel came to the home of Stepan, 49, a driving instructor, in the town of Oleshky in Kherson region. His daughter, who spoke with her mother afterward, said that her father, mother, and younger sister were at home at the time. The men searched the house and yard, including with metal detectors, saying they were looking for weapons. They separated the family members and questioned them in different rooms. The soldiers referred to one of the men among them by nom-de-guerre “The Wind” (In Russian, Ветер).., They took Stepan away with them in handcuffs, telling him to bring his identity documents and medicines, saying, “You’ll need them, since things will be very bad for you.” Stepan has pancreatitis, an inflammation of his pancreas, and osteomyelitis, a bone marrow infection, and is officially registered as having a disability., On April 8, Stepan called his wife and his daughter, separately, from detention, saying that he had had a pancreatic attack, but had received medication and food and was not being beaten. His daughter said it sounded as if her father was speaking on a speakerphone. No one in the family has heard from him since., A friend, acting on behalf of the family, went to the local military administration to ask about her father, the daughter said, but received no information. The family also contacted Ukrainian government agencies and hotlines and a pretrial detention facility in Crimea, without success., Released, A woman named Mariia said that on June 25, Russian forces detained her husband, 30, a taxi driver, and her brother, 19, a naval academy student, with two other men in a shop in central Kherson owned by Mariia’s mother-in-law. Mariia said that the shop’s security cameras showed 10 to 15 armed Russian soldiers entering the shop, forcing the men to the floor, taking away their phones, and putting bags over their heads before taking them away., After the detention, Mariia’s mother-in-law went to the local military administration to ask about the men. Officials did not share any information about the men and told her to wait., They released Mariia’s husband after 7 days, her brother after 13 days, and the other men after three days. She said they were apparently held in the basement of a Kherson pretrial detention facility. Officials beat them and did not provide sufficient food. Mariia said her brother lost 10 kilograms. She said her brother had sent geolocations of Russian positions to Ukrainian intelligence, although Russian forces did not question him about this. During interrogations, the Russian forces asked questions that showed that “they knew everything about the men,” Mariia said. After the men’s release, she, her husband, brother, and mother-in-law left Kherson out of fear for their safety., ""Vasylii,"" Kherson, Russian forces detained Vasylii at his home on July 4, and held him for four days. His wife said she had been at home with Vasylii, their toddler child, and Vasylii’s parents. Seven Russian soldiers entered the house and told the men to go outside, and the women to go down to the first floor. The soldiers took photos of the family members’ identity documents, searched the house, and detained Vasylii., In the evening, his family went to the local military administration office to ask about him, but officials gave them no information. Vasylii was released on July 8. He told his wife he had been held in a former pretrial detention center in Kherson. Russian forces beat Vasylii, used electroshock on him, beat him on his legs with a metal rod, injured his shoulder, and gave him a concussion, his wife said. He still has headaches and nightmares. When they interrogated him, Russians knew everything about him and his family, his wife said., After his release, Russian forces told Vasylii they would come back to check in on him in three weeks. The family fled Kherson, fleeing for their safety. The have no idea why he was detained, but Vasylii was not in the Territorial Defense Forces, did not participate in the war in Donbas, nor in the pro-Ukraine demonstrations, according to his wife. His wife also told Human Rights Watch that Russian soldiers came to Vasylii’s car repair shop sometime in early April and demanded a payment of 5,000 hryvnia ($US169) to continue running the shop or to repair their cars for free. His wife said that Vasylii gave them the money and they left., “Valentyn,” 48, Chaplynka, On June 8, 48-year-old Valentyn left his home in a village of Chaplynka, in Kherson region, about 50 kilometers from the administrative border with Russian-occupied Crimea, to go shopping and did not return. Valentyn’s daughter said that his mother, who is in her 70s and whom he cared for, looked for him on June 9 at the local police station, where Russian occupation officials told her he was detained “for drugs,” but did not say where they were holding him. They told her that she should move to a nursing home., The mother went to the police station daily, and eventually was allowed her to see her son. She told the daughter that Valentyn was “all beaten, very thin.” On a subsequent visit, the staff told her that he had been taken to Crimea. Russian authorities released Valentyn about a month after his initial detention, on July 4 or 5., His daughter said that Valentyn told his family that he had been beaten and had been sent to Crimea for two weeks for “corrective labor.” Authorities did not return his identity documents and bank cards, and barred him from leaving the village. His daughter said Russian personnel allegedly detained several other villagers also on June 8, but she had no further information about them., Legal Obligations, All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation found in the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions. International human rights law, including notably both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, is applicable at all times., The laws of war prohibit attacks on civilians, forced transfers of civilians, summary executions, torture, enforced disappearances, unlawful confinement, and inhumane treatment of detainees. Pillage and looting of property are also prohibited. A party to the conflict occupying territory is generally responsible for ensuring that food, water, and medical care are available to the population under its control, and to facilitate assistance by relief agencies., The Third Geneva Convention governs the treatment of prisoners of war, effective from the moment of capture.

Call for applications to support micro-business start-ups for IDPs and war victims [EN/UK],News and Press Release,EC,Recovery and Reconstruction,21 Jul 2022,"The ""Community. Social Projects Lab""NGOannounces a call for applications to support IDPs and other Ukrainians affected by the war in starting up their own business. Support is provided within the framework of the EU-funded BackHomeUA project that aims to facilitate the return and adaptation of Ukrainians in new hosting communities and communities that suffered from occupation or war actions. The organisation helps create new jobs through entrepreneurship development, providing mini-grants, legal and marketing support, facilitating negotiations with local authorities, searching for temporary housing, etc., ""Now, Ukraine has two overarching tasks – to win the war and to help return to their lives millions of citizens who have lost their jobs, homes, or, most importantly, their loved ones. It is vitally important to preserve their faith in their future in Ukraine. Belief in victory and recovery unites and drives Ukrainians forward, both at the front lines and in the rear. Therefore, BackHomeUA is about getting Ukrainians home and returning them to work. Jobs and taxes help the rear to bring the victory closer"", ‒ Aryna Satovska-Lytvynenko, Director of NGO “Community”, commented., The project focuses on two groups of beneficiaries:, IDPs or refuges who return from abroad and become IDPs because they cannot live at home due to hostilities, occupation, or destruction;, residents of de-occupied or affected by hostilities communities, who suffered human or material losses., For the first group, the priority is to adapt to a new place: find a job and housing, get socially integrated into a new community. The challenge for the second group is to adapt to new circumstances when income sources are lost, housing is damaged, etc., The BackHomeUA project will support both groups by helping them become micro-entrepreneurs through opening a сlosing studio, a mini-bakery, or a children's club. IDPs will receive support on the condition they are ready to work as entrepreneurs in a new place for at least one year. Registration as an entrepreneur is a mandatory condition to receive support.

Relatives of demonstrators killed during the January mass demonstrations in Kazakhstan demanded justice. LGBT+ marches and climate-related demonstrations took place across Europe, while Dutch farmers continue to protest over a proposed cut in nitrogen emissions. Outbreaks of rioting were recorded in France during Bastille Day celebrations on 14 July. Across Northern Ireland, thousands of people took part in parades organized by the Orange Order to commemorate the 1690 Battle of the Boyne on 12 July (BBC, 12 July 2022). Meanwhile, fighting continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Donetsk region, primarily in the direction of Bakhmut, which suffered from heavy shelling (Hromadske, 14 July 2022; Suspilne Media, 15 July 2022). Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces struck several Russian ammunition depots in the Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions (Novoye Vremya Ukraine, 12 July 2022)., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling and missile strikes last week. On 9 July, Russian shelling of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region destroyed a five-story residential building, killing 48 civilians (Ukrayinska Pravda, 13 July 2022).1 On 14 July, a Russian missile strike hit the center of Vinnytsia, killing 24 civilians and heavily injuring dozens (RFE/RL, 16 July 2022). Deadly shelling of civilians was also recorded in the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk regions., In Russia, an explosive device went off on railway tracks in the Bryansk border region on 9 July in an act of railway sabotage aimed at disrupting the movement of Russian military equipment to Ukraine (Activatica, 9 July 2022). Similar acts of railway sabotage were recorded in Russia in late June. Such acts of sabotage have coincided with a significant increase in the number of train derailments in Russia between March and June compared to the same period last year (The Insider, 6 July 2022). Additionally, the governors of Bryansk and Kursk regions accuse Ukrainian forces of several incidents of cross-border shelling and drone strikes last week (Kommersant, 12 July 2022; Rosbalt, 14 July 2022; Rosbalt, 15 July 2022). These trends contribute to the 129% increase in violence in Bryansk last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in Bryansk in the past month., Rallies against the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Poland last week., In Kazakhstan, families of demonstrators killed during demonstrations against price hikes in early January protested last week, demanding justice. People staged multiple protests outside the Akorda presidential palace in Nur-Sultan, demanding a fair investigation into the deaths of their family members and their acquittals for alleged crimes committed during the January demonstrations. Kazakh authorities responded to demonstrations with violent repression, resulting in over 200 demonstrators being killed. While authorities claim that demonstrators attempted a coup and engaged in attacks on government buildings, ACLED found that demonstrators remained peaceful in 95% of the demonstrations. Some demonstrators were detained by police after camping outside the presidential palace for several days, demanding a meeting with country officials. Human rights organizations have criticized Kazakh authorities for failing to investigate the deaths of more than 200 demonstrators during deadly riots in January (HRW, 5 May 2022)., LGBT+ marches, as well as rallies condemning a recent shooting outside a gay bar in Oslo, Norway, were held in Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Romania, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom last week., Meanwhile, in France, violence was recorded across the country last week on the sidelines of French National Day celebrations, known also as Bastille Day, on 14 July. Rioters threw mortar fireworks at police and set garbage bins on fire in at least a dozen locations. At least two police officers were injured and several people were arrested., In the Netherlands, Dutch farmers continue to hold demonstrations last week against the government's plans to cut nitrogen emissions, blocking highways in multiple parts of the country. However, the number of recorded demonstration events significantly decreased last week, despite negotiations between the government and the sector failing to progress (Pig Business, 18 July 2022). Farmers from Germany and Belgium joined their counterparts during protests in Roermond and Ter Apel, in the Netherlands, while solidarity demonstrations in support of Dutch farmers were also recorded in Germany., In Northern Ireland, thousands of people took part in parades organized by the loyalist Orange Order across Northern Ireland to mark the Twelfth of July, commemorating William III's victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 (BBC, 12 July 2022). Despite the sensitive nature of the parades, there were no instances of violence reported.2 Commemorations and sectarian demonstrations in Northern Ireland are often at risk of turning violent, with most parade-related violence in Belfast occurring during the annual marching season, beginning in March and peaking in July., Environmental and climate activists demonstrated across Europe last week, demanding more climate action and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. The police intervened and arrested activists in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Demonstration activity was also recorded in Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Finland., Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces was recorded in the Shahumyan region of Azerbaijan last week.3 These trends contribute to the 110% increase in violence in Shahumyan in the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in Shahumyan in the past month. Additionally, an Azerbaijani and a Turkish civilian were hit by landmine explosions in the Kashatagh and Martuni regions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-9-15-july-2022

The bitter cost of the Ukraine crisis,News and Press Release,Plan International,"Education

Health
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jul 2022,"Tsitsi Matope, It is an armed conflict that has plunged Europe in a refugee crisis unprecedented in recent times. As fighting rages on in Ukraine, thousands of civilians have been killed with over 9.5 million people forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in foreign lands as of 19 July. Children are paying a high price, with hundreds having been killed since 24 February., A new twist to the conflict has emerged with reports showing that millions of Ukrainian refugees are returning to the war-torn country. While for some, this may be a case of returning to check on family assets and visit loved ones before going back to their countries of refuge, it may not be the case for others previously evacuated from hotspots such as Kharkiv and Chuhuiv. Many of these latter returnees have said hardships experienced in some temporary safety shelters necessitated their sojourn back home despite persistent security concerns and worsening humanitarian conditions. This decision to brave the dangers at home points to possible gaps in the humanitarian access and provision of assistance, which need to be assessed and fully addressed by all humanitarian actors in collaboration with all parties to the conflict., On the other hand, in the five months, since the fighting started, the crisis continues to push back the gains made in promoting global peace and sustainable development following the end of World War II in 1945. Endangering the defences of global peace, the very foundations of the United Nations have been shaken, putting to the test the level of compliance to International Humanitarian Law and other international peace-seeking instruments agreed on by many states. Nations have been divided, the global economy and financial markets destabilised, and global grain supplies and food security thrust into jeopardy., The United Nations has warned of an escalating acute food insecurity situation affecting a record 193 million people across 53 countries. Disruptions in the production and delays in delivery of wheat, corn, sunflower oil and barley from Ukraine and Russia – who are among the key producers and exporters – is compounding global food-security. The state of affairs is one of the driving forces of soaring inflation and the rising food prices that are endemic to a high cost of living, as well as increasing vulnerability in the hunger hot spots where the millions affected are in urgent need of food and nutrition support., The bitter cost of this conflict cannot be equated to any other devastation recently seen in Europe. In the face of deeply complex peace negotiations, predicting the trajectory of this conflict, and when it is likely to end is no easy task. The regrouping of forces on both sides has intensified relentless bombardment in Eastern Ukraine, with airstrikes and shelling continuing across the country leaving cities such as Sievierodonestk and Lysychansk in Luhansk region battered. The Ukrainian Government recently reported that on a daily basis, more than one hundred Ukrainian soldiers are killed and over 500 wounded in combat, a grim reality of the grave consequences of this conflict. Losing people at such an alarming rate, on both sides of the conflict, is not only bone-chilling but illogical and pointing to no-winners in this war., With these gloomy scenes, it is going to be a long haul for children and women who make the vast majority of those displaced. Other vulnerable groups including the elderly, people with disabilities and minority groups, are also bearing the brunt of a conflict they did not ask for. Already disability rights organisations in Ukraine have warned that many children with disabilities may not survive the crisis if more support and attention is not channelled towards improving their wellbeing. This follows reports that thousands of disabled children have been abandoned in institutions that are no longer able to look after them. They are now living in atrocious conditions in Ukraine., However, the harsh reality of the matter is that social services have either collapsed in some parts of Ukraine or are on the verge of collapsing in other areas. And in the wake of the conflict, families have been torn apart. Ukrainians continue to suffer heavy losses – their loved ones, homes and other family assets have been reduced to rubble – as well as schools, hospitals, and other public facilities. Livelihoods have been decimated and the world has bared witness to the desolation of a once beautiful country and its people. What they need is continued support to survive other crises within the bigger crisis, through sustained provision of food, medicines, safe shelter, water, electricity and social services, including access to mental health and psychosocial support., In particular, unaccompanied and separated children and minority groups lacking proper documentation, such as the Roma community, are threatened with risks such as trafficking, exploitation, child-labour, gender-based violence and sexual abuse in and outside Ukraine. The option to keep children safe, in schools, as a protection mechanism, has become a luxury Ukraine can no longer afford. Thousands of schools have been targeted and destroyed since February 24, casting a dark cloud over the education and future of over 4 million children remaining in Ukraine., Scaling-up the provision of health, social and essential services will help to save lives, prevent unintended pregnancies, ensure safe delivery of newborns and appropriate care for both mother and baby, as well as treatment of victims of sexual and gender-based violence. However, continued airstrikes and military encirclement is hampering these efforts by humanitarian actors. The need for a breakthrough in negotiating sustained access to deliver humanitarian assistance throughout Ukraine is long overdue. In areas where fighting is intense, mobile services cannot reach those in need or arrive when it is already too late. The United Nations and humanitarian partners have projected that US$4.1 billion should be injected into response programs to meet the needs of 17 million people inside and outside Ukraine. This includes $2.25 billion required to address the escalating humanitarian needs of 8.7 million people within Ukraine until August 2022., In the surrounding countries hosting refugees, risks for children and women are a concern. This has necessitated partnerships between governments and humanitarian actors to expand national capacities and enable the provision of humanitarian assistance to over 8 million refugees. One of the challenges affecting the efficiency of humanitarian actions in some countries is a lack of registration by age, sex and disability disaggregated data to generate evidence that will effectively address the specific needs of all refugees., On the other hand, Visa restrictions for the longer-term deployment of some experienced humanitarian actors are hampering sustained efforts as well as the ability to reach, with speed, populations in need in some areas., In view of the urgent needs, some international organisations that were previously not present in Eastern Europe before the crisis, have set up operations in various countries to help bolster the refugee response actions. Plan International is now operating in Ukraine, Poland, Romania and Moldova, working in partnership with local and international organizations. Speaking recently, on the side lines of an International Education Conference organised by the Government of Romania in partnership with Plan International, Mr. Stephen Omollo, Plan International’s chief executive officer said an all hands on deck approach is imperative to ensure the protection and wellbeing of all people displaced by the conflict., He explained how new operations by his organisation, across the four countries, will support children, including adolescent girls, to remain in school and provide essential services such as mental health and pychosocial support. Working with governments and other humanitarian actors, the organisation is also focusing on the prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence, child-protection in emergencies, sexual abuse and exploitation, and sexual and reproductive health and rights services. “This is a crisis like no other seen recently,” said Mr. Omollo, “we are here to make a difference by leveraging our vast experience in other refugee crises in countries such as Myanmar, Germany, Syria, CAR, Bangladesh and Mozambique. Our priority is to help build national capacities within the education sector, ensure increased access to essential services, cash and voucher as well as providing livelihoods assistance. We continue to strengthen the ‘One Plan Humanitarian Response’ with the contribution of all members of the Plan Federation” Mr. Omollo said., Tsitsi Matope is Plan International’s Global Humanitarian Advocacy and Policy Specialist deployed to support the Ukraine crisis response in Poland, Moldova and Romania",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/bitter-cost-ukraine-crisis

"Russian, Ukrainian Bases Endangering Civilians [EN/RU/UK]",Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,21 Jul 2022,"Basing Forces in Populated Areas Creates Unnecessary Risk, (Kyiv, July 21, 2022) – Russian and Ukrainian forces have put civilians in Ukraine at unnecessary risk by basing their forces in populated areas without removing residents to safer areas, Human Rights Watch said today. International humanitarian law – the laws of war – obligates parties to the conflict to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and civilian structures under their control from the effect of attacks., In four cases that Human Rights Watch investigated, Russian forces established military bases in populated areas, needlessly endangering civilians. In three cases, Ukrainian forces based forces among homes where people were living but took no apparent action to move residents to safer areas. Ensuing attacks on these bases killed and wounded civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross has noted several means of protecting civilians from attack, including: “the construction of shelters, digging of trenches, distribution of information and warnings, withdrawal of the civilian population to safe places, direction of traffic, guarding of civilian property and the mobilization of civil defence organizations.”, “As the war in Ukraine rages on, civilians have been caught in the fighting unnecessarily,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Russian and Ukrainian forces both need to avoid basing their troops among civilians, and to do all they can to remove civilians from the vicinity.”, Between April 17 and May 31, 2022, Human Rights Watch interviewed 54 civilians in the towns and villages of Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske and Yahidne in the northern Chernihiv region; Malaya Rohan, Pokotylivka, Selekstiine, and Yakovlivka in the eastern Kharkiv region; and from Polohy in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.Researchers visited all of these locations except for Polohy due to ongoing fighting but interviewed residents who had fled the village., In Yahidne, Russian forces unlawfully held nearly 350 civilians for a month in the basement of a schoolhouse near the front lines that the Russians used as a military base. Ukrainian attacks in those areas damaged homes and other structures., In Malaya Rohan, Russian forces set up a base at a farm, where they parked dozens of military vehicles. The soldiers unlawfully prevented civilians from leaving the area. On March 26, an exchange of artillery fire resulted in damage to a nearby farm and the death of 140 livestock., In Pokotylivka, Ukraine Territorial Defense Forces established a base at a disease control center in a residential neighborhood without taking steps to remove civilians from the area. When Russian forces attacked the center on April 28, at least six civilians were wounded, and dozens of nearby homes and the local school were damaged., About 300 Ukrainian soldiers began using the cultural center in Selekstiine village as a barracks in early March without relocating civilians from the area. About 10 days later, a large munition hit the center, destroying it completely and damaging many surrounding buildings., In late February, in Yakovlivka village, Ukrainian armed forces started using the local school and council buildings as a military base and barracks while civilians remained in the area. On March 2, multiple munitions hit the village, killing 4 civilians, wounding at least 10 others, and destroying and damaging dozens of homes., Human Rights Watch wrote to the Russian and the Ukrainian Defense Ministries on May 6, asking for information on the steps their armed forces were taking to minimize civilian casualties, remove civilians from the vicinity of fighting, and avoid deploying forces in densely populated areas. Neither side has responded., The laws of war applicable during the international armed conflict in Ukraine can be found in the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I), and customary international law. Article 58 of Protocol I on “precautions against the effects of attacks” requires parties to the conflict, “to the maximum extent feasible,” to take the necessary precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects under their control from the dangers resulting from military operations; avoid locating military targets within or near densely populated areas; and seek to remove civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military targets. Removing civilians must be consistent with laws-of-war prohibitions against forced transfers except for legitimate security reasons., The Russian Federation’s 2001 Regulations on the Application of International Humanitarian Law state: “To the greatest possible extent … precautions shall be taken to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects against the effects of combat operations.” Russia’s permanent representative to the United Nations Security Council stated in 2008 that “The protection of civilians must be the highest priority for Governments involved in conflicts. We emphasize that all parties to armed conflict bear responsibility for ensuring the security of civilians.”, Ukraine’s 2004 International Humanitarian Law manual states:, Civilian persons and civilian objects shall be removed from the locations of military objectives. To that end commanders … shall take all measures to interact with local authorities. Removal of civilians from areas located near military objectives shall be performed to safe areas known to them. If circumstances permit, effective warning of the defensive actions affecting the civilian population shall be made in advance (e.g. for evacuation of persons from certain buildings or areas)., While attacking forces are not prevented from carrying out attacks on military targets if defending forces do not take all feasible precautions, they remain bound to take appropriate measures to minimize civilian harm, including not carrying out indiscriminate attacks or attacks that would be likely to cause disproportionate loss of civilian life or property., “Russian and Ukrainian forces need to do all they can to help civilians in their midst get to safer locations or otherwise minimize their risk of being harmed,” Wille said. “It’s not enough to do nothing and hope civilians won’t be harmed.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russian-ukrainian-bases-endangering-civilians-enruuk

During the conference, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, called for a “reawakening” of international law, emphasizing that, “this moment of clinging to the law and applying the law in a practical way is the requirement of the hour.” Following the conclusion of the conference, several states committed to establish a “Dialogue Group on Accountability for Ukraine” to promote cooperation between ongoing justice and documentation efforts., Daily attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure – which may amount to war crimes – continue in Ukraine. The UN reported that as of 18 July the civilian death toll has climbed to 5,110, including 346 children, while asserting that the real death toll is likely much higher. Heavy shelling caused more than 160 civilian casualties in Ukrainian-held and Russian-held areas in the Donetsk region between 8-11 July alone. On 9 July at least 34 civilians were killed when Russian forces struck a five-story apartment building in Chasiv Yar, marking the deadliest incident so far this month and the second single deadliest attack since the war began, according to the UN. Another six civilians were killed on 18 July in the town of Toretsk when a Russian strike hit the building they were sheltering in. Meanwhile, in central Ukraine three Russian cruise missiles struck the city of Vinnytsia on 14 July, killing at least 25 people, including three children, and wounding 140 others. The missiles hit civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and a neurological clinic servicing children with disabilities., The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate in areas of active conflict in the eastern Donbas regions. Reports have surfaced of Russian forces blocking the flow of humanitarian aid to areas under their control. The intentional blocking of humanitarian aid may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., Sarah Hunter, Ukraine Expert at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “accountability efforts for atrocities perpetrated in Ukraine are important and welcome. Nevertheless, civilians continue to endure crimes on a daily basis. All efforts must be made to halt this senseless war, including continuing to pressure Russia to end strikes on civilians and allow aid access for those in desperate need of relief.”, WORLD DAY FOR INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE, Sunday, 17 July, marked the World Day for International Justice, promoting international criminal justice and commending efforts aimed at holding perpetrators of atrocity crimes accountable. This annual commemoration is an important moment to acknowledge achievements made in fighting impunity and to raise awareness about the challenges that remain, as holding perpetrators of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable plays an essential role in delivering justice for victims and preventing the recurrence of such crimes., Over the past year the international community has taken numerous steps to ensure accountability for atrocities. Under the principle of universal jurisdiction, a German court convicted a Syrian ex-intelligence official of crimes against humanity and another German court opened a trial involving allegations of torture and murder by a Syrian state agent. In February the International Court of Justice held new hearings in the historic case filed by The Gambia against Myanmar (Burma) for failing to uphold its obligations under the Genocide Convention. The hybrid Special Criminal Court in the Central African Republic opened its first trial in April, representing a significant moment to advance justice domestically for victims and survivors of serious crimes committed in the country. The UN Human Rights Council established investigative mechanisms on the situations in Ethiopia, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, and Ukraine. These investigative mechanisms may serve as an important deterrent and inhibit the potential commission of further atrocities, as well as put potential perpetrators on notice that their violations will be subject to ongoing international scrutiny., This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC is the world’s first permanent international court for the investigation and prosecution of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and, since 2018 the crime of aggression. While facing many challenges, the ICC has made significant progress in holding suspected perpetrators of atrocities to account and can play a pivotal role in achieving justice for victims and survivors., Despite the progress made, impunity prevails in far too many situations. The conflicts in Myanmar, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and, most recently, Ukraine, have prompted renewed discussions on the effectiveness of international criminal justice to deter atrocity crimes. The 2021 military coups in Myanmar and Sudan are the consequence of decades-long impunity enjoyed by their security forces. In Yemen, civilians are suffering amidst a “pandemic of impunity,” and in South Sudan, the persistent lack of accountability continues to fuel resentment and has enabled the recurrence of atrocities., The international community should ensure continued financial and political support to all efforts aimed at fighting impunity, including by building capacities of local, regional and national courts. All states should codify international crimes into domestic legislation and, where possible, pursue accountability for perpetrators under the principle of universal jurisdiction., RAIDS IN TOGO RAISE FEARS OF SPILLOVER OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM FROM THE CENTRAL SAHEL, Between 14-15 July suspected Islamist militants killed at least 12 civilians and injured others in overnight raids on villages in Togo’s Kpendjal prefecture, close to the border with Burkina Faso. These raids were the deadliest attacks by presumed Islamist fighters in the country to date. Higher death tolls have been reported by other sources, including a local rights activist who said armed fighters killed more than 25 civilians, reportedly all men and community leaders from four villages in Kpendjal prefecture, while a local new source said 30 victims. Villagers have fled in the subsequent days, fearing another attack as the perpetrators allegedly threatened to return., Recent deadly raids in northern Togo have raised fears over the growing risk of the spread of Islamist armed groups affiliated with the so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda from the Central Sahel to coastal West African states – including Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo. Special Representative and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Saleh Annadif, stressed that violent extremism has “gone from being a phenomenon of isolated incidents to a very real threat in coastal countries.”, In the Central Sahel – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – Islamist armed groups are exploiting local grievances, the lack of governance and security provisions in the peripheral regions to control territory and impose their rule on communities. In doing so these groups have perpetrated atrocities and fueled a humanitarian and displacement crisis. Similar vulnerabilities exist in parts of the coastal countries, heightening the risk for violence., Islamist armed groups have perpetrated several attacks in northern Togo since November 2021, primarily near the border with Burkina Faso and Benin. On 13 June the government of Togo declared a “state of security emergency” in the northern Savanes region following overnight attacks perpetrated by an al-Qaeda affiliated armed group in May that killed eight Togolese soldiers in Kpendjal prefecture. Since the declaration of the state of emergency, the government has increased its military operations in the Savanes region, with the aim of preventing militants from spilling over from southern Burkina Faso. However, counter-terrorism operations have at times put civilians at risk. On 14 July the army admitted to killing a group of civilians – all between the ages of 14 and 18 – in the northern village of Margba, Tone prefecture, after misidentifying them for members of an Islamist armed group., Counter-terrorism operations – conducted nationally, bilaterally or collectively within the collaborative security mechanism known as the Accra Initiative – must adhere strictly to international human rights and humanitarian law to prevent civilian harm. It is essential that coastal states and the Central Sahelian governments develop a coordinated response that addresses the root causes of conflict and violence, including by accounting for the needs of local populations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-309-ukraine-world-day-international-justice-and-togo

“Together we can do so much more”: Partnering with local organisations in Kharkiv and throughout Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,MSF,"Coordination
Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",20 Jul 2022,"In late February, just as war broke out in Ukraine, Dmitry Zakharov, the owner of a local barbecue restaurant and car wash in Kharkiv, started transforming his businesses in the south of the city into a centre for humanitarian aid., “After I heard the first explosions, I went to the grocery store to get food for my family and I started thinking about what I could do to help,” says Zakharov. “I saw a long line of people waiting to buy drinking water, but there wasn’t enough available.”, He knew what to do; his restaurant has its own potable water supply, so he started giving it away for free. When a local meat factory damaged in the fighting had to shut down, he gathered up the meat and distributed it to the community while the food was still edible. Soon, his humanitarian efforts took over his businesses., The barbecue restaurant’s country-style, knotty wood dining rooms were cleared to provide space for free medical care to anyone who needs it. Next door, under a large bright sign advertising the car wash, volunteers walk carefully to avoid the water drainage system so they can serve nutritious free lunches daily to the community., When Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams began assessing the humanitarian needs in Ukraine and how we could address them, a remarkable thing stood out—the number of Ukrainian volunteer networks, non-profit organisations (NGOs), and civil society groups that had swiftly mobilised. They are run by people who were and continue to be directly affected by the war and they are delivering humanitarian aid to the people who need it., As a result, says Barbara Hessel, MSF’s project coordinator in Kharkiv, “we wanted to help strengthen what they’d already built.” Up to now, these local groups have provided the vast majority of humanitarian aid in Ukraine., Zakharov has continued to follow the needs he sees in his community. These days, when MSF determines that the neighbourhood is safe enough, a doctor and psychologist from the team offer their services at the front of the restaurant while volunteer nurses administer infusions to cancer patients one room over and community volunteers cook meals for around 1,200 people each day in the kitchen in the back., MSF projects throughout the country are working with dozens of local groups—from volunteers who deliver thousands of food boxes to remote villages, to the railway authorities that provide trains for the organization's medical evacuation services, to volunteer drivers that deliver medications to patients’ doorsteps., “These are the right people to deliver aid to their communities,” says Hessel. “They’ve been here and will continue to be here after we are gone, but they do need support.”, Reaching those cut off from aid, Yana Biletskaya started organising humanitarian outreach with some friends as soon as the war began. Their goal was to reach the people who were completely cut off from other sources of aid—residents of the myriad of villages located far from Kharkiv city., A massive storehouse is filled with donations from organisations large and small—worn brown boxes of canned food sent from a small school in England sit next to a wall of white, well branded boxes from one of the biggest international NGOs. The group also distributes donations to the countryside where around 100 different community groups will pick them up and distribute them to residents, many of them elderly., “We started off with 50 people here,” says Biletskaya, “and now we are 20. But we are also much more efficient than we were at first. We went from working 24 hours every day to putting in fewer hours but better organising our time. Our problem now is fuel, it’s very difficult for our volunteers to get fuel for distributions.”, MSF has provided thousands of food boxes—one box of non-perishable items feeds a family of three to four for a week—and hygiene kits—with toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, and other essentials—to people throughout Kharkiv city and oblast in partnership with volunteer networks like Biletskaya’s., Partnering with groups and individuals like this allows us to reach far more people than we otherwise could. “Together we can do so much more,” says Hessel. “They have the capacity to deliver 3,000 meals in one day, their networks are so well-organized.”, The groups are also in contact with each other and can tell MSF and other NGOs where there are additional needs., Finding a purpose in helping, Like many of the volunteers she works with and her Ukrainian MSF colleagues, Daria Samoilova, MSF’s volunteer liaison officer in Kharkiv, was on a very different track before the war upended her life. “I was a lawyer. I had a good life; I’d travelled to 38 countries,” she says., When the war started, “I knew everything was changing and it was possible that my life could be destroyed, that I could die.” Seven days into the war, a large building by her mother’s home was blown up; they packed and left for a different part of the country. But she had lost her taste for traveling, she says, and wanted to come home. “I needed to start a new life.”, Samoilova started working with MSF, first as a translator and then in her current role connecting with volunteer groups and overseeing partnerships between local groups and MSF. After just a few days into this new life, she says, “I had a realisation. I felt happy. I was doing something good and kind, and everyone I was working with had the same idea—to help.”, Not slowing down, Even as the war churns on, causing ever more death, displacement, and psychological impact, as well as economic woe, local volunteers and organisations show no sign of slowing down. Zakharov, Biletskaya, and others say they want to do more, not less. Hessel says as inspiring as this is, it also raises questions. “Many people no longer have an income—where is the tipping point? How long can this continue? Many work 24-7 and it’s emotionally draining, what they see and experience.”, To help address this, in Kharkiv, MSF has started to support volunteers and community leaders by helping them develop self-care and stress management strategies. “They deserve recognition for the work they are doing,” Camilo Garcia, MSF’s mental health activity manager, says. “More than anything, though, we want to provide them with continuous support so they can keep helping their peers in need.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/together-we-can-do-so-much-more-partnering-local-organisations-kharkiv-and-throughout-ukraine-enuk

Health care attacks have killed 76 people and injured 59 since the conflict started until 29 June. The World Health Organisation warns of disease outbreaks such as cholera, measles, diphtheria or COVID-19 due to poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene, crowded conditions in bomb shelters and disrupted vaccination programmes.
Across Europe as of 29 June, only 3.5 million refugees who left Ukraine have registered for temporary protection or similar schemes. In Ukraine, more than 5.5 million mostly internally displaced people have returned to their homes, while the overall number of those internally displaced remains high at 6.3 million, says the International Organization for Migration.
Many people inside Ukraine can’t meet basic needs for food, water and medicines, with the delivery of life-saving aid remaining challenging, especially in places experiencing intense fighting.
Around 10.3 million people have received assistance across Ukraine, with a further 5.3 million yet to get humanitarian help.
A generation of children is being scarred by the war, with 1.5 million children in danger of issues including anxiety, depression and social impairment, according to a World Vision report. Ukrainian parents say their biggest worry is the mental health of their children. Previous studies have shown that more than 22% of conflict-affected people may end up with some form of mental health disorder.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-response-situation-report-10-1-june-30-june-2022

The Initiative will increase Ukrainian farmers' access to critical agricultural inputs including seeds, fertilizer, equipment, and pesticides, enhance Ukrainian infrastructure capacity and capability to efficiently export agricultural goods, increase farmers’ access to financing, and expand the capacity of Ukrainian businesses to dry, temporarily store, and process agricultural commodities., USAID seeks to raise an additional $150 million for the Initiative from fellow donors and the private sector, with an overall target of $250 million. AGRI-Ukraine builds on a range of support USAID is providing to Ukraine’s agriculture sector in the wake of Russia’s full - scale invasion, including providing over 8,000 Ukrainian farmers with seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and more, reaching approximately 14% of the country’s registered agriculture enterprises to help them deliver this year’s harvest despite the devastation caused by Russia’s aggression. This effort will bolster the entire agricultural sector, safeguarding this major economic engine for future generations of Ukrainians., Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, USAID has been working closely with humanitarian partners in the country and region to reach Ukrainians with lifesaving humanitarian assistance while also ramping up critical development assistance to respond to cyber attacks and threats to the energy sector, countering disinformation, supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector, documenting human rights violations, meeting essential health needs, and ensuring the continued functioning of local and national government entities., The United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine and its people in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-announces-100-million-ukraine-agriculture-resilience-initiative

The grant will support the efforts of the Government of Ukraine and civil society, including women-led organizations across the country., The conflict in Ukraine has taken thousands of lives, caused untold destruction, displaced millions and resulted in unacceptable violations of human rights. Women and girls caught in the hostilities, in particular, face heightened risks of gender-based violence and abuse, including conflict-related sexual violence and rape, while those fleeing their homes are exposed to increased risks to their safety and well-being., The damage and destruction of over 300 health facilities has denied thousands of women and girls’ access to lifesaving services, including maternal and newborn care, while national protection systems and mechanisms for women survivors of violence have been severely compromised., UNFPA’s priority is to ensure that the conflict in Ukraine does not strip women and girls of their rights, including their right to give birth safely and in dignity, and to live free from violence. With USAID’s support, UNFPA will be able to provide cash assistance to safeguard the wellbeing, dignity, and resilience of pregnant and lactating women and survivors of GBV. USAID’s contribution will also fund the work of 60 mobile teams providing psychosocial counselling to the most vulnerable across Ukraine, facilities for gender-based violence survivors at 30 locations, as well as an online national platform that supports survivors to access other services, including psychosocial support., “The support by USAID is timely and responds to critical funding gaps,” said UNFPA Representative in Ukraine, Jaime Nadal. “The burden of this war is mostly felt by women and girls. Many are carrying scars that will require specialized assistance. The contribution will go towards ensuring that national capacities to provide quality life-saving assistance to women and girls across Ukraine are strengthened, following a survivor-centred approach that respects and upholds the needs and dignity of survivors.”, With USAID’s funding, 20 communities will also be supported to design and implement programmes to prevent gender-based violence, complementing the impact of the work of mobile teams. Women will also have access to career hubs, giving them the economic independence to protect themselves against violence, while training for national healthcare service providers will focus on the clinical management of rape and the provision of integrated reproductive health and gender-based violence services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/usaid-allocates-us124-million-support-access-lifesaving-reproductive-health-and-protection-services-women-and-girls-ukraine

"Ukraine: Invest in the Future, Don’t Rebuild the Past",News and Press Release,TOL,Recovery and Reconstruction,15 Jul 2022,"by Bohdan Vykhor and Andreas Beckmann, At the recent Lugano reconstruction conference, planning for a sustainable economy and climate change was notable by its absence., The Ukrainian government and international donors had the first opportunity to present their plans for the postwar reconstruction of the country at theUkraine Recovery Conference early this month in Lugano, Switzerland., Conference delegates declared “sustainability” as one of the seven key points for reconstruction. The concepts of “building back better” and “green recovery” were touched upon by nearly every leader who took the floor at the conference, from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Nevertheless, there was little presented in terms of concrete steps for achieving these aims., We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make Ukraine a global leader in sustainability and to show the world how nature can help speed up recovery from the war and improve lives and livelihoods. But the critical importance of planning for climate change and restoring a healthy natural environment for the people of Ukraine to help make Ukraine a leader in sustainability after it begins its recovery from the war was not mentioned at all in Lugano., From Reform to Restoration, Initially, the event had been planned as the fifth Ukraine Reform Conference – an annual high-level political event for Ukraine to present the progress that it has made, for international partners to express support, and for all stakeholders to examine what steps to take next to advance the reform process. Against the backdrop of the war, however, Ukraine and Switzerland decided to refocus the gathering beyond reforms to concentrate on recovery. Over 1,000 people from 41 countries and 19 international organizations participated., Ukrainian government officials presented a draft plan for recovery based on the proposals of several working groups. The plan seeks to respond to immediate needs and set Ukraine on a path of longer-term development. The focus on innovation, digitalization, and reform, among other things, is welcome. Nevertheless, the document fails to fully take into account and respond to the overarching challenges facing Ukraine and other countries in the form of climate change and nature loss. What we need to do in the next decade to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change is laid out in the latest report of the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Efforts are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and dependence on Russian fossil fuels – but also to adapt to the already changing climate., The challenge of climate change is made more acute by the loss and degradation of nature, with attendant erosion of ecosystem goods and services, from clean air and water to pollination of crops. Even before the war, declines in harvests in Ukraine, for example, had been driven not only by climate change but also by poor water management and declining pollination, with a worsening trend expected in the future., Despite mention of investment in energy efficiency, the Ukrainian plan actually foresees a near-threefold increase in electricity production by 2050., Unclear Intentions, Natalia Gozak, who heads Ecoaction – an umbrella organization for Ukrainian groups working on energy, agriculture, and sustainable cities – sees the plan as a way for the Ukrainian government to promote expansion of the nuclear sector and fossil fuel projects (such as gas exports), with an additional focus on hydrogen and bioenergy. “We can’t afford to continue our dependence on unsustainable energy solutions,” she says. “Instead, we should be thinking in the longer term, making sure that Ukraine develops as a modern economy based on sustainable renewables and energy efficiency.”, With regard to nature protection, the plan gives a nod to EU policy targets, including an expansion of protected areas to cover 30% of the country’s territory and restoring 10,000 kilometers of rivers – though it remains unclear when, where, and how this will happen. Specific mention of 15 “green bridges” for wildlife and 10 wildlife rehabilitation centers is not unwelcome, but seems overplayed considering that nothing is said of more strategic interventions, no mention of water and how to address growing conflicts around this key resource in times of climate change. Nor was a word spoken of the need to avoid the negative impact of development projects through environmental assessments and biodiversity safeguards without which investments could end up doing more harm than good., Delegates also heard nothing about opportunities to work with nature rather than against it – by, for instance, relying on restored wetlands to naturally purify water, absorb floodwaters, and recharge groundwater rather than investing in expensive gray infrastructure. Investments in green infrastructure can yield multiple benefits, and are often cheaper than pouring concrete. Indeed, in some cases the decision not to rebuild damaged infrastructure, like dams, may also be an opportunity., The impression that we are left with is greenwashing – a few buzzwords and a bit of environmental packaging, without taking this really seriously. But the environment provides the foundations for economic, social, and cultural progress, and will be critical to the future development of Ukraine. Not taking that fully into account would be terribly shortsighted. It would risk not only wasting precious resources, but could even reverse what advances have been made., Whatever the shortcomings, it is remarkable that the Ukrainian government was able to table a proposal given the challenges of the ongoing war. The government plan and the initial discussions at the Lugano conference provide a “zero version” for commentary and improvement. That opportunity must be seized., Many of the speakers at Lugano highlighted the importance of good governance, including adequate public participation, transparency, accountability, and conditionality. They echoed the earlier demands of 50 Ukrainian NGOs laid out in theirgreen reconstruction principles., Reconstruction in Ukraine presents not only a massive challenge, but also an opportunity to restore the country in a way that respects nature while taking into account conditions not only as they have been but as they will be. We must invest in and for the future, not the past., Bohdan Vykhor is CEO of WWF-Ukraine and Andreas Beckmann is regional CEO of WWF-Central and Eastern Europe.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-invest-future-dont-rebuild-past
Polio mission to Western Ukraine to assess critical outbreak response activities being implemented to protect children from further infection especially during this war period,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,15 Jul 2022,"15 July 2022, Polio mission to Western Ukraine to assess critical outbreak response activities being implemented to protect children from further infection especially during this war period., The aim of the visit was to assess the polio outbreak response activities like vaccination and surveillance being implemented during this war period and to reawaken the commitment of the regional authorities and Regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention (RCDC) towards the ongoing polio outbreak. During the 3 days mission, the team had discussions with Heads of Health Departments of Regional State Administrations, Representatives of Regional State Administrations and health care workers., Since the confirmation of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Ukraine last year in Rivne oblast, the GPEI Partners – WHO, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International – are assisting the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Public Health Center of Ukraine in responding to the polio outbreak in Ukraine., The polio outbreak is still ongoing and is being complicated by the war, when high population movement started due to the invasion by the Russian Federation, hence increasing the risk of exporting poliovirus to other regions and countries. Despite the war, the catch-up vaccination campaign is ongoing though very slowly. So far 70% of the targeted children have been vaccinated with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)., About Poliovirus in Ukraine, Ukraine has been experiencing an outbreak of type-2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) since October 2021. The circulation of virus has been confirmed in two oblasts: Rivne and Zakarpattya., To date two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have tested positive for cVDPV2, and the virus has also been detected in 19 asymptomatic contacts., Since the war began, a lot of population were displaced, including the 2 positive cases whose whereabout cannot be traced. An intensified AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance is ongoing across the country, along with environmental surveillance. To date 61 AFP cases have been reported from January 2022, results have been negative so far., About international spread, In the current crisis setting, this outbreak poses a substantial risk of international spread due to subnational gaps in immunization coverage in countries surrounding Ukraine since 2020 caused by local-level disruptions in immunization programmes due to COVID-19 pandemic, declining performance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in multiple countries and mass population movement linked to the war., About Poliovirus and how to protect children, Poliovirus is transmitted via a fecal-oral route, this can also contaminate the environment hence posing a great risk for vulnerable children. The only reliable way to prevent the development of poliomyelitis is vaccination. The vaccines are free, safe and effective. In Ukraine, children are vaccinated for the prevention of poliomyelitis at the age of 2 and 4 months with an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and at 6, 18 months and 6, 14 years with an oral poliovaccine (OPV). To protect against polio all children MUST be vaccinated against polio with at least 3 doses of the vaccine with an interval of 1 month between each dose., A catch-up polio vaccination campaign was launched on February 1st targeting children 6 months to 6 years. This activity is being affected by the war but is ongoing in primary health care facilities., Mission participants about Poliovirus in Ukraine, Dr Ihor Kuzin, the Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine: “Vaccination rates across the country have dropped significantly because of the war. And our task is to do everything possible to ensure that the coverage of routine immunization is high, one of the priorities is vaccination against poliomyelitis. We organized this joint mission with WHO in three regions: Lviv, Zakarpattya and Rivne, where additional organizational, training and information initiatives are planned to strengthen response to the polio outbreak. Poliomyelitis is a debilitating infectious disease which causes irreversible paralysis and there is no medicine to cure it. Vaccination is the only reliable method of protection. We will not be calm until all children are fully vaccinated against polio and other vaccine preventable infections”., Orest Chemerys, Director of Healthcare department of Lviv Regional State Administration: “We recognize the fact that we are yet to achieve the desired polio vaccination coverage. Before the war, we were negatively affected by COVID-19. With the war, there are many displaced persons in the territory of the region. We have been working to support the IDPs. We have conducted some awareness sensitization sessions and supported 2 to 3 mobile vaccinations per week. Vaccines are available, there is no problem with availability and logistics now. Some of our challenges in Lviv region is that some communities are hard to reach because they are in mountainous areas, others are along the international border which is also very far and hard to reach. There is also low perception about vaccines amongst these hard-to-reach communities hence low coverage of vaccination in these districts. We request that WHO should organize seminars, webinars to build our capacity about polio”., Anatolii Pshenychnyi Director of Healthcare department of Zakarpattya Regional State Administration: “We are happy to welcome this delegation who is on an international mission to Zakarpattya and we are expecting technical recommendations on how to deal with the challenges that the region had been facing before the war, and which have become even greater due to the large number of internally displaced persons., Zakarpattya being a border region with several countries, we had many challenges associated with migration even before the war. Other issues are personal prejudices about vaccination in general, including polio vaccination. We hope to work more actively with territorial communities, looking for our own approach to each community, how to effectively involve them in immunization routines, including polio”., Raymond Dankoli, WHO Polio Outbreak Response Coordinator: “Polio is one of the diseases that threatens the life and development of a child. Vaccination is one of the safe way to protect children from the threat of infectious diseases. GPEI partners will continue to support and coordinate with regional and health authorities to provide all necessary skills and technical expertise to improve on the country’s vaccination and surveillance indicators. Process of polio vaccine procurement is ongoing to avoid stockout. All eligible children should be presented for vaccination. There are common challenges to all regions however, there are some region-specific challenges. The efforts of the regions to solve their challenges are appreciated. The polio team will continue to work together with the regions to stop further transmission of the poliovirus. I call on everyone to use their circle of control and circle of influence to ensure that all children are vaccinated according to the national vaccination schedule”., Roman Safonov, Chief sanitary doctor of the Rivne region: “As the representative of the regional authority we can confidently say that we are working hard to ensure everything necessary for vaccination is made available. We ensure that there are trained health workers to administer vaccinations in the health facilities and all the logistics needed to make vaccines available in the health facilities are also provided. However, one of our biggest challenges is wrong perception about vaccination among some parents or caregivers, religious and community leaders. We need a lot of support in this direction so that we get their buy-in as we contribute to eradicating crippling disease as polio and other vaccine preventable infections. We call on international partners to support us in educating these group of influential persons in our communities”., Contacts: Tatiana Dolhova, WHO Ukraine communication officer, dolhovat@who.int, tel:+ 380 63 800 77 35",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/polio-mission-western-ukraine-assess-critical-outbreak-response-activities-being-implemented-protect-children-further-infection-especially-during-war-period

How MSF partners with community groups in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Jul 2022,"When Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) began assessing the humanitarian needs in Ukraine, the number of Ukrainian volunteer networks, non-profit organizations, and civil society groups that had swiftly mobilized was striking., In late February, as war broke out in Ukraine, Dmitry Zakharov, the owner of a local barbecue restaurant and a car wash in the city of Kharkiv, started wondering what he could do to help his community. “After I heard the first explosions, I went to the grocery store to get food for my family,” he said. “I saw a long line of people waiting to buy drinking water, but there wasn’t enough available.”, Zakharov’s restaurant had its own potable water supply, so he started giving it away for free. When a local meat factory was damaged in the fighting and had to shut down, he gathered up the meat and distributed it to the community before it spoiled., Soon, his humanitarian efforts took over his businesses. The restaurant’s dining rooms were cleared to provide space for free medical care. And under a large bright sign advertising Zakharov’s car wash, volunteers now serve nutritious free lunches daily to the community. When the situation in the neighborhood is stable enough, an MSF doctor and psychologist provide care in the front of Zakharov’s restaurant alongside volunteer nurses from the community who administer treatment to cancer patients in the next room and community volunteers who cook meals for around 1,200 people each day., MSF teams throughout Ukraine are working with dozens of local groups, including volunteers who deliver thousands of food boxes to remote villages, railway authorities that provide trains for MSF's medical evacuation services, and volunteer drivers that deliver medications to patients’ homes. These groups are run by people who are directly affected by the war., “MSF wanted to help strengthen what they’d already built,” said Barbara Hessel, MSF’s project coordinator in Kharkiv. “These local groups have provided the vast majority of humanitarian aid in Ukraine. These are the right people to deliver aid to their communities. They’ve been here and will continue to be here after we are gone, but they do need support.”, Reaching those cut off from aid, Yana Biletskaya started organizing humanitarian outreach with some friends as soon as the war began. Their goal was to reach residents of the many villages located far from Kharkiv city who were completely cut off from other sources of aid. A massive warehouse inside a train station is filled with donations from various organizations: canned food sent from a small school in England sits next to a wall of large boxes from an international nongovernmental organization. The group loads donations directly onto trains that will deliver them to around 100 different community groups in the countryside who will then distribute the items to residents, many of whom are elderly., “We started off with 50 people here in the station,” said Biletskaya, “And now we are 20. But we are also much more efficient than we were at first. We went from working 24 hours every day to putting in fewer hours but better organizing our time. Our problem now is fuel, it’s very difficult for our volunteers to get fuel for distributions.”, MSF has provided thousands of food boxes (one box of non-perishable items feeds a family of three to four for a week) and hygiene kits containing toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, and other essentials to people throughout Kharkiv city and oblast in partnership with volunteer networks like Biletskaya’s., Partnering with groups and individuals like this allows the MSF to reach far more people. “Together we can do so much more,” said Hessel. “They have the capacity to deliver 3,000 meals in one day—their networks are so well-organized.” The groups are also in contact with each other and can tell MSF and other NGOs where there are additional needs., Finding a purpose in helping, Daria Samoilova, MSF’s volunteer liaison officer in Kharkiv, was on a very different track before the war upended her life—like many of the volunteers she works with and her Ukrainian colleagues. “I was a lawyer. I had a good life. I’d traveled to 38 countries,” said Samoilova. “[When the war started] I knew everything was changing and it was possible that my life could be destroyed—that I could die.”, Seven days into the war, a large building by her mother’s home was destroyed by an explosion. They packed and left for a different part of the country. But Samoilova wanted to come home., “I needed to start a new life,” she said. Samoilova started working with MSF, first as a translator and then in her current role connecting with and overseeing partnerships between local groups and MSF. After just a few days into her role, Samoilova realized something. “I felt happy,” she said. “I was doing something good and kind, and everyone I was working with had the same idea: to help.”, Even as the war enters its sixth month, causing ever more death, displacement, psychological distress, and economic instability, local volunteers and organizations show no sign of scaling down their work. Zakharov, Biletskaya, and others say they want to do more, not less., With this in mind, MSF has started helping volunteers and community leaders develop self-care and stress management strategies. “They deserve recognition for the work they are doing,” Garcia says. “More than anything, though, we want to provide them with continuous support so they can keep helping their peers in need.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/how-msf-partners-community-groups-ukraine
Ukraine: EU grants access to funding under the EU4Health programme,News and Press Release,ECHO,Health,15 Jul 2022,"Today, as part of the Commission's ongoing efforts to provide support in the area of health, Commissioner Kyriakides visited Ukraine to meet Minister of Health Viktor Liashko and pay a visit to a medical centre for children as well as a patient rehabilitation centre. At this occasion, the Commission and the Ukrainian Government have signed an agreement associating Ukraine to the EU4Health programme. This agreement will open access for Ukraine to EU funding in the area of health. This will enable the Ukrainian health system to respond to immediate needs and contribute to long-term recovery. The programme has a total budget of €5.3 billion for 2021-27., Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said: “What I witnessed today during my visit in the resilience and stoicism of health professionals and patients was truly humbling. I have been deeply moved and saddened by the pain and suffering I saw as a result of the barbaric and senseless Russian invasion. With the EU4Health programme agreement signed today, Ukraine will be able to quickly benefit from EU health-related funding to immediately support its health care sector as well as support the reconstruction in the longer-term. The Russian war in Ukraine is causing unimaginable physical and mental suffering for millions of people, and it is putting tremendous pressure on a severely damaged public health system. Today, as we deepen our health cooperation, we are sending another clear signal of the EU's full and unwavering support to Ukraine”., Minister of Health of Ukraine, Viktor Liashko, said: “Ukraine's participation in this programme is another example of how European integration will improve the lives of our citizens through access to relevant EU funds. The powerful EU support that we are seeing today means possibilities to receive financial assistance for the modernisation and recovery of our healthcare system”., With the entry into force of the agreement associating Ukraine to EU4Health, the Ukrainian health authorities and wider health community will be able to fully benefit from the funding opportunities under the programme, on equal terms as their counterparts from EU Members States, Norway, and Iceland. The agreement will be retroactive to 1 January 2022, allowing Ukraine to start participating in funding opportunities immediately under the EU4Health Work Programme 2022., The EU4Health programme will support mitigating immediate combat-related damage and finance Ukrainian public and private projects helping with Ukraine's post-war reconstruction., Representatives from Ukraine will be associated to the political debates with EU Member States during the preparation of future annual work programmes, thereby strengthening cooperation and facilitating implementation of the actions., Background, In comparison with the three previous health programmes, the EU4Health Programme, adopted in May 2021 with a budget of €5.3 billion for 2021-2027, represents an unprecedented level of financial commitment from the Union in the area of health. EU4Health will make a significant contribution to the EU's post-COVID-19 recovery and contribute to long-term health challenges by building stronger, more resilient, and more accessible health systems., EU4Health is implemented through annual work programmes. The first two work programmes have already been adopted, making more than €1.1 Billion available for funding (€311.8 million for 2021; and €835.5 million for 2022). The EU4Health actions fall under four strands: disease prevention, crisis preparedness, health systems, and digital, with a cross-cutting focus on cancer., Ukraine made an official request for association to the EU4Health programme on 9 September 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-grants-access-funding-under-eu4health-programme

A strike on Chasiv Yar in the Government-controlled part of eastern Donetska oblast on 9 July hit a municipal dormitory for vulnerable people. By 12 July, local authorities confirmed that 34 people, including a child, had been killed, and nine injured civilians had been rescued from under the collapsed building. Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. for Ukraine Sebastian Rhodes Stampa condemned the strike, once again stressing that the parties to the conflict have an obligation under international humanitarian law to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure in times of war. The attack on Chasiv Yar is the second deadliest since the start of the war, after the 8 April airstrike on a train station in Kramatorsk, which killed nearly 60 people. It adds to the growing toll of casualties and severe damage of the past two weeks caused by attacks which hit civilian areas, including the strike on a residential building and recreation centre in Serhiivka in southern Odeska oblast on 1 July and the missile that hit a shopping centre in Kremenchuk in central Poltavska oblast just days earlier on 27 June., At the same time, the frequency and severity of civilian attacks have intensified on both sides of the front line and in different parts of the country, particularly in eastern Luhanska and Kharkivska and south-eastern Zaporizka oblasts. According to humanitarian sources and authorities, heavy shelling and more than 160 civilian casualties were reported on both sides in Donetska oblast from 8 to 11 July. The Government-controlled cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were allegedly a focus of the fighting, following reports of civilian casualties and damages to houses and other vital civilian infrastructure in other Government-controlled parts of the oblast, including the towns of Bakhmut and Toretsk. Multiple-launch rocket system fire reportedly resulted in more than 35 civilian casualties in the eastern city of Kharkiv on 11 July, when several residential buildings, a shopping centre and other civilian buildings were struck. Several residential buildings, a shopping centre and other civilian buildings were reportedly struck the eastern city of Kharkiv on 11 July, causing more than 35 civilian casualties, according to the local authorities., Elsewhere in Ukraine, rocket fire and missile strikes were reported in Odeska and Zaporizka oblasts, while reports of repeated destructive attacks on the southern city of Mykolaiv and across Mykolaivska oblast continue to emerge. On 12 July, for example, two hospitals were reportedly hit in the city centre, according to humanitarian security reports and local authorities. The following day, 13 July, five civilians were reportedly killed due to hostilities in the area, according to local sources., Although displacement trends are much more fluid than at the start of the war, fighting and hostilities continued to push people from their homes or prevent them from moving back. Inside Ukraine, over 5 million people went back home, while about 6.3 million are still internally displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. The number of forcibly displaced people seeking refuge in European countries still stands at nearly 6 million. In its latest report, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) highlights that only 16 per cent of surveyed refugees have plans to return to Ukraine due to a high level of uncertainty about the future, and most of them intend to come back only temporarily.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-13-jul-2022-enruuk

Traditional values and patriarchal views that condone discrimination and violence against women and girls remain widespread, while existing gender inequalities are continuously compounded by the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The present study is based on perception data from January to May 2021 and seeks to map the realities and needs of women in Ukraine, the obstacles they faced and their ability to overcome these. The study focusses on key dimensions of the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation (SCORE) Index indicators that align with global gender equality indices and metrics, including economic, civic and political participation, as well as health, wellbeing, and exposure to adversity. The study subsequently aims to provide quantitative evidence from which actionable recommendations can be derived for achieving progress in gender equality and women’s empowerment in Ukraine, a prerequisite for both the success of any democratisation and development agenda, and for Ukraine’s post-war recovery., SCORE results show that women report higher levels of subjective poverty and economic insecurity, experiencing lower employment rates despite having equal educational attainment compared to men. The women most vulnerable to economic fragility tend to be older and more rural, suffering from poorer health outcomes and facing barriers in their access to services, as well as feeling disenfranchised from the state and their personal role in civic life. Women overall are less likely to be active citizens, and their civic empowerment was found to depend on their sense of agency and civic responsibility, trust in civil society and political security, as well as intergroup contact, leadership and entrepreneurial skills. When age-related effects are accounted for, women continue to experience lower physical health status and mental wellbeing, both of which are exacerbated by economic fragility and by insufficient access to medical services. Harmful gender norms continue to be pervasive, particularly in men, and while exposure to physical and psychological domestic abuse is similar for both women and men in the sample, women have lower personal security., Actors seeking to alleviate the challenges faced by the most vulnerable segments of the population should focus on targeting economic and employability recovery, and directing financial assistance to the most vulnerable, isolated and hard-to-reach citizens, namely, older and more rural women. There is a need to expand the provision of psychosocial support, eliminating the stigma surrounding this, and scaling up protection mechanisms for women survivors of domestic violence. Finally, education on the equal rights of women and men, and the importance of women’s equal contribution to social and civic life should be mainstreamed and popularized, with targeted emphasis on men of all ages and rural citizens.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment-ukraine

In anticipation of potentially the “worst winter since the independence of Ukraine”, additional funds are urgently required to prepare at-risk communities and fast-track urgent activities that will have the most effective results for vulnerable individuals and families. As the winter temperature is predicted to plummet as low as –20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country, severe impact will be felt by millions living in sub-standard conditions or without sufficient personal insulation or access to heating., Early planning is essential to ensure warm, safe and dignified living conditions for affected people prior to the onset of winter. The Government of Ukraine is leading preparation and implementation of winterization activities, while the UN and humanitarian partners are collaborating to complement this through interventions to address acute humanitarian needs over the winter period. With adequate preparation and timely funding, many lives can be saved, particularly those vulnerable displaced and war affected, during months of freezing temperatures., This Plan is grounded in a people-centred approach, prioritising IDPs and people living in sub-standard housing with critical interventions that can ensure warm, safe and dignified living conditions - complemented by targeted sectoral activities. The Plan describes a multisector response aimed at providing critical, life-saving interventions to protect the most vulnerable from the depredations of winter through the early procurement and distribution of winter items and repairs, and calls for $226 million to commence time-critical procurement, distribution and repair activities, providing an initial 1.7 million people with support in advance of the 2022/2023 winter season.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-winterization-plan-winter-priority-procurement-repair-plan-2022-2023

After a baseline round of data collection (‘Rapid Needs Assessment’), REACH launched a second round of data collection, focused specifically on conflict-affected areas (CAA) in the east and south, as well as a selection of IDP-hosting settlements along evacuation routes or in key arrival hubs. Following two additional rounds of data collection, a fourth round was launched in government-controlled areas (GCA), covering both conflict-affected and IDPhosting areas., Data collection for the fourth round was conducted between May 30th and June 11th through 639 telephone interviews with key informants (KIs) representing non-government organisations (NGOs), local authorities and civil society in 213 settlements (towns or villages). A total of 3 settlements were selected in every raion across conflict-affected areas in GCA, with a target distribution of 35%/58%/7% between rural, urban, and urban-type settlements, respectively to reflect the rural/urban/urban-type population distribution in Ukraine., While the current assessment was conducted in GCA settlements, concurrent data collection was conducted in non-government-controlled areas (NGCA).

Update 86 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (14 July 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,14 Jul 2022,"Ukraine has received a large batch of vital radiation protection and monitoring equipment offered by Australia and France and delivered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The Director General said the shipment of personal protective equipment, radiation dosimeters and radiation and contamination monitors marked a milestone in IAEA-led efforts to ensure nuclear safety and security during the current military conflict in Ukraine, which has four operational nuclear power plants (NPPs) with 15 reactors, as well as many other radiation-related facilities., “This is a major step forward in our joint work to help Ukraine reduce the risk of a nuclear accident or a radiological emergency. I’m very grateful for the generous support provided by Australia and France, as well as by many other countries that have also offered to assist,” he said. “Despite significant logistical and other hurdles, the equipment has now arrived in Ukraine where it will be put to good use by our Ukrainian counterparts.”, The IAEA has also previously assisted Ukraine with equipment during three safety, security and safeguards missions to the country in recent months. But this was the first shipment organized through the IAEA’s Response and Assistance Network (RANET), where countries can register their capabilities for support in areas ranging from radiation dose assessments and decontamination to nuclear installation assessment and advice, radioactive source search and recovery, and much else., Australia and France are among 12 IAEA Member States registered in RANET that have so far offered to provide specialised equipment to Ukraine, in response to a comprehensive request for equipment the country said it needed for the safe and secure operation of its nuclear facilities. Ukraine’s list included radiation measurement devices, protective equipment, computer-related assistance, power supply systems and diesel generators, among other items., This week’s shipment consisted of more than 160 dosimeters and monitors that are important for safety and radiation protection as well as hundreds of items of personal protective equipment, including full body suits, masks and disposable gloves and covers., Australia donated its share of the delivery, while the IAEA procured additional equipment with funds from France., “More safety and security-related equipment will be transported to Ukraine in the coming months, thanks to substantial support from countries offering equipment and others providing extra-budgetary contributions for our assistance. The needs are large, and I encourage other countries to also step forward with support for our crucial work in Ukraine,” Director General Grossi said., “Together with Ukraine, we have made significant progress in identifying and beginning to address what is needed for the highest possible level of safety and security at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and activities involving radioactive sources during these unprecedented and extremely challenging times,” he said. “But a lot remains to be done. I am fully focused on doing everything possible to prevent a nuclear accident that could have severe consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond.”, Director General Grossi once again stressed the importance of the IAEA being able to travel to the Zaporizhzya NPP (ZNPP) to conduct essential safety, security and safeguards activities at Ukraine’s largest NPP. The IAEA has not been able to visit the ZNPP since before the current military conflict in Ukraine. Russian forces took control of the plant more than four months ago, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate it., In official communications this week, Ukraine informed the IAEA about the “extremely difficult” situation at the ZNPP “due to constant pressure” on its employees., Director General Grossi reiterated his growing concern about the severe and challenging conditions facing staff at the ZNPP and the impact of such conditions on the safety and security of the plant, saying this further underlined the need for the IAEA to go there as soon as possible., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the four operational NPPs, but it is still experiencing a partial loss of safeguards data transfer from Chornobyl, he said., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that nine of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including three at the ZNPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-86-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-14-july-2022
"SRSG Patten’s Remarks for the Ministerial Level Accountability Conference for Ukraine, Prioritizing the Interests and Needs of Survivors and Victims of Core International Crimes, The Hague, 14 July 2022",News and Press Release,OSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",14 Jul 2022,"Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,, In my recent briefings to the United Nations Security Council, I posed the question: “What do the ten resolutions on Women, Peace and Security – half of which focus squarely on eradicating conflict-related sexual violence – mean right now for a woman in Ukraine?” Despite robust normative commitments, the world has seen mounting allegations of sexual violence since the invasion of 24th of February and heard harrowing testimonies of brutal sexual violence. By mid-May, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Team was aware of 108 acts of CRSV committed against women, girls, men, and boys, across a range of regions. As always, reported incidents of sexual violence, in the midst of active armed conflict, represent only the extreme tip of the iceberg., This conflict has cost thousands of lives, displaced millions, and dramatically increased the risk of sexual violence – war’s oldest, most silenced, and least condemned crime. The focus of this session, a survivor-centered approach to accountability, is critical to breaking the vicious cycle of silence and impunity, by giving voice and choice to the survivors., On 3 May, I traveled to Kyiv and signed a Framework of Cooperation with the Government of Ukraine, which includes specific commitments to advance accountability for sexual violence crimes. My Office will support these efforts, including through the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict. I also visited Poland and Moldova, in response to warning signs of conflict-driven trafficking in persons, including for the purposes of sexual exploitation. For predators and human traffickers, this war is not a tragedy but an opportunity, with over 90 percent of those fleeing Ukraine being women and children. It is critical that individuals and networks implicated in human trafficking are held accountable, and that border guards, police, and immigration officials in Ukraine as well as in refugee-receiving countries are trained to detect and deter these crimes., Historically, accountability for sexual violence crimes has been the rare exception, rather than the rule. We cannot allow this history of justice delayed and justice denied to be repeated in relation to events currently unfolding in Ukraine. Instead, we must urgently adopt a “survivor-centered approach” that prioritizes survivors’ rights, needs, and aspirations over any political considerations. This will be a critical contribution to restoring peace and offering the survivors a measure of healing and hope., The first step for any survivor is to ensure their physical, psychological, and economic security, which is foundational for safe reporting. Sexual violence survivors face acute risks of stigmatization, rejection, reprisals, and re-traumatization. Accountability cannot be separated from investment in comprehensive services for survivors, including measures to address stigmatization and support to socioeconomic reintegration. I urge you member states hosting refugees to provide a safe and enabling environment for survivors, with access to comprehensive services, including sexual and reproductive healthcare, specialized trauma counseling and psychosocial support., I have heard reports that some survivors are reluctant to come forward to seek even basic medical care, due to fear that their personal information may be reported to the authorities without their consent. We must urgently implement all protocols in place to uphold the “do no harm” principle, including the need to respect confidentiality and ensure the informed consent of the survivor. Security protocols are also critical to protect those being interviewed. This is paramount to building trust and confidence in accountability processes. All justice processes must ensure the engagement and involvement of the affected communities, the victims and survivors. The experiences are theirs. The “evidence” is theirs. The justice is for them. And it is clear that nothing about them, without them, can ever be truly for them., Effective accountability processes are built on the systematic gathering of timely, reliable, accurate, and objective information. Documentation is not an end in itself. Evidence collection is not justice, evidence is only as valuable as its end-use. We cannot be content with remaining mere archivist. Beyond evidence collection a clear prosecutorial and prioritization strategy is necessary to ensure that sexual violence crimes will be prosecuted. This is why the operational methodology of my Team of Experts on Rule of Law is to ensure that today’s documentation translates into tomorrow’s prosecutions., Finally, our efforts must be complementary and coordinated. We have heard too often of survivors facing “interview fatigue,” after dealing with a multiplicity of actors. An uncoordinated approach can risk tainting the evidence, generating inconsistencies that can result in testimony being discredited in a court of law, and more importantly, retraumatizing victims and witnesses. It can also result in gaps and overlaps in the response., We know that a culture of impunity for sexual violence fuels violations and emboldens the perpetrators. Let us therefore put all perpetrators and potential perpetrators, at any level of the chain of command, on notice that they will face the full force of justice according to law. At the same time, we must deliver justice to the victims, including reparations and redress., Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a pivotal moment where we can and must ensure that commitments on paper are translated into practical action for survivors. My mandate will do everything in its power to support that goal., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/srsg-pattens-remarks-ministerial-level-accountability-conference-ukraine-prioritizing-interests-and-needs-survivors-and-victims-core-international-crimes-hague-14-july-2022

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (2 - 8 July 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jul 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, with violence also spilling across the border into Russia. In Uzbekistan, police deployed deadly force against demonstrators. Far-left violence increased in Greece in solidarity with a jailed anarchist. LGBT+ Pride marches continued across the region, as well as solidarity demonstrations condemning the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Farmers continued to demonstrate against plans to restrict nitrogen emissions in the Netherlands and Belgium. In Germany, an explosive device was detonated near a Left Party office. Meanwhile, fighting continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. On 3 July, after heavy fighting, the Ukrainian army was forced to withdraw from Lysychansk, with Russian forces currently controlling all the large cities in the Luhansk region. From the occupied Luhansk region, Russian forces continued offensive operations in the direction of the Donetsk region (Suspilne Media, 9 July 2022). Ukrainian forces struck nearly a dozen Russian ammunition depots in the Kherson, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions (Newsweek, 7 July 2022). Meanwhile, alleged partisan groups blew up another Russian ammunition depot and a bridge used by Russian forces to transport military equipment in the Kherson region., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling and airstrikes, killing dozens of civilians in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Zaporizhia, and Mykolaiv regions last week.1, In Russia last week, the governors of the Belgorod and Bryansk regions reported artillery shelling coming from Ukrainian territory and drone strikes in the border areas (The Moscow Times, 5 July 2022; Kommersant, 8 July 2022). Additionally, a Russian border guard was killed and three others were injured in a grenade and small arms attack in the Belgorod region, a few hundred meters away from the Russia-Ukraine border (Meduza, 6 July 2022). This violence contributes to the 220% increase in violence in Russia last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month. Russian border villages have occasionally come under fire since mid-March, with some incidents confirmed as accidental shelling by Russian forces. Ukraine has not commented on last week's incidents, but has previously denied targeting Russian territory (Ukrinform, 14 July 2022)., Russian police forces broke up several small anti-war pickets, while rallies against the war and in solidarity with Ukraine were also held in France, Germany, Poland, and Switzerland., In Uzbekistan, mass demonstrations in the Karakalpakstan region, against a constitutional amendment that would remove the right of the region to seek independence, continued on 2 July. In the regional capital, Nukus, people also protested against the arrest of an informal leader of the protest movement and widely-known lawyer, Dauletmurat Tajimuratov (BASE, 2 July 2022). The Uzbek government used deadly force to suppress the demonstrations. On 4 July, the country's prosecutor general reported that 18 people had been killed and over 200 wounded, with over 500 being detained during the demonstrations (RFE/RL, 4 July 2022). The actual number of casualties is likely higher though remains difficult to verify due to a state of emergency in the region and information blackout (RFE/RL, 4 July 2022; Gazeta.uz, 2 July 2022). Non-governmental sources claim that around 35 people demonstrating in support of Tajimuratov outside his house were killed during his second arrest on 2 July (ACCA Media, 11 July 2022). Following the demonstrations, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev rolled back the amendment affecting the Karakalpakstan region's right to secede; other draft amendments are still under consideration, including one that would allow Mirziyoyev to remain president for two additional terms (RBC, 4 July 2022)., In Greece, there was an increase in far-left violence last week. Anarchist groups staged a series of petrol bomb attacks against riot police in the Athens neighborhood of Exarchia and an explosion at the apartment building of a deputy of the ruling party, New Democracy. As a result, two police officers were hospitalized and over 30 people were arrested (AMNA, 6 July 2022). Additionally, a group called 'Effectively Solidary Anarchists' blew up a tax office in northern Athens. The attacks were reportedly perpetrated in solidarity with a jailed anarchist after his release request was rejected for a second time. The anarchist became known as the 'Archer of the Constitution' during the February 2011 riots when he attacked the parliament building with a bow and arrow (Ekathimerini, 7 July 2022; Ekathimirini, 8 July 2022). These trends contribute to the 233% increase in violence in Attica, home to Athens, last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in Attica in the past month., Despite the official end of Pride Month at the end of June, LGBT+ Pride marches continued to be held in the region last week, with events recorded in Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the Pride in London parade was attended by more than one million people, in what organizers described as the ""biggest"" gathering in favor of LGBT+ rights in the country's history (BBC News, 2 July 2022)., Meanwhile, solidarity demonstrations condemning the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, restricting access to abortion, continued in the region last week. Rallies in solidarity with US women and in defense of women's right to abortion were recorded in Croatia, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., In the Netherlands, farmers' deep-rooted discontent with the government's plans to cut nitrogen emissions, rekindled in June after new reduction targets were introduced, continued to fuel a high volume of events last week. In over 110 demonstration events recorded across the country, farmers blocked supermarket distribution hubs and highways (Reuters, 4 July 2022). In several instances, clashes also broke out between farmers and police forces, notably in Heerenveen, where a violent demonstration erupted on 4 July. The next day, a police officer fired live ammunition at a farmer attempting to slip through a police blockade during a protest. ACLED's Conflict Change Map first warned of increased violence to come in the Netherlands in the past month. Gatherings in solidarity with the Dutch farmers' movement were staged by fishermen and other actors, and by farmers in Germany. Farmers also took to the streets in Flanders in Belgium to denounce similar governmental plans to cut nitrogen emissions in their sector., In Germany, unknown assailants detonated a homemade explosive device near a local Left Party office in downtown Oberhausen in North Rhine-Westphalia on the night between 4 and 5 July, damaging the interior of the premises and nearby businesses. While police continue to investigate different leads, Left Party officials claim the detonation was a targeted attack by the far-right, after stickers with neo-Nazi messages were stuck on the office and local party officials received threatening letters (DW, 5 July 2022; Die Zeit, 7 July 2022)., Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations increased last week. Fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces was recorded in the Shahumyan region of Azerbaijan and the Vayots Dzor region of Armenia. These trends contribute to the 140% increase in violence in Shahumyan last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in Shahumyan in the past month.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-2-8-july-2022
Russia: Forcible Disappearances of Ukrainian Civilians [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jul 2022,"Detainees Unlawfully Transferred to Russia, Possibly Held as Hostages, (Berlin, July 14, 2022) – Russian forces in Ukraine have forcibly disappeared civilians and illegally transferred them to Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch documented the detention of nine civilian men by Russian forces while they occupied Ukraine’s Kyiv region, and their apparent transfer to detention facilities in Russia’s Kursk and Bryansk regions when the forces rotated out or withdrew., The family and friends of the men told Human Rights Watch that those being detained are civilians, which means they should be treated as “protected persons,” not prisoners of war (POWs), under the Geneva Conventions applicable to the armed conflict in Ukraine. They said they learned about the men’s locations from former prisoners who had shared cells or had otherwise seen them in Russian facilities. Russian violations committed against these detainees include possible unlawful confinement and hostage-taking, unlawful transfer or deportation, and enforced disappearances, which may amount to or involve multiple war crimes., “Russian forces unlawfully transferred these civilians to Russia, forcibly disappeared them, and continue to hold them without providing information or access to their families,” said Tanya Lokshina, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Russian authorities should immediately release and return all Ukrainian civilians detained in Russia and ensure that everyone in their custody who was detained in or from Ukraine, combatant or civilian, is officially registered with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).”, In a June report, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said that it had documented hundreds of cases of arbitrary detention by Russian forces in areas they, or affiliated armed groups, control in Ukraine. The report that said many were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and that and “an unknown number of victims were transferred to territory of the Russian Federation …” among other locations, where they were “held in penal institutions, often together with prisoners of war.”, Artur Prihno of Media Initiative for Human Rights (MIHR), a Ukrainian nongovernmental human rights group, told Human Rights Watch that after Russian forces detained civilians in Ukraine, they transferred them to a camp in Naroulia, Belarus and, between 3 and 10 days later, took them to Russia. Some of what families have learned about their missing relatives suggests that Russian authorities may be treating the civilians as POWs, and at a minimum are detaining them with POWs. Ukrainian authorities dealing with POWs have also informed relevant families that they received information that five of the men – Bohdan Shcherba, Ramiz Musaev, Roman Kissel, Vasyl Volokhin, and Serhii Liubich – are in detention in Russia., Two lawyers who attempted to visit detention facilities in Kursk and the town of Novozybkov in Bryansk told Human Rights Watch that the authorities refused to grant them access, acknowledge the detention, or disclose detainees’ whereabouts. One lawyer said his team tried at least five times to access both detention facilities, most recently in mid-June. Relatives also sent written requests for information about their loved ones to both detention facilities and received replies that the men were not there. This amounts to enforced disappearance, a crime under international human rights law in all circumstances., International humanitarian law prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers of civilians from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying power, which can constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law also prohibits hostage-taking. Detaining civilians for the purpose of using them in future prisoner exchanges would constitute the war crime of hostage-taking., The June UN report described “credible reports of torture and other forms of inhuman treatment of prisoners of war interned both in territory of the Russian Federation and territory controlled by Russian-affiliated armed groups [in territory of the Russian Federation],” including in the Kursk pretrial detention facility., “Ukrainian civilians detained by Russian forces not only lose their liberty, but also face a serious risk to their health and lives by being held without legal or public oversight,” Lokshina said. “Russian authorities should immediately reveal the whereabouts of and free all Ukrainian civilians in their custody, detained in formerly or currently occupied areas.”, People ‘Disappeared’, All nine men whose families or friends Human Rights Watch interviewed were detained between February 26 and March 18 in the Kyiv region: five from the Bucha district, two from Hostomel, and one each from the town Dymer and the village of Dorohynka., Sent to Kursk, Six of the men whose relatives or friends spoke with Human Rights Watch were transferred to Kursk. These include Bohdan Shcherba, 31, his brother-in-law; Ramiz Musaev, 24; and their friend, Roman Kissel, 30. On February 26, Russian soldiers detained the three men while they were driving from Lubianka, a village near Bucha, to the neighboring village of Ozera., Shcherba’s wife recognized him and Kissel in a video a Russian TV channel released in March, claiming to show Ukrainian captives in Hostomel. Two weeks later, Shcherba’s colleague found his undamaged car abandoned on the road with the doors and trunk open and license plates missing., A friend of Ivan Remez told Human Rights Watch that Russian forces detained Remez, 31, in Hostomel when he was riding his bicycle delivering humanitarian aid to older people on March 6. The friend said she had spoken with two released POWs who said they saw Remez while in Kursk pretrial detention center no. 1., On March 5, Russian soldiers in Hostomel detained 25-year-old Mykola Smagliuk and another man whose name is withheld for his safety, who had left their shelter to take out trash. Smagliuk’s relative told Human Rights Watch that she spoke with the other man after he was released from detention in Kursk. He told her that on the day they were detained, soldiers had ordered them to drop to the ground and crawl toward the soldiers’ armored personnel carrier. He said he and Smagliuk were held together on a military base in Hostomel for several days but were transferred separately to Russia, with the other man arriving at the Kursk detention facility several days before Smagliuk., The families of Shcherba, Musaev, Kissel, Remez, and Smagliuk said that they had been in contact with former cellmates of each of the five men in Kursk pretrial detention facility no. 1. The former cellmates said that in mid-April, Shcherba, Musaev, and Kissel were transferred to a women’s penal colony no. 11 in Kursk region., The family of Danylo Kuptsov, 26, told Human Rights Watch that Russian forces detained him in Dorohynka, in the Kyiv region, on March 11, while he was trying to charge his phone in his car. About a month later, his family learned from a former cellmate that Kuptsov was being held in the Kursk pretrial detention facility. In April, Kuptsov’s wife tried to contact the facility but was told that Kuptsov was not there. On May 13, the ICRC informed the family that Kuptsov was in custody in Russia., In June, Human Rights Watch documented the enforced disappearance of Viktoria Andrusha, a Ukrainian teacher detained by Russian forces in Chernihiv region and forcibly transferred to Kursk., Transferred to Bryansk Region, Human Rights Watch spoke with the families of three men whom Russian forces forcibly transferred to the Bryansk region. They, in turn, had spoken with people who had been their loved ones’ cellmates and other witnesses to their detention. Anna, a resident of Dymer, whose family name is withheld at her request, said that on March 4, Russian soldiers detained her 33-year-old brother, Vasyl Volokhin, when he was cycling across Dymer to warn the residents about an upcoming rocket attack about which he had obtained information. Witnesses told his family that Russian soldiers shot and injured him. His damaged bicycle and phone were found on the road., Russian soldiers in Bucha detained Evhen Guryanov, 45, after raiding his house and interrogating his family on March 18. Natalia, Guryanov’s wife, said she was there when he was detained. She also said that on March 7, Russian soldiers detained her brother-in-law, Serhii Liubich, 37, as he was transporting drinking water from Bucha to Hostomel. Witnesses told her that soldiers put a bag over his head and took him away., Natalia said that several former prisoners from correctional facility no. 2 (IK-2, in Russian) in Novozybkov, Bryansk region, confirmed they saw Guryanov and Liubich there. Eventually, a man passed a message to Volokhin’s family, through an intermediary, that he had been Volokhin's cellmate in Bryansk region. When the family sent Volokhin a letter in mid-March, IK-2 authorities responded with a notice that “the message has been delivered to the addressee,” and then with another response that “this person does not exist.” Volokhin’s family believes he remains in IK-2., Ill-Treatment, Following their release and return to Ukraine by way of prisoners’ exchanges, former prisoners, both civilians and combatants, told rights groups and mass media about humiliating and degrading treatment and torture they endured in Russian captivity in Ukraine and Russia., MIHR reported that the authorities in the Kursk and Novozybkov detention centers forced captives to wear a prison uniform and cut their hair short, including women. One of the former prisoners with whom a detainee’s family member spoke said inmates were repeatedly interrogated, regularly beaten, and given electroshocks, as well as forced to stand for extended periods of time. MIHR documented a case in Kursk pretrial detention facility no. 1 in which a detainee witnessed guards beating a civilian detainee to death., The authorities also subjected some of the detainees to psychological pressure, forcing them to learn the Russian anthem by heart and sign documents without being allowed to read them, MIHR staff told Human Rights Watch., One family member said that her neighbor, who returned to Ukraine after having been held in a Russian prison, had to have his leg amputated due to lack of medical treatment for frostbite in prison. Other men reported similar stories to the media., International Law, The laws of war allow a warring party in an international armed conflict to detain combatants as POWs and to intern civilians in noncriminal detention if their activities pose a serious threat to the security of the detaining authority. The Fourth Geneva Convention on civilian protection sets out procedures and safeguards around internment, and any interned civilian must be released as soon as the reasons that necessitated their internment no longer exist., Civilian detainees cannot be transferred from occupied territory to that of the detaining party or its allies. Article 49 (1) of the Fourth Geneva Convention is explicit in its prohibition of “individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country … regardless of their motive.” This is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions (see article 85 (4) (a) of Additional Protocol I) and a war crime under the ICC Rome statute (article 8 (2) (b) (viii))., If a person is detained not as a civilian but as a combatant, they are to be afforded POW status and are entitled to all the protections afforded POWs, in particular those set out in the Third Geneva Convention. The ICRC should be informed of all POWs, allowed to visit them and to transmit information about them to their families., During an armed conflict, when part of an attack against the civilian population, failure to acknowledge a civilian’s detention or to disclose their whereabouts in custody with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period constitutes the crime of enforced disappearance and is prosecutable as a crime against humanity under the International Criminal Court’s statute (article 7(1) (i))., No detained person, whether POW or civilian, should be held outside of the protection of the law, but should be formally registered and information regarding their detention, including their whereabouts, should be accessible and provided to their families and all relevant authorities. All detainees are protected by due process obligations under international law., Taking hostages is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a war crime, including under the Statute of the International Criminal Court (article 8 (2) (a) (viii)). Hostage-taking includes detaining a person with an explicit or implicit threat to continue to detain the hostage as leverage to compel a third party to undertake a particular act to secure the hostage’s release.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-forcible-disappearances-ukrainian-civilians-enruuk

Health",13 Jul 2022,"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, provided an additional $1.7 billion to the Government of Ukraine, as part of President Biden’s commitment to President Zelenskyy to provide Ukraine with direct budgetary aid. This contribution was made possible with generous bipartisan support from Congress., The additional resources provided by the United States, through the World Bank, will alleviate the acute budget deficit caused by Putin’s brutal war of aggression and ensure the Ukrainian government can continue operating and responding to critical needs, including delivery of essential services such as healthcare by paying the salaries of healthcare workers., To date, USAID has provided $4 billion in direct budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine. These resources have helped the Ukrainian government continue carrying out core functions – for example, keeping gas and electricity flowing to hospitals, schools, and other critical infrastructure, supporting the provision of humanitarian supplies to citizens, and continuing to pay the salaries of civil servants and teachers., Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, USAID has been working closely with humanitarian partners in the country and region to reach Ukrainians with lifesaving humanitarian assistance while also ramping up critical development assistance to respond to cyber attacks and threats to the energy sector, countering disinformation, supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector, documenting human rights violations, meeting essential health needs, and ensuring the continued functioning of local and national government entities., The United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine and its people in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-contributes-17-billion-support-government-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Jul 2022,"*SITUATION OVERVIEW, Thursday, 7 July marks 134 days since the invasion of Ukraine and major attacks continue to be reported across the country, causing extensive destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement. Fighting continues to be concentrated in Eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas region where there have been clashes and shelling. On 25 June alone, over 50 missiles were reportedly launched by Russian Federation forces across the country.
Meanwhile, the fall of the city of Lysychansk may lead to further internal displacement. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports that from 24 February to 3 July, there have been 11,152 civilian casualties, including 4,889 deaths, although the actual number of persons affected is likely higher.
IOM is particularly concerned about ongoing internal and cross-border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. According to round six of IOM’s Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, as of 23 June, 14 per cent of the general population, or 6.27 million people, have been displaced within Ukraine. While this represents a decrease of nearly 900,000 IDPs since 23 May and a second consecutive reduction since the start of the war, continued displacement raises the need for both humanitarian aid and the development of long-term solutions. Access to healthcare, education, and shelter are among the most urgent needs of both internally displaced persons (IDP) and host communities. Nearly one in four (23 per cent)
Ukrainians have been unable to access medication due to the conflict, and nearly 10 per cent of all respondents and 15 per cent of returnees said that their homes had been destroyed.
Additionally, the survey found that as many as 38 per cent of displaced households and 25 per cent of non-displaced families with children aged 5-17 reported that their children did not have full access to education. The education situation is most dire in Eastern Ukraine, where 16 per cent of relocated households with school-age children reported having no access to schooling at all.
Meanwhile, the international community continues to support both humanitarian and strategic recovery planning efforts for the country. On 4-5 July, Switzerland and Ukraine hosted the international Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano, where the Prime Minister of Ukraine outlined a three-stage reconstruction plan targeting basic needs and infrastructure in the short- and mediumterm and a longer-term investment in modernization.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-23-8-july-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",12 Jul 2022,"Relocated from the war-ravaged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the NGO Heavenly Fortress has created a centre in Dnipro, Ukraine, to support internally displaced persons from the areas of the county most affected by the war., Dnipro, Ukraine, 12 July 2022 – Recognizing the strong potential of this unique new facility for displaced Ukrainians fleeing violence in the east of the country, the EU and UNDP helped organize the opening of the centre as a way both to support the relocated NGO and to boost social cohesion among IDPs and the locals in Dnipro., Previously, the NGO had been providing daily humanitarian assistance to some of 2,000 IDPs in Dnipro. Now, with a fully operational centre ready to serve people in need, it will be able to increase its reach to more than 100,000 IDPs and locals in Dnipro. The centre will offer various services: from organizing artistic events and exhibitions, to providing legal and psychological assistance to the displaced. Thanks to EU and UNDP support, the centre now has a spacious co-working space and a Ukrainian library., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said he believes the centre will be a great success in the city, and will contribute to the better integration of IDPs into their new community., “The opening of this residence clearly shows that no military weapon can ever destroy the authentic Ukrainian culture,” Coene said. “The strong desire we see to preserve and share it is inspiring, and gives us hope in these difficult times. We, together with our UNDP partners, want to assure Ukrainians that we will continue to do our utmost to help such social initiatives grow and get stronger – and the war will not stand in our way.”, Manal Fouani, the interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said that she never ceased to be impressed by the speed and quality of the recovery interventions designed and implemented in response to the war by civil society in Ukraine., “We at UNDP are stunned by the incredible zeal of Ukrainians from Mariupol who despite temporarily losing access to their hometown have found the strength to actively implement important initiatives to help other displaced people in their host communities,” Fouani said., “UNDP will continue working side-by-side with all war affected populations alongside our strategic partners at the EU. Treading this difficult path together can only lead to strengthened resilience of Ukrainian people through engaging institutions and empowering civil society organizations.”, Using funds provided by the European Union under the framework of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, UNDP purchased furniture and technical equipment for the space worth more than UAH 600,000 (U.S. $20,000). EU and UNDP officials participated in the launch ceremony., Heavenly Fortress head Kyrylo Dolimbaev said the idea behind the centre was to care for the needs of displaced people while introducing the public to the diverse culture of his native Mariupol., “The Open space – Little Mariupol – is a place where the big heart of Mariupol beats,” he said. “We really wanted to create a place where everyone can feel at home. I hope that we’ve made it happen.”, Background, The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland., Media enquiries, Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Leader; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-and-eu-join-local-ngo-heavenly-fortress-create-little-mariupol-displaced-ukrainians-enuk

"The number of calls to our psychosocial hotline increased by 73 % after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, says People in Need’s psychologist",News and Press Release,PIN,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",12 Jul 2022,"Elena Kravcova is working as the coordinator for People in Need’s psychosocial activities in Ukraine. Nowadays, she is leading a mobile team of 14 psychologists providing support in 4 oblasts of Ukraine and 10 psychologists offering support through a nationwide hotline. ""Hotline psychologists receive up to 50 calls per day. The number of calls increased by more than 73%,"" she shares, describing the situation after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kravcova adds that people will need psychological support for at least another 5 years after the end of the war., You’ve been working as People in Need’s psychologist for a long time. How has the psychological well-being of the people you meet daily changed before and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine?, The war has changed a lot. There’s collective psychological trauma at the state level. People have been plunged into a whole range of situations where there is horror, panic, shock, confusion, rejection of the situation, fear of sudden death, and loss of relatives, friends, property..., Many have become internally displaced and left their homes, some have already lost their home and the opportunity to return, some have lost contact with relatives, and some have lost loved ones and are experiencing grief. All these events, complicated by the lack of safety and confidence in the future, have a serious negative impact on the mental and physical health of the people I work with., Speaking about well-being, all the areas of well-being have disruptions at different levels. Basic needs are not being met and there is no unconditional security in the entire territory of Ukraine., How you would describe the psychological impact of the war on the people we are supporting?, Various reactions to stressful situations are identified among those impacted – starting from freezing up, to expressions of external aggression, and auto-aggression., On the one hand, there is a lot of sadness and apathy related to fatigue caused by the protracted war, due to uncomfortable living conditions, lack of work, and uncertainty for the future. The plans that were built before the war are destroyed and it’s not possible to plan ahead. The homes of many people have been destroyed or damaged., On the other hand, there is a lot of aggression. Many people who were pulled out from under the rubble and who fled under shelling have lost their documents. And for many, the waiting time to renew the documents is more than one month. The passport manufacturing plant has been destroyed and this has caused major problems. People are waiting long weeks before receiving their documents, and without these documents, there is no chance to receive cash aid payments. It turns into a vicious cycle where people aren’t able to influence their situation and this causes a lot of anger., In addition, there is a language issue in the western part of the country, and cases of bullying and mobbing are already being recorded. We expect this problem to intensify in September when the school year begins., Anxiety, fear, uncertainty, difficulty in adapting…, Do you think that psychological support will be needed more in the near future?, Yes, of course, the needs will only grow, and changes will be possible only with complete security. People need to have their basic needs met., What are the main problems people are sharing with People in Need’s psychological teams in the field?, The main problems are anxiety, fear of the future, the uncertainty of the future, complaints about their physical condition, depression, lesser control over their emotions, apathy, sadness, aggression, irritation, difficulty in adapting, wanting to go home, searching for friends and loved ones, conflicts with the local population due to language barriers, fear of losing property, the experience of loss, sadness due to loss of loved ones, severance of family ties, lack of work, and dissatisfaction with living conditions., How many PIN psychologists are now working across Ukraine?, As of today, we have 14 psychologists in mobile teams and 10 psychologists on the psychosocial support hotline 0800210160., How many regions of Ukraine are covered by PIN psychological services/teams now?, The hotline operates at the national level throughout Ukraine. Mobile teams work in 4 oblasts: Lviv, Ternopil, Kirovohrad and Dnipro. In addition, we provide support through our partners in 3 oblasts: Mykolaiv in Lviv oblast, Khmelnytska, and Chernivetska oblasts., Do you plan to extend your geographical coverage?, Yes, we plan to include psychological support in all of the regions where we have a presence., Who are the main clients of our psychological services? Is the focus mainly on displaced people or also on hosting communities?, If we talk about the hotline – our clients are all the inhabitants of Ukraine. Our mobile teams work mainly in collective centers for internally displaced people; besides this, we provide support to both volunteers and host communities, as they also often require assistance., Do your teams offer psychological support to children? In what way is the work with them different?, Yes, of course. Children are one of the most vulnerable categories. Our work is different and is built in accordance with age characteristics and perception abilities., Psychologists use the same skills and tools that they provide to people. Personally, I practice meditation and use grounding techniques. Breathing exercises help a lot., How do you choose what location will be visited by our team of psychologists?, The service of a psychologist is included in the makeup of our general humanitarian response, if the need for psychological support is identified during the needs assessment at the location - we definitely provide it., Do people understand what psychological support means and what the benefits are? Or does it take some time before they start to share their problems?, It really depends, some people are aware of their psychological needs and immediately respond, while others need preliminary group sessions to build confidence in the psychologist. Psychological education sessions are very useful in this case, where people begin to distinguish a psychiatrist from a psychologist and what can be expected from working with a psychologist., After consultations, people’s emotional state becomes more stable, What is usually the feedback of people on psychological support?, After the consultations, people said that thanks to the tools and skills for self-regulation they received, their emotional stress, anxiety level, and muscle tension decreased. They noted an improvement in their mood and their emotional state became more stable., How many counselling sessions are you usually organizing in one collective centre? How often is your team returning to the same place?, Support is offered according to the needs of the population; it all depends on the number of residents in one collective center and how long they stay there. There are places where people live up to 5 days, someone leaves, someone comes., Are you organizing individual counselling as well?, Of course, we focus on them in crisis counselling., How you are working with people who have serious psychological problems and need long-term professional support?, If we see that our support is not enough, we refer them to specialized professionals from other organizations., You said that 10 of People in Need’s psychologists are providing support via hotline 0800210160. How many calls are they receiving every day?, Hotline psychologists receive up to 50 calls per day, usually more than 300 per week and on average 1,300 per month., Did the number of calls increase after the Russian invasion of Ukraine?, Yes, the number of calls increased by more than 73%., What are the main problems people are sharing via this hotline?, From the first days, they shared shock, panic, decision-making issues during the evacuation, suicidal thoughts, despair, and all kinds of fears..., Helping others is a source of energy for psychologists, Listening to stories of people fleeing war every day could be really demanding. How do you relax?, Psychologists have the opportunity to receive supervision support in a group format and individually in unlimited quantity. In addition, they use the same skills and tools that they provide to people. Personally, I practice meditation and use grounding techniques. Breathing exercises help a lot., PIN psychologists interact with people who have been displaced by the war, separated from their families etc. Where is your source of energy to continue and help others?, Helping others is what gives me energy as a psychologist., Are you providing the opportunity for psychological support to colleagues within People in Need’s team? Are they using this offer?, Yes, we offer this kind of support and have already organized several group meetings., How long do you think people in Ukraine will need professional psychological support to deal with the trauma of war?, At least another 5 years after the end of the war. The trauma of war is cured over several years, provided that the person is already safe and living under normal conditions, including economic stability.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/number-calls-our-psychosocial-hotline-increased-73-after-russian-invasion-ukraine-says-people-needs-psychologist

Mykolaiv Snapshot: Civilian Protection Needs & Concerns in Ukraine,Assessment,NP,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Jul 2022,"Background, This snapshot presents several preliminary conclusions from Nonviolent Peaceforce’s (NP) rapid protection assessment conducted in Mykolaiv city center in early July of 2022.
This report builds on analysis and recommendations published in May 2022 as part of a broader assessment focused on protection needs and response mechanisms throughout Ukraine.
From the start of the war, Mykolaiv has been a keystone location for Ukrainian territorial defense on the southern front. Sitting at the confluence of the Southern Bah and Ingul rivers, the city's geographic and strategic importance has been a focus of Russian bombardment in efforts to try and secure the city’s ports, which is critical for resupply to overstretched forces as well as act as an operational base for western ambitions.
Mykolaiv acts as a main route of egress for those fleeing Russian occupied areas, specifically residents from Kherson, located 60km south-southeast of Mykolaiv city center. The assessment team has identified key evacuation routes used by civilians and civilian-led volunteer mechanisms supporting evacuations.
In interviews with civilians, the NP assessment team sought to evaluate protection concerns across different age, gender, and socio-economic demographics; experiences of displacement, evacuation, and return; safety and security; protection risks to vulnerable groups, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and children; and access to humanitarian services.
As a result, this snapshot builds on over 24 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and meetings with local government actors, nonprofit bodies, and civilian-led collectives which provided information for the snapshot analysis and situational report within Mykolaiv. This rapid assessment took place over three days in early July 2022, comprising additional outreach to civilians and local humanitarian organizations directly impacted by the conflict, as well as firsthand field observations and desk research conducted by NP staff.
All meetings were conducted in line with the principles of confidentiality, non-partisanship, and Do No Harm practices. Team members were clear to gain explicit consent before all interviews, and clearly introduced themselves, NP’s mission, as well as the objectives of the assessment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mykolaiv-snapshot-civilian-protection-needs-concerns-ukraine

Shelter and Non-Food Items",29 Jun 2022,"Russian military invasion to Ukraine on 24 February 2022 rapidly led to numerous reported and documented destructions of infrastructure in conflict vicinity. Suburbs in North-West of Kyiv city, capital of Ukraine, either were occupied or became a battlefield in the late February. Until the end of March dozens and hundreds of residential buildings were damaged with varying degree of damage severity. As well, multiple facilities as a part of important non-residential infrastructure were reportedly damaged or destroyed (link)., Official estimates of destroyed infrastructure (any buildings) remain rather scarse. It was reported that city of Irpin experienced 70-75% of its buildings to be damaged, when at least 115 of them were completely destroyed (link). At least 459 buildings were reported to be damaged in Hostomel, north to Irpin (link). An alternative look on situation with infrastructure's damage was applied by UNOSAT., They used high-resolution satellite imagery to assess a number of structure visually sustained damage or destruction (link). Higher number of damaged buildings was revealed in Irpin and Hostomel compared to Bucha and Vorzel in this suburb area., Similar approach was used to quantify damaged non-residential facilities in North-West of Kyiv severely affected by February-March conflict hostilities. Among the different categories of interest, damaged healthcare, education, industrial infrastructure and food shops are visualized with Irpin experiencing the highest number of destructions. This city was not occupied but became a target for shelling and street battles (link). Hotspots of damaged infrastructure are along Soborna, Kotliarevskoho, Mechnykova and Lychaka Streets in Irpin. Importantly, relative proportions of damaged infrastructure are found to be extremely high in Hostomel and Horenka settlements which were under heavy battles in late February., Comparison of all building (UNOSAT) and only non-residential facilities (IMPACT) damage assessment shows overall agreement in estimated proportions (graph below). Satellite image-sourced estimation rather shows geospatial hotspots, as multiple structures with no visible roof or wall damage were exposed to artillery shelling. Onground inspections with acquiring georeferenced photos and carrying out drone surveys will facilitate more comprehensive damage assessment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-summary-infrastructure-and-facilities-damage-analysis-north-west-kyiv-february-march-2022
Thousands trained to shelter children separated from families in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,5 Jul 2022,"More than a thousand Ukrainian families have been trained in how to shelter children left without parental care, thanks to a campaign from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners., Selected families met with psychologists, teachers and social work specialists to learn about adaptation tools, features of care and the upbringing of temporarily placed children., They are among over 21,000 people who have used the Telegram bot @dytyna_ne_sama_bot to apply to shelter children since the start of the ""Leave No Child Alone"" campaign in March, with more families set to begin training in July., Millions of children have been deeply affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with many separated from their families and exposed to deeply traumatic events. These children urgently need safety, stability, child protection services and psychosocial support – especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families., The “Leave No Child Alone” campaign was launched by the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rights of Children and Children Rehabilitation, the Office of the President of Ukraine, together with UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Policy., ""This huge number of people willing to shelter a child is really impressive,” says Daria Herasimchuk, Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for Rights of Children and Children Rehabilitation. “It is an important step towards the public understanding that a child should grow up in a family, not in an institution. I want to thank everyone who expressed a desire to shelter a child and, for those who have not yet been called, I'd like to ask for patience.”, Children's services across Ukraine have access to a list of families and will contact them when there is a need to temporarily place a child. This includes over 90,000 children who were in institutional forms of education before the war., ""Over 1,000 families have already been trained, and it's just the beginning,” says Maryna Lazebna, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine. “I hope it would be a start for foster families' development, as well as for the development of other family forms of upbringing and adoption after the victory. Sometimes destruction encourages building something new, not rebuilding the past. I believe that we will unite to build a future in which every child in our country will grow up in a loving family.”, As a result of the first cohort of families trained, six families have already provided a temporary home for children. A social worker is assigned to each child to ensure the best interests of the child, and provide support and advice to families., Tetiana, a doctor from the Cherkasska region, has been sheltering a seven-year-old boy with autism who was staying at a medical facility., ""When I saw a television story about a child being evacuated abroad, I realized there are many children who are seeking help,” says Tetiana. “That's how I discovered the chatbot ‘Leave No Child Alone’ and registered. Soon, they contacted me.”, “When children grow up outside a family environment, their chances to develop to their full potential drop,” says Murat Shakhin, Head of UNICEF Ukraine. “We are committed to scaling up the efforts of partners, increasing the number of trained families and fostering carers to raise children in their own homes, or with their families, and looking after their best interests under the direct and constant supervision of the social workers across Ukraine. Our vision is to leave no child alone, and the training of the first 1,000 families is a huge step towards a family environment for every child in Ukraine.”, “During the war, the number of children deprived of parental care has grown,” adds Zhanna Petrochko, expert of the Partnership for Every Child NGO. “That means they may live in an institution. This provokes a big trauma for any child. I believe that families trained through the project will help to minimize the number of children entering institutions. They're willing to help those children, shelter them and provide good care. This is crucial for foster families' development and a breakthrough in the process of deinstitutionalization.”, According to conditions of temporary housing, a child may stay with a foster family until martial law ends or parents or relatives are found. If a child is without relatives, a family who provides temporary housing receives the right to adoption or guardianship., As part of the ""Leave No Child Alone"" campaign, a website aimed at preventing child rights violations has been launched. The site provides information on how to support children without parental care, guidance on temporary housing and ways of dealing with psychological trauma. It also outlines the procedures for adoption and temporary shelter, explains the regulatory framework for the protection of children's rights, and provides advice for psychologists and journalists covering this topic in the media., UNICEF has been working with Ukraine’s Government and partners to develop and promote family-based care for children, as part of efforts to decrease the number of children in institutions which, even before the war, was the highest in Europe.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/thousands-trained-shelter-children-separated-families-ukraine-enuk

Ukraine: Wounded and sick patients transported to advanced medical care,News and Press Release,ICRC,Health,11 Jul 2022,"Between 29th June and 1st July 2022, teams from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) supported 10 patients with medical needs and their caretakers from Odesa and Dnipro. The patients, originally from the city of Mykolaiv as well as the Donetsk region, had been unable to seek medical care on their own., ICRC ambulance drivers and medical personnel, in cooperation with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, transferred the patients for treatment from the Donetsk region to a safer area in Dnipro, and from Odessa across the border to Moldova. Civilians evacuated to Chisinau received medical care before eventually being transported to one of 16 European countries of their choice for permanent resettlement., “I was being evacuated with my daughter and granddaughters when we heard explosions,” said Tatyana, who was transported from Kramatorsk to Moldova “The scene was horrible; some people were laying without arms or legs. I had a blast wound in my leg and couldn’t stand up without falling. My granddaughters started shouting. Their mom was not moving. The ambulance crew couldn’t save her; she died instantly. I didn’t even get to say goodbye to her. I was taken to the hospital, had surgery, but my ankle joint doesn’t work. I want to reach Germany and have another surgery. I hope I will walk again.”, Despite fighting and insecurity, the Red Cross teams continue to transport patients to hospitals for medical care. “We have to be very quick.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",10 Jul 2022,"OVERVIEW, The Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on 24 February 2022 has displaced one-third of the country’s population. Over 6.2 million people remain internally displaced within Ukraine, and there were over 5.6 million Ukrainian refugees recorded across Europe in early July (IOM 27/06/2022; UNHCR accessed 06/07/2022; OCHA 24/04/2022). Reports suggest that displaced populations have been moving back to their place of habitual residence in Ukraine since May, although it is unclear how sustainable and permanent the return may be. This report looks at their motivations for moving back, presents the scale of their movement and the main locations involved, and provides a comprehensive overview of their humanitarian situation.
The main motivations for returning people present include a sense of having fewer safety and security incidents in their places of habitual residence, reuniting with family members that had stayed behind, and financial reasons.
Although there is huge uncertainty around numbers, estimations suggest that around 5.5 million people have returned to their places of habitual residence in Ukraine (IOM 27/06/2022).
While around 90% have returned from within Ukraine, 10% have reported returning from abroad. Border-crossing figures report an increase in the number of Ukrainians coming back into Ukraine (Frontex 02/06/2022; UNCHR accessed 28/06/2022; Ukrayinska Pravda 12/04/2022; UN 14/04/2022; BBC 15/04/2022).
People moving back initially returned to oblasts predominantly in the north and west of the country. As at late June, the highest numbers of IDPs moving back were reported in northern and eastern oblasts, as well as Kyiv. Since May, the return movements from abroad have been recorded across majority of the oblasts in the country with Lviv, Kyiv, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts named as most popular oblasts of destinations (REACH/UNHCR 02/05/2022; REACH/ UNHCR 13/06/2022; IOM 27/06/2022). Some reports suggest that people are also returning to areas with active conflict. These people are more likely to experience displacement again if insecurity worsens (Razumkov Centre 18/05/2022; REACH/UNHCR 02/05/2022; IOM 23/05/2022).
Priority needs among the people moving back are cash assistance and materials to rebuild their damaged houses. The affected population will continue to face long-term needs and require assistance rebuilding their lives, which may pose additional challenges to humanitarian responders.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-return-movement-dynamics-idps-and-refugees-07-july-2022

Supporting healthcare in a rural town in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Jul 2022,"Unlike some other humanitarian emergencies where local healthcare systems collapse or struggle to meet people’s needs, hospitals and civil society organisations in Ukraine continue to function in the ongoing war in the country. Since hands-on medical care is largely taken care of, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are currently focusing on building a network of support to hospitals and first responders, mostly through training and donations. Here we share a window into an MSF team’s two-day visit in late May offering support to people in a rural town in central Ukraine., Day 1, A mobile team en route, At 7.30 am there is a rush at the entrance of a hotel in Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine 150 kilometres from the nearest frontline. MSF set up a small base there in April. People load some medical and logistics materials into three cars, and the project coordinator does the last briefings on the situation and planned activities with the mobile team members as they get ready to leave., Fourteen people, including doctors, psychologists, translators, logisticians and drivers, head to Holovanivsk, a small town of 16,500 inhabitants, located two and a half hours west by road. The convoy crosses vast and mostly empty fields for soya, corn, wheat and sunflowers, as the crops have not yet grown. The cloudy blue sky and the yellow soya flowers recreate the bi-coloured Ukrainian flag., Division in groups according to tasks, At 11 am the MSF team reaches Holovanivsk. Over 1,000 people displaced by the war are registered in the town, but they live scattered, the majority in nearby villages., The team is divided in four groups. Olexander and Juan Pablo, doctors from Mariupol and Argentina, go to the local hospital and ambulance centre. In each location, they will carry out training sessions about mass casualty response and decontamination; in other words, on how to triage during a situation of a high influx of wounded patients and on how to proceed in case of an attack with non-conventional weapons., Two Ukrainian psychologists, Olha and Alissa, go to assess the condition of people in the displaced communities. They would like to offer individual mental health consultations and try to arrange a psychotherapy group. The war is having a huge psychological impact and many people suffer from symptoms like intense fear, constant stress, persistent worry, hopelessness and panic attacks., The midwife, Florencia, and the mental health activity manager, Ariadna, from Argentina and Mexico, accompanied by the translator Olha, head to a school to launch a two-day workshop on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). In the meantime, the Brazilian logistician Tanain and other staff visit the humanitarian centre to donate relief items., Addressing needs of people who are displaced, Olena waits at the humanitarian centre. A former teacher in chemistry and biology, Olena is currently the village council secretary., “During the first days of war, 150 to 180 people arrived here daily, mostly at night,” says Olena, “Many were transiting to other places.”, “It was awful… nobody was prepared, so we organised ourselves to do different tasks: to cook, clean… Everyone brought things,” continues Olena. “As women with small babies couldn’t stay in the social centres, some locals offered their homes. There was a lot of solidarity; I have never seen anything like this.”, Olena’s own son and partner used to live in Kyiv, but they moved here also shortly after the war started., “It is now very important to get humanitarian assistance,” says Olena. “We can temporarily ask farmers to provide food, but other things like hygienic items are helpful… people are running out of money, they have already spent a lot.”, An MSF team was in Holovanivsk two weeks earlier, so before this visit the local authorities had identified the needs: blankets, towels, bedding, solar torches and pillow covers., Victimisation and barriers for survivors of sexual violence, Not far away, around 35 healthcare workers, social workers, teachers and psychologists, all of them women, participate in the training on SGBV. The facilitators talk about the feeling of victimisation some women can have after giving birth to a child as a result of a rape, or about the barriers male survivors experience., “It doesn’t matter what you wear, you don’t have a sign to be raped,” midwife Florencia says in the session to the group. “It is always the guilt of the perpetrator.”, “The training is very useful and informative,” says Olga, a psychologist at the school. “It’s extremely important in these times because we often encounter cases of violence. We have examples from Luhansk, Donetsk, Kyiv region, Bucha... We want as many people as possible to be aware of such cases.”, Day 2, Understanding survivors’ bureaucratic challenges, The next day, the group starts with a role-playing game. Each participant takes a different role: a police officer, a doctor, a psychologist. The woman portraying a survivor holds a string and moves from one person to the other seeking assistance., By doing this, she creates a complex spider web out of string. The web represents the bureaucratic hurdles survivors find in real life. The solution? To create a single pathway with all the services, including medical treatment and psychological assistance, something MSF is trying to support health authorities with in parts of Ukraine., ""Our aim is to sensitize these first line responders in order to increase the number of people reaching the services,” says Florencia. “But it is proving hard.”, Violence has put people in vulnerable situations, In another room of the school, the MSF psychologists carry out psychological support sessions with adults and their children displaced by the conflict. Maryna and Olena come from the Donetsk region and arrived here one and two months ago, respectively. They live in an empty house in a village near Holovanivsk with another woman; all of them have children between six and 12 years of age., “A relative living here [in Holovanivsk] was told by administration officials about the place where we are now,” says Olena. “When we first arrived, we were afraid about how people would react. We didn’t want them to feel sorry for us. But the attitude was very good, people have been very warm.”, Both are entrepreneurs. Before the war, Maryna had a beauty parlour and Olena ran a small store. Now they are helping in a local kitchen to prepare food and grow some vegetables., Sandra also shares her experience on the effects of the war. She is in the last year of her bachelor studies on international management and comes from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city., “I feel okay, in general. I am alive, and my parents and husband are with me,” says Sandra. “We married here just one month ago. But I can’t read the news. It takes me just one minute to get frustrated, to start crying… I still can’t believe this is possible.”, She tries her best to occupy her mind with tasks, be it drawing or writing poems. She says some of her friends chose to stay in Kharkiv, despite the extremely hard situation – one girlfriend who has a small daughter is living in a partially destroyed home., “I don’t miss any material belongings,” says Sandra, “but I miss my city, the trees, the buildings. I would like to just get back home.”, But then she recalls why they fled., “It was very stressful. I couldn’t cope with it. I felt nauseous just by looking at food,” continues Sandra. “During the first days we always moved to the bunker. Later when the bombs fell, we went to the bathroom and covered our heads with pillows and blankets. We sat down squatting and prayed.”, “Jet fighters flew over the building,” she says. “The sound of the bombs was so loud, every time it seemed they were hitting us.”, Building preparedness at the hospital, At the hospital, the MSF medical team concludes the training; Yanina and Oleksii sit again in their paediatric department office dressed in white coats. They studied medicine together. She is from Zaporizhzhia and he is from Melitopol, in the southeast, but both moved to Holovanivsk two years ago., “We have had fewer patients since 24 February [start of the war] but they come with more severe conditions,” says Yanina. “A lot of people from the region have left Ukraine and many people who are displaced within the region don’t know exactly what we do.”, The wall is full of drawings, done by children who have received medical support. The patients draw about their experiences with health issues. A cat, for example, was drawn by a girl who had asthma., “In the first month of the war we worked at night and the surgical team was 24 hours on standby,” says Yanina. “During the siren alerts, we went to the bunker with the patients. These days we stay in the safe area of the corridor.”, “We have received humanitarian assistance over the last months. The training is important in rural areas for the staff to develop knowledge, not to panic and to know how to act step by step,” she continues. “We have had children from occupied territories, like a boy from Mariupol. He developed allergic rhinitis [inflammation of the lining of the nose] from spending one month in the bunker and was in a bad psychological condition.”, Things are not easy for the doctors themselves either. They check every day on their own families., “I try to avoid thinking much, the easiest is to just come to work,” says Oleksii. “I still have so many relatives in Melitopol. My parents live near the military airport and keep hearing military planes. People trying to leave Melitopol to other parts of Ukraine spend days in each checkpoint.”, During the conversation, the siren alert sounds on everyone’s mobile phones. It is the third time today. The previous two were in the middle of the night. In town, the different members of the MSF team regroup. They eat lunch, wrap up their work and get into the three cars to travel back to Kropyvnytskyi. The two-day visit to support people in Holovanisk has come to an end.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/supporting-healthcare-rural-town-ukraine

Border crossings to Ukraine, BACKGROUND, Since the onset of the Russian invasion, nearly one-third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes. This is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. Within Ukraine, over 6.2 million people remain displaced by the war. As of today, UNHCR estimates there are over 5.6 million refugees present across Europe, and over 3.6 million refugees from Ukraine have registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe. Some 8.8 million refugee movements out of Ukraine have been recorded since 24 February, with more than 3.3 million movements back into the country., Inside Ukraine, many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including for food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access in areas where intense fighting is ongoing. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-20-8-july-2022

Protection and Human Rights",8 Jul 2022,"Excerpt, War in Ukraine, Dr Dorit Nitzan, Ukraine Crisis Incident Manager at the World Health Organization, speaking from Odessa, Ukraine, said that the WHO mission to Mykolaiv and Odessa was to assess health needs, readiness to all-hazards and establish WHO’s hub in Odessa. She added that the WHO was working in close alignment with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, the Oblast health authorities, and the city authorities – to make sure its work was driven by needs at all levels – both top-down and bottom-up. The focus was the health needs of affected populations, the people whose physical and mental health had been harmed, and/or had deteriorated due to the Russian invasion and its consequences. For instance, this included the people who had not been able to receive early diagnosis and treatment for cancer, who now had much more advanced tumors and more critical illnesses, or people who had not been able to receive medication for hypertension and now had failing hearts or had suffered strokes. It also affected diabetics who could not get treatment and whose disease was now severe, as well as premature babies, pregnant women, older people, many of whom had been left behind and were highly vulnerable., Dr Nitzan further said that other people had suffered the terrible effects of explosions and missile strikes with impact on their vision, with burns that damaged their eyes, leaving people permanently or partially blind. Odessa had a countrywide-renowned Ophthalmology Centre and the expertise and skills there were sorely needed. People were being disabled in all kinds of ways. The thunderous noise of bombardment could damage hearing. Landmines had been the cause of many amputated legs. And of course, the fear, grief and uncertainty exerted an appalling toll on mental health., Dr Nitzan highlighted that the WHO's modus operandi was triple headed: readiness, response and recovery, all done at the same time, in different parts of the country. Together with the health authorities, WHO was getting ready for all hazards. The health institutions in Odessa and Mykolaiv were really overstretched, and the healthcare system was now faced with gaps that had already been created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the health sphere, more than 130 NGOs, national and international, had been taking part under the health cluster. She called for all to step forward and work in full coordination on the ground. Having said that, Dr Nitzan expressed that the combination of major emergencies, including the war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing health system reform in Ukraine, had made the system more responsive and more resilient. However, people had higher expectations of their health service. WHO’s role was to help the health system to meet those expectations, to ensure the package of lifesaving health services was available, people-centered, and of good quality. It was not just about providing supplies. WHO was providing the standards, guidance and training, and identifying what was needed most and making sure it got to the right people. WHO was keen to get to the conflict affected populations, using a diversified toolbox, such as, for example, the treatment of waterborne diseases, as the ever-present risk of cholera had moved higher up its list of priorities and this was one of the issues they were concerned about in Mykolaiv., In response to questions, Dr Nitzan specified that there were landmines everywhere in Ukraine and that it was hard to anticipate their impact or even assess their number. What was visible were people going through amputations or medical evacuations to other institutions., She also said that the new WHO hub was in Odessa, but the head office remained in Kiev. Ukraine was a large country with 18 million affected people, and 5.9 million injured. Among them, there was suffering related to trauma and the effect of war. Non-communicable diseases were also to be accounted. There were no new polio cases, the 29 cases of acute flaccid paralysis had all been checked and none of them was due to polio. There was no case of cholera and she hoped there would not be any, yet WHO was getting ready for it. There had been one suspected case, but it was not a toxic subtype. The number of non-communicable diseases was the leading cause of the heavy health burden in Ukraine, and it was rising. In regards to damages to the eyes, WHO was collecting data. She called for a humanitarian corridor to be allowed. On sexual violence, as in every war, the WHO Manager had seen cases of sexual violence, and numbers were increasing especially in areas under conflict. Gender-based violence was occurring not only to women but also to men and others. WHO was also working on strengthening the country's health system., Tomson Phiri, Global Spokesperson for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), said that, almost five months into the war in Ukraine, the country was facing multiple challenges. Intense fighting was continually displacing people, cutting off those who remained from commercial supply lines and holding back the country’s economy. One in three households in Ukraine was food-insecure, rising to one in two in some areas of the East and South. WFP rapidly scaled-up assistance through food distributions or cash in Ukraine, reaching 2.6 million people in June and continued to work with partners to reach areas close to front lines. In these areas fighting was preventing people, especially the elderly and families with children, from accessing food. WFP was buying as much food inside Ukraine as possible, supporting people with cash wherever there was access to banks and where markets were functioning., In Ukraine, WFP had transferred US$140 million cash and vouchers to close to 1.9 million people since April. People received their cash within 72 hours of registering. Every dollar spent was directly injected into the local economy. In June, close to 925,000 people were assisted with cash worth US$66.5 million. Internally displaced people received US$75 per person for up to three people per family. WFP tried to buy grain, food and services within Ukraine where possible, as part of efforts to support the local economy. It remained difficult to secure sufficient access to fuel, with harmful knock-on effects for our work., In Moldova, the second round of cash transfers was underway for an estimated 15,000 Moldovan families hosting refugees from Ukraine, to help them reduce the burden of additional costs of food and other essential needs. WFP had delivered more than half a million hot meals (three meals per day reaching an average of 1,966 people per day) in 90 refugee reception centers across 31 different localities/regions through cooperating partners. The third round of transfers was scheduled for July and in total, WFP was planning to conduct up to four rounds of transfers, depending on funding availability., Rhéal LeBlanc, Chief of the Press and External Relations at the United Nations Information Service (UNIS) reminded correspondents that more than 1,400 UN personnel were working on the ground to deliver life-saving assistance and was currently reaching 10.3 million people across Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/regular-press-briefing-united-nations-information-service-08-july-2022-war-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",7 Jul 2022,"Maternal and newborn health, mental health needs, and chronic disease care are among top concerns, according to the World Health Organization and NGOs operating within Ukraine., recent report from the World Health Organization says that over 8.2 million refugees left Ukraine between the start of Russia's invasion on February 24 and June 28, most of them going to Poland (52%), then Russia (17%) and Hungary (10%). More than 4,700 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and 5,900 have been injured., While 6.2 million people remain internally displaced in Ukraine, more than 5.5 million people who left their homes during the war have now returned home, according to the WHO's latest external situation report., AICM Ukraine, an NGO that has been active in Ukraine since 2006, reports that 12.1 million Ukrainians are considered in need of humanitarian health care, as the country's health care system has been severely impacted by months of active conflict. WHO has noted 323 Russian attacks on Ukrainian health care infrastructure including facilities, transport, warehouses, and patients, in addition to broken supply chains, restricted mobility, and mass displacement., With the diminished capacity of the national health care system, WHO has identified priority public health concerns including conflict-related trauma, maternal and newborn health, chronic disease care, mental health care, food security, potential communicable disease outbreaks, potential nuclear and chemical hazards, human trafficking and sexual violence., In May, WHO European Regional Director Dr. Hans Kluge said at least 3,000 people in Ukraine have died since Russia's invasion due to a lack of access to chronic disease medication., According to the NCD Alliance, a global nonprofit focused on non-communicable disease issues, about 9 million people in Ukraine are living with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and mental and neurological conditions., AICM Ukraine pointed out that another vulnerable group includes older adults. About 20% of the Ukrainian population is 60 years and older, making it one of the highest proportions of elderly people in a humanitarian crisis location globally., ""People with disabilities, children and youth, women and girls, health care workers, and internally displaced persons, which AICM Ukraine, notes, are all distinct vulnerable populations with their own humanitarian health care needs,"" said Dr. Christian Carrer, a French physician who co-founded AICM and AICM Ukraine, in an email., As noted by AICM Ukraine, many of the social determinants of health, such as access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security, shelter, security, and restriction of movement, impact the health of displaced and nondisplaced populations., Given the deteriorating state of such factors, WHO has noted the elevated risk for an outbreak of cholera, noting that residents of Mariupol have been forced to drink from puddles, as the water supply has been severely impacted. Prior to the war, there was a polio outbreak in the country, which the WHO fears could expand, along with Covid-19, measles, and diphtheria, as access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene have been decreased. The close proximity of people in bomb shelters is also of concern., In Poland, which has accepted over 4.3 million refugees, there have been almost four times as many chickenpox cases this year as in the corresponding time period last year. Other areas of concern identified by the WHO include low vaccination rates for polio (56%) measles, mumps, and rubella (68%) among refugee children. Only 40% of all respondents said they were vaccinated against Covid-19. WHO said major impediments to care in Poland among Ukrainian refugees are language barriers, cultural differences, and a general lack of information, while also noting that the lack of specialized services available for people with disabilities is a ""major issue."", ""Having an understanding of the status of these determinants gives context to the health issues faced by those affected and can help inform intervention planning,"" said Carrer., In an effort to help optimize aid delivery for its own operations and those of other NGOs which are responding, Direct Relief is contributing to the WHO situation reports through its partnership with a crowdsourcing company called Premise. Direct Relief's Research and Analysis team has helped them shape a series of data collection efforts about health and medical needs both within Ukraine and throughout the refugee receiving countries so as to receive novel data of relevance to the response., Among other research and development projects, including mobility and refugee movement dynamics and analyzing a $10 million grant program for refugees in partnership with Pelion in Poland, Direct Relief collaborated with Premise to develop two surveys on health care and pharmacy needs in Ukraine, as well as another on refugee reception centers in Poland., ""We have been involved in helping to collect data on pharmacies, displacement, and attitudes towards refugees in order to understand the scope and dimensions of this unprecedented crisis as it affects the people of Ukraine, the health system, and the host communities in neighboring countries,"" said Andrew Schroeder, vice president of research and analysis at Direct Relief., Since the war began, Direct Relief has sent 800 tons of aid and over $13.6 million in grants to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-strains-health-system-needs-continue-ukraine

On 1 July, missiles hit a residential building and a recreational centre in the south of the country, in a village called Serhiivka, close to the port city of Odesa, just a few days after an attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk (Poltavska oblast) took the lives of dozens and injured more civilians Ukrainians. In Serhiivka, at least 20 people were killed—including 1 boy—and at least 38 more, 7 of them children, injured, according to verified figures from the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Apart from the civilian casualties, local authorities and humanitarian partners reported that the attack had an immediate impact on 2,000 people—shockwaves caused structural damage to five residential buildings, 23 more suffering different levels of damage, and more than 130 people were immediately left homeless and in need of humanitarian assistance. The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, condemned the attack and reiterated the insistent call on the parties to the conflict to decisively comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and act in accordance with the principle of precaution to minimize or avoid civilian harm, including by verifying targets., Over the following weekend, more heavy hostilities were reported, killing and injuring an increasingly high number of civilians on both sides of the front line in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, according to different sources on the ground. The Ukrainian Armed Forces announced on 3 July their withdrawal from the heavily damaged city of Lysychansk, the last Government-controlled urban centre in Luhanska oblast and where, according to the Governor, over 10,000 civilians remain., Following this, fighting and hostilities reportedly moved towards the Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Donetska oblast., The people in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk—where just two weeks ago the United Nations and partners delivered vital humanitarian assistance—have experienced a particularly hard impact, including damage to the water system of Sloviansk, according to humanitarian security reports. The intensifying hostilities prompted the mayors of both cities to appeal to the residents to evacuate immediately and find safety elsewhere. People in the towns of Bakhmut and Toretsk were also heavily affected. Across Donetska oblast GCA, the UN has received reports of dozens of houses being damaged, and access to basic services continued to be impacted, as some education and health facilities have reportedly been damaged. There have also been reports of damage to agricultural land, just before the harvest. The situation is also dire in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA), with multiple attacks reported during the past week leaving, an unconfirmed but apparently high number of people killed and injured, and dozens of civilian infrastructure objects damaged. The bombardments in the NGCA of Donetska oblast have been particularly high since last weekend in Donetsk city, Makiivka, Oleksandrivka and Yasynuvata. Access to water in the NGCA of Donetska oblast remains limited., While the east accounts for most of the active warfare, more missile attacks and casualties were also reported in several other regions of the country, including in eastern Kharkivska and western Khmelnytska oblasts taking a heavy toll on civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Ukrainian Government reported that some 25,000 kilometres of roads and more than 300 bridges, among other critical infrastructure across the country worth a total of US$95 billion, have so far been damaged or destroyed due to the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-8-jul-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: Civilians killed by ‘reckless’ Russian attacks on Serhiivka apartment block and beach resort,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,7 Jul 2022,"Russian air strikes on an apartment block and beach resort hotel in the coastal town of Serhiivka in southern Ukraine killed at least 21 civilians, Amnesty International said today following a new on-the-ground investigation., The strikes, apparently using anti-ship missiles, hit the town in the Odesa region shortly before 1am on 1 July, injuring at least 35 people. Five people remain in serious condition in intensive care, meaning the total death toll may rise., “These powerful weapons were designed to destroy warships, and firing them into residential areas is extremely reckless,” said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser., “This attack is yet another example of the Russian military’s utter disregard for civilians in Ukraine as they continue to cause needless death and destruction. All those responsible for such war crimes must face justice for their actions.”, Amnesty International visited the strike locations in Serhiivka and found no evidence of the presence of Ukrainian soldiers, weapons, or other valid military targets nearby. Satellite imagery reviewed by Amnesty International also did not indicate any military activity in the area prior to the attack., Local government officials told Amnesty International that the weapons used in the attack were two Kh-22 guided missiles. With an estimated warhead of more than 900kg and a targeting system designed to hit ships rather than land objects, the missile is potentially extremely inaccurate, and therefore completely inappropriate for use in a populated area., Amnesty International’s Crisis Response weapons expert found ordnance fragments consistent with a large guided missile at the scene of the strike on the hotel. Notably, the fragments contained old-style rivets, consistent with a 50-year-old weapon such as a Kh-22., A core principle of international humanitarian law (the laws of war) is that parties to an armed conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and civilian objects, and members of the military and military objectives. Military objectives can be targeted, but it is unlawful to target civilians or civilian objects. Prior to any attack, members of the military are required to take steps to ensure that they are reasonably certain they are not targeting civilians and civilian objects., To date, there have been numerous examples of Russian forces routinely launching unlawful attacks in Ukraine which have killed and injured civilians, some of which may have been deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian objects., Resort hotel strike, Just after midnight on 1 July, Russian forces launched at least two missiles towards the Black Sea resort of Serhiivka, around 45 miles southwest of the city of Odesa. The first missile hit the Godji Hotel, and killed six civilians. Just minutes later, a second missile hit the hardware store at the front of a residential nine-storey building at 23 Budzhaska Street, and killed 15 civilians., Amongst those killed at the Godji Hotel were Nadiya Rudnitskaya, the hotel manager, and her 12-year-old son Dmytro Rudnitsky. Olha Ilyashevych, 30, and her mother Maria, who had both fled fighting from Slovyansk in the Donbas region, were also killed., The fatalities also included Oleksander Shishkov, 41, a well-known football coach who lived in Odesa but who had been staying at the hotel following a children’s football match the day before between the local team and the team from the nearby town of Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky., Residential block strike, Amongst those killed in the strike on Budzhaska Street were Volodymyr Chulak, a 68-year-old physical education teacher, his wife Tetiana, a 64-year-old chef, and their son Mykhaylo, 35, who lived in Odesa and was visiting his parents., Tetiana Chulak’s sister Valentyna told Amnesty International: “I heard the explosions and ran to the street… I ran there [number 23] and into the building, and found Tetiana in her bed, dead, covered in smashed-up furniture and debris, and her husband Volodymyr was dead in the kitchen. Their son Mykhaylo had been standing on the terrace, and was directly hit by the missile; he was in shreds.”, Also killed were Halyna Rumashuk, a 50-year-old receptionist, and her husband Serhii, a 48-year-old builder. They had initially survived the strike and managed to escape the building, but the couple then returned to look for some of their belongings, when a wall collapsed and killed them both., Roman, 36, a resident of the fourth floor of the building, told Amnesty International that he and his mother only survived because at the time of the strike they were behind a poured-concrete wall in their kitchen, bathing their puppy who had undergone surgery. The rest of their apartment was obliterated in the blast. Roman attempted to save his next-door neighbour, Proskovia Pavlenko, 63. She was mortally wounded in the blast, and died as he carried her from the building., Natalia Yankovska and her partner Maksym Nedomov both died from serious injuries caused by the blast. Natalia’s two young sons from a previous marriage, aged 10 and 14, both remain in hospital, with one in critical condition., Other victims killed in the strike on the residential block include Oleksander Sribny (47), Tetiana Nesterenko (64), and Vira Maksymenko (71)., “The Russian military’s relentless bombardment of residential areas full of civilians, killing people as they sleep, shocks the conscience,” said Donatella Rovera., “How many more civilians must die before there is justice and accountability for these crimes? The Russian forces responsible for these ongoing serious violations of international humanitarian law must be held accountable for their actions, and victims and their families must receive full reparations.”, Amnesty International’s ongoing documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilians-killed-reckless-russian-attacks-serhiivka-apartment-block-and-beach-resort

Recovery and Reconstruction",4 Jul 2022,"As Prepared for Delivery, Presidents Cassis and Zelensky., Prime Ministers Shmyhal and Fiala, President von der Leyen, distinguished panelists. Ladies and gentlemen., Last year in Vilnius, at the Ukraine Reform Conference, we welcomed the important milestones Ukraine was reaching along its reform path and encouraged continued progress., I specifically talked about the impressive strengthening of the financial sector; the improved targeting and poverty impact of the social protection system, and how reforms in the health sector were helping Ukraine’s COVID response., We welcomed the monumental passage of the agricultural land reform, a measure promising to transform Ukraine’s economy, after having been stalled for two decades., On July 1—just days before we gathered—the government opened the land market, and the year ended with Ukraine on track for a record harvest., Indeed, when I addressed this forum one year ago, I said that, thanks to the persistence with which the authorities had pursued reforms, Ukraine in 2021—despite the pandemic—was a stronger and more resilient country than at any time since its independence thirty years earlier., Today, What we did not know then—and what we have seen day in and day out since February 24—was just how resilient., After more than four months of devastating attacks, Ukrainians are hard at work., The Government, under the most extreme conditions, has continued to perform crucial administrative functions, including collecting revenues, making social and pension payments, delivering key social services, and teaching children., World Bank Response: FREE/PEACE/MRII, The international community has responded strongly, including the World Bank Group., In the four months since the outbreak of war, the Bank has mobilized $6.75 billion, including commitments and pledges from donors, to support the continuation of essential government services and to help blunt the widespread human and economic impacts of the war., We are also supporting neighboring Romania and Moldova to mitigate the impacts of the war on forcibly displaced Ukrainians and households, as well as build resilience and enhance competitiveness to reduce vulnerabilities to future shocks., As all of you know, Ukraine’s current budgetary financing needs remain high – at $5 billion a month., This means another $30 billion will be needed between now and December, if the war lasts that long., The Bank has prepared two fast disbursing operations to support the Government during this difficult time. We have also, through our sister organization, IFC, mobilized support to the private sector., The expressions of interest to support Ukraine remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to build on the role we have played in mobilizing partner engagement also in the recovery and reconstruction phases., In this context, I am pleased to announce today the establishment of the Multi-Donor Resources for Institutions and Infrastructure for Ukraine facility., We see this as an agile facility that can channel grants from partners to co-finance projects and support critical analytical and advisory work through a Ukraine Relief, Recovery and Reconstruction Trust Fund (URTF); while also coordinating additional sources of support—guarantees, co-and-parallel financing, and other financial instruments to help Ukraine. Our hosts, Switzerland, have kindly volunteered the first contribution that will start this fund for Ukraine – and we warmly welcome others to join., Looking Forward, In April, we produced a paper setting out a strategic approach to support Ukraine during and after the war, setting out three phases:, Relief Phase—which entails keeping the government functioning. I think we’ve all been astonished at how firmly the authorities have led on this front., Recovery Phase—this phase begins when the conflict ends or abates and focuses on addressing the immediate physical and economic needs. I do wish to acknowledge that this is already happening where it can, with Ukraine repairing damage to restore services to its citizens daily., Resilient Reconstruction Phase—this is the longer-term rebuilding of the country, including leaving behind the weight of policies which inhibited Ukraine’s growth and development before the war., Estimating the Damages, Since April, we have been involved - together with support from the EU and other partners - in supporting Ukraine in the development of a detailed Damage, Loss and Needs Assessment (or DNA)., A first rapid version, called the Rapid DNA is ongoing, with damage, losses and needs assessments being completed in July and the report ready in August. There will be more detailed versions over the next months and years. But we hope this will be an important input to the recovery and reconstruction efforts., At this point, I would like to share some preliminary findings from the Rapid DNA:, Estimates until early in June and covering the following key sectors: housing, transport, and commerce and industry, indicate about $100 billion in direct physical damages., I would like to highlight that there is a very large need for de-mining and clearance of explosives as a pre-condition to safe rebuilding and resumption of service provision., These needs have to be sequenced carefully for recovery and reconstruction but are also needed right away as people are victims of extensive mines., Indeed, we believe the Facility and Trust Fund I spoke of, and other financing mechanisms being developed by Ukraine’s partners, will be crucial components of this rebuilding, and we would propose a dedicated discussion on demining and clearance of explosives to see where expertise and funding can be mobilized from., Reforms More Important than Ever, But going back to where I began, in supporting the authorities in rebuilding, we need to also support the government’s continued efforts to strengthen economic management and institutions, which have sustained the country under such difficult conditions – and are central to paving the way for Ukraine’s future prosperity., This will include:, Ensuring the adequacy of fiduciary mechanisms to demonstrate to donors and investors that the flow of resources that will be critical for Ukraine’s rebuilding will be deployed effectively and efficiently., The immediate challenge for Ukraine’s agriculture sector is finding a way to store and export the significant levels of production its farmers are still managing to harvest under these extreme circumstances. Looking forward, the job remains to complete the land market opening to support small farmers and help transition the sector to higher value-added European standards., A strong recovery will require a vibrant private sector. Determined measures will need to be taken as early as possible to ensure that the banking system, which has been heavily exposed to Ukraine’s wartime needs, will be positioned to provide sufficient credit to businesses when recovery can begin., Finally, depending on how long the war lasts, we estimate that poverty—the percentage of people living below the subsistence level—could rise from 18 percent in 2020 to more than 70 percent by the end of this year. The support we are providing to the authorities to sustain hospitals and ensure teachers continue to teach their students—even virtually—is and will remain critical. The government will need to continue to protect Ukraine’s human capital., I would like to thank all the partners with whom we work and with whom we have worked, and with such purpose, over the past four months to support Ukraine., And, of course, I want to express my admiration for the Ukrainian people whose resilience and courage ensured that this day – today - would come., Thank you very much., Watch the video recording (YouTube), Anna Bjerde is World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/anna-bjerde-remarks-ukraine-recovery-conference-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Jul 2022,"While the Russian military advance in eastern Ukraine continues to escalate, the UN refugee agency, UNCHR, on Thursday warned that the winter months are very likely to be extremely harsh on millions of people affected by the war., Since the Russian invasion on 24 February, more than 11.5 million people have had to flee their homes in Ukraine, and some 6.3 million are internally displaced., Speaking from bomb-shattered ruins in Irpin and Bucha near the capital Kyiv, UNHCR High Commissioner, Filippo Grandi warned that winter was only around the corner: “And winters in Ukraine are very harsh and severe, extremely cold. So, we must do everything possible to prevent the cold of winter from becoming the next challenge for people that already have to face so much in their lives.”, Homes broken, families split, The UN refugee agency warned that people are struggling to rebuild their damaged homes, reunite with their families and recover from the trauma of more than four months of war., They are also in urgent need of financial assistance, having lost their jobs and incomes, while the price of essentials continues to rise, along with fuel shortages., While acknowledging the major challenges facing the people inside Ukraine, Mr. Grandi also highlighted the anxiety of separation felt by so many, “of being in exile, either in the country itself and …as refugees abroad”., Reslience and aid for millions, But after meeting and talking to some of those affected by the war, the High Commissioner also insisted that he had seen “lots of strength, resilience and determination to carry on, to recover, to rebuild here in this very building that appears so damaged, people are already working to fix it, to make it habitable again.”, According to the UN humanitarian coordination office in Ukraine, OCHA, 15.7 million people have been affected by the war and need support now, and two-thirds of them have been reached so far., Ongoing fighting and “impediments” imposed by the warring parties have continued to seriously hamper or make impossible the delivery of assistance to the hardest-hit areas, particularly in government and non-government-controlled areas of Luhansk oblast, or region., The insecurity has also made it extremely dangerous for civilians trying to evacuate from areas where there is active fighting., Electricity still cut, Critical locations of concern in Luhansk include Kherson, Sievierodonetsk among others, while people in Mariupol have received very limited support from local actors operating in areas outside Government control in the Donetsk region., “Access to water and healthcare there remains worryingly limited”, noted OCHA’s assessment. “Lack of access to electricity remains at an alarming level: more than 625,000 users, including families, businesses and public institutions in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, have not had electricity for weeks on end.”, OCHA’s latest update on the war indicated that 60 per cent of people forced to leave their homes have been displaced from the east, 15 per cent from the north, 11 per cent from the south and another 11 per cent from the capital., The oblasts of Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkivsk, Kyiv, Poltava and the city of Kyiv continue to host most displaced people.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-struggling-now-winter-will-be-even-worse-unhcr-chief

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (25 June-1 July 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,7 Jul 2022,"Last week in Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued, as the Russian military invasion of Ukraine entered its fifth month. Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine continued in several countries across Europe, as anti-war activists carried out acts of railway sabotage in Russia. Meanwhile, demonstrations against a proposed constitutional amendment in Uzbekistan were met with violence. LGBT+ Pride marches continued after last week’s deadly shooting in Norway, while solidarity demonstrations condemning the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, restricting rights to abortion in the US, were reported in several countries. Farmers continued to demonstrate against plans to restrict nitrogen emissions in the Netherlands and Belgium., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions last week. Fighting in the Donetsk region accounts for almost half of all violence recorded in Ukraine last week. Russian forces continued to try to encircle Lysychansk, the last large city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian control, with heavy fighting persisting throughout the week; on 3 July, Ukrainian forces withdrew from Lyschansk.1, In the Black Sea, Russian forces retreated from Zmiinyi Island (Snake Island) that had been under Russian control since the beginning of the full-scale invasion on 24 February, following several successful attacks by Ukrainian forces. Russian occupation of the island supported the blockade of ports in the Odesa region, which has contributed to worsening global food supply disruptions (BBC, 30 June 2022; The Guardian, 31 May 2022). On 1 July, a day after the retreat, Russian forces struck Zmiinyi Island with phosphorous bombs and also fired missiles at residential houses in a coastal settlement of Serhiivka in the Odesa region, killing at least 21 civilians (Reuters, 1 July 2022). These trends contribute to the 357% increase in violence in the Odesa region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month.2, Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to target civilians with shelling, airstrikes, and missile attacks across the country last week. On 27 June, a Russian missile hit a shopping mall with around 1,000 people inside in Kremenchuk in the Poltava region, killing at least 20 people, with many more still missing (RFE/RL, 30 June 2022). In addition to Russian strikes on Serhiivka and Kremenchuk, at least 50 more civilians were killed by Russian forces in various cities, including Kharkiv, Lysychansk, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv.3, Russian forces also continued to abduct civilians from occupied regions in Ukraine last week. On 28 June, Russian soldiers abducted the mayor of Kherson, with his location currently unknown (24 Channel, 28 June 2022). Russian forces also arrested around 50 civilians, mostly Crimean Tatars, in the Henichesk district of the Kherson region (Suspilne Media, 27 June 2022)., Additionally, Ukraine and Russia agreed to a prisoner exchange last week. On 28 June, 16 Ukrainian soldiers and one civilian returned to Ukraine in exchange for 15 prisoners captured by Ukraine. The next day, Russia released 144 more Ukrainian soldiers, including 95 servicemen captured during the surrender of Mariupol in May (The Guardian, 29 June 2022)., Demonstrations against the war and in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and Spain last week., In Russia, two acts of railway sabotage were carried out by anti-war activists, one of which temporarily paralyzed the movement of the Trans-Siberian Railway (Activatica, 30 June 2022). Two anti-war partisan movements – the Combat Organization of Anarchist Communists and the Ostanovi Vagony (Stop the Railcars) movement – claim responsibility for these acts, stating that they aim to disrupt the movement of Russian military equipment to Ukraine (Activatica, 28 June 2022)., In Uzbekistan, thousands of people took to the streets in several cities in the Karakalpakstan region on 1 July to demonstrate against a draft constitutional amendment that would remove the region’s right to seek independence (BASE, 1 July 2022). Protests in the regional capital Nukus were initially peaceful but were met with police violence during the night between 1 and 2 July (RFE/RL, 5 July 2022).4 Authorities later claimed that the demonstrations that started on Friday and continued throughout the weekend led to fatalities among both the demonstrators and police (RFE/RL, 4 July 2022). According to the amendment proposed by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev, Karakalpakstan would retain its autonomy but would lose the option to secede through a referendum among the region’s residents, including the Karakalpaks ethnic minority (RFE/RL, 27 June 2022; Al Jazeera, 2 July 2022)., Following the shooting outside an LGBT+ venue in Oslo last week, gatherings condemning the deadly incident took place in several cities in Norway, including in Oslo, which drew several thousand people (BBC, 28 June 2022). During the last week of June (LGBT+ Pride month), LGBT+ Pride marches were also held in Belgium, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., Elsewhere, solidarity demonstrations condemning the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, restricting access to abortion, were reported in Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, farmers’ ongoing discontent with the government’s plans to cut nitrogen emissions escalated into more than a hundred demonstration events across the country last week. Dutch farmers argue that the plan to halve nitrogen emissions by 2030 will force some out of business (Bloomberg, 28 June 2022). Targeting highways, demonstrators slowed down traffic with tractors or by burning hay bales. Demonstrations also took place at the residences of several politicians, including the Dutch Minister of Nature and Nitrogen. While the majority of events remained mainly peaceful, clashes occurred on several occasions when police attempted to stop the farmers. These trends contribute to the increase in violence in the Netherlands over the past week relative to the past month that is flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map. Similarly, farmers in Belgium continued to protest the new Flemish nitrogen policy, which is also aimed at reducing emissions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-25-june-1-july-2022
Ukraine: How basic food support becomes a lifeline for those escaping to safer places,News and Press Release,ICRC,"Food and Nutrition
Shelter and Non-Food Items",7 Jul 2022,"For Svetlana, an elderly resident in the Donetsk region, living through the hostilities these last few months has been overwhelming. ""I have no money at all so I can´t buy food, not even bread,"" she says as she chokes up with emotion while waiting for someone to help her carry boxes of food., While many people have left frontline areas, some of the most vulnerable people, like Svetlana, have remained in their homes, with few options to overcome the impact of hostilities., I have asked for help because there was nothing to live on and to continue with my rehabilitation,, - Svetlana, a resident of Kostyantynivka, Victoria waits for her husband to push along the bicycle on which she stacked the food parcels provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Ukrainian Red Cross Society., ""We had a good job. We worked with my husband in a private business. We gave people joy and satisfaction, with a lot of grateful customers throughout the Donetsk region and beyond. My husband is now unemployed. We have two children. We survive with the savings we made back when we still had plans for the future, including taking some holidays. Now everything has changed. We live one day at a time and hope there is no active fighting."", Kostyantynivka lies near the frontline. Air raid sirens blare nearly all day, alongside the sounds distant shelling. It now hosts many who have fled from neighboring villages after losing their jobs as a result of the hostilities, which makes it difficult to look after their basic needs. The conditions in Kostyantynivka are also very difficult, with rising prices for most goods., Many people have fled to other cities with whatever they could carry, looking for a safer place. This has led the ICRC and the URCS to provide relief items to persons who have fled from Lysychansk, Popasna, Rubizhne, Mariupol and other regions, and who have found shelter in Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in Ukraine., Yevgenia Aleksandrovna is a Ukrainian language teacher who fled from Sloviansk. She lost her apartment due to a missile attack at the end of May. ""In my flat, all the doors and windows were totally destroyed. I was knocked out of my bed onto the floor. I thought I would never walk again,"" Evgenia recalls while she wipes away tears on her face., When she was rescued and subsequently evacuated, she could only carry a small bag with a few clothes, a set of religious icons and a prayer bead, which she keeps close to her bed in a shared room with two other displaced women., ""In this shelter we have food three times a day, we don't sleep in basements, we have clean beds. Here we have electricity, water and I feel safe,"" she says with gratitude., While moving in search of safer places, people escaping conflict areas have immediate needs for food, water, hygiene items, blankets, and other essential items., ""We are providing relief items directly to displaced civilians located in different places such as shelters and as well as to communities near the frontline,"" says Hussein Rasool, who coordinates the ICRC's delivery of food, hygiene and livelihood assistance by its team based in Dnipro., ""This is part of a much larger distribution of relief items all over Ukraine and hopefully this helps people to cope with a very difficult situation,"" Hussein adds.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-how-basic-food-support-becomes-lifeline-those-escaping-safer-places
Ukraine War: The impact of disruption on infectious and chronic disease programmes is expected to be severe and durable,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,7 Jul 2022,"WHO/Europe releases Ukraine Crisis Strategic Response Plan for June -- December 2022, FULL REPORT AVAILABLE https://reliefweb.int/node/3863941, EXCERPTS, Prior to the war, Ukraine had a functioning health system with 1,630 hospitals and 10,140 primary health care facilities but was already facing multiple health-related challenges. Life expectancy was lower than in the EU by nine years -- at 72 versus 81 years -- and about 12% of patients of working age who had a stroke subsequently died with about 50% remaining with a primary disability., Ukraine has one of the highest catastrophic health expenditures among countries in the Region, with more than one-third of hospital admissions being potentially unnecessary. Health sector reform in Ukraine, initiated in 2016, encompasses the eHealth system. Currently, more than 35 million Ukrainians are registered in the Ministry of Health (MoH) system, which connects to health records at both primary and secondary health levels. However, health services are not solely provided through the MoH but also through the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Defence, and Presidential Administration, for example. Moreover, digitalized records are not accessible to patients and therefore are not available when they seek refuge in other countries. The current system is also unable to provide for early warning, syndromic surveillance, and remote health care, to name a few services., Ukraine suffers from low immunization rates for all vaccine-preventable diseases -- 81.9% for measles (second dose of measles-containing vaccines, or MCV) and 84.2% for polio (pol3). The national COVID-19 vaccination rate for one dose is estimated to be 36%. The vaccination coverage is less than 50% in regions with the largest population displacement, including eastern Ukraine. This, along with disruption in testing and treatment, puts those who are most vulnerable at increased risk of severe illness and death. Moreover, given suboptimal routine childhood vaccination coverage, the crisis and displacement will further increase existing immunity gaps in Ukraine, and potentially other countries, and therefore the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. The last nationwide outbreak of measles in Ukraine started in 2017 and reached a peak in 2019, reflecting a prolonged suboptimal vaccination coverage with MCV., Another concern is the outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) that Ukraine has been experiencing since September 2021. As of 25 February 2022, there have been two detected paralytic cases and 19 isolations of cVDPV2 from asymptomatic contacts. A so-called catch-up polio immunization campaign, introduced by the Ukrainian MoH and WHO in early February 2022, was put on hold due to the conflict and is now being revived., Overcrowded conditions in shelters, population displacement, infrastructure damage as well as exacerbating factors, such as lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygiene, nutritional stress and exposure to cold weather during winter, could increase the risk of respiratory and diarrheal diseases, including cholera, and thus it is critical to strengthen the early warning and alert component of the disease surveillance system to capture the various hazards., Conflict and infrastructure damage can lead to direct health impacts through trauma and injuries. Lack of access to emergency health care can lead to increased morbidity and mortality from trauma and injuries as well as a range of other common conditions as indicated below. Lack of access to good quality rehabilitation care that is embedded in the community may result in long-standing disability. Lack of access to preventive and emergency health care can also lead to unnecessary excess illness and death from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and neonatal and childhood conditions., Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ukraine, with the five major NCDs -- cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and mental health conditions -- accounting for 84% of all deaths. Disruptions in treatment for chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases increase morbidity and, most likely, mortality. About 120,000 people are living with Type 1 diabetes and need to receive regular doses of life-saving medicines to survive. Some key challenges identified have included difficulties in being able to control diabetes, a lack of continuous supply of medicines for chronic disease, and the lack of compatibility of medicines for returnees to Ukraine due to different EU/Ukraine licensing and registration., Ukraine has the second-highest burden of HIV/AIDS in Europe, with an estimated prevalence rate of one percent among Ukrainians between the ages of 15 and 49. It is assessed that about 59,000 people on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy reside in areas affected by the war. Ukraine has the fifth-highest number of confirmed cases of extensively drug-resistant TB, globally. Shortages of medicines and medical supplies, challenging access to essential health services, and the interruption of prevention, diagnostic and treatment services pose a severe threat of adverse outcomes from these conditions., Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the case detection rate of TB was half of that prior to the pandemic. And now, the war has weakened TB surveillance capacity and interrupted continuous treatment regimens. This will probably result in an increased spread of drug-resistant TB., Gender-based violence (GBV) is a widespread human rights violation globally, with potential life-threatening health consequences. Crises and emergencies greatly exacerbate all forms of GBV, including sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), and at least two out of three women in Ukraine had experienced some form of GBV before the conflict. The security context and displacement have resulted in a sharp increase in the risk of multiple forms of violence, including SEA and trafficking of persons. The proliferation of agencies and non-vetted volunteers and voluntary organizations further increases the risk of SEA and all forms of sexual misconduct., WHOs response, The health response will target the entire country of Ukraine and neighbouring countries where there is an influx of refugees. Under the humanitarian core principles, this strategic response plan aims to meet the essential health care needs of all affected populations regardless of where they may be, and to ensure that the required services are accessed in safe environments consistent with the principles of protection., Programming within Ukraine, ENDS, FULL REPORT AVAILABLE HERE, WHO Spokesperson in Ukraine: Margaret Harris, harrism@who.int, WHO/Europe Press Office: eupress@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-impact-disruption-infectious-and-chronic-disease-programmes-expected-be-severe-and-durable
Ukraine crisis strategic response plan for June-December 2022,Appeal,WHO,Health,5 Jul 2022,"Overview, This WHO Strategic Response Plan (‎SRP)‎ will be implemented in collaboration with partners providing life-saving support to people affected by the conflict in Ukraine, whether they are inside or outside Ukraine. It is an overarching framework built on the Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022 to guide priorities and work, according to access and location, in support of national and local authorities who are leading the readiness, response and early recovery activities. The timeframe of this SRP is six months., Context, On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation military offensive commenced in Ukraine. Since then, intense hostilities have been escalating across Ukraine, including around the capital, Kyiv, in the north, and in the eastern, southern and western parts of the country, triggering one of the world’s fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crises. To date, more than one-third of Ukraine’s entire population has been displaced: 8 million people, of whom 60% are women and 40% men, have been internally displaced, and over 6.3 million people, of whom 90% are women and children, have fled across the border to neighbouring countries, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reporting 2.5 million people continuing their journey to other countries. At the same time, authorities have reported more than 1.8 million movements back into the country (1).
Another 13 million people have been directly affected in the hardest-hit areas of north, east and south Ukraine, including many who have been trapped in hotspots of intense fighting, or stranded due to destruction of infrastructure, and who face acute shortages of food, water and medical care. This is on top of eight years of armed conflict already in eastern Ukraine. As of 26 May, there were 8766 civilian casualties in the country, including 4031 killed and 4735 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (2).
More than half of all casualties so far verified were recorded in the government- and non-government-controlled areas of the Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. Attacks on health care, including those against health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses, continue.
Cumulatively, between 23 February and 30 May, 265 attacks were reported, resulting in 59 reported injuries and 75 reported deaths (3).
In addition to the immediate devastating physical and psychological impacts of ongoing violence and attacks, the unfolding humanitarian crisis is impacting, and will impact, everyone in the country in a variety of ways that will increase morbidity and mortality in the medium- to long-term. Some 300 health facilities are located in conflict areas, and 1000 health facilities are in areas where control has changed, which leaves the health system vulnerable to infrastructural damage and severe disruptions.
Consequently, there is limited or no access to medicines, health facilities, or health care workers in some areas.
Nearly 50% of Ukraine’s pharmacies are presumed to be closed, and many health workers are either displaced or unable to work.
Emergency medical services, surgical departments and intensive care units have been overwhelmed with trauma patients. Accessing health care has been limited, essential health services have been disrupted or are collapsing, and the treatment of chronic/noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease, has been jeopardized. Equally, mental health, sexual, reproductive and maternal health care, antenatal care, child health and assistance to people with disabilities are also being severely compromised. The long-term physical and mental health and psychological impacts, including those due to genderbased violence, cannot be underestimated.
Health care service disruption coupled with conflict conditions has also increased the affected population’s vulnerability to communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, tuberculosis, polio and measles. Low vaccination coverage increases the risk of outbreaks of preventable communicable diseases, particularly among children; the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent reported cases of polio in the western part of the country compound this risk.
Population movements across borders continue to be unpredictable. UNHCR estimates that, by the end of 2022, about 4.2 million refugees will remain in these neighbouring countries and another 4.1 million will have continued onwards to other countries in the WHO European Region, such as Germany, Czech Republic and Bulgaria, as well as beyond (4).
Most refugees are women and children due to a ban in place on Ukrainian men aged 18–60 leaving the country. There are reports of vulnerable and marginalized populations among the refugee population, including older people, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities. Nearly one-third of the displaced households have a child under the age of five and more than half have an elderly person. The provision of family friendly services that cater especially to mothers and children will be critical.
Governments in countries neighbouring Ukraine and those of final destination for refugees have generously kept their borders open, and local communities have welcomed refugees and other persons of concern. These governments and health authorities are leading the response for this crisis, with UN agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local responders, including civil society organizations, faith-based institutions, refugeeand women-led organizations, academia and the private sector, as well as private citizens, playing an important role in supporting and complementing state authorities’ efforts. Local and national authorities have established reception facilities at border crossing points to receive new arrivals as well as urgent medical referrals from within Ukraine, and are providing life-saving assistance, including accommodation, food, emergency medical care and other basic needs. They are then providing onward transport to referral health facilities as well as for those seeking to reach urban centres. At these urban centres, information is provided on the asylum process and temporary protection, as well as on the risks of trafficking. Access to basic rights and services, such as health, has been facilitated.
On 4 March, European Union (EU) Member States activated the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for the first time.
Under the TPD, Member States grant temporary protection (TP) to Ukrainians and persons with protection status in Ukraine and their family members residing in Ukraine before 24 February. The TPD enables access to national health services at the same level as host communities, including free access to health services in line with national regulations. Steps have been taken to foster protection and inclusion into national systems, such as for health and education services. While this may be feasible in the short-term for many EU countries, it is critical to monitor access and financial barriers for both refugee and host populations, as even now some countries, such as Republic of Moldova, may not be able to afford equitable access for increased populations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-strategic-response-plan-june-december-2022

On 27 June an estimated 21 people were killed when Russian forces bombed a busy shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. Ukrainian officials estimated an upwards of 1,000 people were in the shopping center before the attack. During overnight strikes on 1 July in Serhiivka, in the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa, an estimated 16 people were killed in a residential complex while another five were killed when a missile struck a community center., Osnat Lubrani, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, said that, “the level of human suffering caused by this war has no limits. The people of this country have had enough and have seen way too many of their loved ones killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, and their homes, schools and hospitals bombed. It is high time that the parties to the conflict started to decisively comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.” At least 4,889 civilians have been killed since 24 February. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has acknowledged that the real toll is likely much higher., Russian forces have intensified the scale of their attacks in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, an eastern area collectively known as Donbas, in recent weeks. A majority of the infrastructure in the conflict areas of Luhansk has reportedly been destroyed by fighting. On Monday, 4 July, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory over the Luhansk region following a weeks-long offensive and the capture of the strategic city of Lysychansk. Many buildings in Lysychansk have been scorched and streets are strewn with rubble. Russian forces have redirected their efforts to the city of Sloviansk and other civilian areas in Donetsk. According to local officials in Sloviansk, Russian shelling killed six people on 3 July while another two were killed on 5 July., According to the UN, over 16 million people in Ukraine need humanitarian assistance. At least 6 million people remain internally displaced while 5.3 million others have taken refuge in neighboring countries., On 4-5 July Switzerland hosted a conference focused on recovery and reconstruction efforts for Ukraine. Sarah Hunter, Communications and Digital Media Officer at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “while Ukraine will need the international community’s support as it begins to rebuild, states must continue to explore all avenues for securing a lasting ceasefire. Mitigating civilian harm and preventing further war crimes and crimes against humanity must be paramount.”, DEADLY USE OF FORCE DURING MASS DEMONSTRATIONS IN SUDAN, Since 30 June tens of thousands of protesters in Sudan have taken to the streets in Khartoum and its twin cities, Omdurman and Bahri, commemorating the third anniversary of the Sudanese uprising. During the demonstrations at least 10 people were reportedly killed and hundreds injured due to excessive use of force by Sudanese security forces, including stun grenades, tear gas and live ammunition. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors reported that multiple people died as a result of gunshot wounds, including to the head and chest. The protests were the largest and deadliest gathering of demonstrators in Sudan since the October 2021 military takeover., In a statement on 30 June the Trilateral Mechanism – a group consisting of the UN, African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development, aimed at brokering peace and overcoming political deadlock in Sudan – condemned the protest violence “in the strongest terms possible” and expressed its “disappointment over the continued use of excessive force by security forces and lack of accountability for such actions, despite repeated commitments by authorities.” Last month, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed that security forces have repeatedly used excessive force against peaceful protesters since the October coup, including the use of lethal weapons such as AK-47 assault rifles and machine guns. An estimated 114 protesters have been killed by security forces since the October coup., On Monday, 4 July, Sudan’s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced in a televised statement that the army would no longer participate in the political talks facilitated by the Trilateral Mechanism to allow political and revolutionary groups to form a civilian transitional government. General Burhan said that, “the armed forces will not stand in the way” of a democratic transition, stating that the military remains committed to working towards “elections in which the Sudanese people choose who will govern them.” Burhan’s announcement was received with skepticism by protesters, who question whether the military will truly step down, and continue to call for the immediate departure of the military from power., Amid ongoing protests, the risk of further violence and atrocities remains. Sudanese security forces must respect the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and immediately end the use of excessive force against protesters, as well as arbitrary arrests and detentions. Sudanese authorities must launch credible investigations and hold perpetrators of violations and abuses accountable. The international community must continue to pressure the Sudanese authorities to fully restore the political transition, taking into account the people’s desire for democratic reform., UN COMMISSION CALLS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A MECHANISM ON MISSING PERSONS IN SYRIA, Syrian civil society organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as several UN-mandated bodies have documented and publicly reported on missing and disappeared persons in Syria since the armed conflict between the government and opposition groups began in 2011. The UN-mandated Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Syria has reported that at least 100,000 persons are missing or have been forcibly disappeared by parties to the conflict. The whereabouts and fate of the missing and disappeared remain unknown as parties to the conflict, including the Syrian government, withhold information from family members thereby prolonging their suffering., Given the extent of resources required to effectively investigate, until now the thousands of individual cases and claims have not been comprehensively documented or consolidated and millions of people continue looking for their missing loved ones. Since 2016 the CoI has made repeated calls for the establishment of an independent international mechanism to resolve the issue of the missing and forcibly disappeared. On 17 June the CoI issued extensive recommendations regarding the establishment of such a mechanism, stating that it should be mandated to consolidate claims to effectively track and identify those missing and help their families; coordinate technical assistance to parties to the conflict regarding detainees and missing persons and their remains; independently monitor all places of detention; provide assistance in releases and post-release reunification of families; and on-site examination and protection of remains., Syrian victims and survivors of enforced disappearance and detention, as well as their families, have also advocated for the creation of a mechanism for years. CoI Commissioner Hanny Megally emphasized that, any mechanism “must ensure the participation of the families of missing persons in Syria, and be accessible to them, regardless of where they reside or actual or perceived links or affiliations. They are also victims, and the mechanism should amplify their voices as they seek information.”, As requested in UN General Assembly Resolution 76/228, the UN Secretary-General is expected to soon release a feasibility study on how to bolster efforts to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing people in Syria. Following the findings of the feasibility study, it is imperative that UN member states urgently establish an independent international mechanism and ensure that the rights of victims and their families, as well as their meaningful participation, are centralized.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-307-ukraine-sudan-and-syria

The modular housing is being built for more than 200 persons with the support of the European Union and the German government within the framework of the project “EU4ResilientRegions – Special Assistance Programme Ukraine”. For this purpose, Chernivtsi City Council signed the agreement for a total of EUR 3 million with the federal company GIZ, which is implementing the project., Since February 24, 2022, when the full-scale Russian invasion began, the municipality of Chernivtsi has sheltered tens of thousands of internally displaced persons from the eastern and southern regions., ”People who have moved to us receive hot food, essential things, and we provide everything they need to be fully secured. But it's obviously an additional load on the city, part of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) is currently forced to live in schools and kindergartens, which are not equipped for long-term residence.

Healthworkers held 300 counselling sessions on immunisation at IDP centres [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,6 Jul 2022,"Forty-eight healthcare workers are visiting displaced people in western Ukraine as part of efforts to challenge misinformation about vaccines., Forty-eight health workers have been visiting internally displaced persons’ (IDP) centres in Ukraine as part of efforts to challenge misinformation about vaccines and reduce the spread of infectious diseases, as the war continues to escalate., The UNICEF project, which will see physicians hold public lectures and private meetings with IDPs, is set to take place throughout summer in five regions of Ukraine – Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Zakarpattia and Chernivtsi., UNICEF health envoys will also answer some of the most common questions about immunisation and advise IDPs on where and how they can receive all necessary vaccinations according to the immunisation calendar., Similar meetings are due to take place in over 700 temporary IDP centres., During the first four weeks of the project, health workers already consulted around 3,000 Ukrainians with Lviv and Ternopil regions having the highest number of people subsequently signing up for vaccination. People are most interested in getting vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus, COVID-19, hepatitis B and polio. In addition, mobilizers provide breastfeeding recommendations and consult IDPs on the “Spilno” multipurpose cash programme by UNICEF., Talking about the importance of vaccination is most effective during personal conversations and open meetings, says infectious disease doctor Lilia Mykhailiv, who has already made her first visit to an IDP centre in Lviv., “I was very interested in participating in this project because helping people is what always brings the greatest satisfaction,” says Lilia. “So now I am delighted to have the opportunity to hold meetings in IDP centres – especially regarding such an important topic as immunisation. During the full-scale war, it is our task as healthcare workers to provide psycho-social support and remind people about the diseases that threaten their safety if they hesitant to get vaccines.”, More than 200 medical workers from all over Ukraine have answered the callto take part in the initiative. Health mobilizers have been selected based on their expertise in routine vaccinations, medical qualifications, social skills and motivation for change in healthcare in Ukraine. Many of those who were selected have themselves become internally displaced, including university professors, family doctors and interns., This project has been implemented by UNICEF Ukraine, together with the Ukrainian Catholic University, with the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)., Media contacts Nina Sorokopud Chief of Communication UNICEF in Ukraine Email: nsorokopud@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/healthworkers-held-300-counselling-sessions-immunisation-idp-centres-enuk

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region),
Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.

Description of the emergency, Around 8 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since the beginning of the armed international conflict on 24 February 2022. Most of those fleeing Ukraine have entered the immediate neighbouring countries, primarily Poland, Russia, and Romania (see the map below for estimated figures). Beyond the immediate neighbouring countries, Germany, Czech Republic, France, Greece and Spain have indicated the highest number of refugees’ registrations for international protection., The number of people moving into neighbouring countries continues to be much lower than at the start of the conflict. At the same time, more than 2.5 million Ukrainians have entered back to Ukraine since 28 February 2022. However, this figure reflects cross-border movements and does not indicate permanent returns. IFRC is closely monitoring the flow of people to anticipate needs and situations, which changes daily., A further 7.13 million are estimated to be internally displaced within Ukraine, more than half of whom originally resided in the eastern regions of the country. This reality indicates that the geographical needs within the country are fluid as the context evolves and as populations seek refuge in other parts of the country., Critical infrastructure has been affected, damaged, or destroyed, including approx. 1,9005 educational facilities and nearly 3006 health facilities. Many pharmacies are closed, and stocks of medicines are low, leaving people without access to health care and life-saving medicines. Hundreds of thousands of people are living without access to basics, such as water, food, and electricity., Access to medical supplies, food, water, utilities, and other vital goods and services deteriorates, which pushes people to seek refuge to meet their basic needs. For those who have left Ukraine, people without social and family networks are increasingly struggling to find or cover the cost of accommodation. Host families face increased pressure to offer support in the immediate and longer-term. After two years of responding to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health systems in neighbouring countries are also struggling to meet increasing demands. Given the nature of this crisis, people affected will face long-term mental health needs that those existing resources may not be able to support.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-and-impacted-countries-emergency-appeal-ndeg-mgr65002-operation-update-report-ndeg-3

Currently, about 120,000km2 of this territory is under the control of Russian Forces. The State Emergency Services of Ukraine (SESU) report that they have cleared 149,032 items of explosive ordnance since March to the 29th of June in 2022. They also have developed an App for reporting explosive ordnance, accessible at https://mine.dsns.gov.ua/.

The storm-tested logistics networks he has helped set up are what have made Rotary members in the Jacksonville, Florida, area so effective at responding to the war against Ukraine, including helping find housing for around 140 refugees., ""We have the institutional knowledge already in place and the infrastructure,"" explains Mulvihill, a semiretired business executive who has served as an infantry officer, paratrooper, and Green Beret in the U.S. Army Reserve., His district's Rotary clubs have raised more than $95,000 for Ukraine relief efforts. They have channeled food, protective equipment, and EMT supplies to Ukraine. They even organized a day at the Jacksonville Zoo for the children of refugee families., Rotary clubs unite across continents, Rotary members in North America, South America, and Europe have collaborated with a U.S.-based association of Ukrainian health care workers and used their connections to collect and ship more than 350 tons of critical medical supplies to Ukraine., As of May, five cargo planes packed with medical supplies such as tourniquets, blood-clotting gauze, negative pressure wound therapy equipment, and medications have been flown from Chicago to Europe, where members have helped deliver them to Ukraine., ""It is Rotary doing what Rotary does best. It networks, pulls people together, and gets the job done,"" says RI Director Pat Merryweather-Arges, who has helped coordinate the shipments., North American and Argentine Rotary clubs combined their resources to purchase medical supplies and worked with pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers to arrange donations. For example, a hospital in Peoria, Illinois, sent an ambulance and networked with others to have seven ambulances shipped to Ukraine., Supplies streamed into a warehouse operated by the Ukrainian Medical Association of North America near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Rotary clubs in Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Iowa collected supplies to ship to the warehouse., ""It's amazing what one Rotarian talking to another Rotarian can accomplish,"" says Marga Hewko, immediate past president of the Rotary Club of Chicago., Rotary clubs in Ukraine are leading relief efforts, Ukraine has 62 Rotary clubs and seven satellite clubs — about 1,100 members in total, as well as 25 Rotaract clubs that combined have more than 300 members., The Rotary Club of Cherkasy purchased medical supplies and medicine and delivered them to local hospitals. Members of the Rotary Club of Kharkiv International have traveled to border countries to help refugees adapt to their new situations and have worked, through their project Yellow Help, to evacuate families near war zones., The Rotary Club of Kyiv Synergy collected 350 boxes of medical supplies from Italy and distributed them to areas within Kyiv and Sumy., The Rotary Club of Kyiv-Sophia prepared hot meals and delivered them to residents of Kyiv and its suburbs of Irpin and Bucha. Members purchased hygiene products and medicine and delivered them to young mothers and the elderly., Rotary relief efforts in Europe, Poland has taken in more than 3 million refugees, and Rotary clubs all over the country created a central account for contributions. The Rotary Club of Olsztyn collected and managed donations for more than 150 Ukrainian refugees, most of whom are unaccompanied children whose parents stayed in Ukraine. Four cars full of supplies including food, clothes, toiletries, and toys were donated to a local refugee center hours after it began accepting refugees., Also in Poland, members of the Rotary Clubs of Zamosc and Wolsztyn partnered with other organizations to collect supplies and equipment. Members of the Rotary Club of Gdansk Centrum have provided accommodations and jobs for four refugee families., In Germany, the Rotary Club of Berlin Platz der Republik, supported by the Rotary Club of Berlin International and the Rotary E-Club of Wall Street New York, has developed a housing-specific platform called Spaces for Ukraine. Nearly 400 refugees have found homes through the site, and 925 host families have registered., In Hungary, the Rotary Club of Kisvárda coordinated contributions and mobilized members to donate necessities and deliver the items to where they're needed. Rotary members in Romania and Moldova used WhatsApp to organize shelter for refugees. In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, clubs partnered with a railway and cargo company to transport some 2,300 refugees to safety., This story originally appeared in the July 2022 issue of Rotary magazine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rotary-responds-support-ukraine

Millions of Ukrainians have lost their livelihoods — and 90 per cent are at risk of falling into poverty.

We aim to reach millions more in the coming months., We are also working with the Government of Ukraine to tackle the insidious threat of unexploded ordnance, landmines and cluster munitions. And we are preparing the groundwork for the reconstruction and repair of critical infrastructure. This is a long road, but it must start now., The United Nations is committed to supporting the Government of Ukraine to save lives, strengthen relief efforts, advance Ukraine’s recovery and development plan, and protect hard-won gains towards the Sustainable Development Goals., This is our common obligation.

"Brief: Displacement Trends Analysis, Ukraine - June 2022",Analysis,REACH,Protection and Human Rights,5 Jul 2022,"Key findings, • As of June 23, 6.25 million people were reported as internally displaced (IDPs) within Ukraine, and KIs in REACH-assessed settlements reporting new IDP arrivals in all oblasts between 2-16 May. Estimating displacement figures has reportedly been challenging due to the changing situation of the war., • Western oblasts continue to host a large share of IDPs. 5,670 collective sites have so far been identified across Ukraine, mostly in educational and publicly owned facilities. Nevertheless, low occupancy and hence collective site closures suggest that many IDPs are residing in private housing, likely requiring a different response from humanitarian actors. IDP arrivals and returns to urban areas, such as Kyiv city, suggest rising needs in urban centres., • Another wave of displacement from eastern regions was reported over the past month, despite officially-supported transport and exit routes becoming less available. Evacuation trains from eastern oblasts decreased in late May, potentially due to decrease in passenger demand, closure of railway stations, and many people having already left the region. Access to transport remains difficult for vulnerable groups.• Displacement and returns were reported in non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), as well as movement barriers out of these areas. As humanitarian needs have reportedly been rising rapidly, humanitarian access and security in NGCAs are key concerns., • Between 17 March and 6 May, 118,444 people were reportedly evacuated via government-approved evacuations (green corridors). However, green corridors out of conflictaffected areas and/or NGCAs have ceased since 6 May. Restrictions of movement out of nongovernment-controlled areas are a key concern., • In late May, returns to and within Ukraine increased considerably, and continued to rise in late June at a slower rate. Common destinations were Northern oblasts, Kyiv city, and Eastern oblasts. Frequently cited reasons for return include pull factors such as family reunification and perception of safety, and push factors include employment, accommodation, access to social security and assistance, and access to documentation. Factors that remain difficult to assess include the estimation of return numbers, length of intended returns, provision of assistance to returnees, and the safety of return areas., • The significant proportion of people returning to conflict-affected areas, or people returning despite security concerns, indicates that other push factors could outweigh security concerns and push IDPs to return. Further data collection could help indicate whether additional humanitarian support during displacement could contribute to mitigating push factors leading to returns to unsafe areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/brief-displacement-trends-analysis-ukraine-june-2022

Shelling from heavy artillery, such as multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, including weapons that can carry cluster munitions, were used repeatedly. Even though the civilian toll from such weapons, used in the manner they have been, has become indisputable, Russian armed forces have continued to operate the same way – with predictable consequences on the civilian population and its infrastructure., The placement of military objectives near civilian objects and the use of human shields by both parties to the conflict – as documented in the case of a care house in Stara Krasnianka (Luhansk region) for instance – also raise concerns., The mass displacement of the civilian population – including over 8 million within the country – has had disproportionate impact on women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities., Restrictions on freedom of movement to and from regions occupied by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups are reducing access to basic services., To date, we have recorded damage or destruction to over 400 medical facilities and educational facilities, while the actual numbers are likely higher. Thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed.

Despite restrictions on access, we have documented 270 cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance. 8 of the victims were found dead., The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and National Police have reportedly arrested over one thousand individuals suspected of supporting Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. We have concerns that arrests may not have been carried out in line with Ukraine’s international human rights obligations. We have also documented 12 cases which may amount to enforced disappearance by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies., And appalling reports of torture and ill-treatment by both parties continue, including of prisoners of war, with little progress in holding those responsible to account., We remain concerned for people, among them Mariupol residents, who have not passed the so-called ‘filtration’ process by Russian armed forces in evacuations. Absent any confirmation about their whereabouts or treatment, based on information gathered, we consider that they may be detained and at high risk of being subjected to torture or ill-treatment., We are also concerned about confirmed allegations of forced conscription by Russian-affiliated armed groups at the end of February 2022, in Donetsk and Luhansk., My team has verified 28 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including cases of rape, gang rape, torture, forced public stripping, and threats of sexual violence. The majority of cases were committed in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, but there were also cases committed in Government controlled areas. The extent of violations is not yet clear given the active hostilities, limited access to services, mass displacement and persistent stigma, with survivors often not willing or able to report such crimes.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",5 Jul 2022,"Large parts of Ukraine have been in a state of war since 2014. But since February 2022, the lives of all Ukrainians have been severely affected by violence, shortages of goods and food and a major displacement crisis. In Ukraine, Cordaid funds partner organisations through Caritas Internationalis, the global network of Catholic aid organisations., In Ukraine, there are two national Caritas organisations: Caritas Spes, which originated from the country’s Roman Catholic constituency and Caritas Ukraine, which stems from the Greek Catholic church., Staff and volunteers of both organisations are working day and night to support people who have fled their homes with sometimes nothing more than the clothes they had on., Humanitarian hub, The western part of the country, and especially the city of Lviv, has become a humanitarian hub after the situation in the east deteriorated. At a storage facility of Caritas Spes in the Lviv region, multiple trucks arrive every day, full of essential goods donated by neighbouring countries., After the goods have arrived, the aid workers load up their own trucks and start driving to the cities in the east, that have been suffering continuous air raids and bombings, and where, in some cases, people are still living in the rubble., “I have been to Irpin myself, the devastated town close to Kyiv, to deliver aid,” says Markian Stefanyshyn, humanitarian aid coordinator for Caritas Spes and chief logistics of the storage facility. “People started crying when we got there. It was very touching.”, Practical issues, According to Markian, the continuous aid operation is running into various practical issues. “Our biggest challenge now is space. We don’t have enough. The only thing we can do is unload and load faster, so the trucks can leave sooner and we create space for the next one coming in. We need to be extremely efficient.”, The Caritas members do not only distribute food, water, clothes and medicines, they also provide a home for hundreds of displaced people or guide them to the border in case they are looking for safety outside of the country., More than a project, 80 kilometres outside of Lviv, Caritas Spes has built so-called ‘family-run orphanages’, providing a safe space for children where they can live, learn and grow with the support and warmth of a real family., “We don’t like to call this a project because a project has a beginning and an end,” says Tetiana Kalinichenko from Caritas Spes. “This is a way of life. The kids who live here will not be on their own when they turn 18. They will always be a part of this family. Helping children this way means true dedication.”, “From the moment we stepped out of the train, we felt amazing support from the people in western Ukraine.”, Caritas Spes has built five of these houses for five families, each consisting of ten people. Some families have been living here for years now, while others have arrived recently after the violence in other parts of the country forced them to leave their homes., This is the case for Natalia Molar who came from a village near Kyiv with two of her children. She now takes care of eight other displaced children as well., Natalia: “We wanted to stay in our home as long as possible, but when the missiles started flying over our heads and a neighbouring village was occupied by the Russian military, we knew we had to leave. From the moment we stepped out of the train, we felt amazing support from the people in western Ukraine. People are doing everything they can. The children now go to school. They received books and the teachers are great. They are doing really well and their grades are good.”, In cities throughout the country, Caritas Ukraine has set up tents where the volunteers hand out essential goods. They have also organised food kitchens where displaced people can get a warm meal. To give just an example: in the city of Ivano-Frankyvsk Caritas Ukraine provides meals for 1200 people each day., “Even when this war is over, we will be needing a lot of extra hands.”, The lives of millions of Ukrainians depend on the immense aid operation, coordinated by local and international NGOs. Despite all the good work and satisfying results, it is unlikely the humanitarian needs in the conflict will decline in the coming months. Markian Stefanyshyn is worried about the long term, “For instance, the number of goods coming in from Poland is dropping. The volunteers are becoming very tired and some of them are losing their motivation. People are also worried about their own income, understandably., Even when this war is over, we will be needing a lot of extra hands. The needs will still be there. The most important thing now is ending this war. Not only for Ukraine, but for the entire world.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emergency-aid-displaced-ukrainians
"Ukraine: FAO scales up efforts to save upcoming harvest, ensure export of vital grains [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture

Food and Nutrition",5 Jul 2022,"New $17 million Japan-funded project aims to address grain storage deficit and increase export of critical agricultural goods to international markets, To address the impacts of the war in Ukraine on the global agricultural sector, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a new $17 million project to help Ukrainian farmers save the upcoming harvest in July-August while ensuring export of critical agricultural goods to international markets., Funded by Japan and implemented jointly with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, the project aims to restore grain storage capacity and functionality of supply chains from harvest to export as well as maintain productive capacity of Ukrainian farmers to enable continued future productions., “Ukraine’s farmers are feeding themselves, their communities and millions more people around the world. Ensuring they can continue production, safely store and access alternative markets to sell their produce is vital to secure food availability, protect livelihoods, strengthen food security within Ukraine and ensure other import-dependent countries have a steady and sufficient supply of grain at a manageable cost,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of the FAO Office of Emergencies and Resilience., Ukraine is one of the top-five global grain exporters, supplying more than 45 million tonnes of grain yearly to the global market. According to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, due to the blockage of Black Sea ports, the country still has 18 million tonnes of last year’s cereals and oilseeds harvest in stores waiting for export. Alternative rail and river routes cannot make up for the lost exports through maritime transportation and bottlenecks along new, potential supply chains that have yet to be resolved., This season Ukraine is expecting to harvest up to 60 million tonnes of grain. But the lack of export does not allow for the opening of available storage space for the new harvest, since 30 percent of the available capacity of granaries still remain filled with last year’s harvest., “Within the new Japan-funded project, FAO will address storage deficit by providing the polyethylene grain sleeves, grain loading and unloading machinery to the smallholders and a variety of modular storage containers to the medium-sized producers and associations. Support will be provided to the farmers from ten oblasts of Ukraine: in the east, centre, south and north of the country,” said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office., In addition, the project will provide technical support to the Government to operationalize alternative transport routes for grain export and foster the rapid expansion of technical capacity of the Izmail laboratory. The facility will enable farmers to meet international standards including veterinary and food safety testing and certification., FAO’s ongoing support to Ukraine, FAO has been operating in Ukraine since 2003 and since 2015 focused its activities on emergency support and development projects., Following the start of the war, the Organization has developed and updated its Rapid Response Plan, calling for $115.4 million in funding to provide support to almost 980 000 small farmers and medium-sized producers through December 2022., As of 29 June, FAO has already supported over 75 000 people with emergency agricultural support including distribution of seed potatoes and vegetable seeds and multipurpose cash assistance. An additional 44 000 people will be supported in the coming weeks to produce vegetables, cereal crops, milk, meat and eggs to feed themselves., This is the second time Japan has contributed to fund FAO’s Humanitarian Response Programme in Ukraine followed by its first contribution in April 2022, adding up to a total of $20 million., To date, with the additional funds from Japan, FAO has raised $30.4 million. The financial support has been also provided by Australia, Belgium, the CERF Rapid Response, the European Union, France, the Louis Dreyfus Foundation, Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA). With more contributions, FAO would be able to reach more people to bolster food production and improve the food security situation in the country., Facts and figures:, Contact, Viktoriia Mykhalchuk

No Peace of Mind: The looming mental health crisis for the children of Ukraine,Assessment,World Vision,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",5 Jul 2022,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, This report warns that, because of the conflict in Ukraine, millions of children are likely to suffer from mental health impacts now and into the future. World Vision is concerned that the war is subjecting children to constant fear and hopelessness, increasing their immediate stress responses and increasing their risk for specific mental disorders such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. We are doing what we can, but we know from experience in places like Syria and South Sudan that proper investment in mental health and other services is vital if children are to overcome the impact of such distressing experiences., Children are resilient and can cope if provided with adequate support., However, if left unattended, their symptoms will have mid- and long-term impacts; in 15-20 years’ time, a large percentage of the country’s workforce will be suffering from some sort of emotional or mental disorder. On top of what this will mean for individuals, families, and Ukrainian society at large, it will also inevitably have long-term economic impacts on the country and the region., Key statistics and facts include:, Previous studies have shown that more than 22% of conflict-affected people may end up with some form of mental health disorder. In the context of Ukraine, that would mean 4,595,591 people, 1,531,864 of them childreni , and the number is growing daily., In a rapid assessment of needs amongst displaced families in Ukraine, parents’ biggest worry for their children was their mental health (45%). Worryingly, more than a quarter (26%) of parents in the same area had no knowledge of mental health services that they could make available to their children., Investing just US$50 per person3 now could prevent over 1 million people affected by the conflictii from developing more complex mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mental health disorders., Alongside a plea for an end to hostilities, this report calls for mental health and psychosocial support to be sufficiently prioritised and funded for the children of Ukraine and their communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/no-peace-mind-looming-mental-health-crisis-children-ukraine

EU and UNDP support launch of psychological assistance hotline for Ukrainians affected by war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",5 Jul 2022,"The hotline engages professional psychologists with many years of experience who have volunteered to provide assistance in crisis situations, Kyiv, 5 July 2022 – With EU funding, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine has supported the launch of a hotline to provide psychological assistance to Ukrainians affected by the war. The initiative to establish this hotline for the provision of first-hand psychological care came from the National Psychological Association of Ukraine, which is implementing it., The line employs professional psychologists with many years of experience who have previously undergone special training to work with complex crisis situations. The line, with the number 0-800-100-102, works every day from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Calls from Ukraine are free of charge., Martin Schroeder, Head of the Local and Human Development Section at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said that the launch of the hotline was a very timely initiative to help Ukrainians gain relief from the constant emotional tension caused by the war, and to obtain reliable support during these difficult times., “The Russian war of aggression continues to take the lives of Ukrainians, harm their relatives and friends, and destroy entire cities and villages,” Schroeder said. “We can only imagine what the citizens of Ukraine are made to feel when they face such atrocities, but one thing we can do is intensify and expand our efforts so that every Ukrainian, wherever they are, can at least get timely and professional psychological help. I’m convinced that thanks to the work of this line, we’re several steps closer to this goal.”, Manal Fouani, UNDP interim Resident Representative in Ukraine, said developing the capacity of specialized organizations providing psychological assistance is an important priority for UNDP, as the war is extolling a heavy toll on all Ukrainians, creating a growing need for quality psychological services., “The war has forced millions of Ukrainians to live in constant fear and anxiety; fearing for their own lives, the lives and wellbeing of their loved ones, and the future of their country,” Fouani said. “We believe launching this hotline service with the National Psychological Association makes it possible for every Ukrainian to benefit from this support. It is only a call away and a confirmation to Ukrainians that they are not alone in the daily struggle of war. Coping with emotional tension and distress of such unprecedented scale is way too difficult to be handled without professional support. We at UNDP continue our work to make psychological services as accessible as possible for all Ukrainians, because timely interventions can save lives.”, The line also accepts calls from citizens of Ukraine who are currently residing in other countries, namely in:, Czech Republic +420 800 012 058
Poland +48 800 088 141
France +33 805 080 466
Portugal +351 800 780 756
Sweden +46 20 160 46 46
Ireland +353 1800 817 519, Calls from all mobile operators in these countries are free of charge as well. The number of countries connected to the psychological care network is to expand – additional information on this will be published on the website of the National Psychological Association., The line will work in two formats: audio and video. To have a live video chat with a professional, those seeking help simply need to ask the operator to set up a video call., Valeria Paliy, the president of the National Psychological Association, said that in the process of developing the line, psychologists focused on the accessibility of services to the population., “We know that not all people have smartphones, a stable Internet connection, and that not all of our citizens can even use services online, so the telephone line is a convenient solution,” Paliy said., “However, those people who would like to have visual contact with a specialist, will be able to get it without any problems.”, The American Psychological Association and Amazon have taken part in developing and supporting the hotline. The hotline is an initiative implemented by the National Psychological Association within the framework of a grant project to provide comprehensive psychological support to Ukrainians. It is being implemented with the support of UNDP under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme., Background, The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).

Between 13 and 26 June the International Organization for Migration ( conducted an area baseline assessment of 888 hromadas* hosting IDPs in Zakarpatska, Lvivska, Ivano-Frankivska, Chernivetska, Kirovohradska, Kyivska, Odeska, Ternopilska, Vinnytska, Volynska, Khmelnytska, Zhytomyrska, and Poltavska oblasts in order to gather initial trends on the number and geographic location of officially recorded internally displaced persons., This routine assessment supports the targeting and provision of humanitarian assistance to the affected population and serves as a preliminary source to identify oblasts and hromadas hosting high numbers of IDPs., IOM compiled information on more than 100 000 IDPs in the 18 oblasts covered by Round 6 of DTM Area Baseline Kyivska Dnipropetrovska and Lvivska oblasts have the highest number of displaced each hosting over 180 000 IDPs., Dniprovskyi Poltavskyi Vinnytskyi Bilotserkivskyi and Khmelnytskyi raions have reported the largest populations of IDPs, with over 65 000 per raion IDPs' most frequent oblasts of origin have been Donetska Kharkivska Luhanska and Kyivska., The data presented are sourced from official IDP data recorded by hromada officials, likely representing an undercount of those who were forced to flee their homes (see methodology note on page 5).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-area-baseline-report-round-6-5-july-2022
EU and FAO supported import of consignment of buckwheat seeds donated by Canada,News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Contributions",5 Jul 2022,"With the support of European Union and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Union “Millers of Ukraine” have successfully completed the delivery of buckwheat seeds from Canada to Ukraine. The project, realized under the auspices of the Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food of Ukraine, aims to overcome the shortage of buckwheat in the current year., In total, Government of Canada bought and transferred to Ukraine 140 tonnes of buckwheat seeds of Sobo variety from Manitoba province. Seeds have come a long way of 8 000 km to Ukraine: across Canada to Montreal port, and to the port of Bremerhaven in Germany where the seeds had been moved to the customs warehouse and reloaded into trucks to Ukraine., “As seeds are transferred in the form of humanitarian cargo, we have involved the Charitable Foundation ""Kvity"", which has the authority to receive humanitarian cargo. The costs for the movement of seeds were covered by Canada-Ukraine Foundation, Muehlenchemie GmbH, the USAID, EU and FAO,” said Rodion Rybchynskyi, Head of the Union “Millers of Ukraine”., The contributions from EU were done within FAO EU-funded project following the request from the Ministry, as two containers were stuck in the port in Germany. Totally, EUR 9 000 were transferred to cover an urgent budget deficit for seeds transportation., “We understood that cost increased and each day passed means additional costs at the port where the containers are stored.” said Christian Ben Hell, Head of Agriculture Sector at the EU Delegation to Ukraine. “In order to avoid further expenses and secure the distribution of these seeds in high demand in Ukraine, the European Union used part of the funds available under the contribution agreement between the EU and FAO”., “According to the FAO analysis, since the beginning of the war the price for seeds, plant protection agents, fertilizers and fuel increased 40–45percent. In the upcoming seasons, producers may determine that standing crops are not profitable to harvest,” added Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO Ukraine Country Office. “Understanding that, we focus our support on the small and medium-sized farmers. These buckwheat seeds are urgently needed to bolster local agricultural sector”., The actual distribution of seeds is undertaken by the “International Buckwheat Association”, Skvyra Grain Processing and the Union “Millers of Ukraine”. The seeds will be delivered to the farmers from Chernihivska, Kyivska, Lvivska, Poltavska, Ternopilska, Zakarpatska and Zhytomyrska oblasts., “Having received these buckwheat seeds we are able to support farmers to sow about 2,500 hectares in the west and center of Ukraine,” explained Rodion Rybchynskyi. “Taking into account the specialization, experience of farms and the quality of seeds, the yield from this area will be at least 2 tonnes per hectare, or 5 000 tonnes of buckwheat grain (3 000 tonnes of processed buckwheat groats)”., According to Rodion Rybchynskyi, the main condition for farmers’ participation in the seed distribution program is the further transfer of the harvest from the received seeds at a fixed price to specialized processors of buckwheat grain, such as Skvyrskiy and Bilotserkiv Combines of Bread Products. In their turn, grain producers have to transfer processed groats at a fixed price to state and social institutions for humanitarian purposes., Viktoriia Mykhalchuk, FAO Communications Specialist Viktoriia.Mykhalchuk@fao.org +380986055061",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-and-fao-supported-import-consignment-buckwheat-seeds-donated-canada

As part of the project, mobile teams made up of professionals are available to reach and support children with disabilities in remote areas., The response is part of UNICEF's Spilno programme aimed to strengthen efforts of government, local authorities, civil society, and business partners to provide multisectoral support to families with children affected by the war., The intervention is available in seven Ukrainian oblasts where the delivery of services is possible and where displaced families are concentrated: Volynska, Zakarpatska, Ivano-Frankivska, Lvivska, Rivnenska, Ternopilska, and Chernivetska., ""Even before the war, children with disabilities faced challenges in realizing their rights, including access to inclusive education and services. The situation has now been worsened by conflict, compounding vulnerability for children with disabilities. Our project aims to put children with disabilities – who often remain invisible – at the forefront of our response, and continue building a complex system where they would feel protected,"" says Serhii Shkarlet, the Minister of Education and Science., ""Quality and timely access to specialized assistance, including psychological support, was of critical importance even before the full-scale invasion of Russia. Now providing critical support for children with disabilities has became even more important. That is why we are doing everything we can to remove barriers to access to services,"" Minister of Health Viktor Lyashko claimed., “It was important for us to provide support for children with disabilities, and their families, as well as for host hromadas where the number of people has significantly increased due to internal displacement. Children and their families should be provided with access to quality services that will minimize the traumatic impact of the war. The war impacts children with disabilities as well as their families disproportionately. That is why they have to be the focus of the government and hromadas. At the same time, we have to ease the burden on the social security and social services infrastructure in hromadas."" adds Maryna Lazebna, the Minister of Social Policy., “The war in Ukraine poses a threat to childhood and the future of every child in Ukraine. For children with disabilities, the stakes are even higher. It is our responsibility to support children with disabilities and their families and ensure they can access the services and resources,” Murat Shahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine., The project unites different specialists to provide complex personal assistance for each child., Experts of the project will spread important information on how children with disabilities in the hosting hromadas can access services, and train social workers and other local professionals on how they can better support children with disabilities. Through this project, parents and caregivers will be provided with necessary specialist consultations and psychological support., Find more about the project and contact information within regions., Media contacts, Olha Pryshko

The environment is about people: it’s about livelihoods, public health, clean air and water, and basic food systems. It’s about a safe future for Ukrainians and their neighbours, and further damage must not be done.”, “Ukraine will then need huge international support to assess, mitigate and remediate the damage across the country, and alleviate risks to the wider region,” she added., As key donors, agencies and Member States meet in Lugano, Switzerland, this week to discuss Ukraine’s reconstruction, the United Nations’ top official in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, stressed that “restoring Ukraine’s environment must be up at the top of the agenda.”, “Millions of displaced Ukrainians need a safe and healthy environment to come home to if they are expected to be able to pick up their lives. As soon as the fighting ends, and it must end soon, a colossal clean-up operation must be supported,” said Lubrani, the UN’s Resident Coordinator in Ukraine., According to UNEP and partner data, the conflict has seen damage across many regions of the country, with incidents at nuclear power plants and facilities, energy infrastructure, including oil storage tankers, oil refineries, drilling platforms and gas facilities and distribution pipelines, mines and industrial sites and agro-processing facilities., The result has been multiple air pollution incidents and potentially serious contamination of ground and surface waters., Water infrastructure, including pumping stations, purification plants and sewage facilities, has also suffered significant damage, and multiple industrial facilities, warehouses and factories have been damaged, some storing a range of hazardous substances ranging from solvents to ammonia and plastics., Hazardous substances have also been released from explosions in agro-industrial storage facilities, including fertilizer and nitric acid plants. There are also reports of the targeting of several large livestock farms, where livestock carcasses pose a further public health risk., In many urban areas the clean-up of destroyed housing will bring its own challenges, with debris likely to be mixed with hazardous materials, particularly asbestos. Satellite imagery has also shown a significant increase of fires in various nature reserves and protected areas, as well as forested areas., Furthermore, pollution from the extensive use of weapons including in populated areas and the large volumes of military waste, including destroyed military vehicles, creates a major clean-up challenge., NOTES TO EDITORS, About the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

The IAEA worked with the operator to fix the problem and the transfer of data resumed on 1 July and has continued over the weekend, the Director General said. The previous time, the connection was lost for nearly two weeks, from 30 May until 12 June., The IAEA has not been able to visit the ZNPP since before the current military conflict in Ukraine. Russian forces took control of the plant four months ago, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate it. Director General Grossi has repeatedly expressed deep concern about the extremely difficult situation for Ukrainian workers at the plant., The IAEA is continuing to receive remotely transmitted safeguards data from Ukraine’s three other operational nuclear power plants (NPPs). However, the IAEA is still experiencing a partial loss of safeguards data transfer from the Chornobyl NPP., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that eight of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP.

ICM, a prominent organization that represents, supports, advocates for, and educates midwives around the world, will distribute the funding to its member midwives’ associations serving Ukrainian refugee women and their families., Approximately 90% of the more than 6.5 million people who have fled Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s invasion are women and children. ICM estimates that approximately nine percent of refugee women are pregnant. Refugee women are at increased risk of sexual violence, unwanted pregnancies, exposure to sexually transmitted disease, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and a lack of maternity care, according to ICM., By conducting a needs assessment of midwives’ associations throughout the region, ICM determined that women and children fleeing the conflict in Ukraine are in particular need of maternal health care, mental health care, hygiene items such as diapers and menstrual care products, and accommodation, among other needs., “When these events occur, ICM takes immediate action to connect with its midwives’ associations in the impacted region(s) and collect on-the-ground perspectives to understand the specific needs of its members, and the challenges facing midwives in upholding quality care for women and newborns,” explained ICM’s Chief Executive, Dr. Sally Pairman., The Direct Relief grant is designed to address these needs, supporting midwives’ associations in Europe as they care for Ukrainian refugee women and their families; procure and distribute supplies such as food, hygiene products, and bus and train tickets to women and children; place families in accommodation; and provide other vital services., “Women and children are disproportionately affected by humanitarian conflict, and in this particular situation, when they form the vast majority of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, understanding and meeting their needs is essential,” said Thomas Tighe, President and CEO of Direct Relief. “The International Confederation of Midwives, with its on-the-ground connections to the midwives’ associations providing maternal and child health care every day, is uniquely positioned to develop a thorough understanding of the situation that refugee individuals and families are facing, and to develop and support strategic approaches to meeting those needs.”, In particular, ICM has designed a rapid response grant process through which midwives’ associations can request funds to support their work caring for Ukrainian refugees. Already, a number of midwives’ associations have requested funds for translators, mental health providers, and other professionals; supplies such as hygiene and sanitary products, bedding, and clothing; and funding for transportation fees., “Through this new partnership with Direct Relief, we will be able to move from advocacy to action by directly funding the efforts of ICM midwives’ associations to effectively respond to humanitarian emergencies,” Dr. Pairman said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/meeting-needs-ukrainian-women-and-children-through-new-grant

"In Ukraine, recovery can’t wait: Clearing landmines and rubble makes it safer for displaced families to come home",News and Press Release,UNDP,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",1 Jul 2022,"“It is still terrifying to bring kids here.”, Olexander Krushynskii lives in Bucha in Kyiv Oblast, 25 kilometres west of the capital. The terrifying place he speaks of is a children’s play area. “We have no idea what the situation at the playgrounds is. There are many more locations where shells and mines are being found.”, Following the withdrawal of Russian forces, many residents who had fled the fighting are coming home to cities and towns like Bucha, eager to resume their normal lives. One of the major obstacles they face is the unknown number of landmines, cluster munitions and other explosive ordnance left behind in the war. Clearing away these explosive remnants of war – along with the mountains of rubble left by the fighting – is a critical step in the early recovery process., “The challenge we are facing now is the demining of the surrounding forests and fields,” says Taras Dumenko, head of the administration in Hostomel village. “Also, the removal of debris, restoration of the residential infrastructure and of residential buildings.”, Local authorities estimate that around 1,800 buildings were destroyed. “We are facing enormous hardship right now, because Hostomel is 50 percent destroyed,” resident Oleksandr Nevychenko says. “The community where I live is 90 percent destroyed.”, About 25 percent of Ukraine’s territory – roughly 160,000 square kilometres – has been affected by the war. The cost to Ukraine’s economy from damage and destruction of residential and non-residential buildings and infrastructure is thought to be over US$100 billion., As previously occupied areas become accessible, UNDP teams are finding thousands of explosive devices left behind, posing immediate danger for civilians. A UN Flash Appeal for Ukraine estimates that 14.5 million people are living in areas contaminated with explosive ordnance., “The priority is to enable the safe return of civilians,” says Oleksandr Sushchenko, Team Leader for Energy and Environment with UNDP Ukraine, who works on a demining and debris removal project focusing on towns around Kyiv., The State Emergency Services of Ukraine is a critical player in making streets, forests and playgrounds safe for civilians. Since March 2022, the SES have cleared close to 150,000 items of explosive ordnance left over from the conflict., “The Emergency Service is creating 80 new demining units [approximately 400 staff], but there are problems with equipping these units,” says Yevhen Kyrychenko, a representative of the SES. “One such unit should have at least two pieces of equipment and protective clothing for the staff and the engineering equipment for demining. We also really need specialized engineering equipment for the removal of construction debris.”, Even as the war continues, UNDP is working closely with the Government to put in place the foundations for recovery and reconstruction, because recovery and resilience building can’t wait until the fighting stops. These early actions are critical for preserving the country’s hard-won development gains as much as possible., A big part of the equation is making it safe for some of the almost 12 million people who have been forced from their homes – approximately 6.3 million are internally displaced, while more than 5 million are refugees outside Ukraine’s borders – to come home again. Spontaneous homecomings have started, with 5.5 million Ukrainians returning from other regions of Ukraine and abroad., Mapping and removing explosive devices is a top priority, as is clearing debris from destroyed buildings and infrastructure and addressing the large number of damaged and unstable structures at risk of uncontrolled collapse. In Irpin, a town north of Kyiv, UNDP teams have assessed 410,000 tonnes of rubble requiring removal. Roads must be cleared and some buildings demolished to make areas safe for reconstruction and to open access routes for humanitarian assistance., Comprehensive area-based recovery planning is critical to create a safe environment for those wishing to come home, UNDP’s acting Resident Representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, said during a visit to Hostomel. “It’s important that we listen to people’s needs, we prioritize and plan with government authorities, with civil society, and all active stakeholders and we connect to the national recovery and development plan that the government is putting in place,” she said., Like the recovery work itself, Hostomel resident Nadiya Dovhopola can’t wait. “I hope our city will recover as soon as possible, and the school rebuilt quickly,” she says., Demining and debris clearance must respond to this sense of urgency, yet it cannot ignore sustainability concerns. Removed rubble is sorted, processed and screened for contaminants. When safe, it can be reused for quick repairs and green reconstruction, cutting costs and reducing the strain on natural resources. The process also injects money back into the economy and helps to build back the cities better and greener than before., “I see the future of our community,” Hostomel administration head Taras Dumenko says. “It will be a blooming suburb of Kyiv, an example not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world. It will rise like a Phoenix from the ashes, and shine with new colours.”, Footnotes, UNDP is the lead UN agency for mine action in Ukraine and has been supporting demining work in the country since 2016. Our work on mine action coordination, emergency explosive ordnance clearance and debris removal is made possible by contributions from the Governments of Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-recovery-cant-wait-clearing-landmines-and-rubble-makes-it-safer-displaced-families-come-home

Today alone, 18 people, including children, were reportedly killed and others injured in missile attacks on an apartment building and a resort in Odesa, southern Ukraine., These deaths and injuries are a grave reminder that children are bearing the brunt of this conflict. The impact of explosive weapons on children is devastating, robbing families of their hopes and profoundly altering the direction of a child’s life. For the children injured in these incidents, their suffering may last for years. Other children may have witnessed their peers or loved ones lose their lives. The widespread and unpredictable nature of this conflict could leave children struggling with their mental health., Even before this week of violence, at least 330 children have been killed and almost 500 injured since the escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine on 24 February. These numbers are likely an underestimate., Save the Children Ukraine Country Director Pete Walsh, said:, “Attacks on civilian infrastructure, including homes where children are sleeping in the middle of the night, are beyond condemnable. This war shows no sign of easing – instead it is spiraling out of control., “Save the Children condemns these attacks in the strongest possible terms and calls for the respect of international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure from attack.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to get access to the services they need. With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, baby and hygiene kits to displaced families. It is on the ground, distributing essential household kits to families affected by the conflict., Notes:, The UN has reported that two children were killed and four injured in attacks in Odesa today.

More than 8.4 million refugee movements out of Ukraine have been recorded since 24 February, while more than 3 million movements back into the country have been recorded since 28 February., Inside Ukraine, many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including for food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access in areas where intense fighting is ongoing. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with lifesaving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-19-1-july-2022
Ukraine Crisis: Week of 18-24 June 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jul 2022,"By Olha Polishchuk and Ciro Murillo, In the Luhansk region, heavy clashes continued in Severodonetsk until 24 June, when the Ukrainian government ordered a full withdrawal from the city (BBC News, 24 June 2022). Following the withdrawal, Russian forces began to push towards Lysychansk, the last large city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian control (NV, 23 June 2022). Russian troops also continued unsuccessful offensive operations in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions aimed at surrounding the Ukrainian forces in Lysychansk (ISW, 24 June 2022)., In the Black Sea, Ukrainian forces struck Russian positions on Zmiinyi Island (Snake Island), inflicting losses (Ukrinform, 22 June 2022). In response to Ukrainian strikes, Russian forces reportedly deployed additional air defense and rocket group units, as well as special forces, to the island (ISW, 23 June 2022). Ukrainian forces also shelled drilling rigs in the Black Sea that had been seized by Russia during the occupation of Crimea in 2014, causing fires. Ukraine claims Russia has been using the rigs for surveillance (New York Times, 22 June 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-18-24-june-2022

There are serious concerns for the thousands of civilians, both in Government-controlled and non-Government-controlled areas (GCA and NGCA), trapped or otherwise directly impacted by the hostilities. The number of verified civilian casualties since the start of the war surpassed 10,000 this week and is only growing., The situation in the GCA of Luhanska oblast remains extremely alarming, including with thousands of civilians still sheltering in the administrative centre of Sievierodonetsk and hundreds more at the Azot chemical plant there. The situation is similar in the city of Lysychansk, where airstrikes, missile strikes, and shelling were reported throughout the week, along with civilian casualties. Similarly, reports were also received of intense and constant shelling leading to a large number of civilian casualties in both GCA and NGCA of Donetska oblast. Still in the east, daily reports on missile attacks and shelling in and around Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast) continue. And in other parts of Ukraine, hostilities continue in the south, especially in Khersonska oblast, while air attacks and shelling were also reported neighbouring Mykolaivska and Odeska oblasts and in Sumska oblast in the north.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-29-jun-2022-enruuk

Republic of Korea contributes $3 million to strengthen Ukraine’s resilience [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",1 Jul 2022,"Flexible funds to supplement UNDP’s integrated area-based and multidimensional Resilience Building and Recovery Programme for Ukraine, Kyiv, 30 June 2022 --- The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) announced this week a new partnership to support the Government of Ukraine in its efforts to respond to the ongoing war. With this announcement the ROK will underpin emergency livelihoods and community recovery in Ukraine with a flexible contribution of $3 million, which will allow UNDP to adapt its operations to reach those most in need and enhance the response to the ongoing war., The war in Ukraine has already resulted in significant loss of life, unprecedented displacement, and devastating destruction of infrastructure. Early UNDP projections suggest that up to 90 percent of the population of Ukraine could be facing poverty and vulnerability to poverty by the end of 2022. Eighteen years of socio-economic achievements are at risk of being lost., Manal Fouani, UNDP's acting Resident Representative in Ukraine, reiterated that the ROK's investment in the humanitarian development nexus action for Ukraine comes at a critical time for continuing to strengthen the Ukrainian government's ability to serve its people while planning for recovery. ""The complex humanitarian, development, and peace challenges now emerging in Ukraine underscore the importance of programming that responds to the multiple dimensions of the war,"" she said. ""The ROK strategic investment in further enhancing a decentralized approach for crisis coordination capacities, restoring basic infrastructure, and keeping Ukrainian businesses of all sizes up and running is just a demonstration of how investment in institutions and services can reduce the impact of a humanitarian catastrophe."", To ensure resilience interventions have the maximum impact, leaving no one behind, the project will focus on the following four areas:, ""We are pleased to join other donor countries in supporting this important UNDP initiative to strengthen the Government's resilience to respond to the needs of its people, while also helping it plan for rebuilding and recovery,"" said Kim Hyung Tae, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine., This project is part of the UNDP's integral response to the UN system-wide Flash Appeal launched on 1 March 2022 and revised in April 2022 to support immediate efforts to protect and assist those most affected in Ukraine. The initiative also falls under the UNDP Resilience Building and Recovery Programme for Ukraine, supported by a number of development partners including the European Union, the European Investment Bank, the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., Background, UNDP has been supporting the people and Government of Ukraine for almost 30 years. The Resilience Building and Recovery Programme for Ukraine is grounded in working in partnership with sister UN entities and other international development partners. Immediately after the war started in February 2022, UNDP fully integrated within the humanitarian response architecture, including the Humanitarian Flash Appeal and the Regional Refugee Response Plan. With this programme, UNDP is joining up with its sister humanitarian and development agencies and development partners to support and invest in the resilience of the Government, private sector, and civil society in Ukraine to help ensure no one is left behind in the rubble of war., For more information, Contact: Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine, yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/republic-korea-contributes-3-million-strengthen-ukraines-resilience-enuk
Ukraine – An opportunity for the Grand Bargain signatories to translate their commitments to local leadership of crisis response into practice [EN/UK],News and Press Release,CAFOD,"Coordination
Humanitarian Financing",1 Jul 2022,"On 30th June to 1st July, the heads of donor humanitarian departments, UN agencies and NGOs meet in Geneva to take stock of progress on Grand Bargain commitments to reform the humanitarian system. One of the priority commitments adopted under the Grand Bargain was to support national and local leadership of crisis response, and to ensure that humanitarian response is “as local as possible, as international as necessary.” The under-signed organisations are actively involved in the humanitarian response in Ukraine., We see how the international community – donors, UN agencies and NGOs – is struggling to act on these commitments in Ukraine. It is likely that many participants at the Grand Bargain meeting will acknowledge this, and we appreciate that. But looking forward, local actors do not want rhetorical statements or acknowledgement of their role, they want practical and ambitious action to support what they are doing. For this reason, we highlight the following very practical steps that we expect in support of local humanitarian action in Ukraine by Grand Bargain signatories, and we hope you will use your meeting to send a strong signal of support for these:, Donor, UN and INGO strategic frameworks and plans for the Ukraine response should outline specific objectives, time-bound milestones and metrics to promote accountability for support to local leadership. The previous UN Flash Appeal made reference to engagement with national and local actors, but more specifics are needed in the next UN strategic plan framework. This should outline specific metrics on priorities that local actors have been raising; including on provision of flexible, longer term funding, consistent support for overheads, and scale-up of longer-term accompaniment and mentoring approaches to capacity strengthening., The UN Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) should adopt clear and more ambitious targets for percentages going directly to local actors, and this percentage should increase over time (eg towards 70% within 12 months). The UHF should also adopt new guidance requiring that local partners get fair overheads support even when they act as sub-implementing partners to an international agency, rather than leaving this to the discretion of the intermediary agency. The model of the NGO Twinning Programme in Afghanistan could be adapted to support a more deliberate approach to enabling a wider range of national NGOs to shift from being sub-grantees to leading on directly accessing funding from the UHF. Additional pooled funds or consortia should also be supported to get small grants to diverse local actors, who do not have the scale of operations or systems in place to pass UHF selection processes., Donors should establish clear expectations with UN agencies and INGO grantees that require these agencies to articulate a clear approach to reinforcing, complementing and supporting – rather than undermining – national and local actors’ roles. One key aspect of this is that international agencies implement a clear and joined-up approach to partnership and capacity strengthening aimed at fostering local leadership of the response. Donors should hold international agencies accountable for demonstrable outcomes in terms of strengthened local leadership; such as on supporting local NGOs to transition from being sub-grantees to lead grantees on funding from the UN and other donors., Donors and international agencies should adopt a ‘no regrets’ and enabling approach to support for smaller national NGOs, local organisations and voluntary networks. This has to involve adopting a proportionate approach to due diligence and compliance so that funds can reach smaller and informal groups and networks leading aid efforts. Due diligence passporting by some agencies should be scaled-up and harmonised across the response so that local organisations are not required to complete multiple duplicatory or inconsistent due diligence processes all addressing fundamentally the same questions. This should be packaged with sustained support for capacity-sharing; recognizing and building on the leadership, expertise and creative ways of working that local actors have brought to the response; whilst investing in capacity strengthening (including through local-to-local capacity-sharing) on identified areas of improvement needed for effective and accountable delivery of humanitarian aid., Donors and international agencies should take into account local legislation on tax and charitable work, and factor this into their budgeting and liaison with Ukrainian authorities. National legislation requires taxes to be paid on assistance beyond a certain level and on reimbursement of volunteer expenses, as well as documentation of charitable work, which can represent a challenge in areas under occupation. A common approach by donors and international agencies to resourcing the costs involved and problem solving any issues arising with national authorities would be helpful., All international agencies and clusters should endorse and act on the Ethical Recruitment Guidelines, which have been tabled at the HCT. Poor practice has been observed and mentioned in coordination meetings across Ukraine. Examples such as one international agency attempting to recruit the staff of local NGOs that were engaged in initial life saving work in Irpin and Bucha demonstrate the extent of the problem. The Ethical Recruitment Guidelines aim to stop the worst kinds of 'cowboy' practices of poaching of local organisations’ staff. Donors should systematically hold international agencies accountable for this, and funding should be conditional on adhering to the Guidelines., Donors and international agencies should encourage and build on existing cooperation between government and civil society at the local level to ensure effective needs-based programming and capacitystrengthening in the response. Prior to the invasion, the Ukrainian government had initiated a process of decentralisation, and various processes were underway, including national NGOs experienced in social and public services at the local level supporting local government authorities on training of their staff. Donors and the international humanitarian community should look to foster government-civil society cooperation in support of solutions that will strengthen government systems at national and local levels, rather than establish parallel systems. This will simplify coordination, enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian needs’ assessment and the implementation of programs, while strengthening the overall system’s capacity to respond to what is likely to become a long term crisis., Donors and international agencies should ensure that localisation efforts across funding and coordination engage with diverse local actors; including organisations supporting marginalised groups, given the critical role they play in reaching those living under most vulnerable conditions and in ensuring the critical gender, age, language, and disability dimensions of this crisis as well as specific needs are addressed., Donors and international agencies should ensure systematic use of local languages and a focus on inclusion in humanitarian coordination, especially at the local level. Use of local languages in coordination made important differences in terms of local staff being able to engage meaningfully in the east after 2018. Yet, there is no consistent use of local languages in cluster meetings and documents in the current response, limiting the ability of local actors to truly influence decisions., SIGNATIROIES, Благодійна організація “Мережа 100 відсотків життя Рівне” / Charitable Organization “Network 100 Percent Life Rivne”, Благодійна організація “Фонд громади Березані” / Charitable Organization “Berezan Community Fond” HPLGBT, Громадська організація “Чарівні Руни” / NGO “Charivni Runy”, Громадська організація “Спадщина!” / NGO “Spadshchyna!”, Громадська спілка “ЕА Екосистема” / Public Union ""Ecological Association Ecosystema”, Благодійна організація ""Фонд громади міста Олешки ім.

Donors should systematically hold international agencies accountable for this, and funding should be conditional on adhering to the Guidelines., Donors and international agencies should encourage and build on existing cooperation between government and civil society at the local level to ensure effective needs-based programming and capacitystrengthening in the response. Prior to the invasion, the Ukrainian government had initiated a process of decentralisation, and various processes were underway, including national NGOs experienced in social and public services at the local level supporting local government authorities on training of their staff. Donors and the international humanitarian community should look to foster government-civil society cooperation in support of solutions that will strengthen government systems at national and local levels, rather than establish parallel systems. This will simplify coordination, enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian needs’ assessment and the implementation of programs, while strengthening the overall system’s capacity to respond to what is likely to become a long term crisis., Donors and international agencies should ensure that localisation efforts across funding and coordination engage with diverse local actors; including organisations supporting marginalised groups, given the critical role they play in reaching those living under most vulnerable conditions and in ensuring the critical gender, age, language, and disability dimensions of this crisis as well as specific needs are addressed., Donors and international agencies should ensure systematic use of local languages and a focus on inclusion in humanitarian coordination, especially at the local level. Use of local languages in coordination made important differences in terms of local staff being able to engage meaningfully in the east after 2018. Yet, there is no consistent use of local languages in cluster meetings and documents in the current response, limiting the ability of local actors to truly influence decisions., SIGNATIROIES, Благодійна організація “Мережа 100 відсотків життя Рівне” / Charitable Organization “Network 100 Percent Life Rivne”, Благодійна організація “Фонд громади Березані” / Charitable Organization “Berezan Community Fond” HPLGBT, Громадська організація “Чарівні Руни” / NGO “Charivni Runy”, Громадська організація “Спадщина!” / NGO “Spadshchyna!”, Громадська спілка “ЕА Екосистема” / Public Union ""Ecological Association Ecosystema”, Благодійна організація ""Фонд громади міста Олешки ім.

Ukraine Humanitarian Fund Annual Report 2021,Other,OCHA,"Contributions
Humanitarian Financing",30 Jun 2022,"Humanitarian situation in 2021
After seven years of armed conflict, humanitarian needs remained critical on both sides of the “contact line” – the 427km-long stretch of land dividing eastern Ukraine into Government- and non-Government-controlled areas (GCA and NGCA). The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated people’s needs and led to the introduction of severe restrictions on movement, decreasing livelihood opportunities, and pushing the already fragile health system to a breaking point. While the GCA significantly eased movement restrictions during the second half of 2021, requirements for crossing the “contact line” applied in NGCA continued to prevent people from enjoying greater freedom of movement and pose obstacles to accessing basic services, and social benefits and entitlements in GCA. Of the 2.9 million people estimated to be in need, 1.1 million people lived in the GCA of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, including over 133,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), while over 1.6 million people resided in NGCA. In addition, 160,000 IDPs resided in other oblasts across Ukraine., Among the most affected were older people living in NGCA, who used to cross to GCA regularly to access pensions. Ukraine continued to be one of the “oldest” humanitarian crises globally, with one in three people in need of humanitarian assistance aged over 60. In the meantime, humanitarian access remained seriously constrained, undermining the provision of principled humanitarian assistance, while the humanitarian crisis continued to be at risk of further politicization., Additional challenges in times of COVID-19
The COVID-19 crisis had devastating effects on Ukraine, pushing the country to its limits. In November 2021, Ukraine experienced its worst wave of the pandemic to date, with a spike in cases and deaths. In mid-November 2021, the number of COVID-19 infections in Ukraine surpassed 3 million, and by the end of the month, over 85,000 deaths had been recorded, yielding a fatality rate of 2.3 per cent. In the conflict-affected areas, the pandemic has driven an already fragile health system to a breaking point. In November 2021, the occupancy rate of oxygen-supplied and intensive care unit beds stood at almost 71 per cent for Donetska oblast and 66 per cent for Luhanska oblast (GCA), representing the highest occupancy rates nationwide, with 208,000 infections recorded. The situation in NGCA was reportedly worse, with hospitals reporting to have exceeded their capacity with a case fatality rate estimated at 9 per cent., Economic context
As in many other countries, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ukraine’s economic growth have been significant. The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported a decline of 4 per cent in real GDP in 2020.
In conflict-affected oblasts, the unemployment rates have consistently been the highest nationwide since 2015, with 15.7 per cent in Donetska oblast (GCA) and 16.6 per cent in Luhanska oblast (GCA), compared with a national average of 10.3 per cent by the second quarter of 2021. Rural households in the areas close to the “contact line” were hard hit by the difficult economic conditions, with 24 per cent reporting spending their savings, compared with 16 per cent for the combined rural and urban areas in Donetska and Luhanska oblast (GCA)., Geopolitical situation
The prevailing absence of a political solution continued to bring uncertainty to the future of millions of people on both sides of the “contact line.” The ‘Normandy Format’, including France, Germany, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, did not meet throughout 2021, with elections in Germany and the Russian Federation bringing further uncertainty over the future of the negotiation process. Prior to the State Duma elections held in September 2021, the Russian Federation expedited the issuance of the Russian Federation passports to residents of NGCA. Some former NGCA leaders ran in the elections, successfully becoming members of the Parliament of the Russian Federation. Most of the actions agreed by the ‘Normandy Format’ during their Paris Summit (9 December 2019) have remained pending, with the opening of new entry/exit crossing points (EECPs) along the “contact line” for civilian crossing, new areas of disengagement, de-mining, and the Minsk Agreement’s political provisions still under negotiation as of the end of the year., Existing legal and policy frameworks
The Government implemented decentralization reforms in January 2021, resulting in a reconfiguration of administrative boundaries. The empowerment of the hromradas² administrative units at the community level through the decentralization of power, resources and responsibility has been viewed as a welcome development and an opportunity to strengthen communities and local development. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, responsibilities for public services and administrative functions were transferred from the raion level to local authorities at the hromada level and to the 19 Civil-Military Administrations (CMAs) along the “contact line.” Of the 103 hromradas in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, 72 are in GCA. The decentralization process risked disrupting essential services in GCA during its transitional phase, with concerns over long-term prospects. Once past its current transitional stage, it is hoped to enable a solid functionality of new local governance structures and enhanced service provision at the local level., A new whole-of-Government IDP integration strategy for 2021 through 2024 was adopted on 28 October 2021, when the Cabinet of Ministers issued Decree No. 1364-p, adopting the “IDP Integration and Medium-Term Solutions Strategy until 2024 and the Operational Plan (2021-2023)”.³ The Strategy is centered around six strategic aims, which outline challenges, key tasks and implementation indicators. All interventions shall flow from the policy, as opposed to the previous system of ad hoc responses. The focus of IDP integration will lie in medium-term solutions aimed at solving challenges in IDP housing, employment, social protection, access to education, health care, documentation and IDP participation in local decision-making., Security environment
The security situation declined throughout 2021, with a steady increase in the number of ceasefire violations despite the endorsement of the July 2020 strengthened ceasefire agreement. By late 2021, the number of civilian casualties had returned to pre-ceasefire levels, coupled with a general increase in tensions along the “contact line” and along Ukrainian borders. The number of ceasefire violations in the conflict-affected areas increased by nearly 370 per cent, resulting in increased civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure., Ukraine remained one of the world’s most landmine/ explosive remnants of war (ERW) contaminated countries, putting people’s lives at risk and impeding recovery, access to livelihoods and basic services. Ukraine ranked fourth after Afghanistan, Mali and Yemen in mine/ERW casualties in 2020. Civilian infrastructure continued to be affected by the conflict in 2021, with damage to water and gas facilities, as well as to schools. In 2021, schools were attacked at least 12 times, which is a disturbing reminder of the effect of the conflict on children. Water infrastructure was less frequently damaged than in previous years, yet disruptions in the water supply have continued to affect hundreds of thousands of people.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2021

During the past four months, Ukraine has been the epicentre of the world’s attention. And not for good reasons. Since the start of Russia’s war on Ukraine, the lives of every single woman, man and especially child in this country have been torn apart: their loved ones have been killed, injured and traumatized, their families separated, and thousands of homes have been bombed. The level of human suffering cannot be explained with words. But maybe the numbers will give a better idea:, Almost 16 million people in Ukraine need, today, humanitarian assistance—water, food, health services, a roof over their heads, protection. And these are conservative numbers that the United Nations is revising now, together with our humanitarian partners., More than 6 million people are still internally displaced. Some 5 million managed to return, but many know they might be forced to flee again., More than 5.3 million became refugees in other countries, a situation which I am sure most of them had never even imagined they would face., And what is even worse: how many lives have been taken since this war started? My colleague Matilda from the UN Human Rights monitoring mission here in Ukraine can give you more details. But we do know that the number we have of almost 5,000 civilians killed and more than 5,000 injured is just a fraction of the frightening reality., And this is not to mention the numbers—that are also not accurate because we could not verify all reports received—of hospitals, schools, and homes damaged., But this is probably not new information for the people of Ukraine who are hearing me today., It is not new for the mother of a 4-month-old baby I met when supporting the evacuations from Mariupol and Azovstal, who told me how she survived for months without seeing the sunlight, how she struggled to feed herself, how she and others had not enough clean water to drink., This is not new for the people of Donetsk, who over the past month, especially, have seen day after day their city being bombarded, their schools and hospitals destroyed and having to spend hours hiding. They know what it is to live without piped water, which they can only have a couple of hours per day, some three times per week., It is not new for the people of Kherson, mainly those who are desperate to leave the city, to find safety somewhere else but have been repeatedly prevented from doing so. Many even lost their lives while risking taking the journey towards the west of Ukraine. It is not new for people in almost the entire Luhanska oblast, not only Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, where we have all seen the images of destruction caused by the clashes between the parties to this horrendous conflict., I am not from here… but my heart breaks when I see this destruction, this suffering. When I was in Mariupol in May, I could not believe what came in front on my eyes. I remember how the city was when I visited it many times before and my heart broke again. I felt the same in Kharkiv, or areas close here to Kyiv, as Bucha, Irpin and others. And I stressed that I am not from here because I cannot even start to imagine how painful it is for many of you to see your houses, your cities destroyed., We are making every effort to support the people whose lives have been torn apart because of this war. But the Russian Federation, and the Ukrainian Government, they have to do more to protect the people of this country and to make our work possible., Since 24 February, the UN and humanitarian partners have provided life-saving assistance to nearly 9 million people in every single region of Ukraine. Nearly 2 million have received cash assistance, and are able to make their own choices to meet their basic needs. And my colleagues here can give you more details on the assistance provided., We are more than 300 organizations working in the response here, almost 200 of them national NGOs.
And this is in complementarity to the incredible work that thousands and thousands of volunteers are doing here in the country to support people. Ukrainians are the first responders and they are truly supporting one another. I also have to say thanks to the private sector and local organizations that have both supported our work or directly provided assistance where it was needed., But what I wanted to highlight is what we have not been able to do, because of insecurity, because of impediments imposed on us that have prevented the UN and NGOs from doing more.
We could not deliver relief supplies or access Kherson. We could not deliver relief supplies or access Mariupol., We could not support any sort of assistance, have not even managed to have the parties agree on safe passage of civilians from Sievierodonetsk so they could move in the direction of their choice.
Access to non-Government-controlled areas is extremely difficult, to not say impossible., The parties to this conflict are blatantly ignoring their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law., The parties bear the responsibility for every violation under international humanitarian and human rights law. So, to conclude, I call on the parties to comply with their obligations, and protect civilians that have already suffered immensely because of the war, to protect civilian infrastructure that is vital for the people of this country, to decisively and urgently facilitate safe and unimpeded access for humanitarians to all regions, cities, towns, villages, where people need assistance, and to allow civilians to leave these areas if they want to.

Ukraine: Agrarian sector in proximity to conflict - 24 Feb. to 30 May 2022: Risk to vegetables production,Map,IMPACT Initiatives,Agriculture,30 May 2022,"Ukraine is one of the top three producers of fruits and vegetables in Eastern Europe In the 2020-2021 market year, vegetables accounted for 72.5% of Ukrainian agricultural exports to Europe. Ukrainian vegetable exports make up 0.5% of the world market. Ukraine exports vegetables to 96 countries. Export of vegetables from Ukraine was carried out by 400 exporters in the world market. Due to the escalation of the conflict, logistics and trade infrastructure have been disrupted, which complicates the export of vegetables. In 2020, Ukraine ranked 19th globally among top legume exporters, and was in the top 5 of exporters for tomatoes, onions, frozen, dried and boiled, fresh and chilled vegetables. In 2021, the sowing area of vegetables was 1.7 million hectares., The gross harvest of vegetables was 231.7 million tons, with the following average yields: potatoes - 16.6 tons/hectare, open field vegetables - 20.8 tons/ hectare, and melons - 8.1 tons/ hectare. In 2021, potatoes made up 38.5% of land cultivated with vegetables in Ukraine. The largest harvest areas for potatoes were in Vinnytska, Zhytomyrska and Lvivska oblasts (23% of total potato harvest zones). The oblasts with the largest harvest areas for open field vegetables were Lvivska, Khersonska, Dnipropetrovska, Kyivska and Kharkivska oblasts (40.6%). There was military action in all of these areas except the Lvivska oblast. Khersonska oblast hosted 37% of the overall national harvest area for melons (Figure 1).",https://reliefweb.int/map/ukraine/ukraine-agrarian-sector-proximity-conflict-24-feb-30-may-2022-risk-vegetables-production
"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (18 - 24 June 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,30 Jun 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, Ukrainian forces withdrew from Severodonetsk as the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued. Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine continued to be reported in several countries, while demonstrations in support of European Union (EU) integration broke out in Georgia as the EU granted candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova. LGBT+ Pride marches continued across Europe against the backdrop of several violent events targeting members of LGBT+ communities. In Germany, unknown assailants set fire to police vehicles ahead of the G7 Summit in Bavaria from 26 to 28 June. Meanwhile, fighting continued along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued last week. In the Luhansk region, heavy clashes continued in Severodonetsk until 24 June, when Ukrainian forces were ordered to withdraw from the city (BBC News, 24 June 2022). Following the occupation of Severodonetsk, Russian forces began their assault in the direction of Lysychansk, the last large city in the Luhansk region under Ukrainian control (NV, 23 June 2022). Russian troops also continued unsuccessful offensive operations north of Slovyansk in the Donetsk region and south and west of Izium in the Kharkiv region in order to surround the Ukrainian forces in Lysychansk (ISW, 24 June 2022)., In the Black Sea, Ukrainian forces struck Russian positions on Zmiinyi Island (Snake Island), inflicting losses on the Russian side (Ukrinform, 22 June 2022). In response to Ukrainian strikes, Russia reportedly deployed additional air defense and rocket group units, as well as special forces to the island (ISW, 23 June 2022). Ukrainian forces also shelled drilling rigs in the Black Sea, seized by Russia during the occupation of Crimea in 2014, causing fires on the rigs. Ukraine claims that Russia has been using the rigs not only for drilling but also for surveillance (New York Times, 22 June 2022)., Suspected local partisan groups attacked Russian soldiers and occupation authorities in the occupied Kherson region last week. Around 20 June, a group of suspected partisans fired assault rifles in a cafe in Kherson, killing two Russian soldiers and injuring another (Unian, 20 June 2022). Unidentified groups also blew up several cars belonging to Russia-appointed officials in Kherson and Chornobaivka, killing one official and injuring two others., Meanwhile, Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure across Ukraine last week. Over 50 civilians were killed in Russian shelling, missile attacks, and airstrikes in the eastern, central, and southern regions of the country.1 This violence contributed to the 26% increase in violence in Ukraine last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month.2, In Russia, the Bryansk and Kursk regional governors reported the cross-border shelling of villages close to the Russian-Ukrainian border last week (Novaya Gazeta, 20 June 2022; Rosbalt, 19 June 2022). The governor of the Rostov region also claimed that an oil refinery plant was hit by two Ukrainian drones (Meduza, 22 June 2022). Russian border villages have occasionally come under fire since mid-March, with some incidents confirmed as accidental shelling by Russian forces. Ukraine has denied targeting Russian territory (Ukrinform, 14 June 2022)., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine and against the war took place in Germany, Italy, Malta, Poland, and Sweden last week., On 23 June, the EU granted Ukraine and Moldova candidate status, the next step towards EU membership, after EU integration talks were expedited following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (DW, 23 June 2022). The promotion of Ukraine and Moldova to EU candidate states sparked demonstrations in Georgia in support of the country's EU integration. Tens of thousands of people rallied in Tbilisi on 20 and 24 June, demanding EU candidate status for Georgia, which also suffered from Russian military aggression in 2008 (RFE/RL, 24 June 2022). Smaller demonstrations were organized across the country, with some demonstrators also expressing anti-government sentiments., Several attacks targeting members of the LGBT+ community were reported in the region last week amid the ongoing commemoration of LGBT+ Pride Month. In Norway, a man opened fire outside an LGBT+ venue in central Oslo, killing two people and wounding 21 others before being detained by police (Aftenposten, 25 June 2022). In a press statement, Norway's intelligence service said that the suspected shooter was known to the police as a potentially radicalized Islamist, though the degree of ideological motivation in the shooting is yet to be confirmed (NRK, 25 June 2022). Oslo's Pride parade, which was planned for the same day, was called off following the attack (NPR, 25 June 2022). In Italy, on 23 June, unidentified individuals set several kiosks at a swimming pool complex on fire in Misano Adriatico in Rimini province. The owner, a prominent member of the local LGBT+ community, claims it was a homophobic attack. The venue had recently displayed pride symbols and is a popular weekend venue for the LGBT+ community (Rimini Today, 23 June 2022; Rimini Today, 23 June 2022). In Germany, on 21 June, two members of the LGBT+ community were beaten, kicked to the ground, and had their pride flag torn as they returned from Christopher Street Day celebrations in Augsburg (Merkur, 24 June 2022)., Meanwhile, LGBT+ Pride parades were held in Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Moldova, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland last week. In Italy, participants took to the streets across the country to denounce discrimination against LGBT+ people after a transgender former teacher committed suicide due to alleged transphobia at work (ANSA, 14 June 2022; La Repubblica, 14 June 2022)., On 20 June, on the occasion of World Refugee Day, rallies calling for better access to jobs and housing solutions for asylum seekers were recorded in Denmark, France, Germany, Malta, Poland, and Spain., In the Netherlands, after two weeks of regular and widespread protests, which also rippled across the border in Belgium (notably in Flanders), farmers' discontent with the Dutch government's plans to cut nitrogen emissions culminated in a mass demonstration in North Holland province last week. Up to 40,000 farmers with thousands of tractors from across the country met on 22 June around Stroe to demand the scrapping of the recently announced measure. The leaders of the protest movement claim that the planned cuts, which are set as high as 95% in some provinces, will impose significant reductions on livestock and the closure of small farms (France 24, 22 June 2022; Bloomberg, 28 June 2022)., In Germany, unidentified assailants set fire to eight police vehicles parked in front of a hotel hosting members of the G7 security task force in Munich last week, ahead of the G7 Summit at Elmau Castle from 26 to 28 June. While several anti-G7 activists condemned the attack, police authorities declared that they suspect a strong link between the arson attack and the G7 Summit (Merkur, 22 June 2022)., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations increased last week. Azerbaijani positions reportedly came under Armenian fire in the Shahumyan, Kalbajar, and Kashatagh regions. This violence contributed to the 256% increase in violence in Azerbaijan and Artsakh3 last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month. One Armenian serviceman was killed during fighting in the Gegharkunik region of Armenia. Additionally, an Azerbaijani civilian was hospitalized as a result of a mine incident in the Hadrut province.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-18-24-june-2022

Ukraine: Russian Missile Kills Civilians in Shopping Center [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,30 Jun 2022,"Investigate Attack in Kremenchuk as Potential War Crime, (Poltava, June 30, 2022) – Russian forces launched a missile which struck a shopping center in Kremenchuk, central Ukraine, on June 27, 2022. The attack killed at least 18 civilians, according to local authorities, and wounded dozens of others, Human Rights Watch said today. On June 29, 36 people remained missing, as rescue efforts continued., A Russian Defense Ministry official claimed that the shopping center had been closed at the time of the attack. He also claimed that the fire that damaged the shopping center had spread from the detonation of Western-supplied munitions caused by Russian forces’ strike in an industrial complex adjacent to the shopping center. Both claims are demonstrably false., “The Russian missile that directly hit an open and busy civilian shopping center on June 27 caused devastating loss of civilian life,” said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The incident should be investigated as a potential war crime, and if the Russian authorities don’t, the International Criminal Court and other investigative bodies should.”, The missile hit the shopping center at 4 p.m., destroying it and damaging several vehicles in its parking area. A second missile, minutes later, hit the north side of the Kremenchuk Road Vehicle Factory, a large industrial complex whose boundaries are less than 40 meters behind the shopping center, separated by a cement-block wall. The second strike hit 450 meters north of the first, leaving a crater approximately 16 meters wide and 5 meters deep. Four CCTV cameras recording different angles over a nearby park, captured the impact of the second missile. The CCTV time stamps show the second missile struck at 3:59 p.m. In one CCTV video, the smoke plume from the shopping center strike is visible. A Russian Defense Ministry official claimed that Ukrainian authorities stored weapons from the United States and European countries in the industrial complex. Ukraine’s interior minister said there were no military targets within five kilometers of the shopping center., Based on site investigations on June 28 and 29, Human Rights Watch could not identify any evidence to indicate the industrial complex was storing munitions., Contrary to Russian claims, although some of the shops closed after February 24, the shopping center remained open, witnesses, staff and shoppers said. Human Rights Watch spoke with 15 people, including people hospitalized with injuries, doctors, shop staff, other witnesses, and local officials., Four people separately said that around 4 p.m., they heard two explosions minutes apart. Elena Guseva, 55, who works at a grocery kiosk opposite the shopping center, said she heard the air raid siren around 4 p.m., “prayed for it to be a false alarm”, went outside, and then heard a very loud explosion: “I screamed and jumped. I felt sudden pain in my chest and stomach. And saw huge black smoke over the shopping mall.”, Footage, recorded from a CCTV camera overlooking the industrial complex behind the shopping center, captured the moment the first missile hit the shopping center. The footage’s timestamp displays 3:51:54 p.m. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly shared the footage, whose exact location was first geolocated by the investigative journalism group Bellingcat and verified by Human Rights Watch by matching landmarks in the video with satellite imagery., Human Rights Watch cannot at this time verify or disprove whether the industrial site was ever used for military purposes. However, Human Rights Watch observed its perimeter, and factory management granted researchers access to the complex. The factory’s deputy director, Viktor Shybko, said that the factory did not house any military vehicles, equipment, or personnel and only produced machinery for concrete and asphalt production., Researchers were allowed unhindered access to the facility, including multiple warehouses, where they saw large, stationary machinery and old metal parts, some covered in dust. They found no evidence of military vehicles, weapons, or munitions. Since Russia’s February invasion, the factory operated only part time due to disrupted supply lines. On June 27, the workday ended at 3:30 p.m., and about 50 personnel remained when the missile hit. The site’s security staff is not militarized and are equipped only with radio and flashlights., Kremenchuk’s deputy mayor, Olha Usanova, and Oksana Korlyakova, head of the intensive care clinic, Kremenchutskaya, said that only 5 of the 18 killed had been identified because the other bodies were so badly burned as to make visual identification impossible. After the attack, 57 people sought medical assistance at the clinic, 25 of whom – 15 men and 10 women – required hospitalization. One of them died shortly after arrival and five were in grave condition on June 28., The officials said that most people hospitalized had traumatic brain injuries and other injuries caused by primary and secondary blast fragmentation. Medics sent one person with severe burn injuries to a specialized hospital., A man hospitalized with head trauma and other injuries said he had been in the shopping center, lost consciousness, and woke up under a concrete slab. He said that he heard his wife, 43, screaming nearby. She was also trapped under concrete debris with her arm broken in three places: “As we were stumbling out [of the mall], she had to hold her arm with her other arm, and we could see the bone protruding under the skin.”, Mykolay, 39, who worked for 10 years as a consultant at an electronic store in the center, was also hospitalized. He said he heard an explosion followed by a “deafening crushing noise.” He remembered only being led outside by his colleagues, some of them injured and bleeding: “A part of the wall was completely gone, and we just walked through the opening to get outside.”, Petro, 41, an employee with another electronics store, had been sitting outside the center with a co-worker, Oleksandr, waiting for the air raid siren to end: “I saw a yellow flash in front of my eyes, and a wave threw me several meters, hitting wooden pallets before losing consciousness.” When Petro regained consciousness, he realized he had multiple cuts and blood gushing from his right arm. He was hospitalized with a concussion and multiple bruises on his back and head. His hand was visibly swollen and his back covered in bruises. His co-worker was hospitalized with leg fractures., An IT expert who was a kilometer from the shopping center when the strike hit went to the center when he heard the explosion. He saw numerous emergency vehicles, and people being carried out with blood on their arms and head. He said there was a lot of smoke and the smell of burning plastic was so overpowering that he could not breathe and had to leave after about 20 minutes., Rescue workers continue to comb the site for survivors. Human Rights Watch spoke with a family who said they called the morgue and every hospital in the city looking for their daughter, an employee at the shopping center, to no avail., Human Rights Watch analyzed satellite imagery collected before and after the attack. A low-resolution image taken on June 27 at 11:18 a.m. shows no damage to the shopping center or factory. A high-resolution satellite image the following morning confirms that the attack hit at least two distinct areas, reducing the shopping center to rubble and severely affecting the surrounding areas. Several cars were destroyed and a section of the wall that surrounds the neighboring factory was damaged. Debris is spread in various directions., The crater at the industrial complex was caused by the second strike. It hit the complex’s largest production warehouse and the greenhouse next to it. The satellite image shows the crater and damage to several surrounding buildings. The roof and northern façade of one of the buildings are severely damaged, and six buildings are destroyed., The Ukrainian air force command identified the weapons used by Russia in the strikes as KH-22 (X-22 in Cyrilic) cruise missiles, fired from Russian aircraft. At the shopping center site, Ukrainian authorities presented remnants they said had been recovered from the strike. Human Rights Watch has not independently verified the weapons used in either strike. The impact crater in the factory and the blast damage to the shopping center are consistent with the detonation of warheads weighing nearly 1,000 kilograms with large high-explosive payloads., If Russian forces were targeting the industrial complex, they had to or should have been aware of the large presence of civilians adjacent to their intended target. They had an obligation to distinguish those civilians and the civilian shopping center from any potential military objective, and to take all feasible precautions to minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects., This includes not conducting a strike where the foreseeable risk of civilian causalities and harm to civilian objects clearly exceeds any concrete military advantage anticipated. Intentionally launching an attack where the loss of life or injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated is a war crime., The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. These weapons can have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions simultaneously. This includes munitions with large, high-explosive warheads, as used in the June 27 attack. The use of these weapons should be avoided in populated areas., “The civilians in Kremenchuk who suffered such intense loss from the June 27 strike deserve justice,” Gorbunova said. “There needs to be a thorough investigation, and those responsible should be held to account.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-missile-kills-civilians-shopping-center-enruuk
"‘Children’: The Attack on the Donetsk Regional Academic Drama Theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine [EN/RU]",Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,30 Jun 2022,"An extensive investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Russian military forces committed a war crime when they struck the Mariupol drama theatre in Ukraine in March, killing at least dozen people and likely many more., In a new report, ‘Children’: The Attack on the Donetsk Regional Academic Drama Theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine, the organization documents how the Russian military likely deliberately targeted the theatre despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there on 16 March, making the attack a clear war crime., Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team interviewed numerous survivors and collected extensive digital evidence, concluding that the attack was almost certainly carried out by Russian fighter aircraft, which dropped two 500kg bombs that struck close to each other and detonated simultaneously., “After months of rigorous investigation, analysis of satellite imagery and interviews with dozens of witnesses, we concluded that the strike was a clear war crime committed by Russian forces,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “Many people were injured and killed in this merciless attack. Their deaths were likely caused by Russian forces deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians., “The International Criminal Court, and all others with jurisdiction over crimes committed during this conflict, must investigate this attack as a war crime. All those responsible must be held accountable for causing such death and destruction.”, Amnesty International commissioned a physicist to build a mathematical model of the detonation, to determine the net explosive weight (NEW) of the blast which would be required to cause the level of destruction seen at the theatre. The conclusion was that the bombs had a NEW of 400-800kg. Based on available evidence regarding the aerial bombs in Russia’s arsenal, Amnesty International believes the weapons were most likely two 500kg bombs of the same model, which would yield a total NEW of 440-600kg., The most likely Russian aircraft to have conducted the strike are multi-role fighters – such as the Su-25, Su-30, or Su-34 – which were based at nearby Russian airfields, and frequently seen operating over southern Ukraine., Amnesty International examined several alternative theories about who was responsible for the attack, and what weapons may have been used. Based on the available credible evidence, the investigation ultimately found that a deliberate air strike targeted at a civilian object was the most plausible explanation., ‘I COULDN’T BELIEVE MY EYES’, Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, civilians began fleeing their homes as cities and towns were targeted by military attacks. In besieged Mariupol in the Donetsk region, the theatre became a safe haven for civilians seeking shelter from fighting., The theatre, in the city’s Tsentralnyi district, was a hub for the distribution of medicine, food and water, and a designated gathering point for people hoping to be evacuated via humanitarian corridors. The building was clearly recognizable as a civilian object, perhaps more so than any other location in the city., Locals had also written the giant Cyrillic letters “Дети” – Russian for “children” – on forecourts on either side of the building, which would have been clearly visible to Russian pilots and also on satellite imagery., Nevertheless, Russian bombs struck the theatre shortly after 10am on 16 March, producing a large explosion which caused the roof and huge portions of two main walls to collapse. At the time of the attack, hundreds of civilians were in and around the theatre., Amnesty International believes that at least a dozen people were killed by the strike and likely many more, and that many others were seriously injured. This estimate is lower than previous counts, reflecting the fact that large numbers of people had left the theatre during the two days prior to the attack, and most of those who remained were in the theatre’s basement and other areas that were protected from the full brunt of the blast., When the bombs detonated, they destroyed the adjacent interior walls along the sides of the performance space, and then breached the exterior load-bearing walls, creating two main debris fields on the north-eastern and south-western sides of the building. Both debris fields are visible on satellite imagery taken just minutes after the strike., Ihor Moroz, a 50-year-old architect, was nearby when the theatre was hit. He told Amnesty International: “It all happened in front of our eyes. We were 200 or 300 metres away [when] the explosion happened… I could hear a plane and the sound of bombs dropping. Then we saw the roof [of the theatre] rise up.”, Grigoriy Golovniov, a 51-year-old entrepreneur, said: “I was walking down the street leading to the drama theatre… I could hear the noise of a plane… but at that time I didn’t really pay attention because [planes] were constantly flying around… I saw the roof of the building explode… It jumped 20 metres and then collapsed… then I saw a lot of smoke and rubble… I couldn’t believe my eyes because the theatre was a sanctuary. There were two big ‘children’ signs.”, Vitaliy Kontarov, a 48-year-old truck driver, was also close to the theatre at the time of the attack. He told Amnesty International: “We heard planes… I saw two missiles fire from one plane towards the theatre.”, ‘IN A SECOND, EVERYTHING CHANGED’, In total, interviewees provided Amnesty International with the full names of four people who were killed: Mykhailo Hrebenetskyi, Lubov Svyrydova, Olena Kuznetsova, and Ihor Chystiakov. They also gave the forenames of three other people they believe were killed. Several survivors and other witnesses reported seeing dead bodies of people they could not identify, and it is likely that many fatalities remain unreported., A woman in her late teens was sheltering in the basement with her boyfriend and her mother when the bombs struck. She told Amnesty International: “In a second, everything changed. Everything jumped up… People started screaming. It was full of dust. … I saw people bleeding. We grabbed our documents and left… Some people were not as lucky.”, Yevhen Hrebenetskyi found the body of his father Mykhailo inside the concert hall. Yevhen told Amnesty International: “There were many injured people… There were police trying to pull people out of the rubble… At first, I saw his [Mykhailo’s] arm. First, I saw a familiar hand. You know the hand of your loved ones. His face was covered with blood. His body was covered with bricks… I didn’t want my mom to see.”, Dmytro Symonenko was with Lubov Svyrydova moments before she died from her injuries. He told Amnesty International: “She was severely injured. She managed to crawl from the rubble… she asked us to remember her name, because she felt she was dying.”, Many other interviewees told Amnesty International they had seen bloodied bodies and dismembered body parts, including legs and hands, in the rubble of the devastated building following the strike., DELIBERATE TARGETING OF CIVILIANS, International humanitarian law (IHL) is the body of law which principally governs armed conflict. A core principle of IHL is that parties to an armed conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and civilian objects, and members of the military and military objects. Military objects can be targeted; it is unlawful to target civilians or civilian objects. Prior to any attack, members of the military are required to take steps to ensure that they are reasonably certain they are not targeting civilians and civilian objects., None of the 28 survivors Amnesty International interviewed, nor any of the other witnesses around the theatre on the day of the attack, provided any information to indicate that the Ukrainian military was using the theatre as a base for operations, a place to store weapons, or a place from which to launch attacks., The civilian character of the theatre and the presence of numerous civilians was evident in the weeks prior to the attack. The nature of the attack – the strike’s location inside the building, as well as the likely weapon used – and the absence of any potentially legitimate military objective nearby, strongly suggests that the theatre was the intended target. As a result, the attack likely constitutes a deliberate attack on a civilian object, and is a war crime., “Through the air and on the ground, Russian forces have been on a well-documented and deliberate killing spree of civilians in Ukraine,” said Agnès Callamard., “Thorough investigations are urgently needed in order to hold perpetrators accountable for the serious injury and loss of civilian life they caused, as well as for the extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.”, METHODOLOGY, Between 16 March and 21 June, Amnesty International gathered and analysed available credible evidence related to the attack on the theatre. This included 53 first-hand testimonies from survivors and witnesses of the attack and its aftermath, 28 of whom were inside or adjacent to the theatre at the time. Amnesty International also analysed satellite imagery and radar data from immediately before and shortly after the attack; authenticated photographic and video material provided by survivors and witnesses; and two sets of architectural plans of the theatre., This was supported by an open-source investigation by Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab, who examined and verified 46 photos and videos of the strike that were shared on social media, as well as an additional 143 photos and videos that were privately shared with researchers., Amnesty International’s ongoing documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/children-attack-donetsk-regional-academic-drama-theatre-mariupol-ukraine-enru
Building Resilience Helps People Carry On During Wartime,News and Press Release,IOM,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",29 Jun 2022,"Ukraine, 29 June 2022 – Four months of full-scale war have put an enormous burden on the mental health of people in Ukraine, but from feelings of distress and pain, sprouted resilience and adaptability, paving the way to recovery., Normal Reactions to Abnormal Situations, “At the beginning of the war, people were in a critical state. They didn’t sleep or eat for days at a time, hiding in basements; they had to endure long and difficult journeys to reach safety, completely exhausted, both physically and emotionally,” explains Olha, a psychologist with the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) mobile medical clinic in Lviv. “In the midst of all this chaos, people weren’t able to process what they were going through.”, When the first evacuation trains arrived in Lviv in February, Olha provided people with psychological first aid. She saw fear, anxiety, anger, and apathy among the group – a complex range of emotions and psychological reactions which soon became a normal sight at the overcrowded railway station and in the humanitarian hub set up in the Arena-Lviv Stadium., People used different ways to cope with the unprecedented stress and anxiety that they were going through, in order to face these new challenges, support family members, or simply – survive. Traditionally reluctant to seek psychological help, millions of Ukrainians had to process by themselves what they were feeling. To help alleviate the burden of their stress, from April, IOM’s mobile clinics have been providing people in the Lviv Region with health services and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)., “We may have different backgrounds, but we are brought together by war and displacement. We are here to explain certain techniques that may help you reduce your stress level and anxiety and take care of your mental well-being. If you are able to take care of yourselves, then you can then take care of your loved ones too.” With these words, psychologists begin a psycho-education session near the centre for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Yavoriv in June., Psychologists working with IOM’s implementing partner Sheptytskii Hospital now regularly conduct individual, family and group counselling with children, teenagers, couples, men, women, and elderly people, among IDPs and host communities. During group counselling sessions, people talk about how to cope with stress and understand the ways in which their mental and physical health are connected, to alleviate their reactions. Consultations are carried out in a safe, private, and comfortable space in IDP centres or IOM mobile clinic, IOM’s emotional support hotline also operates 24/7 to support people in Ukraine. Since 24 February, the helpline has been expanded to 30 psychologists with more than 2,800 consultations provided in English, Ukrainian, and Russian., “We were very scared. We managed to survive the shelling, but our son is in the army. Now I watch the news and worry all the time. I decided to seek psychological help because I am going through a lot of stress,” says 63-year-old Tetiana before a group counselling session at IOM’s mobile medical clinic in Lviv., Resilience Paves New Ways, After finding a safe place to stay and ensuring their basic needs are met, there is another wave of feelings that befalls people: the longing for the past and uncertainty about the future. Trying to adapt to a new reality and live in the present moment, people have begun to develop unique resilience strategies to cope and often bounce back stronger., “Once, a 13-year-old girl whose house was destroyed showed me her favourite mobile game, where you could design and decorate a house,” Olha recalls. “Through it, the child who lost her home found a unique way to process her emotions by creating a new home, albeit virtual for now.”, Art-based interventions and games empower the children who struggle to find words for their feelings. Still, some of them need support from psychologists because despite their young age, they witnessed the horrors of war and were uprooted from their regular social environment., “Many children draw tanks, weapons, grenades. Children know so much about the war, partly from TV or their families, even at a young age. They can draw down to the last detail how the missiles strike,” Olha explains., A recurring feeling that IOM psychologists try to help to ease is loneliness. Many families in Ukraine have been separated by the war, sometimes physically with spouses forced to stay behind in Ukraine, other times emotionally, divided by their views or beliefs., “Even before the war, we watched a lot of upsetting news, but my family thought that I was just overreacting. They didn't understand me, which made me feel lonely. But once the war started, our family came together, and we now support each other in whichever way we can,” says a local resident in Lviv Region after a psychological consultation., As Ukraine is witnessing its second wave of mass internal displacement in the last eight years, there are many who know already what it means to have to start all over again., “The people who are now experiencing their second displacement are usually the ones who refuse to give up, first to volunteer and encouraging others to carry on,” explains Olha., There is no recipe that works for everyone, but what can help those newly arrived is a change in perspective. Host communities refuse to see those displaced as victims and try to empower them as much as they can, finding opportunities for growth, volunteering, and setting up new routines., “Everything depends on one’s attitude. Before, we had a narrow family circle, whereas now we have a wide one. We find new things to do every day: take a walk to the lake, go to church, help others,” explains a couple from Kharkiv, who now live with 80 other IDPs in the sports school in Lviv Region., IOM’s MHPSS activities in Ukraine are possible thanks to the support of the European Union, the US Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, and the governments of Canada and Japan., If you have been affected by the war and need support, please call the IOM Emotional Support Hotline., *Names were changed to ensure confidentiality., Written by Alisa Kyrpychova, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/building-resilience-helps-people-carry-during-wartime

Update 84 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (29 June 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,29 Jun 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency has once again lost the remote connection to its safeguards surveillance systems installed at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), further underlining the need for the IAEA to go there very soon, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The IAEA has not been able to visit the ZNPP since before the current military conflict in Ukraine. Russian forces took control of the plant nearly four months ago, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate it., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed his determination to agree, organize and head an IAEA-led international mission to conduct essential nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities at the ZNPP, Ukraine’s largest such facility with six reactors., He also recently expressed his increasing concern about the difficult conditions facing staff at the ZNPP and the impact of such conditions on the safety and security of the plant, “The fact that our remote safeguards data transmission is down again – for the second time in the past month – only adds to the urgency to dispatch this mission,” he said., Earlier this month, the IAEA and the Ukrainian operator of the plant worked together to restore the remote transmission of safeguards data from the ZNPP to IAEA headquarters after a technical interruption of almost two weeks. The data from this time period was also recovered., But the connection was lost again on 25 June, due to a disruption of the facility’s communication systems, Director General Grossi said, citing the assessment of IAEA technicians at its headquarters., In addition, inspectors can only carry out essential nuclear material verification work when they are at the site. The interval of physical inventory verifications at nuclear power plants (NPPs) cannot exceed a specified duration. This is particularly important at two of the units at ZNPP. These units have also been refuelled in recent months and a physical verification of the nuclear material therein is a safeguards pre-requisite before re-starting them., The IAEA is also facing a partial loss of remote safeguards data transmission from the Chornobyl NPP, the Director General said., Safeguards data from IAEA systems installed at two of the NPP’s facilities are no longer being transmitted. The problem seems linked to safeguards equipment at the site, in which case IAEA technicians need to go there to restore communication, he added. The IAEA sent a mission to Chornobyl in late April and a second mission about four weeks ago, to conduct safety, security and safeguards work., With the exception of the ZNPP, the IAEA continues to receive remote safeguards data from Ukraine’s three other operational NPPs., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that eight of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-84-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-29-june-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",29 Jun 2022,"I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, This report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) covers violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law that have occurred in the course of the ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. It covers the period from 24 February 2022 until 15 May 2022 and is based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.1 2. In the morning of 24 February, the Russian Federation launched an armed attack against Ukraine.2 The armed attack and associated hostilities have led to a grave deterioration in the human rights situation across the country., During the reporting period, OHCHR recorded a total of 8,368 civilian casualties, with 3,924 persons killed and 4,444 persons injured. At least 95 girls, 98 boys, 985 women, 1,519 men and 1,227 persons whose sex is still unknown were killed from 24 February to 15 May, and at least 104 girls, 126 boys, 604 women, 907 men and 2,703 persons whose sex is still unknown were injured. However, actual casualty numbers are much higher, since these figures only include the cases that OHCHR has been able to fully verify., As a result of hostilities, civilian infrastructure and housing have been severely impacted. OHCHR recorded damage or destruction to 182 medical facilities and 230 educational facilities as a result of attacks. The attacks also endangered the lives of civilians and infringed on the enjoyment of other human rights, including the rights to health, work, education and housing., Hostilities have also had a severe negative impact on people and groups in situations of vulnerability, including persons with disabilities and older persons. OHCHR has found that many of them were not able to access bomb shelters or quickly evacuate and had to rely on the assistance of their family members and others, when such assistance was even available., The intensive and wide-scale hostilities have caused mass displacement of the civilian population, with grave implications for the enjoyment of their human rights, including economic and social rights. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that over 6.2 million persons had fled the country by 15 May, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) indicated that over 8 million were internally displaced.3 OHCHR also has concerns that the volatile security situation and other factors are restricting freedom of movement to and from regions occupied by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups, reducing civilians’ access to medical assistance, social protection and other basic services in Government-controlled territory. OHCHR has received reports that people attempting to leave Kherson, for example, have been denied permission to exit the region at checkpoints., OHCHR monitored the processes of evacuating civilians from Mariupol towards Government-controlled territory, or towards territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups and further towards the Russian Federation. OHCHR is concerned about the manner in which the ‘filtration’ process, which evacuees are obliged to go through when passing Russian armed forces’ checkpoints, is carried out.8. The armed conflict has led to a wide range of human rights violations of both civilians and combatants, including the rights to life, liberty and security of persons.
OHCHR verified numerous allegations of killings and summary executions, of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, of torture and ill-treatment, and of conflict-related sexual violence., OHCHR has documented and verified allegations of unlawful killings, including summary executions of civilians in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, committed while these territories were under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and March. In Bucha alone (Kyiv region), OHCHR documented the unlawful killings, including summary executions, of at least 50 civilians. Most victims were men, but there were also women and children. As the recovery, exhumation and identification of mortal remains is not yet over, the scale is yet to be fully assessed., OHCHR is also concerned about the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of representatives of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists and other civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.
OHCHR documented 248 cases of arbitrary detention (214 men and 33 women, 1 boy), some of which may amount to enforced disappearance, attributed to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Among those cases, OHCHR recorded that six victims (one woman and five men) were eventually found dead. OHCHR also documented 12 cases of enforced disappearance (11 men and 1 woman) by Ukrainian law enforcement of people suspected of providing support to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., OHCHR documented numerous cases of the widespread use of extrajudicial punishment against individuals alleged to be marauders, thieves, bootleggers, fake volunteers (fraudsters), drug dealers and curfew violators. During the reporting period, OHCHR documented 89 such cases (80 men and 9 women) in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine and 3 cases in territory controlled by the Russian Federation and affiliated armed groups., OHCHR is also looking into mounting allegations of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), although it remains difficult to properly assess the extent of violations, as survivors are often not willing or able to be interviewed. Many referral pathways are not functional and law enforcement authorities have limited capacity to address CRSV cases. OHCHR verified 23 cases of CRSV, mostly attributable to Russian armed forces. They occurred in different regions of Ukraine, including Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. Women and girls constitute the majority of victims, with rape, including gang rape, being the most common form of CRSV. A few cases concern acts such as forced public nudity, where the victims (both male and female) were alleged to be law-breakers in both Government-controlled territory of Ukraine and in territory-controlled by Russian armed forces., The treatment of prisoners of war by the parties also raised serious concerns. OHCHR viewed an abundance of videos publicly available online depicting interrogation, intimidation, insults, humiliation, ill-treatment, torture and summary executions of prisoners of war on both sides. It has also received numerous other allegations of torture of prisoners of war by both sides, including through 44 interviews with prisoners of war. As of 15 May, OHCHR still had no reliable information about the exact numbers of prisoners of war on both sides., OHCHR is alarmed at the security risks faced by journalists and media workers in Ukraine. OHCHR documented 16 cases of deaths of journalists and media workers during hostilities and recorded 10 more cases of injured journalists (21 men and 5 women), including four cases where survivors reported they may have been targeted because of their status as journalists. Moreover, many human rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to perform their human rights work due to ongoing hostilities and large-scale displacement, which in turn has deprived vulnerable groups of their support. There are growing concerns about possible reprisals and retaliation against HRDs in areas controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/situation-human-rights-ukraine-context-armed-attack-russian-federation-24-february-15-may-2022-enuk

New report by UN Human Rights shows the shocking toll of the war in Ukraine [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,29 Jun 2022,"The armed attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine has led to a grave deterioration of the human rights situation in the country with thousands of civilians killed and injured, massive destruction to civilian infrastructure and housing, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence, says the new UN Human Rights report issued today., The report is based on findings by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) and covers the period from 24 February until 15 May 2022., “The daily killing of civilians, the torture, disappearances and other violations must stop. If the hostilities will not stop, then the absolute minimum required is to fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law and commit to protecting every civilian woman, man and child and those hors de combat,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU at the presentation of the report today., The report documents that many of the means and methods of warfare have been in breach of international humanitarian law (IHL) rules governing the conduct of hostilities. In particular, the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, which are aimed at avoiding, or at the very least, minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, were not respected in numerous instances by Russian armed forces; and on a lower scale by Ukrainian armed forces., The report documents unlawful killings, including summary executions of civilians that occurred in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions that were committed by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March. As of 15 May, HRMMU had received information about more than 300 such killings. This figure may increase as new evidence becomes available. In Bucha alone, HRMMU documented that at least 50 civilians were killed by Russian armed forces while it was under their control. Cases of torture and ill-treatment of civilians are also highlighted in the report., The report documents violations of IHL and international human rights law, to varying degrees, by both parties in relation to their treatment of prisoners of war and persons hors de combat, namely cases of extrajudicial execution, torture and ill-treatment, denial of medical assistance, exposure to public curiosity, and violations in relation to the conditions of their internment. While HRMMU enjoys unimpeded access to places of internment of prisoners of war in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine, the report calls for unimpeded confidential access for OHCHR and other independent international monitors to be granted by all parties to the conflict, in particular Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., “I stress that the prohibition of torture and arbitrary deprivation of life is absolute and applies all the time to all persons, regardless of whether they are civilians or combatants,” Ms Bogner said. “Perpetrators must be held to account and victims and their relatives must enjoy their rights to remedy and truth,” she added., The armed attack has also been marred by conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). HRMMU has received numerous allegations and has been able to verify 23 cases of conflict-related sexual violence, including cases of rape, gang rape, torture, forced public stripping, and threats of sexual violence. The majority of cases were committed in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, but there were also cases committed in Government controlled areas., “Due to active hostilities, insecurity, mass displacement and stigma, victims of CRSV are often not able or willing to speak to others or register a complaint with law enforcement authorities. Understanding the full scale of sexual violence in this context may take years,” Ms Bogner said., The report also documents 248 cases of arbitrary detention of representatives of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists and other civilians, many of which may amount to enforced disappearance, attributed to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Among those cases, six victims, one woman and five men, were eventually found dead. It also documented 12 cases which may amount to enforced disappearance by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies, of people suspected of providing support to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., The report confirms allegations of forced conscription of men by Russian-affiliated armed groups in Donetsk and Luhansk. OHCHR recalls that forcing civilians to serve in the armed forces of a hostile power is a grave breach of IHL. Men who have been forcibly recruited should not face criminal prosecution by Ukrainian authorities for mere participation in hostilities., Freedoms of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly and association have been drastically affected since the beginning of the armed attack. HRMMU is alarmed at the security risks faced by journalists and media workers in Ukraine. The report documents 17 cases of deaths of journalists, media workers and bloggers during hostilities, and 14 more cases of injured journalists. Moreover, many human rights defenders have not been able to perform their human rights work due to the ongoing hostilities and large-scale displacement. This has in turn deprived groups in vulnerable situations of invaluable support. In Crimea, the report documented 41 cases of prosecution of Crimean residents for “discrediting” or “calling for obstruction” of Russian armed forces. Multiple media outlets, previously accessible in Crimea, have also been blocked since 24 February 2022, which has seriously restricted the right to freedom of expression on the peninsula., The report also provides details on the impact of hostilities on the rights of people in situations of vulnerability, including IDPs, Roma, persons with disabilities, and older persons., The report includes detailed recommendations to the parties and the international community. “The parties should ensure timely and effective investigations into all allegations of violations, including torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and sexual violence, and ensure that perpetrators are duly prosecuted,” Ms Bogner concluded, HRMMU seeks first-hand information concerning international humanitarian law and human rights violations, and encourages victims and witnesses to contact:, · E-mail: ohchr-hrmmu@un.org · HRMMU on Facebook: write to us on Facebook messenger Моніторингова місія ООН з прав людини / UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission, · HRMMU on Telegram: ohchr_hrmmu (only messages, calls disabled), · HRMMU on Viber: +380503746708 (only messages, calls disabled), --, For more information or media enquiries, please contact Tanya Korol at +380503868069 or e-mail tetiana.korol@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/new-report-un-human-rights-shows-shocking-toll-war-ukraine-enruuk
"Amid Probable Atrocity Crimes, Ukraine Suffering Largest Human Displacement Crisis in World Today, Political Affairs Chief Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jun 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9080TH MEETING (PM)
SC/14951, Delegates Condemn Attack on Kremenchuk Shopping Mall, Civilian Infrastructure, The President of Ukraine today called on the Security Council to immediately compel the Russian Federation from killing children and other civilians in his country, urging the adoption of a legal definition of “State terrorism”., Addressing the Council via videoconference, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that although the United Nations does not have a legal definition for the term “terror State”, the war waged by Moscow displays the need to enshrine it legally and punish any such State. Citing events of the last 3 of the 125 days of aggression, he noted that on 25 June, 62 missiles hit Ukrainian cities, and on 26 June, one rocket hit a residential building in Kyiv, while another exploded in the yard of a kindergarten., He underscored a 27 June strike on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, where, he said, Russian forces must have known they were hitting a civilian target. The United Nations should send a Special Representative of the Secretary-General, or an evidentiary commission to independently confirm the identify of those responsible. Although the Charter of the United Nations states that any member that violates its principles may be expelled, the Russian Federation is still not held to account. That country does not have the right to discuss and vote on the war in Ukraine, he stressed, urging Member States to strip it of its powers., Moreover, the Charter allows for an international tribunal to investigate the Russian Federation’s actions on Ukrainian soil. The word genocide has repeatedly been used, he stressed, pointing to the events in Bucha and Mariupol — a city of 500,000 residents, now in ruins. He called on Council members to commemorate the tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed with a minute of silence., Briefing the Council, Rosemary DiCarlo, the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the depravity of the situation in Ukraine has only increased in the 10 weeks since she last briefed the Council. Recalling that the shopping centre in Kremenchuk was hit by what are reported to be Russian missiles, she said that 18 civilians were reportedly killed and another 59 injured, voicing concern that it was only the latest in a fresh wave of air strikes and missile attacks in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and other cities far from the frontlines., “Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war,” she underscored, reporting that as of 26 June, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had recorded more than 10,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine. The Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which recently concluded its first mission to the country, received information and visited sites that “may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed”, she added., Given that at least 16 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance and protection services, a flash appeal, which runs through August, is being revised to cover needs through the end of 2022. Ukraine is suffering the largest human displacement crisis in the world today, with some 12 million people forced from their homes since the start of the conflict, she stressed, urging partners not to neglect the country’s long-term recovery and rebuilding needs., In the ensuing discussion, many Council members called on the Russian Federation to end the war, condemning the strike on the Kremenchuk shopping centre, while the Russian Federation challenged the truthfulness of those accounts, arguing that they are fake., The representative of the United States said that although the Russian Federation is expected to avoid responsibility for the tragedy, no one will be fooled. There is ample public evidence available to show that Moscow alone is responsible, and their attacks constitute war crimes. Pointing to the bombing of schools and hospitals, the killing of civilians waiting in line for water, and forced executions, he expressed support for all international investigations into those war crimes., Mexico’s representative similarly voiced support for the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in his investigations into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine. Mediation and dialogue are urgently needed for a total ceasefire, he emphasized, adding it must be a priority of the Council. He also stressed that mechanisms are needed to mobilize grains, fertilizers and other commodities, which are being blocked from export and worsening the precarious food situation in other parts of the world., Ghana’s representative, citing the conflict’s snowball effect on developing countries, said that, although the present situation casts a grim outlook, the international community must not lose hope of finding peace. Ongoing diplomatic efforts must be given an opportunity to succeed, she stressed, advocating for the urgent creation of demilitarized humanitarian corridors in all besieged areas, in compliance with international law., The representative of the United Arab Emirates called for addressing humanitarian challenges and prioritizing an immediate cessation of hostilities. Encouraged by ongoing efforts aimed at allowing ships safe passage to and from key seaports, she stressed that the Security Council must do everything within its power to support those negotiations., The representative of the Russian Federation expressed concern about President Zelenskyy’s participation in the meeting, stressing that no consultations were held with all Council members on that matter. Referring to various glaring inconsistencies in media accounts, he said that there was no strike on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk, adding that a video posted by Ukrainian bloggers shows that the goods inside the shopping centre were not affected by the blast., “We have not carried out any strikes against civilian peaceful targets, nor have we ever done so,” he said, urging Member States to refer to eyewitness accounts and the opinions of military experts. On the other hand, the Kyiv regime is deliberately storing weapons in the very centre of cities, next to residential areas. His country began its special military operation to stop Ukraine’s shelling of Donbas and so that its nationalist leadership ceases to pose a threat to his country or to the inhabitants of the south and south- east of Ukraine. “Until those goals are achieved, our operation will continue,” he said., China’s representative, stressing that dialogue is the only viable way to end hostilities, voiced support for direct negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Sending weapons cannot bring about peace, nor can sanctions solve the security conundrum, he said, adding that attempts to weaponize the world economy and pressure countries into taking sides will only divide the international community. Moreover, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) must abandon its cold war mentality based on bloc confrontation., Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, France, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, Kenya, India, Gabon, Norway, Estonia (also on behalf of Latvia and Lithuania) and Poland., The meeting began at 3:04 p.m. and ended at 5:05 p.m., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the depravity of the situation in Ukraine has only increased in the 10 weeks since she last briefed the Security Council. It was on full display again on 27 June following a missile strike in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region. Hundreds of people — perhaps even some trying to get a respite from the daily horrors of the war — suffered one of the most shocking attacks of the conflict when a shopping centre was hit by what are reported to be Russian missiles. Eighteen civilians were reportedly killed and 59 were injured, but the final toll may be much higher., Stressing that the incident should be investigated, she said it was only the latest in a fresh wave of airstrikes and missile attacks in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and other cities far from the frontlines, with many civilians killed or injured. The most intense fighting is currently in and around the towns of Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and Sloviansk, in Donbas. Heavy fighting is also being reported around the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson. “In scenes reminiscent of the World Wars, large-scale artillery duels are devastating industrial areas, with thousands of civilians forced to hide in basements or to flee for their lives,” she said, citing large-scale military casualties on both sides., “Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war,” she continued, reporting that as of 26 June, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had recorded more than 10,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine. Most were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Noting that the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine recently concluded its first visiting mission to the country, she said it received information and visited sites that “may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed”., Emphasizing that such work “must lead to justice”, she went on to note that since 24 February more than 8.8 million people across Ukraine have received some form of humanitarian assistance and protection services. At least 16 million people are currently in need of such aid. Needs are increasing, and the flash appeal — which runs through August — is being revised to cover needs through the end of 2022. Women are facing particular hardships in accessing health care, safety and food, and they are increasingly becoming the heads of their households and leaders in their communities as men are conscripted. They must be included in formal decision-making processes related to humanitarian efforts, peacemaking and other areas that directly impact their lives., She outlined perilous conditions which are hampering efforts by humanitarian partners to reach civilians, citing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) report that 323 attacks on health-care facilities and personnel — resulting in 76 deaths — have been reported. Ukraine is also suffering the largest human displacement crisis in the world today, with more than one quarter of the country’s population — some 12 million people — forced from their homes since the start of the conflict. Over 5.2 million are estimated to now be refugees across Europe. She urged partners not to neglect Ukraine’s long-term recovery and rebuilding needs, spotlighting the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) new Resilience and Recovery Programme, which aims to support the Ukrainian Government’s emergency response, delivery of public services and efforts to keep the economy running., She also noted with concern that the war is having devastating consequences not only on Ukraine and the immediate region, but far beyond its borders, exacerbating the greatest cost-of-living crisis in a generation. “Price shocks in the global food, energy and fertilizer markets are escalating in a world already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change,” she said. Calling for strong political will and a comprehensive approach to those multiple threats, she emphasized that no country or community will be left untouched, declaring: “The cycle of death, destruction, dislocation and disruption must stop — for the sake of Ukraine, Russia and the entire world.”, Statements, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine, speaking via video teleconference, said that, as of now, the United Nations does not have a legal definition for the term “terror State” agreed upon by all Member States. However, the war waged by the Russian Federation displays not only the meaning of the concept but the urgent necessity to enshrine it legally and punish any such State. Citing events of the last 3 of the 125 days of aggression, he noted that on 25 June, 62 missiles hit Ukrainian cities, and on 26 June, one rocket hit a residential building in Kyiv, destroying three stories, with another exploding in the yard of a kindergarten. On 27 June, those who carried out the strike on Kremenchuk could not have been unaware they were hitting a shopping mall, killing 18 — with many more victims likely. He called for the United Nations to either send a Special Representative of the Secretary-General, or an evidentiary commission to independently confirm that this was a Russian Federation strike. Also on 27 June, that military launched rocket artillery on people lined up for water in Lysychansk, and killed nine people and wounded 29 in Kharkiv., Naming victims, he stressed that they included a 3-month-old child. Turning to the “long-suffering Donbas that Russia has humiliated since 2014”, he asked: “Who of you does not agree that this is terrorism?” If, in any other part of the world, a country acted like the Russian Federation in killing Ukrainians, it would definitely be recognized as a terrorist, and would become the enemy of all humankind. The Charter of the United Nations, he noted, confers on the Council primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security, and that Article 6 of Chapter 2 states that any member that violates its principles may be expelled by the Assembly. However, the Russian Federation is still not held to account, remaining in United Nations agencies and enjoying the privileges of the seat of a permanent Member of the Council. That country, he stressed, does not have the right to discuss and vote on the war in Ukraine, which is unprovoked and colonialist, and urged Member States to deprive it of its powers., He noted that Chapter 7 of the Charter allows for an international tribunal to investigate the Russian Federation’s actions on Ukrainian soil. The word genocide has repeatedly been used, he stressed, pointing to the events in Bucha and Mariupol — a city of 500,000 residents, now in ruins. With more than 4 months passed since the beginning of aggression, the international community must act urgently to compel Moscow and its military to stop killing children and other civilians — otherwise, it will turn upon other countries in Europe, Asia and the Baltic States. The Council could meet round the clock to discuss every terrorist act committed, he said, urging it to prevent that country from manipulating the United Nations, and adopt the legal definition of the notion “State terrorism”. He then called for Council members to commemorate the tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed with a minute of silence., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), President of the Security Council for June, speaking in his national capacity, said the Russian Federation continues its massive assault on Ukraine, running against every human effort invested since the Second World War to build global peace through the rule of law. Although the Russian Federation continues to deny the targeting of civilians, overwhelming evidence proves the contrary, he said, stressing that those committing war crimes must pay for their actions. Moreover, zealous commentators of State propaganda “fill the air” with worst-case scenarios of deploying weapons of mass destruction. Pointing to the current food and insecurity crisis that continues to spread around the world, he said that millions of tons of grain are piled in Ukraine, and the Russian Federation is reportedly stealing it. The war is paralysing Ukraine; destroying its industry, roads, schools and health system; killing civilians; and destroying the fabric of its society. “International support for Ukraine and its people is a moral and solidarity issue. It is to choose to stand on the right side of the law, of rights, of life, of dignity,” he said., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States) said he was honoured by the presence of President Zelenskyy and expressed his deepest condolences to him and the people of Ukraine for the horrors they suffer each day, as well as the recent attack on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk. The United States stands united with Ukraine. This latest outrage is not unusual, but a pattern that the Kremlin has demonstrated as it tries to subjugate Ukraine. Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin keeps trying to divide Ukraine’s partners. The United States’ support for Ukraine is resolute. He said he expected the Russian Federation to obfuscate and avoid responsibility for this tragedy, stating that no one will be fooled. There is ample public evidence available to show that the Russian Federation alone is responsible, and their attacks constitute war crimes. There is the bombing of schools and hospitals, the killing of civilians waiting in line for water, forced executions. Council members should hold the Russian Federation responsible as should the international community as a whole. The United States supports all international investigations into these war crimes as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities as they prepare to investigate these crimes. The world has said it is enough. The Russian Federation has started this war and only the Russia Federation can end the war by withdrawing from Ukraine, he concluded., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) strongly condemned the 27 June Russian Federation strike on a shopping centre in Kremenchuk, which, according to a provisional report, claimed at least 10 victims. In recent days, that army has deliberately targeted and shelled Ukrainian residential areas and areas far from combat zones, with a heavy toll in Kharkiv, Lysychansk and Kyiv. The Russian Federation continues to kill children, humanitarian personnel and journalists and destroy civilian infrastructure to demoralize the Ukrainian people — violating the most basic principles of international humanitarian law, having trampled on the Charter of the United Nations. War criminals will be brought to justice, he stressed, and his delegation will maintain the strongest possible pressure to compel Russian Federation authorities to end to this war, which threatens to push one fifth of the world’s population into poverty and food insecurity — and it is unacceptable for Moscow to use hunger as a political lever. He called for the blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea to be lifted to allow the export of foodstuffs, and for full, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to be urgently guaranteed. Faced with the historic challenge represented by the return to war in Europe, the European Union has decided to grant Ukraine the status of candidate for membership, as its people are “fighting to defend our values, and those promoted by the Charter of the United Nations”, he said, noting that France has already mobilized $2 billion in economic and humanitarian support and will continue to stand alongside the Ukrainians., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) expressed deep concern about the air strikes on or near densely populated areas in Ukrainian cities, in particular the attack on Kremenchuk. Attacks against civilian objects encourage a perverse logic of retaliation. He urged the parties to allow an impartial investigation into these incidents and to refrain from actions that could result in increased civilian casualties. He also reiterated his call for parties to respect their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law. Citizens must be protected in all circumstances, which entails the exercise of restraint by military forces and the establishment of mechanisms for evacuating areas directly impacted by operations. There is no alternative to a political solution, and he appealed for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the establishment of peace negotiations, without delay or preconditions. The Council is responsible for creating conditions for dialogue, he stressed, adding: “We should redouble efforts to seek solutions that favour peace negotiations and minimize the impacts of the conflict, both in Ukraine and in other affected regions.”, BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that in recent days the Russian Federation launched an intense barrage of cruise missile attacks at targets across Ukraine, some of which struck a shopping centre in Kremenchuk with over 1,000 people inside. “When the world calls for peace, dialogue and adherence to international law, Russia answers with escalation and the targeting of civilians,” she said, adding that it also deploys yet more war propaganda and disinformation. Also spotlighting the prominent role being played by Belarus as a direct staging post for Moscow’s attacks, she reiterated that Ukraine is entitled to defend itself, “as any of us would if our cities, towns and villages were subject to repeated, relentless missile strikes by a foreign army focused on wiping out our existence”. She once again called on the Russian Federation to end its illegal invasion, withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and enter into dialogue and negotiation., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) pointed to reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, including the attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk full of civilians going about their ordinary lives. Parties to conflict must comply with international humanitarian law, including the obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to attack only military objectives; the prohibitions against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks; and the obligation to take all feasible precautions in attack, she reiterated. Turning to the human rights situation, she noted that the human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has recorded over 10,000 civilian casualties, most of which have been caused by the use of explosive weapons, recognizing the important role of the ongoing investigation of the International Criminal Court in helping to pursue accountability for such violations. There must be full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for humanitarian personnel to reach civilians, including those who choose to remain in Ukraine and those who are unable to depart, she stressed, calling on the Russian Federation to end its war and to withdraw all forces unconditionally from the entirety of the sovereign territory of Ukraine, MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine, “who are suffering the failure of the multilateral system” to help end the war. The reported intensification of missile strikes and shelling is having a worsening impact on civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure, in violation of international law. Condemning the disproportionate use of force, the use of human shields and the targeting of civilians and objects, he added that the blockade of Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea has disrupted the global food supply chain, worsening food insecurity - especially in conflict situations and fragile economies in the global South. With inflation surging and food and fuel prices spiking, the conflict is also undermining efforts to build back from the COVID-19 pandemic. In that context, he urged the parties to adhere to international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians and to bring an immediate end to the war in a manner that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), reaffirming his delegation’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity, echoed expressions of concern over reports of intensified military bombardments in recent days. “While the present situation casts a grim outlook for peace, as purveyors of global peace and security, we cannot, and must not, lose hope of finding peace,” he stressed, citing the growing urgency of the situation and its snowballing effect on developing countries in particular. Ongoing diplomatic efforts must be given an opportunity to succeed, he said, welcoming positive steps that followed the Secretary-General’s visits to Kyiv and Moscow in April. He also called for an immediate cessation of military engagements in areas populated by civilians and advocated the urgent creation of demilitarized humanitarian corridors in all besieged areas, in compliance with international law., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), condemning the deadly attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk, said that such an attack is contrary to international law and international humanitarian law. He called for an independent investigation and voiced support for the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in his investigations into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine. He also called for safe and unrestricted access to all personnel providing humanitarian aid. One of the main premises of international humanitarian law is the principle of distinction; its main objectives is to avoid, whenever possible, the suffering of the civilian population or minimize the damage. Not respecting this principle is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. Mediation and dialogue are urgently needed for a total ceasefire, he emphasized, adding it must be an urgent priority of the Council. Further, it is necessary to increase the humanitarian pauses that guarantee safe and voluntary evacuation of the population. He also stressed that mechanisms are needed to mobilize grains, fertilizers and other commodities which are being blocked from export and worsening the precarious food situation in other parts of the world., DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) expressed concern about President Zelenskyy’s participation in the meeting, stressing that no consultations were held with all Council members on that matter. Representatives of States who wish to speak in the Council must be physically present in the Chamber, he added, underscoring that the organ must not be turned into a platform for a remote public relations campaign for President Zelenskyy to get more weapons from participants of the NATO Summit. Recalling that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Central African Republic just a week ago was refused the opportunity to speak to the Council, he said it should not demonstrate double standards to serve the Ukrainian party and its Western backers., He pointed out that from the beginning of his country’s special military operation, Ukrainian authorities’ true concern was on the information front, which they, together with their Western public relations propagandists and collaborators, took on with special zeal, adding that a count of all “Ukrainian fakes” disseminated thus far would be enough for a weighty tome. Pointing out the falsehoods in the legend about the Russian ship to which the defenders of the Snake Island allegedly refused to surrender and one about “The phantom of Kyiv”, he said that to Ukrainians and their Western handlers, what Western media was showing is what is important in the digital age, not what is happening on the ground. Referring to other glaring inconsistencies in the media, he said that at some point, reports accusing Ukrainian soldiers and nationalists of cruelty and war crimes began to multiply in social media., He went on to say that there was no strike on the shopping centre in Kremenchuk, noting that a video posted by Ukrainian bloggers shows that the goods inside the shopping centre were not affected by the blast. Moreover, houses next to the mall were not damaged, and glass in windows remained intact. The Kyiv regime is deliberately storing weapons in the very centre of cities, next to residential areas, endangering the population. “We have not carried out any strikes against civilian peaceful targets, nor have we ever done so,” he said, urging Member States to refer to eyewitness accounts and the opinions of military experts. Moscow began its special military operation to stop the shelling of Donbas by Ukraine and so that its nationalist leadership ceases to pose a threat to the Russian Federation or to the inhabitants of the south and south-east of Ukraine. “Until those goals are achieved, our operation will continue,” he said., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) reiterated his country’s calls for a complete cessation of hostilities and advocated a path of peace, dialogue and diplomacy. He also voiced his support for all efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people of Ukraine — especially talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation — and noted his country has been sending humanitarian supplies to Ukraine and its neighbours. Noting that the issue of the protection of civilian objects in armed conflicts should be considered within the framework of applicable international law, he said the impact of the conflict is not limited to Europe, as it is worsening concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security, particularly in developing countries. All countries must adequately appreciate the importance of equity, affordability and accessibility when it comes to food grains. To that end, open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination. As such, he welcomed the recommendation to exempt purchases of food by the World Food Programme (WFP) from food export restrictions, and outlined India’s financial and food assistance to countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan and Yemen., JUN ZHANG (China) said it is regrettable and worrying that the crisis is expanding and the humanitarian situation dire, with civilian casualties growing. Stressing that dialogue is the only viable way to end hostilities, he voiced support for direct negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, also welcoming the Secretary-General’s good offices on the issue of grain exports, among others. The international community must avoid contrary actions, with all parties working in concert for peace talks. Facts illustrate that sending weapons cannot bring about peace, nor can sanctions solve the security conundrum, he said, while attempts to weaponize the world economy and pressure countries into taking sides will only divide the international community. The Ukraine crisis has once again sounded the alarm for the world that security is indivisible, he observed: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) eastward expansions have not only failed to make Europe secure, but sowed seeds of conflict — a lesson worthy of reflection. NATO must abandon its cold war mentality based on bloc confrontation, he said, expressing concern over the organization’s strategic adjustments. While NATO leaders recently painted other States as a threat, he stressed the organization itself is the cause of trouble, condemning its involvement in the Asia-Pacific region. “Any attempt to go against the tide of history is doomed to fail,” he stressed., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirate), calling the images in Kremenchuk of a shopping mall engulfed in flames “horrifying”, said that the fact that the war in Ukraine has so greatly affected heavily urbanized areas only underlines the imperative of applying the principles outlined in the Council’s framework on the protection of civilians and civilian objects. Almost two months have passed since the Council adopted a presidential statement. Yet the war in Ukraine has continued to escalate. The Charter outlines many of the tools that can be deployed to reach a peaceful settlement. But knowing that the tools exist is not enough. The talk needs to be walked. Now is the time to have an actual dialogue on humanitarian challenges and to prioritize an immediate cessation of hostilities. Further, a food catastrophe must be avoided. Specifically, there needs to be a solution to export the grain and fertilizer that are critical to food systems around the world. Encouraged by the ongoing efforts aimed at allowing ships safe passage to and from key seaports, including Odessa, she stressed that the Security Council must do everything within its power to support these negotiations. “We need to redouble our efforts to achieve peace and end this human suffering,” she emphasized., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) said the serious humanitarian crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine must be stemmed, as too many civilians have paid with their lives, with millions, mainly women and children, forced to flee combat areas. The humanitarian situation is worsening with bombardments, the destruction of means of production and distribution, and disruption of value chains, while outside Ukraine, the war is exacerbating food insecurity with the spectre of famine rising. However, “there is still time to avoid chaos,” she stressed, and the parties must reach consensus to export the tons of wheat held up in Ukrainian ports. She welcomed the actions taken by the African Union, as many farmers, especially on her continent, are waiting for agricultural fertilizers for their crops. The parties to the conflict must respect their commitments under international humanitarian law, refrain from any use of weapons of mass destruction and do their utmost to facilitate unimpeded and secure access for humanitarian aid. Condemning the artillery fire targeting a shopping centre in central Ukraine on 27 June, she stressed that the international community has the means to bring the protagonists to the discussion table to engage in good faith and called for the cessation of hostilities for peaceful coexistence., MONA JUUL (Norway) reiterated that the Russian Federation war is and of itself a violation of international law. The United Nations Charter is clear on the illegality of acquisition of territory by force. She called for that country to stop its illegal attack on Ukraine immediately. Condemning all violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, she also called for the Russian Federation to stop the indiscriminate killing of civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Targeting of residential areas, such as the shopping mall in Kremenchuk, are unacceptable. The urban warfare on Ukrainian cities is causing immense suffering, she said, adding that international law is clear that civilians must be protected and all necessary measures be taken to avoid civilian casualties. She also condemned Belarus for facilitating the Russian Federation’s attacks on Ukraine. Further, she stressed that all violations of international law cannot go unchallenged and must be investigated, with perpetrators being brought to justice. The war continues inflicting terrible harm on the civilian population; it is undermining prospects for international peace and security. “In Ukraine, the best way to protect civilians is clear; it is for Russia to end this war,” she said., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), taking the floor again, said the representative of the Russian Federation can try to claim that nothing is true and make outrageous claims of Ukrainian provocations. However, the undeniable fact is that Russian forces are in Ukraine and there are no Ukrainian forces in the Russian Federation. There is one aggressor here. The evidence will catch up with them and there will be accountability for those crimes., Mr. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation), also taking the floor again, said that such statements sound very convincing coming from the representative of a country that brought the world such provocations, referring to names of cases and other incidents that will go down in history books as glaring provocations and “false flag” operations. “Please keep that in mind next time you try to teach us lessons,” he said., KRISTEL LÕUK (Estonia) decried the Russian Federation’s “colonial, neo-imperialist, expansionist war against Ukraine, amplified by the obscene, dehumanizing disinformation campaign against Ukraine” and its right to exist. The Council must urgently perform its duties to stop the unfolding catastrophe, she said, noting Moscow’s remorseless efforts to terrorize civilians. The shelling of a crowded shopping centre in Kremenchuk had no justification whatsoever, other than to kill, injure and cause extensive human suffering in order to break the spirit of Ukrainian people. Such systematic violations of humanitarian and human rights law amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and possibly even genocide, she said, urging the international community to spare no effort in holding perpetrators to account — including through the work of the International Criminal Court, the Human Rights Council and the Moscow Mechanism of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). She also voiced concern over Moscow’s dangerous and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its attempts to weaponize food shortages and global hunger for its own purposes., MATEUSZ SAKOWICZ (Poland), said that, irrespectively of what the Russian Federation representative said, that country is waging a total war against Ukraine. Spotlighting the attacks on 27 June in Kremenchuk, he said that Russian forces have fired over 130 missiles on Ukrainian cities hitting objects of no military significance. Moscow wants to cause large human losses, terrorize the civilian population and disrupt the functioning of infrastructure catering to everyday needs of ordinary Ukrainians. A permanent member of the Security Council, the Russian Federation has been entrusted with the responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security. However, that country is not only failing to fulfil its basic responsibilities but is acting as an aggressor, in blatant disregard for the United Nations and the foundational rules the international peace and security mechanisms have been built on. Further, Belarus, since 24 February, has been actively facilitating Moscow’s military action by making its airspace, territory and infrastructure available to Russian troops. If not for Minsk’s support, the Russian Federation’s aggression would have been limited. Thus, Belarusian leadership should be considered complicit of crimes committed in Ukraine, he said, calling for the Russian Federation to stop the war and withdraw its troops from Ukraine., For information media.

Frontex and Moldova host international conference on Ukraine and border security,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jun 2022,"Today, Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and Moldovan authorities brought together European and international partners to discuss the changing situation at the borders following the outbreak of Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine., In the aftermath, more than 6 million Ukrainian nationals have entered the EU since Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February. Countries neighbouring Ukraine are particularly affected by the those fleeing the war and crossing the border., “We are bringing together relevant authorities of the EU, Ukraine and Moldova to discuss challenges posed by the war and the strengthening of border management amid the unprecedented security crisis,” said Frontex Deputy Executive Director Lars Gerdes., “Together we protect Europe, shoulder to shoulder, on the spot,” he added., Opening the conference, Moldova's Minister of Internal Affairs, Ana Revenco, underlined the need to consolidate the extended border of the European Union and anticipate threats to security: “We have to build a trustworthy, resilient and sustainable ecosystem together to respond to the current challenges. Cooperation between the judiciary and law enforcement is key to protect people in need and ensure security.”, Deputy Director-General of the European Commssion, Olivier Onidi, added: “This conference is very timely, a few days after the EU formally recognised Ukraine and Moldova as candidate countries for the European Union.”, Amid the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, EU Member States and institutions are doing their utmost to quickly and efficiently support refugees, but also the affected neighbouring countries., Organised in Chisinau, Moldova, the conference gathered representatives from law enforcement and border authorities of the Member States, EU institutions, and international organisations. Representatives of Ukraine also took part in the event, including General Serhii Deineko, Head of Border Guard Service of Ukraine, who told the audience how the Ukrainian border guards were helping defend the country., During the event, the participants shared lessons learned from their respective operational responses to the war in Ukraine, including how to protect fundamental rights of those fleeing the war, as well as discussed the impact of the war on cross-border crime. Majority of the people fleeing Ukraine are women and children. This poses an increased risk of trafficking in human beings and the participants gathered during the event spoke about measures undertaken by EU and national authorities to counter this and other types of cross-border crime., The measures undertaken by European Member States and institutions include operational support by Frontex, the introduction of the temporary protection mechanism by the European Commission and relocations of asylum seekers from Moldova to EU Member States., Frontex launched its first operation in Moldova in March this year, following the signing of a status agreement between the EU and Moldovan authorities. The agency currently has 59 standing corps officers deployed to Moldova, who have helped the national authorities process the flow of refugees from Ukraine.

"DiCarlo on Ukraine: ""The cycle of death, destruction, dislocation, and disruption must stop""",News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Jun 2022,"Mister President,, When I last briefed this Council on 5 April, it hardly seemed possible that the devastation being wrought on Ukraine and its people could get any worse., In the 10 weeks since, countless more Ukrainian civilians have been killed in indiscriminate attacks, cities and towns continue to be levelled, and much of the country’s arable land has been horribly disfigured by shelling., And this horrific conflict, an open source of instability in Europe, shows no signs of abating., The depravity of the war was again on full display yesterday following the missile strike in Kremenchuk, in the central Poltava region., Hundreds of people, perhaps even some trying to get a respite from the daily horrors of the war, suffered one of the most shocking attacks of the conflict when a shopping center was hit by what are reported to be Russian missiles., Eighteen civilians were reportedly killed and 59 injured. The final toll may be much higher., This incident, which should be investigated, was the latest in a new wave of airstrikes and missile attacks in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and other cities far from the frontlines, with many civilians killed or injured., Presently, the most intense fighting is in and around the towns of Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and Sloviansk in the Donbas. Heavy fighting is also reported around the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson., In scenes reminiscent of the World Wars, large-scale artillery duels are devastating industrial areas, with thousands of civilians forced to hide in basements or flee for their lives. Large military casualties are claimed on both sides., Mr. President,, Civilians continue to pay too high a price in this war. As of 26 June, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 10,631 civilian casualties in the country: 4,731 killed and 5,900 injured. These are figures based on verified incidents; the actual figures are considerably higher., Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Many of these weapons are inherently indiscriminate when used in populated areas and, therefore, result in increased civilian casualties and devastating humanitarian impacts., The Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine concluded earlier this month its first mission to the country, including visits to Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy., Though only in the initial stages of its work, the Commission received information and visited cities that quote “may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed” end quote., The work of the Commission of Inquiry, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and other fact-finding efforts are essential for establishing accountability for the crimes and atrocities committed during this war., This work must lead to justice. It is imperative for the people of Ukraine. It is also crucial if we hope to be able to prevent such violations in the future, wherever they threaten to occur., Mr. President,, Since 24 February, over 8.8 million people across Ukraine have received some form of humanitarian assistance and protection services. At least 16 million people need such aid., Needs are increasing, especially ahead of winter. Humanitarian partners are working on a winterization assistance plan and revising the Flash Appeal, which runs through August, to cover the needs through the end of 2022., Women, in particular, are facing immense hardship when it comes to health, safety, and access to food. A Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE in April revealed that women are increasingly becoming heads of households and leaders in their communities as men are conscripted., They must be included in formal decision-making processes related to humanitarian efforts, peace-making, and other areas that directly impact their lives., Perilous conditions are hampering efforts by humanitarian partners to reach civilians, or for them to access the support they need. One statistic sheds light on this concern: since 24 February, the World Health Organization has recorded 323 attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel, resulting in 76 deaths., We strongly remind all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law: All adequate measures must be taken to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure., Mr. President,, Ukraine is suffering the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. Since the start of the Russian invasion, more than one-quarter of the country’s population – 12 million people – have been forced from their homes., Within Ukraine, over 7.1 million people remain displaced by the war. UNHCR estimates there are over 5.2 million refugees present across Europe. Over 3.5 million refugees from Ukraine have registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe., The UN remains committed to provide support for the Government-led responses in host countries., Also, given the increasingly protracted nature of the conflict, we must not neglect Ukraine’s long-term recovery and rebuilding needs., Using early socio-economic assessments, UNDP launched a new Resilience and Recovery Programme to support the Ukrainian Government’s emergency response, its commitment to public services, and to keeping the economy running, as well as to help assess priority needs to deliver for the people of Ukraine., Mr. President,, The war is having devastating consequences not only on the country and the immediate region, but far beyond Ukraine’s borders. As the Secretary-General noted on 8 June during the launch of the second brief of the UN Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, the war is exacerbating the greatest cost-of-living crisis in a generation., Price shocks in the global food, energy and fertilizer markets are escalating - in a world already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change., To address this multi-dimensional threat, strong political will across the multilateral community and a comprehensive approach is foremost necessary., Mr. President,, We have run out of words to describe the senselessness, futility and cruelty of this war., As the Secretary-General warned, “for those on the ground, every day brings new bloodshed and suffering. And for people around the world, the war, together with the other crises, is threatening to unleash an unprecedented wave of hunger and destitution, leaving social and economic chaos in its wake”., No country or community will be left untouched., The cycle of death, destruction, dislocation, and disruption must stop.

Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",28 Jun 2022,"Arup Banerji, World Bank Regional Director for Eastern Europe Originally published in Interfax-Ukraine, – Yesterday, the World Bank approved a new Development Policy Loan for Ukraine with a significant sum, $1.5 billion. How fast these money will come to Ukraine and what are the priorities of this loan?, – The loan approved on 7 June – the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (or PEACE in Ukraine) – is not a Development Policy Loan, but one that finances core government expenditures so that the government can continue to operate and provide services to the people of Ukraine. In its current version, the World Bank undertakes to reimburse the government for all salaries of core civil servants as well as salaries of educators every month (beginning in March, after the war began, until at least the end of the year), so long as the salaries are actually paid in full. So, after an initial big reimbursement for the March-May period, the remaining amount will be paid month-by-month on the basis of proof of actual expenditures. All of this will help Ukraine preserve and protect the capacity of the government and help in ensuring that this strong government capacity is preserved for economic recovery., – What types of financial assistance can Ukraine expect from the World Bank Group in 2022 and 2023? What additional amount can be received through the Bank’s Trust Fund? Could the Bank participate in covering Ukraine’s sectoral deficits, for example, in the electricity and gas sectors?, – Given the acute financing needs for the central budget, The World Bank is now concentrating on helping provide fast and immediate assistance – which in turn can help the population, especially the most vulnerable. First, very soon we will disburse a further $100 mln to help internally displaced people. We are continuing, within our existing projects, to help in the health sector, infrastructure and energy. We are also exploring with other bilateral development partners (such as Italy, Japan and the United States), who are very interested in adding to the PEACE loan and financing other types of verifiable budget expenditures; the specific items are not yet agreed, but will certainly include additional payments to internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups in Ukraine. Our sister organization, IFC, who works with the private sector, is helping with guarantees to promote trade and agriculture., – On what conditions, in your opinion, should financial assistance be provided to Ukraine during the war and after it, for the reconstruction of the country? How strict should they be? How to avoid the formation of Ukraine’s debt overhang, because according to the World Bank forecast only this year its debt will increase from 50.7% of GDP to 90.7% of GDP?, – Ukraine right now needs enormous resources every month to keep the economy functioning during the war – the government’s estimate, which we broadly endorse, is around $5 billion a month (or $35 bn from now until the end of 2022). Clearly, getting sufficient resources is the most important challenge – but the cost of these resources also matters, exactly because Ukraine will need to service these increasing debts in the future., So the best way for partners to support Ukraine is through grants – which is most prominently being done by the US. Since grants of sufficient magnitude are not easily available, the next best option are loans that are quite concessional, with low interest rates and longer maturities – such as from the World Bank and other IFIs. Some countries, such as the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia and Denmark, have innovatively helped increase the volume of such cheap loans to Ukraine, by issuing guarantees to the World Bank and other IFIs., – In early April, the WB forecasted a decline in Ukraine's economy this year by 45,1% with inflation of 15% and its recovery in 2023 year by only 2,1%. How much has this forecast changed as of now?, – Our 2022 GDP projection is still unchanged (authorities currently have 44 percent GDP decline in 2022). But our estimate of the medium-term recovery is now at risk due to the prolonged war, with active combat still continuing in parts of Ukraine. So the impact on the GDP is coming from the relatively large area with active war, while the remaining part of Ukraine is suffering from shelling with corresponding damage to infrastructure, assets and thus livelihoods and jobs. And unfortunately, the probability that the war can last beyond 2022 is now higher., There is another risk to the broader economy. Inflation pressures are growing – due to the need to cover some part of fiscal needs during March- May via Central Bank monetization and financing from domestic banks and depreciation expectations, together with decreased supply of essential goods. Thus, inflation is now expected to increase further – and can reach 20 percent in December (vs 15 percent in our April projections)., International partners have recognized the fiscal challenges and have already committed around $20 bn of financing to help Ukraine. Despite these significant commitments, the timing of its disbursement will remain critical in order to address Ukraine’s ongoing needs., – What is the current World Bank's assessment of Ukraine's losses from the war? How fast can the economy of Ukraine and the level of poverty of its population return to the pre-war level? Under what conditions?, – At the end of March, we estimated damages to infrastructure and structures to be around $60 bn, which was close to the estimates being provided on a continuing basis by the Kyiv School of Economics, which is using World Bank methodology. By now, the direct physical damages are well over $100 bn. If you additionally account for the economic losses that companies and individuals have undergone because of the war, the damages rise to two or three times that amount. Together with the government of Ukraine and the European Union, the World Bank will come up with a broader “Damage and Needs Assessment” by late summer., Catching up to pre-war levels of the economy will not, unfortunately, be quick or easy. Ukraine will need rapid economic growth – far higher than the average of 3 percent a year that we saw in the pre-war era. A simple way to think about this is the “rule of 70” – the number of years it takes a country to double its GDP is 70 divided by the rate of growth. So at 3% growth, Ukraine would take 22 years to double its economy. But if Ukraine can achieve a consistent 7% growth, it will need just 10 years., – In your opinion, what economic steps would help Ukraine better adapt to the war-caused situation? For example, should the state increase or decrease its expenditures? Should tariffs be fixed or subsidies increased?, – To achieve the sort of growth rate needed for recovery, Ukraine will need to reinvent its economy to one that is led by a dynamic, competitive private sector and an EU orientation. It will need to take measures – on investment climate, rule of law, justice and logistics infrastructure – to attract large amounts of foreign private capital and technical expertise. The model here is what Western Europe was able to do after World War II with the help of the Marshall Plan – where modernizing their economies was as or more important than the large grants from the US., So the state expenditures will play a big part – for essential infrastructure, for essential services, for education and health, for social protection, and of course for defense and security. Because of this, the state will also need to collect sufficient revenues to do all this. But public spending by itself will not be enough for recovery and growth – a major role for the state will be to set the conditions (that go much beyond tax rebates or special subsidies) to help all Ukraine’s competitive private sector flourish., – What are your suggestions for the current Ukraine’s social safety nets sector? Does it worth for Ukraine to establish Universal Basic Income system? How should the government build its financial relations with refugees, who left the country?, – Ukraine’s social safety net system, including pensions and the Guaranteed Minimum Income program - as well as the new benefit program to support internally displaced persons (IDPs) - provides important financial protection to the population during the economic disruption caused by the war. The system will soon come under pressure, though – a pressure that will worsen the longer the war endures. Our own estimates show that the household losses from the income shock and higher cost-of-living will be around 25 percent of the household budget. Poverty, under the worst-case scenario, may reach as high as 58 percent in 2023. This will push millions more people onto social assistance., Although the government budget is under fiscal strain, sweeping social expenditure cuts should be avoided since they would have catastrophic consequences for beneficiaries of these social safety net programs. This is why the Bank has been supporting, and will continue to support, the Guaranteed Minimum Income program (including through a new $50 million disbursement). As I mentioned earlier, the World Bank will also provide nearly $100 million in reallocated lending to support the IDP program during the period of martial law. The government is also to be commended for its impressive leveraging of the existing digital Diya platform to allow new cash transfers to be paid to IDPs within just eight days, reaching 3.5 million beneficiaries within a month., – What wartime solutions for the medical sector, education and science does the World Bank offer?, – The war is having a devastating impact on health and education in Ukraine and is expected to affect generations to come. The most obvious effects on health are immediate, in the form of thousands of conflict-related deaths and injuries. Less visible is the illness caused, and worsened, by people not being able to access care for acute and chronic conditions. In education, due to the combination of COVID-related and war-related school closures, Ukrainian children have been out of school for more than a year. This will imply huge learning losses, whose consequences will impact future employment and income, with estimated future earnings losses of more than 10 percent per year per student., While the war still rages, the health system will need to focus on meeting emergency medical needs related to war-related injuries, but also ensure continuation of other essential health services, including for COVID, and for chronic conditions (like hypertension and diabetes), so that long-term population health is not jeopardized. This is why World Bank projects are continuing to support both the procurement of emergency medical equipment and also the financing of the Program of Medical Guarantees. Expansion of services to address the mental health impact of the war is also needed. While providing education during war is difficult, a very promising approach it to use on-line, phone-based, or in-person tutoring can happen anywhere and is both effective and cost-effective. Tutoring could be an important complementary to the classes provided by the All-Ukrainian Online School platform. Through payments through the PEACE project to cover a share of teachers’ salaries, the World Bank is helping to ensure continuity of education for all Ukrainian students, no matter where they are located., – The concept of “RebuildUkraine” was recently presented. It stipulates that while the reconstruction plan must be framed by Ukraine itself, its implementation should be led through the “Ukraine Reconstruction Platform”. In Ukraine, there is a discussion about the effectiveness of this format: they say that a significant part of the funds will go to the bureaucracy instead of financing real projects. Could the “RebuildUkraine” concept be effective? How centralized should the funding process be? What role will the World Bank play?, – Ukraine’s reconstruction, as mentioned earlier, will need efforts from everyone – Ukrainian authorities (and yes, the bureaucracy), Ukrainian farmers, entrepreneurs, those in digital tech industry, heavy industry, banking, retail …, Key to this process is for the state to provide the essential expenditures and framework for recovery – in terms of basic services, protection of the population, proper regulation and competition policy (that is not too onerous and not too light), security and justice. Improving services and rebuilding institutions not cheap, and it will require significant resources for the state. A lot of that will come from abroad – especially if Ukraine commits itself to build institutions as good as those in the EU to prepare for accession. However, the state also has to enable the private sector to be able to flourish – and that means not just the big industrialists, but also the average Ukrainian farmer or small businessperson. And for this, what will be needed is not just money, but expertise, regulations that are fair and easy to navigate, and attention to ensuring that everyone has equal opportunity to succeed., The World Bank will play a strong role in helping the Ukrainian authorities in achieving this vision –through our own finances, but also through coordinating with other development partners so that we can all complement each other to get the most resources to the best uses in Ukraine (as we are already doing today for the period of wartime relief). But as important will be our global expertise across all economic sectors, which we hope to share with and work hand-in-hand with Ukrainian authorities to help rebuild the Ukraine of the future., – The World Bank has repeatedly claimed the risks of deepening poverty and hunger in many low-income countries due to the war in Ukraine. What is the World Bank Group doing to unblock food exports from Ukraine?, – The cheapest and fastest way to get grain and oilseeds out of Ukraine is through the Black Sea. This needs work in the diplomatic and political areas to unblock these routes. While these are not our area of expertise, we encourage and support these efforts. Meanwhile, we are working to enhance the overland exports of grain, by working with Ukrainian railways and the European Union on how to increase the flow of grain exports through EU countries. Since this will not be able to get all the grain out, IFC and we are also working to see whether we can help farmers obtain better forms of temporary storage for the grain so that it does not spoil before it can get exported or consumed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dynamic-competitive-private-sector-and-eu-orientation-should-be-driving-force-ukraines-recovery-enuk

Falling through the cracks: older people in conflict situations,Analysis,Dorcas,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",28 Jun 2022,"Dorcas published a report entitled ‘Falling through the cracks’, which concludes that, in Ukraine, older people are particularly vulnerable to suffering the consequences of the war with Russia. The researchers based their conclusion on previously published reports and recent information from Ukraine., The report states that too little is being done to ensure that the help provided meets direct needs of older people. In the report, the situations in Iraq, Yemen, South Sudan and Ukraine are discussed, and it is concluded that the rights of older people are often not protected well enough. The report suggests a UN human rights convention for the rights of older people as a possible solution for generating more attention for the specific needs of older people., Loss of social safety net and reduced mobility, One of the causes of the vulnerable position of older people in conflict situations identified by the researchers is the lack of available data. Insufficient measurements are carried out about how many older people stay behind in a certain conflict area, and what the specific needs of these people are. Another reason for the particularly vulnerable position of older people in conflict situations is the sudden loss of the social safety net. Some older people depend on their children, neighbours or acquaintances for food, drinks, medication and so forth. When that social safety net is lost, it becomes much harder for older people to access these basic resources. Furthermore, older people are in general less mobile, as a result of which fleeing to a safe region or reaching a bomb shelter in the case of shelling is difficult or even impossible. This means that, during conflicts, older people will often stay in their homes and are therefore more likely to suffer from artillery attacks or to fall into the hands of one of the fighting parties. This means older people are more likely to become victims of burglary, (sexual) violence or even murder., Older people in Ukraine fall between the cracks, Stories of older people who stay at home because they are unable to flee are coming from Ukraine. Previous research from the original conflict area in East Ukraine, prior to the large-scale invasion on February the 24th, reveals that 86% of older people have a limited mobility, with over 10% of interviewees being completely immobile. Furthermore, 98% of older people staying behind were found to suffer from one or more chronic illnesses, and 70% of older women had insufficient access to medical support. According to this same study, only 6% of older people in this particular conflict area have received humanitarian support during the past six months. These statistics reveal the vulnerability of older Ukrainians who are unable to flee., In addition, prior to the escalation of February the 24th, the war with Russia was known as the “oldest conflict in the world”. This means that the percentage of older people experiencing negative consequences due to the war is higher in Ukraine than anywhere else in the world (30 percent). It is therefore feared that, following the escalation, many older people find themselves in a perilous situation without appropriate support. As many residents of Ukraine have fled and the men are obliged to join the fight against Russia, it is feared that older people will end up falling between the cracks without the support they need to access basic resources such as food, drinks and medication. Dorcas therefore calls for more attention to be paid to the effects of armed conflicts on older people so that nobody is left behind.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/falling-through-cracks-older-people-conflict-situations

This means that, since 24 February 2022, 99% of casualties when commercial premises have been targeted with explosive weapons in Ukraine have been civilians., Missiles have caused 71% of civilian casualties when commercial premises have been targeted, and account for 64% of recorded incidents of explosive weapons use on commercial premises., This latest incident tracks with Russia’s systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure. Since 24 February 2022, explosive violence targeting armed bases has accounted for 3% of explosive weapons use in Ukraine. The majority of incidents have been recorded in urban residential areas and locations where multiple urban locals were affected (28%, 165 incidents respectively).

"Returns Increase in Ukraine, but 6.2 Million People Remain Internally Displaced",News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jun 2022,"Geneva -- More than 5.5 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have returned to their homes in Ukraine while the overall number of internally displaced persons remains high at over 6.2 million, according to the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) latest report. About half of those who had left their homes due to the war since 24 February have now returned, especially to the North of the country and to the capital Kyiv., The number of returns has grown significantly -- by 24 per cent -- over the last month. Most returnees have returned to their homes from other locations within Ukraine and about three-quarters of those people plan to stay. Only 10 per cent of people are returning to Ukraine from abroad. Considering the situation in Ukraine remains highly volatile, and despite a majority of all returnees (internally displaced and coming from abroad) indicating their intention to stay in their homes (74 per cent), returns may not be long-term., The sixth round of the general population survey conducted between 17 June and 23 June reveals that the most pressing needs of both displaced and non-displaced persons include access to health services and education, as well as rehabilitation of damaged homes. Alarmingly, the IOM survey revealed that almost one in four people (23 per cent) in Ukraine had to stop using their medication during the war, because it was either unavailable or too expensive., The survey also sheds light on a dire situation: access to education has been particularly precarious among children in displaced households. As many as 38 per cent of families with children aged 5-17 among displaced people and 25 per cent among non-displaced stated that their children did not have full access to education. The situation is most critical in the East of the country, where 16 per cent of displaced households with children of school age indicated they had no access to education at all., Almost 10 per cent of all respondents, and 15 per cent of returnees, indicated that their home was damaged by war. This results in growing needs for shelter repair materials and assistance, especially among returnees., In response to growing health care and shelter needs, IOM is responding swiftly. IOM's mobile medical teams have provided more than 9,000 health care and psychological consultations in western Ukraine. More than 40 facilities benefited from IOM's shelter rehabilitation works in Lviv, Uzhhorod, Vinnytsia, Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Dnipro, and Poltava regions. IOM is also planning longer-term housing solutions in the regions of displacement and in the war-damaged cities of return., Since the beginning of the war, hundreds of thousands of people in 24 regions of Ukraine have received direct assistance from IOM, including food, non-food and hygiene items, cash, mental health and psychosocial support, and have received timely information to help prevent human trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse., Read the latest Internal Displacement Report on Ukraine here., For more information, please contact:, In Geneva:, Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int, *Johanna Bohl, jbohl@iom.int *, In Ukraine:, Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, DTMUkraine@iom.int, Karolina Krelinova, kkrelinova@iom.int, In Vienna:, Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/returns-increase-ukraine-62-million-people-remain-internally-displaced

Its nuclear assembly is subcritical, and the radioactive inventory is low. Before the conflict, the facility was under commissioning, but it is not currently operating., The facility has been hit previously during the conflict and it lost its external power supply in March., In the latest shelling, Ukraine told the IAEA that the facility’s infrastructure, including the cooling system and the diesel generator building, had been damaged. However, the diesel generator remained available if needed, it said., Measurements carried out with a portable dosimeter on the same day showed that the radiation background in the experimental hall of the Neutron Source building was “within the standard limits”, Ukraine said., Based on the nature of the installation and these measurements, the IAEA assessed that there was no significant implication for its safety, Director General Grossi said., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA on Sunday that the flight path of a missile had again passed over the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), the latest such incident during the conflict. Director General Grossi again expressed grave concern about the potential severe risks for nuclear facilities were such missiles to go astray., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine informed the IAEA that eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve.

The main purpose of the assessment is to have a multisectorial overview of the needs of people affected by the war, both displaced and host community, by analyzing their intentions for the next weeks and months; understanding the needs (particularly of children and adolescents) in terms of protection, mental health and education; and priority needs for the entire household; as well as assistance and accountability preferences. This assessment was conducted across nine (9) administrative centers and large cities in eight (8) oblasts inside Ukraine (Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Khmelnytskiy, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, Kyiv, Sumy); Vinnytsia is recognized as one of the main IDP receptors in the country with 39% of IDP participants are in this Oblast. World Vision used a contextualized basic rapid assessment tool (BRAT) to assess 1026 households selected using a convenience sampling approach. Surveys were collected via phone call by a team of 55 enumerators. Enumerators received training in critical topics like safeguarding, referral and accountability, and requested informed consent from each participant. The survey did not require any personally identifying information (PII). The information presented in this report should be used as indicative of the situation in assessed areas, but cannot be considered representative due to the sampling and methodological constraints.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",27 Jun 2022,"Lilia and her family, like over 533,000 other internally displaced people (IDPs) have enrolled in UNHCR’s cash assistance programme funded by donors including the EU Humanitarian Aid., Author Victoria Andrievska | 27 Jun 2022, Lilia, a 35-year-old mother of one, and her family were determined to stay in Kostiantynivka, a small industrial town in eastern Ukraine, despite heavy fighting since the very beginning of the war. But, as fierce shelling and bombardment continued almost daily, they were forced to flee., ‘It was becoming too dangerous. Sirens were howling every day, and the frontline moved closer to our town. Our daughter, Angelina kept asking to leave, she was extremely scared and exhausted from hiding in a cold corridor every night when the sirens would start’., The deteriorating security situation was not the only worry for this family of five. Before fleeing their hometown, Lilia and her husband, Vadym, had to ask their employer – a local medical centre – to give them leave without pay for an indefinite period of time, losing their only source of income. Moreover, during their flight, they were joined by their older family members – Vadym’s 61-year-old mother and his 87-year-old grandmother, a great grandmother to Angelina., ‘We were left in a situation when not only we were leaving all we had behind, but we could no longer provide for our 15-year-old daughter Angelina as well as for her elderly great grandmother whose health has been very poor in recent months,’ continues Lilia., Amidst increasing fighting, the family packed their most essential belongings and took an evacuation bus to Kramatorsk and then an evacuation train to the city of Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, where they found shelter in one of the students’ dorms., Having lost their income, today the family relies heavily on the cash assistance provided by UNHCR, with support from donors like the EU Humanitarian Aid. With a large influx of displaced people in Vinnytsia – more than 50,000 people – there is little opportunity to secure new jobs., ‘When we registered and received the cash, it felt like someone gave us a helping hand. In a desperate situation like ours, I was relieved to know that we will be able to buy medicine for Angelina’s great grandmother and food for the family. Until we find new jobs, this support is critical for us,’ said Lilia., The war has uprooted the lives of millions of people in Ukraine. For many, finding a dignified source of income has become very difficult given the deteriorating economic situation in the country., To support the Government of Ukraine’s efforts in providing social support for displaced people in Ukraine, UNHCR has immediately rolled out its multi-purpose cash support programme., *“**In the first **months *of the war, when millions of people were fleeing within a very short period of time, it was very important to quickly launch this cash assistance programme. Having left their homes, their belongings and their jobs behind in order to get to safety, people arrived without anything but the clothes on their bodies and – in the best case – their ID documents and a toothbrush,” says Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR’s Representative in Ukraine “, Upon reaching safety, millions of people have found themselves short of even the most basic things., *“*We couldn’t even take large bags with us,” Lilia explains “Vadym carried his grandma in his arms the whole journey as she has issues with mobility, he could not carry anything else. When summer came, we had to buy new clothes for the whole family, as we had nothing for this season.”, The family received some donated clothes from volunteers, but for Lilia this was difficult to accept., *“You cannot **imagine how humiliating it is, after we had everything – our beloved home and our jobs – to become so dependent, to go and ask for something – to ask for clothes or for *food”., UNHCR’s multi-purpose cash programme is one way to give displaced people the capacity and dignity to purchase the most essential items they need, at a given point in time. It thereby not only helps people meet their basic needs, but also helps reduce the risk of exploitation of people who have become socio-economically vulnerable and dependent due to their forced displacement. The programme, which was set up in record-time in March 2022, provides displaced people with UAH 2,220 per person per month, during a 3-month period. The assistance is normally used to cover basic needs such as accommodation, food, medicines and hygiene items., This programme is aligned with and complementary to the Government’s and the Ministry of Social Policy’s social assistance programmes., ‘UNHCR works to support the Government of Ukraine in addressing the humanitarian and social needs of people impacted by the war. We want to make sure our programmes, like multipurpose cash, complement and reinforce the national programmes. This is key for sustainability and national leadership of the response. UNHCR therefore signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Social Policy on 19 Apriland worked with the Office of the President of Ukraine to design our programme in a way which achieves this goal,’ said Karolina Lindholm Billing., UNHCR identifies people who qualify for the cash assistance through referrals from the Ministry of Social Policy and by enrolling displaced people with specific vulnerabilities. Enrollment is taking place in Cherkasy, Kirovograd, Lviv, Poltava oblasts and mobile brigades in Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Kyiv oblast of Ukraine, with locations in the east and centre of the country prioritized. A priority is to ensure that the most vulnerable people are supported, through protection pre-screening at all enrolment centres to identify single-headed households, older persons, foster families caring for unaccompanied or separated children and others with specific needs like disabilities., As of today, UNHCR has enrolled over 516,000 displaced people for multi-purpose cash assistance and processed payments for 350,035 individuals. Among IDPs enrolled, 76 per cent are women and children and the majority from eastern and central oblasts of Ukraine., Lilia and her family are among millions of displaced people who long to return to their home as soon as the fighting stops., *“Sometimes, *I wake up in the morning and I almost believe that when I open my eyes, I will see myself in my dear home,” says Lilia. “I truly hope one day it will not be just a dream, but the reality.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcrs-cash-assistance-programme-supports-four-generations-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Jun 2022,"Starting on 24 February 2022, the war in Ukraine triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across all of the country’s sub-regional divisions (oblasts). Between 17 and 23 June, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted the sixth round of a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war-affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,001 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. For further notes on method and limitations, including IOM’s definition of internally displaced persons used for the purpose of this assessment, see page 11. In addition to this General Population Survey, data on recorded IDP presence at hromada level in Ukraine are available from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix – Baseline Assessment (Round 5, June 22 2022, HDX – registration required).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-6-23-june-2022-enuk

Update 82 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (24 June 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,24 Jun 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is increasingly concerned about the difficult conditions facing staff at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and it must go there as soon as possible to address this and other urgent issues, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Director General Grossi said he was continuing his determined efforts to agree, organize and head an IAEA-led international mission to conduct essential nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities at the ZNPP, stressing again that “other considerations should not prevent” it from taking place., The IAEA is aware of recent reports in the media and elsewhere indicating a deteriorating situation for Ukrainian staff at the country’s largest nuclear power plant (NPP), Director General Grossi said., “The situation at this major nuclear power plant is clearly untenable. We are informed that Ukrainian staff are operating the facility under extremely stressful conditions while the site is under the control of Russian armed forces. The recent reports are very troubling and further deepen my concern about the well-being of personnel there,” he said., The Director General noted that the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security in Ukraine that he outlined at the beginning of the military conflict include one stating that NPP staff “must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., Further underlining the necessity of an IAEA-led mission travelling to the facility in southern Ukraine, several other safety and security pillars have also been compromised at the ZNPP in recent months, including those regarding the physical integrity of nuclear facilities, secure off-site power supplies, and uninterrupted logistical supply chains, he said., In relation to safeguards, IAEA inspectors and safeguards technicians must carry out important verification activities at the site, where large amounts of nuclear material are present., Earlier this month, the IAEA and the ZNPP operator worked together to restore the remote transmission of safeguards data from the facility to IAEA headquarters after a technical interruption of almost two weeks. But essential nuclear material verification activities, such as physical inventory verifications, cannot be done remotely and require the physical presence of IAEA inspectors., The interval of physical inventory verifications at NPPs cannot exceed a specified duration. This is particularly important at two of the units at ZNPP. In addition, these units have been refuelled in recent months and a physical verification of the nuclear material therein is a safeguards pre-requisite before re-starting them., “This week, I dispatched safeguards inspectors to Ukraine to conduct essential verification activities at the South Ukraine NPP. Unless I am able to do the same for the Zaporizhzhya NPP as soon as possible, the implementation of safeguards in Ukraine will be compromised,” Director General Grossi said., The IAEA continues to receive safeguards data from its systems installed at the other three operational NPPs in Ukraine and from the Chornobyl NPP., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine informed the IAEA today that eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-82-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-24-june-2022

This included:, a total of 4,677 killed (1,793 men, 1,208 women, 132 girls, and 148 boys, as well as 41 children and 1,355 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,829 injured (1,183 men, 821 women, 130 girls, and 171 boys, as well as 182 children and 3,342 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,969 casualties (2,739 killed and 3,230 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 5,013 casualties (2,551 killed and 2,462 injured),  On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 956 casualties (188 killed and 768 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,537 casualties (1,938 killed and 2,599 injured)., Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.

UOSSM Completes Fourth Medical Mission in Ukraine Providing Surgical Trainings,News and Press Release,UOSSM,Health,24 Jun 2022,"Edinburg, TX - UOSSM completed its fourth medical mission in Ukraine which lasted for two weeks in early June. The medical mission included surgical trainings for surgeons on the frontlines and meetings and planning for future UOSSM work in Ukraine., The surgical trainings, led by UOSSM, and in partnership with the David Nott Foundation (DNF), were planned and facilitated by Dr. Ahmad Dbais and the UOSSM Ukraine team. Dr. Khaula Sawah and Dr. Monzer Yazji, both co-founders of UOSSM USA, joined the surgical trainings., The DNF and team, led by world renowned war doctor, Dr. David Nott, who have worked with UOSSM in the past in Syria and have experience in war medicine in war inflicted areas, wanted to help local doctors and surgeons by providing these vital trainings. The main objective of the Hostile Environment Surgical Trainings (HEST) was to share expertise with local surgeons on the frontlines., UOSSM facilitated the logistics of the surgical trainings coordinating with local authorities and invited surgeons with different specialties to attend the courses., The HEST trainings included one three-day course in Dnipro, where 38 surgeons received the training, and another three-day training in Kharkiv, where 30 surgeons received the intensive and engaging training course. The trainee surgeons were very appreciative and felt they benefitted greatly from the training courses. Both cities have been on the frontlines and under attack causing many war injuries. The surgical trainings will help give surgeons the tools and expertise they need to treat war injuries and ultimately save lives., Dr. Nott and team posted on the David Nott Foundation page, “We want doctors to feel empowered – sometimes all that’s needed is confidence. We want doctors to feel inspired to learn and try the techniques they’ve seen on our course.”, ﻿In addition to the trainings, one complicated surgery was also performed on a patient with war wounds., UOSSM will continue to provide medical training to doctors from the expertise gained from over 10 years of war in Syria., Dr. Sawah met with the director of the Ukrainian Ministry of Public Health Center of Emergency Medical Aid and Disaster Medicine, Dr. Vitaliy Kryliuk (Віталій Крилюк) after the Dnipro training. Dr. Kruylik was impressed with the work UOSSM is doing on the ground in Ukraine and emphasized on the importance to provide doctors and surgeons with more advanced, structured, vital trainings, and to provide Training of Trainers (ToTs) courses to advance the skills of Ukrainian surgeons to handle and treat war zone injuries in particular on the frontlines to train fellow Ukrainian surgeons., UOSSM doctors felt the duty to provide Ukrainian doctors and patients with support and invaluable expertise gained from the 11-year Syrian crisis., Dr. Sawah said, “We know exactly how the Ukrainian doctors and civilians are feeling, and what they are experiencing. The brutal effects of war…the fear…the helplessness…the uncertainty…that is why we chose to share our experiences and expertise gained over the past 11 years in Syria, with the Ukrainian people. We want to help save lives. It was heartwarming to see people just come up to us and thank us for our support especially after they knew where we came from and what we have been doing for over a decade in Syria. We hope to continue to have more impact in Ukraine, supporting civilians with medical and humanitarian relief, and doctors and healthcare professionals with vital training and support to help save lives.”, Dr. Sawah added, “The UOSSM Ukraine team is making a difference every day with these trainings, mental health workshops, and medical and humanitarian relief amid the massive displacement during the last three months.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/uossm-completes-fourth-medical-mission-ukraine-providing-surgical-trainings

Where water supply is limited, women and girls' hygiene issues are especially acute, as they are forced to compromise water use for hygiene purposes in favour of water for drinking.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-integrating-gender-equality-humanitarian-needs-assessments-wash-cluster-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Jun 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, 24 June marks four months–since the invasion and full-scale war in Ukraine. Millions of civilians in Government-controlled and non-Government-controlled areas have been affected., The situation is dire in the Donbas, especially in Sievierodonetsk in Luhanska oblast and in eastern Donetska oblast. Humanitarian access is restricted and, at times, impossible., The number of civilian casualties surpassed 10,000, including 4,662 killed and 5,803 injured., On 20 June, a 12-truck inter-agency convoy delivered critical supplies to assist 64,000 people in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in the GCA of Donetska oblast., 8.85 million people have received humanitarian assistance since 24 February. The number of humanitarian partners has quadrupled since September 2021 to 320 organizations., Situation Overview, General security and humanitarian situation, Nearly four months since the start of the war in Ukraine, the humanitarian situation across the country—particularly in the eastern Donbas region—is extremely alarming and continues to deteriorate rapidly. The lack of humanitarian access due to ongoing conflict has prevented aid workers from providing life-saving assistance to people affected in several parts of Ukraine. Over the last week, active hostilities continued to escalate, especially in Luhanska and Donetska oblasts in eastern Ukraine, taking an enormous toll on civilians, including aid workers. In both Government- and non-Government-controlled areas of the two oblasts, there have been reports of dozens of civilians killed, hundreds injured, while many more are caught up in places without adequate access to vital services and supplies, including water, food, healthcare or electricity., The UN has received reliable reports of widespread shelling of residential areas and critical infrastructure—including several bridges—in the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, and surrounding villages across Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Luhanska oblast, severely disrupting essential services and access to the region. Although insecurity has made it impossible to determine or verify exact numbers, humanitarian partners who have been in Sievierodonetsk until recently informed that thousands of people are still in the city, including hundreds who are taking shelter in the bunkers of the Azot plant. Civilians in the city are struggling to have access to piped water, sanitation, health services or electricity. They are experiencing constant clashes and bombardments, with no guarantees to safely evacuate the area. In addition, another 30,000 people reportedly remain in Lysychansk (15,000) and neighbouring villages (15,000)—estimates from the local authorities—enduring intense hostilities. The disruption of essential services is particularly affecting health care, according to information gathered by UN agencies and NGOs. Reportedly, 19 health facilities have been hit in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, causing the total interruption of medical services in the former and leaving the latter with only one functional medical facility, when people need it the most. To date, the parties to the conflict have not reached an agreement to either facilitate safe evacuations of civilians or enable access to humanitarians to provide urgent assistance in the city., The situation is also dire in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetsk oblast, where daily shelling and bombardments are further impacting civilian areas and leading to civilian casualties, affecting areas dangerously close to UN facilities and to the homes of humanitarian staff in Donetsk city. The week-long shelling in Donetsk city intensified in recent days, and on 13 June a market and apartment building were struck in the city centre, not far from the UN compound., On the same day, at least five health facilities were hit by shelling, including a maternity ward. Humanitarians on the ground informed that no one was killed or injured, but some pregnant women had to be transferred to other hospitals.Overall, over the last week, dozens of people were reportedly killed or injured, hundreds of critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, hospitals, markets, were reportedly hit across the oblast. This is making life nearly unbearable for people who are also facing severe water shortages and, sometimes, unable to leave their homes for days due to insecurity. Insecurity prevented the UN from verifying the exact figures., Elsewhere, sustained shelling was reported in the eastern Kharkivska oblast and fighting and hostilities continued in the south of the country throughout the week. This is along with daily reports of airstrikes right across the country, including in Zaporizka oblast in the south-east, Dnipropetrovska in the centre and Sumska in the north, as well as Lvivska and Ternopilska in the west.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-22-jun-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 22 June 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,23 Jun 2022,"Date: 23 June 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 22 June 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 10,465 civilian casualties in the country: 4,662 killed and 5,803 injured. This included:, a total of 4,662 killed (1,789 men, 1,207 women, 131 girls, and 148 boys, as well as 41 children and 1,346 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,803 injured (1,177 men, 820 women, 131 girls, and 169 boys, as well as 179 children and 3,327 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,945 casualties (2,725 killed and 3,220 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,995 casualties (2,539 killed and 2,456 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 950 casualties (186 killed and 764 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,520 casualties (1,937 killed and 2,583 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 21 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 22 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 22 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-22-june-2022-enruuk

The Russian military blew up the bridge connecting Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, complicating the resupply of Ukrainian forces and the evacuation of civilians (The Telegraph, 12 June 2022). Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force struck several Russian positions and ammunition depots in the Kherson region for the second consecutive week, inflicting losses on the Russian side (24 Channel, 17 June 2022)., Russian forces continued shelling civilian infrastructure in southern and eastern Ukraine last week, killing dozens of civilians. Additionally, at least six civilians were killed by mines and other remote explosives in the Odesa, Kherson, and Sumy regions. Meanwhile, two incidents of rape perpetrated by Russian soldiers were reported in the Zaporizhia region last week.

Between 1 and 11 June the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted an area baseline assessment of 728 hromadas* hosting IDPs in Zakarpatska, Lvivska, Ivano-Frankivska, Chernivetska, Kirovohradska, Kyivska, Odeska, Ternopilska, Vinnytska, Volynska, Khmelnytska, Zhytomyrska, and Poltavska oblasts in order to gather initial trends on the number and geographic location of officially recorded internally displaced persons., This routine assessment supports the targeting and provision of humanitarian assistance to the affected population and serves as a preliminary source to identify oblasts and hromadas hosting high numbers of IDPs., IOM compiled information on more than 1,400,000 IDPs in the 13 oblasts covered by Round 5 of DTM Area Baseline. Poltavska, Zakarpatska, and Lviviska oblasts have the highest number of displaced each hosting over 140,000 IDPs., Poltavskyi, Vinnytskyi, Khmelnytskyi, Cnernivetskyi, and Ivano-Frankivskyi raions have reported the largest populations of IDPs, with over 54,000 per raion., IDPs' most frequent oblasts of origin have been Donetska, Kharkivska , Luhanska and Kyivska., The data presented are sourced from official IDP data recorded by hromada officials, likely representing an undercount of those who were forced to flee their homes (see methodology note on page 5).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-area-baseline-report-round-5-23-june-2022-enuk
"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus (11 - 17 June 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,23 Jun 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the military invasion of Ukraine continued with heavy fighting in the eastern and southern regions. The invasion continues to drive demonstration activity in solidarity with Ukraine. Attacks against police offices and private property continued in Russia against the backdrop of mass arrests of anti-war activists. A deadly clash broke out on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Demonstrations against fuel price hikes and LGBT+ discrimination continued across Europe. Meanwhile, demonstrations in solidarity with asylum seekers and migrant workers were held in the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively., ​​In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued last week, as Russian forces continued their attempts to seize Severodonetsk and establish full control over the Luhansk region. The Russian military blew up the bridge connecting Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, complicating the resupply of Ukrainian forces and the evacuation of civilians (The Telegraph, 12 June 2022). Intense fighting also continued in the Kharkiv region, where Russian forces attempted to push the Ukrainian army away from the Russian-Ukrainian border and renewed their offensive toward the Donetsk region south of Izium (ISW, 17 June 2022; Kyiv Independent, 18 June 2022). For the second consecutive week, the Ukrainian air force struck several Russian positions and ammunition depots in the Kherson region, inflicting losses on the Russian side (24 Channel, 17 June 2022)., Russian forces continued shelling civilian infrastructure in the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine last week, killing dozens of civilians.1 Russian forces also launched missiles at several western regions of the country, albeit most of these attacks were intercepted by Ukrainian air defense (NV, 14 June 2022; Ukrainska Pravda, 15 June 2022). Additionally, at least six civilians were killed by mines and other remote explosives in the Odesa, Kherson, and Sumy regions. Meanwhile, two more rape incidents perpetrated by Russian soldiers were reported in the Zaporizhia region last week. The actual extent of Russian sexual violence in Ukraine is likely much higher than that which has been reported but remains hard to verify (Democracy Now, 9 June 2022)., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine took place across Europe last week, with rallies recorded in Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and** Serbia**., In Russia, unknown groups carried out at least five attacks on police offices or private property with pro-war symbols across the country last week. Attacks included Molotov cocktail attacks against a Federal Security Service’s office in Krasnodar and a police office in Gedzhukh, and the burning of a car in Nizhny Novgorod that belonged to the founder of a foundation that collects assistance for Russian forces fighting in Ukraine. This violence contributed to the 46% increase in violence in Russia in the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month. Meanwhile, in Moscow, authorities arrested around 50 activists who had previously taken part in anti-war protests to prevent them from organizing demonstrations or protests coinciding with Russia Day — the country’s national holiday — on 12 June (RFE/RL, 12 June 2022). Despite the preventive arrests, several anti-war one-person pickets were held on Russia Day in the capital; these protesters were also arrested (Activatica, 12 June 2022)., Less than two weeks since the last clash, another deadly firefight took place on the disputed border between **Kyrgyzstan **and **Tajikistan **last week. The incident took place between the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan and the Israfa district of Tajikistan and resulted in the death of a Tajik border guard and the wounding of three others. Authorities of both states accuse the other of initiating the violence (Al Jazeera, 14 June 2022). Much of the 970-kilometer border between the countries is yet to be demarcated (RFE/RL, 14 June 2022), prompting sporadic outbreaks of violence (for more, see this ACLED report on violence along the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border)., LGBT+ pride marches coinciding with LGBT+ Pride Month continued across Europe last week, with demonstrations recorded in **Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, **and Slovenia. Events turned violent in Bordeaux, France, where a group of about 15 men described as far-right activists threw rocks and bottles at marchers and insulted them with homophobic slurs (Actu, 13 June 2022). Meanwhile, clashes occurred between marching LGBT+ community members and counter-demonstrating far-right groups in Austria., Demonstration activity against rising fuel costs and inflation also continued across the continent last week, with demonstrations recorded in Albania, Cyprus, France, **Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Moldova, Monaco, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, **and the United Kingdom., In the United Kingdom, 11 anti-racist demonstration events were recorded last week against the government’s Rwanda asylum plan. Amid the demonstrations, people gathered outside two immigration centers and two airports in order to physically obstruct and barricade roads and buildings to stop the deportations of migrants, leading to the arrests of 11 demonstrators. The Rwandan asylum plan, announced by the government in April, provides for the deportation of some asylum seekers to Rwanda for the processing of their claims (BBC, 17 June 2022). The first deportation flight to Rwanda was canceled after the European Court of Human Rights ruled that ​​an Iraqi man would have faced “a real risk of irreversible harm” if he remained on the flight (BBC, 15 June 2022)., Meanwhile, in Italy, anti-racism demonstrators gathered in Foggia amid aggressions and violent attacks targeting migrants and foreign day laborers in the area. On 17 June, a group of youths physically assaulted a group of migrant farm workers in Foggia while they were going to work.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-central-asia-and-caucasus-11-17-june-2022

Mr. Stiller met with President Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Kuleba. Stiller emphasized that sustained attention to and support for the Ukrainian people and communities that have been impacted by the war is crucial, especially in view of the approaching winter which will be very harsh for those whose homes are damaged or completely destroyed. During his visit, Mr. Stiller met with families in Makariv whose homes had been destroyed and visited a community centre in Irpin that UNHCR had rehabilitated in 2014 to serve as a meeting place for people who had fled from Donetsk and Luhansk non-government-controlled areas. He also heard the compelling stories of several of these individuals about their terrifying experiences as displaced, for the second time., This year, World Refugee Day’s emoji was created by a Ukrainian artist, Iryna Morykvas, who fled the war in Ukraine.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Jun 2022,"Cash from WFP and a generous Ukrainian town support families whose lives have been destroyed by conflict. WFP staffer Edward Johnson went to visit them., The principal of Severynivka’s primary school sent the children and teachers home in April. They are yet to return. Gone are the familiar sounds of children chattering or echoing school bells along the pristine corridors. During my two days there, I only ever heard the faint rumble of a washing machine, two chirping cockatiels and the occasional yap of a pug., Classroom desks are now used as ironing tables and baby changing stations. The small chairs have been repurposed as bedside tables, and where there once was a stack of math books, there's now a large blue and white cage for a guinea pig named Mable., A total 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine due to the conflict and around 4.8 million are taking refuge in neighbouring countries (as of 13 June). Since March, there has been a steady stream of people arriving in the central Ukrainian town of Severynikva. It’s a well-connected pastoral community with a booming reputation. Its claim to fame is that Ukraine's largest raspberry pie (18 metres long) was made there. The residents ate it in four minutes., These days, the town's reputation is one of overwhelming generosity. Its 8,000 residents, while not especially wealthy, have welcomed over 2,000 displaced people into its homes and school for no other reason than they believe it’s the right thing to do. People now sleep in repurposed classrooms, with pupils back to online learning., “We realize we could be in their position now,” says Yevhen the deputy head of administration for the municipality. “So today, if there is a chance to help someone, every member of our community is glad to do so.”, Most arrivals carry few possessions – whatever fits into a bag, usually. But they are soon equipped with clothes, toiletries and, importantly, a peaceful place to stay., “We're a small community but we have one big heart,” says school principal Oleg., The bedframes and mattresses donated by residents sit beneath blackboards. Bookshelves for encyclopaedias now host framed family photos, identity documents, toothbrushes, house keys and other personal belongings grabbed in the moments people left their homes., The centre of the school building is a canteen where Severynivka's citizens operate in shifts to provide three meals a day for the residents. Like many items in the school-hotel, food is donated by the community or bought in bulk when residents pool their cash., Ukrainian hospitality norms dictate that even I receive three meals there during my visit. I can vouch that the battered fish, dill potatoes, vegetable soup, cookies and bottomless raspberry tea on offer were all nourishing and comforting., Once new residents arrive, Oleg takes them over the road to the municipal hall. There, each family has the opportunity to register for financial support from the World Food Programme (WFP) by scanning a unique QR code which directs them to a registration site., After leaving Ukraine in 2018, WFP re-established a presence in Ukraine this year. The immediate priorities are “to ensure that we reach people wherever they need us,” explained Emergency Coordinator Matthew Hollingworth., “We do this in two main ways: through cash and food. WFP signed an agreement with the government in May, which was critical in helping us to identify internally displaced people and others who needed our support. By doing this, WFP increased our cash transfers six-fold in just one month., ""People who register are getting their cash just 72 hours later to cover their food needs as well as medicine and clothes. It was also important that we moved from one-off rations to 30-day food parcels that families can rely on. WFP are now providing pasta, rice, oil and tinned meat.”, Olena, mother of three who drove hundreds of kilometres through active fighting to reach the safety of Severynivka, says: “[We] bought some stuff for the kids, some detergent, shampoo, hygiene stuff. And we are saving the rest for now. We have no idea what's next for us.”, “We are planning on using the money for housing. We really want to rent a place where we could live. This school is temporary, and we want to rent our own place; we're looking for a place now.”, Every family has unique requirements, so WFP provides them with cash support. That money offers both the opportunities to pay for the services and goods they each need, while local businesses and economies receive a fresh injection of hard currency., One in three households in Ukraine is food-insecure, rising to one in two in some areas in the east and south of Ukraine. Cash helps families to boost their food security when they need help the most., WFP has launched and rapidly scaled up its operations over the last 3 months, and is now providing cash and food to families affected by the conflict. By the end of June WFP will be supporting more than 3 million people each month to meet their immediate needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-were-small-community-we-have-one-big-heart

Major attacks continue to be reported across the country, resulting in widescale destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement.
Over the last two weeks, fighting has continued to be concentrated in Eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas, Kharkiv, and Luhansk regions. The Russian Federation military recently intensified shelling in the cities of Kharkiv, Lysychansk, and Severodonetsk. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian Federation forces occupy all residential areas of Severodonetsk, and the Luhansk Regional Military Administration reports that they have seized Metelkine, just east of the city. In addition, there are major concerns and ongoing negotiations regarding 500 civilians trapped in the industrial district of Azot in Severodonetsk. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified that between 24 February and 21 June, there have been 10,403 civilian casualties in the country, including 4,634 persons killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher.
Reports of airstrikes and other fighting continue across the country. Air defense systems shot down a military object in the Kyiv region on 19 June, there is intensive fighting in Kherson, and this week cruise missiles were shot down above Lviv and Ternopil, according to Ukrainian officials.
Artillery and mortar fire in the Chenihiv and Sumy regions were also reported, as was fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region. Widespread use of mines on land and at sea has been widely reported. Peter Adams, Special Adviser on Marine Security at the International Maritime Organization, noted that clearing Ukrainian ports of mines would likely take several months.
IOM is particularly concerned about ongoing internal and cross-border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. A new survey conducted by IOM from 16 April to 31 May (publication forthcoming) indicates that approximately half of the interviewees returning to Ukraine intend to stay, while one quarter intend a short visit and another quarter do not know. The survey findings also suggest that a mix of push and pull factors are contributing to those returning and intending to stay, with some 33 per cent reporting factors such as not being able to afford living costs, while 43 per cent reported family reunification as a major factor. The crisis in and around Ukraine continues to evolve, with ongoing displacement and movement underlining the need for a mixture of continued humanitarian support as well as longer-term solutions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-22-23-june-2022

No mercy for civilians: Troubling accounts from the MSF medical train in Ukraine [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",22 Jun 2022,"Data and patient accounts reveal “no mercy” for civilians in Ukraine war, LVIV/BRUSSELS – Medical data and accounts from patients evacuated on Médecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) medical referral train show that the war in Ukraine is being conducted with an outrageous lack of care to distinguish and protect civilians. Over 40 per cent of the war-wounded on the train have been elderly people and children with blast wounds, traumatic amputations, shrapnel and gunshot wounds. This points to a lack of respect for civilian protection which is a serious violation of international humanitarian law, MSF said., Between 31 March and 6 June, MSF medically evacuated 653 patients by train from war-affected areas in the east of Ukraine to hospitals in safer parts of the country. On the 20- to 30-hour journey, nurses and doctors monitored patients and provided care to keep them stable. Many people shared their harrowing experiences with the MSF staff., “Our patients’ wounds and the stories they tell show unquestionably the shocking level of suffering the indiscriminate violence of this war is inflicting on civilians,” said Christopher Stokes, MSF emergency coordinator. “Many patients on the MSF train were wounded by military strikes that hit civilian residential areas.”, “Although we cannot specifically point to an intention to target civilians, the decision to use heavy weaponry en masse on densely populated areas means that civilians are inescapably, and are therefore knowingly, being killed and wounded,” said Stokes., From the accounts of patients, several consistent and harrowing themes emerged:, Further details of the nature of the attacks and consequences of the war on civilians are outlined in our briefing note, No mercy for civilians: Troubling accounts from the MSF medical train in Ukraine, below., People referred on the train are mostly either long-term hospitalised patients or recent war-wounded who need post-operative care following traumatic injuries. Of more than 600 patients transported and cared for on MSF’s medical train over two months, 355 were injured as a direct result of the war. The overwhelming majority of these patients suffered blast injuries. And 11 per cent of war-related trauma patients were younger than 18, and 30 per cent older than 60., “I was on my way to the toilet when an explosion happened. I lost consciousness and fell,” a 92-year-old woman from Lyman, Donetsk region, recounted. “Once I came around, my face was covered in dry blood. I had an open arm fracture and must have also broken my nose when I fell.”, “I was alone and in pain screaming for help but no one heard me,” the woman continued. “Later, a volunteer found me and spent two days trying to call an ambulance that would get me into a hospital.”, Blast injuries caused 73 per cent of the war-related trauma cases, with 20 per cent caused by shrapnel or gunshots and the rest by other violent incidents. More than 10 per cent of war-trauma patients had lost one or more limbs, the youngest just six years old., MSF patients and their caretakers on the train tell unimaginable stories of children, men and women trapped in conflict, bombed in shelters, attacked during evacuations and seriously injured in explosions, by bombs, by gunshots, or by mines and shrapnel. Some patients report being injured in their homes., Others came under heavy weapons fire as they tried to travel to safer areas. Most patients we talked to when designating who is responsible for their injuries pointed at Russian and Russian-backed military forces., “As in all conflicts, MSF calls on all armed groups to respect international humanitarian law and abide by their obligations to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure,” said Dr Bertrand Draguez, MSF president. “The must allow people to flee to safety, and allow for the safe and timely evacuation of the sick and wounded.”, “In addition, we call for humanitarian access to be able to provide assistance to people no matter where they are,” said Dr Draguez. “In Ukraine, we see, at a minimum, indiscriminate attacks on civilians so our call is particularly urgent.”, MSF in Ukraine, MSF first worked in Ukraine in 1999. Since 24 February 2022, we have significantly scaled up and reoriented our activities to respond to the needs created by the war in Ukraine. This includes a medical referral train that receives patients from hospitals near to the frontlines in the east that are receiving or preparing to receive influxes of newly wounded patients, and transfers them to hospitals in the west of the country, where they can continue their treatment. The medical train is run in collaboration with Ukraine's Ministry of Health and National Railways., In the east and south, MSF also runs an ambulance referral system. While MSF provides medical assistance in the regions affected by heavy fighting in the east and south of Ukraine and on the referral train, we do not have direct access to the places most of our patients come from and where fighting is most brutal., MSF is also providing medical and humanitarian assistance to people displaced into other areas of Ukraine, including providing mental healthcare, treating survivors of sexual violence, running mobile clinics and donating medical and other supplies to hospitals. Surgical teams are also assisting in hospitals in the east and south, where MSF also provides ambulance referral between hospitals. Our teams also provide humanitarian assistance to people from Ukraine in neighbouring Belarus, Poland, Russia and Slovakia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/no-mercy-civilians-troubling-accounts-msf-medical-train-ukraine-enruuk

Protection and Human Rights",23 Mar 2022,"Since 2014, conflict has been ongoing between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed armed groups in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region with serious consequences for children’s rights. Between April 2014 and August 2020, 39 children were reportedly killed and 137 injured due to mines and explosives, representing around a third of all reported child casualties, and many children have been left with disabilities and invisible psychological scars. The UN estimates that more than 750 schools have been damaged since 2014, disrupting children’s education., Hostilities seriously escalated last month, when Russia invaded Ukraine, following weeks of mounting tensions, build-up of Russian military presence along the border, and Russia’s February 21 decision to recognize the independence of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. The significant escalation has already had devastating impacts on children, and immediate action is needed to protect children from further harm. Civilian-populated areas and infrastructure have been attacked, including schools and hospitals, and the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons, such as ballistic missiles and cluster bombs, has caused mass destruction. Civilian casualties, including children, continue to grow, with real numbers feared to be much higher than official tallies. An alarming scale of displacement raises further concerns for Ukraine’s 7.5 million children., Since 2017, Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict (Watchlist) has called on the UN Secretary-General to add Ukraine as a ‘situation of concern’ in his annual report on children and armed conflict (CAAC) and reiterates its call ahead of the publication of the 2022 annual report. A global network of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that strives to end violations against children in armed conflicts and guarantee their rights, Watchlist has developed this briefing note to highlight key ongoing and growing concerns for the protection of children in Ukraine one month since the escalation of hostilities began and provide recommendations to mitigate harm.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/briefing-note-children-and-armed-conflict-concerns-ukraine-march-2022
Ukraine: Russian Nobel winner praises UNICEF as ‘excellent’ choice to distribute $103.5 million auction proceeds,News and Press Release,UN News,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",22 Jun 2022,"The Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov who auctioned off his gold medal to raise money for child refugees on Monday, has told UN News that the record-breaking sale of $103.5 million proved that “sometimes humanity can come together, and show solidarity”., The editor in chief of the independent Russian news service, Novaya Gazeta – which was shuttered by the Kremlin in March following sweeping new restrictions on journalists in the wake of the Ukraine invasion – said that he and his colleagues chose the UN Children’s Fund UNICEF as the best non-governmental organization for the job of ensuring that the funds would reach all Ukrainian children in need., ‘This is what we need’, “UNICEF is absolutely non-toxic”, Mr. Muratov told the Russian service of UN News, in an exclusive interview on Tuesday, following the auction. “They have excellent professionals, they have programmes, they report on how and what they do - this is what we need., “We wrote them a letter, got a response from them, I have it. It was important for me, that UNICEF noted that the money would go to all countries that border Ukraine, where refugees are located - without exception.”, He said he hoped Ukrainian children who were now in Russia, would also benefit: “There are more than one and a half million refugees in Russia, maybe a little less. Therefore, [we chose] UNICEF, which has such opportunities, and which understands very well that it has not a political, but a humanitarian mission.”, The Russian Nobel Laureate, who was awarded the gold medal in October 2021, along with journalist Maria Ressa of the Philippines - for services to free speech and fearless reporting in the face of harassment and death threats – said that never in his “wildest dreams” had he expected the award to fetch such a large sum., His most optimistic hope was that it might reach $5 million., ‘Background checks’, Mr. Muratov said that the auctioneers at UNICEF’s request, had done background checks on the various bidders, including the eventual winning bid, to ensure that the source of the money was not an oligarch, or from any illegal criminal operation such as human or drugs traffickers., “They checked via the banking system, the financial system, and all that I can say 100 percent, which I was also informed of, notified and shown, is that this is absolutely transparent, and transparent money”, he told UN News., He would not however, reveal the identity of the winning bidder – indicating that he did not know the name, and that anonymity had been guaranteed: “If I knew, I would not disclosed it, because this is a pure conflict of interest: people agreed to the rules that we proposed, and then we would have taken and violated the rules. That doesn't work.”, 'It's my country's fault', Explaining the numerous reasons why his publication could not imagine allowing a Russian bidder to enter the running, or why he thought his paper should not hand the money directly to the Ukrainian Government, he said that would be a non-starter given the state of the war., If at first [Ukrainians] had anger, now they are furious – their country is being torn apart, from the face of the earth…When you see all this every second, you constantly have an alarm sound, you live between an apartment and a bomb shelter…It's my country's fault.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-nobel-winner-praises-unicef-excellent-choice-distribute-1035-million-auction-proceeds

This included:, a total of 4,634 killed (1,780 men, 1,194 women, 131 girls, and 148 boys, as well as 41 children and 1,340 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,769 injured (1,163 men, 817 women, 131 girls, and 169 boys, as well as 178 children and 3,311 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,919 casualties (2,710 killed and 3,209 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,973 casualties (2,524 killed and 2,449 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 946 casualties (186 killed and 760 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,484 casualties (1,924 killed and 2,560 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 20 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 21 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.

Kharkiv snapshot: Civilian protection needs & responses in Ukraine,Assessment,NP,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jun 2022,"BACKGROUND, This snapshot presents key conclusions from a rapid protection assessment conducted in Kharkiv and Chuhuiv in May 2022 by Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP). It builds on analysis and recommendations published earlier in May 2022 as part of a broader assessment of protection needs and responses in Ukraine., The snapshot demonstrates that in Kharkiv and surrounds, there is an ongoing protection crisis that predominantly impacts the elderly and people with disabilities. Unable or unwilling to evacuate, many of those who are older, have disabilities, or those who are their carers, are unable to access shelters during ongoing shelling and missile attacks. For those who can move to bunkers or other shelters, these are often ill-equipped to serve the hundreds of people who continue to use them for safety from attacks., These populations are often isolated from public and humanitarian services, and continue to struggle in the face of lack of medicines, food, and other essentials. This impacts people returning to these areas, despite ongoing risk. These challenges are exacerbated in areas occupied by Russian forces and close to frontlines., This snapshot builds on over 50 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and meetings included in the initial assessment, providing a snapshot analysis of the situation in Kharkiv and Chuhuiv. The rapid assessment took place over three days in late May 2022, comprising an additional 15 KIIs with civilians and local humanitarians directly impacted by the conflict, as well as field observations and desk research., In interviews with civilians, the NP assessment team sought to evaluate protection concerns across different age, gender, and socio-economic demographics; experiences of displacement, evacuation, and return; safety and security; protection risks to vulnerable groups, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and children; and access to humanitarian services., ""My husband and I retired so we took a decision not to evacuate. Our son stayed too. He didn’t want to leave us. We’ve been in [the bomb shelter] since the first day of the war. Even here, a sound of shelling is very loud. My husband and son sometimes go outside but I’m too scared"" - Valentina, an elderly resident in Chuhuiv.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/kharkiv-snapshot-civilian-protection-needs-responses-ukraine
Forcibly displaced Ukrainians: Lessons from Syria and beyond,Analysis,Brookings Institution,Protection and Human Rights,21 Jun 2022,"Omer Karasapan
Partner - Strategies for Stability, In May 2022 as around 15 million Ukrainians fled their homes, the number of people forcefully displaced across the world passed the 100 million mark for the first time. This is equivalent to the world's 14th largest country, with 53 percent composed of internally displaced peoples (IDPs) and 47 percent of refugees fleeing their countries. Prior to this, there had been 41.1 million refugees in 2010, 71 million in 2018 (led by the 2012-2015 Syrian war upsurge), and 89 million in 2021, with conflicts in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and elsewhere causing the surge (Table 1)., Of the forcibly displaced Ukrainians, some 8 million are IDPs and 7 million are refugees, making it the most rapid and largest single increase in forcibly displaced populations since WWII. There are some 2.2 million returnees, including civilians returning to cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv as men come back to fight, and an end to the violence is unlikely anytime soon., Poland was the entry point for most Ukrainian refugees (3.7 million), including hundreds of thousands who moved further West, and another 1.5 million who have since returned home. As of June 2022, there were also over a million refugees in Russia, 700,000 in Hungary, 600,000 in Romania (283,000 returnees), and around 500,000 each in Moldova (110,000 returnees) and Slovakia (196,000 returnees). According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), these neighboring countries aside, the top three Ukrainian refugee hosts are Germany (780,000), the Czech Republic (366,000), and Turkey (145,000)., The welcome and resources made available to the Ukrainian refugees are unprecedented. Under the EU's Temporary Protection Directive, Ukrainians receive the right to work and access to health, education, housing, and other services for up to three years. Before the war, Ukrainians could enter the EU visa-free for up to three months and a million were working legally and others informally. This diaspora was important in absorbing Ukrainian refugees., The welcome is in sharp contrast to what asylum seekers from Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and non-European refugees from Ukraine have faced. Poland continues to prevent non-European migrants from entering the country from Belarus while welcoming Ukrainians. Britain is trying to ship non-European asylum seekers to Rwanda to process applications, and Denmark is likely to follow suit., This ""whole-of-the-EU"" approach to the Ukrainian refugee crisis contrasts with the 2015 refugee influx, which prompted many EU members to close their borders to refugees. Yet, the former incorporates useful lessons even though they are unlikely to be extended to non-Europeans anytime soon. While each instance of refugee flows is distinct, some broad lessons emerge. For example, we know that refugees tend to stay displaced for prolonged periods, ranging between 10 and 26 years. European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas estimates that up to 3 million Ukrainians will stay in Europe, a boon to a continent facing demographic decline., But over time, the initial welcome fades. In Turkey the 72 percent support for Syrian refugees in 2016 changed to over 80 percent support for their repatriation---largely due to an economic downturn. Lebanon, already wary of mostly Sunni Syrians in a country with a confessional political balance, soured on refugees after the economy slowed in 2014. Russia's war on Ukraine has upended life there, but grounds for concern remain in Poland because of pre-war anti-Ukrainian animosity (Poland's Human Rights Ombudsman recorded 44,000 anti-Ukrainian hate crimes in southern Poland in 2017). While a small minority, extremists can have an oversized role over time. Turkey's ""Victory Party,"" which has less than 2 percent of the vote, can still dominate the news cycle with slickly produced videos mimicking the European far-right's replacement theory espousing that Syrians---roughly 3 percent of the population---are slowly taking over the country. These dynamics are not new; in 1956 when 200,000 Hungarians fled to Austria from invading Soviets, the initial welcome soon frayed and Austria asked others to accept over 90 percent of the refugees., The Center for Global Development estimates the cost of hosting Ukrainian refugees at $30 billion in the first year. Warsaw's population has increased by 15 percent, straining services like housing as rent has increased by 40 percent. Other cities have seen sharper population rises, such as Krakow (23 percent) and Gdansk (34 percent). More critically some 600,000 refugees are housed with Polish families, an untenable situation in the long run even with stipends to host families, especially in a country with saturated rental markets. Fault lines may also develop within the refugee community and back home that could exacerbate their situation., Also, while 72 percent of Syria's refugees are women and children, that number is 90 percent for Ukrainian refugees. In order to defend the nation, males ages 18-60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, thus making women and children refugees, an already at-risk population, even more vulnerable. From trafficking to child care for working women to educational challenges for children, measures need to be deployed and sustained to support women and children. Long-term separation for families portends more challenges., Gender matters in others way too. In the 2015-16 exodus to Europe of over a million mostly Syrian asylum seekers, 72 percent were males, with 43 percent between the ages of 18 and 34. Without any justification, male refugees were seen as more threatening, prone to crime or radicalization. Many were assumed to be arriving from non-conflict countries like Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey, and subsequently were portrayed as opportunists unwilling to fight for their countries. All these assumptions feed alarmist nativist narratives., We also know that it is important that host communities---often more vulnerable in society and lacking appropriate access to good jobs, housing, and other services---are supported. This will diminish potential resentment and also help prevent the false narratives of preferential treatment. Effective policies for integration are needed, from facilitating employment and access to schooling, health, education, housing, and support in learning host languages. The EU is relatively well placed to help here, less so for other refugee host communities., The longer the conflict lasts, especially as further refugee crises surge, the issue of refugee returns will arise. The World Bank's Harun Onder notes in a detailed study of Syrian refugees and their return dynamics that better conditions in countries of origin almost always encourage refugee returns as conflicts wane and human and property rights improve. Importantly, adverse conditions in host countries do not automatically lead to increased returns to home countries. However, as the Syrian experience shows, improved conditions in host countries can also lead to more returns as the considerable costs of return become more affordable. The dynamics of Ukrainian refugee returns will be affected by the large number of separated nuclear families and measures facilitating reunification.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/forcibly-displaced-ukrainians-lessons-syria-and-beyond
Diaspora Organizations and their Humanitarian Response in Ukraine in 2022,Analysis,DEMAC,Coordination,20 May 2022,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, This real-time review is part of the Diaspora Emergency Action & Coordination initiative’s (DEMAC) “Research study on diaspora humanitarian response and engagement”., On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation launched a coordinated offensive on Ukraine. The hostilities have been characterized by indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardments and have resulted in largescale displacement across the country. As of 6 April, OCHA reported that 6.5 million people are estimated to be internally displaced in Ukraine. Internal displacement has largely responded to the patterns of conflict in Ukraine, with the situation in eastern, southeastern, and northeastern Ukraine - in addition to Kyiv - being particularly volatile., Throughout the 2014 to 2022 period, Ukrainian diaspora organizations (DOs) transitioned their humanitarian activities from a spontaneous approach based on supporting those most in need to developing longer-term relationships with communities, local organizations, and hospitals requiring support. The Russian Federation military offensive on Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has once again thrust diaspora organizations into the position of being both frontline responders and important donors to local organizations and other frontline responders. Their close attention to the escalation of hostilities and their previously developed relationships in Ukraine have put them in a unique position as interlocutors between host countries and their focal points in Ukraine., To better understand the situation, DEMAC commissioned a real-time review to assess the activities, reach, and impact of Ukrainian diaspora organizations for six weeks following the offensive on Ukraine. The study commenced with a diaspora organization mapping exercise of 63 Ukrainian DOs. To support the refinement of the mapping process and to identify organizations willing to participate in the real-time review, an online survey developed on Kobo in English and Ukrainian was shared with the 20 shortlisted organizations reviewed in this study. Social media monitoring consisted of a review of selected organizations’ social media accounts between 24 February 2022 and 1 April 2022. A total of 18 key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with Ukrainian DOs (14), formal humanitarian actors (INGOs, UN agencies) (3), and DEMAC staff in Ukraine (1). To support the monitoring of diaspora organization coordination and concerns, researchers attended six weekly DEMAC-organized coordination meetings (beginning 10 March 2022) attended by diaspora and national NGOs., This report finds that many organizations were well-placed to respond to the situation in Ukraine due to experience gained during the 2014 to 2022 period in response to the annexation of Crimea and areas of eastern Ukraine. This includes the ability to leverage pre-existing contacts and partners on the ground – particularly in the health response – as well as prior experience coordinating delivery of aid to remote areas of the country. In this sense, DOs had equal or better access to Ukraine as compared to traditional humanitarian actors in the early response period. Many organizations were well-placed to continue advocacy messaging and began organizing protests prior to 24 February 2022 in response to anticipated hostilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/diaspora-organizations-and-their-humanitarian-response-ukraine-2022

Ukraine: Humanitarian situation deteriorates as major cities bear the brunt of heavy fighting [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Health,22 Jun 2022,"The humanitarian situation of millions of civilians is particularly concerning in densely populated areas affected by the ongoing hostilities., The impact of the fighting is severe in cities such as Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and other urban areas, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned on Wednesday., Homes, schools, hospitals, bridges, and other infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed due to heavy fighting, as have vital services. People’s lives are at risk and many lack access to life-saving services., Many of those who remain are elderly and the most vulnerable, including people with chronic diseases like diabetes, and hypertension who no longer have access to their treatments. Shortages of essential medicine are a rising problem that carry potentially severe health consequences., “Parties to the conflict have the obligation to take all necessary precautions to spare civilians and essential infrastructure. They should also find agreements to ensure safe passage for civilians to move to safer locations of their choice and to facilitate the delivery of much needed impartial humanitarian aid. The ICRC stands ready as neutral intermediary to facilitate such agreements,” said Pascal Hundt, the ICRC head of delegation in Ukraine., “Hospitals, schools, water and electrical facilities must be protected. Attacks on such facilities only lead to more human suffering.”, The ICRC continues to work in areas affected by the fighting to carry out protection activities and support people with emergency assistance such as food, water, and other vital supplies. We also support hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and medicines., Over the last months and despite difficult security conditions in and around cities, often close to changing front lines, the ICRC carried out protection and assistance operations, including:, Since the beginning of May, ICRC teams have assisted over 900,000 vulnerable people with food, livelihood and cash assistance as well as hygiene material. Medicines and equipment were provided to over 50 health structures to help treat some 58,000 people. We also assisted and continue assisting water utilities to restore and maintain vital water supplies benefitting over 9 million people through the supply of water treatment chemicals and materials. Some 650 civilians have been evacuated to safer places., Around Donetsk the ICRC has continued to deliver food, potable water, basic medical and sanitary material to hospitals, plastic and wooden sheeting for emergency repairs of housing. For instance, several rounds of distribution of food, hygienic items for civilians have recently taken place, as well as potable water to hospitals., In and around Severodonetsk, access has been particularly difficult due to the intensity of the fighting, creating immense suffering among civilians. Deliveries of food, water and medical supplies have become very challenging. Evacuations of civilians were proposed but did not take place due to an absence of agreement between the parties., In Lysychansk we were able to support the water and gas system and with medical supplies for the civilian population., In the Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, as well as on Sloviansk in the Donetsk region, the ICRC supports Ukraine Red Cross Society branches to maintain food and water deliveries to particularly vulnerable groups, and distributes food and hygiene supplies near the front lines., ** Note to editors and producers:**, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war.

"In Ukraine, Women Should Be Protected from Violence in War and Peace",News and Press Release,HRW,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jun 2022,"Violence against Women Treaty Can Support Rape, Domestic Abuse Survivors, Hillary Margolis
Senior Researcher, Women's Rights Division
hillarymargo, After more than a decade of advocacy by women’s rights groups, and amid an armed conflict following Russia’s full-scale invasion, as well as a bid for European Union membership, on Monday Ukraine’s parliament took an important step in combating violence against women and girls. By an overwhelming majority, Ukraine’s parliament approved ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Domestic Violence and Violence against Women, known as the Istanbul Convention., The convention establishes legally binding standards for governments to prevent violence against all women and girls, to support survivors, and to hold abusers to account., Like all human rights treaties, it also applies during armed conflict. Its implementation in Ukraine could not be more urgent., Amid concerns about violence against women and girls during the war, the treaty commits the government to providing essential services and pathways to justice for victims of sexual and other gender-based violence, including rape. Crucially, it includes clear benchmarks for a victim-centered response that minimizes additional trauma and harm to survivors of violence., Importantly, it does the same for domestic violence, which often increases during or in the wake of armed conflict as physical, emotional, and economic challenges intensify and social support systems disappear. Long before February’s escalation of the war in Ukraine, activists and the public had been calling on the government to ratify the convention and take stronger measures to combat domestic violence and the traditional attitudes and stereotypes that feed it. They also called for harsher punishments for abusers., The international community should not forget that, perhaps more than ever, Ukraine’s government and civil society need support to ensure that the most fundamental and important elements of gender-based violence response are in place. This includes comprehensive post-rape care, including emergency contraception, post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV, access to abortion, and mental health care. It also includes investigations by experts trained in survivor-centered, trauma-informed approaches to evidence collection and interviewing., Ukraine’s government should complete procedures to ratify this powerful treaty and continue its work to bring national legislation in line with the convention. The government should implement measures that adhere to the highest standards in prevention of and response to domestic and other violence against women and girls., War or not, these measures are crucial to improving the lives of women and girls affected by violence today and well into the future.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-women-should-be-protected-violence-war-and-peace

"Warning incitement of racial, religious hatred can trigger atrocity crimes, Special Adviser stresses states’ legal obligation to prevent genocide",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jun 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9069TH MEETING (AM)
SC/14939
21 JUNE 2022, Russian Federation’s Disinformation Campaign Aimed to Justify Invasion of Ukraine, Several Speakers Stress, Advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is prohibited by law, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Nderitu told the Security Council today, stressing that these acts represent potential triggers for the commission of atrocity crimes., “The prevention of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes is a legal obligation for States under international law,” she stressed. The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide — which emerged from the shadows of the Holocaust — identifies as punishable offenses conspiracy to commit, direct and attempt to commit genocide., In a wide-ranging debate on “incitement to violence leading to atrocity crimes”, organized by Albania, as Council President for June, Ms. Nderitu said that even before the start of the conflict in Ukraine, her office was working with the United Nations country team to support intercommunal dialogue., She said that, because determination of the commission of genocide can only be made by a court of competent jurisdiction, she could only but reiterate the call to end the war, ensure protection of civilians and accelerate diplomatic efforts to make both possible. The Council must do its part by proposing a road map that considers that “peace itself is a process that is not indifferent to injustice”., Liubov Tsybulska, Head of the Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security, underscored that “Russia wants to destroy Ukraine”, both literally — by killing and raping — and in a broader sense, eliminating its culture, language and history. She recounted Ukraine’s struggle for survival against the Russian Federation’s attempts at conquest — detailing mass famines; the murder and torture of Ukrainian writers, artists and architects in the 1930s; and the mass deportation of Ukrainian dissidents in the 1960s., “This is exactly what is happening now,” she stressed. While such crimes are “the modus operandi of the Kremlin”, the current war is extraordinary, with the Russian army demonstrating “barbarity that is difficult to imagine in the twenty-first century”. She urged the Council to understand that the threat exists not only for Ukrainians but for the entire world., Along similar lines, Jared Andrew Cohen, CEO of Jigsaw and Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that, for the war on Ukraine, there are more hours of footage uploaded to YouTube, TikTok and other platforms than there are minutes of the conflict. “Like land, air and sea, the Internet has become a critical domain to occupy during war.”, Nowhere has this been more evident than Ukraine, he said, where the Russian Federation has deployed distributed denial-of-service, or “DDoS”, attacks that have taken down connectivity by 15 to 20 per cent, and on many occasions, dropped Internet connectivity to zero. His team’s research confirms the ability to leverage disinformation to motivate violence, he added, noting that Russian propaganda that Ukrainians are “Nazis” likely dehumanized Ukrainians in the eyes of Russian soldiers, leading to the many war crimes now alleged against them., In the ensuing debate, several delegates evoked the calamitous consequences of inciting one group of people against another, with many recalling tragedies endured during the Second World War, in Rwanda in 1994, in Srebrenica in 1995 and in Myanmar more recently. Leading the discussion, Albania’s delegate spoke in his national capacity to recall how, in the early 1930s, the Nazis used virulently anti‑Semitic newspapers to incite Germans into persecuting Jews. On the eve of the invasion, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin described Ukraine as an “artificial creation of the Bolsheviks”, he said, stressing that “what begins with dehumanizing words ends in bloodshed”., Lithuania’s representative, speaking also for Estonia and Latvia, said that for years, Ukraine has been a target of Russian disinformation campaigns, aimed at justifying an invasion. “If there is no clear and strong international response to stop it, the aggression against Ukraine will be just the beginning,” he warned, a point echoed by Slovakia’s delegate, who said that the pretexts under which Moscow invaded Ukraine resemble past patterns of framing a targeted group as an existential threat in order to present war as defensive and inevitable., In turn, the Russian Federation’s delegate blamed Ukraine’s propaganda for pushing that country into Nazism. He denounced the demonizing of his country, as well as hatred of everything Russian, introduced year after year, with support from the United States and other Western allies. After the 2014 Maidan coup, the Kyiv regime incited violence against Russian-speaking inhabitants of Ukraine, dubbing all those against it as terrorists, separatist puppets and monsters., The United States delegate, meanwhile, strongly rejected Moscow’s efforts to distort history, noting that the General Assembly rejected its false narrative on Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Pointing out that some have ignored that the Russian Federation illegally invaded its neighbour, he urged the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its forces and embrace diplomacy., China’s representative countered, urging certain countries to stop forcing others to take sides. The cold war mentality, the logic of hegemony and bloc politics “have long outlived their usefulness”, he added., Offering a word of caution, Ukraine’s delegate warned delegates not to be deceived by Moscow’s anti‑fascist rhetoric, denouncing it as “another manifestation of aggressive mimicry”. Noting that, a week ago, President Putin claimed that “the former Soviet Union was historical Russia”, he asked: “What is next?”, Also speaking were representatives of the United Kingdom, Norway, France, Kenya, Ireland, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana and India., The meeting began at 10:03 a.m. and ended at 12:47 p.m., Briefings, ALICE NDERITU, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, said her office acts as a catalyst to raise awareness on the causes and dynamics of genocide, alert relevant actors to a risk of genocide and mobilize for appropriate action. In addition, since 2019, her office has served as the focal point within the United Nations system for implementation of the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech. She described the impact of divisive narratives on incitement to violence, recalling events leading to the Holocaust, in Rwanda in 1994 and in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995. The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide emerged from the shadows of the Holocaust, while the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights outlines that public incitement to genocide is a crime prohibited under international law., She said the Genocide Convention identifies as punishable offenses conspiracy to commit genocide, direct attempts to commit genocide and complicity in genocide. “The prevention of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes is a legal obligation for States under international law,” she explained, noting that she has engaged States on the need to reinforce prevention and accountability efforts. In an 18 March statement, she acknowledged the 16 March order by the International Court of Justice indicating provisional measures in the case concerning allegations of genocide, under the Genocide Convention., She said she also called for the cessation of hostilities and the protection of civilians, acknowledged the important role of regional and international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, and stressed the importance for all States to adhere to international human rights and international humanitarian law. Even before the conflict, her office was working with the United Nations country team in Ukraine to support intercommunal dialogue., On 14 April, she said she expressed strong concern over deteriorating conditions in Ukraine, called on those with influence to help restore peace and reminded religious leaders that advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is prohibited under international law. Noting that the Human Rights Council Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine complements the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) monitoring mission, she said it investigates alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the country. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has also announced his decision to open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine., She said determination of the commission of genocide can only be made by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without judicial or quasi-judicial powers, her office does not determine whether specific situations, either ongoing or from the past, legally qualify as the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. “My main responsibility is prevention, not adjudication,” she clarified. For that reason, she reiterated the call to end the war, ensure the protection of civilians and accelerate diplomatic efforts to make both possible. Recalling that many people believe in the United Nations and envision a world where peace and justice prevail, she said the Council members must articulate an inclusive vision and propose a road map to end the fighting., LIUBOV TSYBULSKA, Head of the Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security, underscored that “Russia wants to destroy Ukraine”, both literally — by killing and raping — and in a broader sense, eliminating its culture, language and history. She recounted Ukraine’s history — a continuous struggle for survival and independence against the Russian Federation’s attempts at conquest — detailing mass famines; the murder and torture of Ukrainian writers, artists and architects in the 1930s; and the mass deportations of Ukrainian dissidents in the 1960s. She then stressed that “this is exactly what is happening now” and pointed out that — although such crimes are “the modus operandi of the Kremlin” — the current war is extraordinary, with the Russian army demonstrating “barbarity that is difficult to imagine in the twenty-first century”., She recalled that, as soon as the full-scale invasion began, Ukrainians would send photos and videos of atrocities committed by Russian soldiers and call acquaintances and relatives in the Russian Federation to explain the horrors of this war and arouse their sympathy. Despite Ukrainian thoughts that Russians would condemn this lawlessness, what occurred was the absence of any compassion, en masse. She detailed intercepted communications between Russian soldiers and their families urging them to rape and kill Ukrainians, stressing that “these are implications of the consistent work of the Russian propaganda machine”. For years, Russian propaganda has been systematically dehumanizing and spreading hatred towards Ukraine and the West, and she said that “there is a lot of evidence for genocidal rhetoric”., Detailing several examples from Russian media and political figures, she stressed that “colonialism became a mindset for the Russian people, a mindset with no room for democracy, human rights and freedom”. Emphasizing that “the world missed how very dangerous processes have begun to unfold in Russia”, she urged those present to understand that this threat exists not only for Ukrainians, but to the entire Western world. The Russian Federation has never reflected on its historical crimes, and therefore it repeats them with impunity. The connection between what Russian propaganda has been saying for years and the mass atrocities committed by the Russian army in Ukraine must be studied, and those who have been spreading genocidal rhetoric must be held accountable. She emphasized that specific people are behind these acts that have “flooded my country with blood and tears”, calling for them to be brought to justice. “Unpunished evil returns,” she warned., JARED ANDREW COHEN, CEO of Jigsaw and Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, said that, when the Council was established, no one could have imagined a future where nearly 65 per cent of the world's population is connected to something as complex as today's Internet. For the war on Ukraine, there are more hours of footage uploaded to YouTube, TikTok and other platforms than there are minutes of the conflict. Missing from the discourse in those early decades were terms like “DDoS attack”, “malware”, “virus”, “trolling”, “online harassment”, “doxing”, “DNS poisoning” and “hacking”., But, while these concepts are new for the Security Council, the motivations behind them — and the consequences — are as familiar as war and conflict itself, he said. Noting that when he founded Jigsaw at Google in 2010 to help the next 5 billion people access the Internet, many were coming online in societies where censorship, corruption or violence were daily realities. “Not surprisingly, all of the geopolitical baggage of the physical world has spilled over online,” he said. “Like land, air and sea, the Internet has become a critical domain to occupy during war.” Within seconds, content is disseminated to billions of people, narratives are amplified to mitigate a perceived threat — or even topple democratic systems. This has brought digital and information warfare to the forefront of geopolitical conflicts., While all wars begin as cyberwars, unfolding silently, invisibly and inexpensively, he said that, today, the types of attacks have diversified and democratized. Nowhere has this been more clear than Ukraine, which since 2014 has been targeted by cyberattacks and offers the world a “crystal ball” for what is to come. He highlighted five key attack vectors, focusing first on critical infrastructure and noting that distributed denial-of-service, or “DDoS”, attacks are among the most pervasive forms of attack. In Ukraine, the Russian Federation has deployed DDoS attacks that have taken down connectivity by 15 to 20 per cent, and on multiple occasions, dropped Internet connectivity to zero. In another effort, campaigns have aimed to create resentment toward Ukrainian refugees throughout Europe, a strategy that goes beyond Ukraine's borders and focuses on grass‑roots movements to drive public and political support away from Ukrainian defence., He said there have been attacks on conversation more broadly, with authoritarian regimes developing sophisticated strategies to disorient digital conversations and completely control the narrative. He cited a case involving the creation of fake fact-checkers who sought to create confusion by ""fact-checking"" Ukrainian claims that were never made. Such attacks have been amplified by a combination of real-people trolls and advanced chatbots. He described the use of misinformation and disinformation to incite and justify extreme violence as a fourth attack vector, noting that his team’s research confirms the ability to leverage disinformation to motivate violence, especially animosity towards an outgroup. Relentless Russian propaganda to its citizens that Ukrainians are ""Nazis"" likely dehumanized Ukrainians in the eyes of Russian soldiers, leading to the many war crimes now alleged against Russian forces., He cited efforts to reconstitute the Ukrainian Internet as the Russian Internet as the fifth vector of attack. This “soft substitution” of one for the other began after the Russian invasion of Crimea and is being accelerated in Donbass. “Borders are still contested, but the digital frontier is now already frozen,” he said. “It is increasingly urgent for this body to consider the digital implications of war and explore legal revisions to cover such threats.”, Going forward, he said Jigsaw’s “Protect Your Democracy” programme, among many others, offers free tools for protecting access to the free and open Internet, and defending websites against cyberattacks. “We have no deterrence in the cyber domain and the world’s connected population is caught in the crossfire,” he explained. States must find a way to settle on a deterrence doctrine for the cyber domain. Companies and technology experts have badly needed expertise, but there is no magical algorithm or single fix. It will take numerous experimental efforts, rather than a single grand effort, to protect the digital world, he said., Statements, FERIT HOXHA (Albania), Council President for June, spoke in his national capacity, recalling how, in the early 1930s, the Nazis used virulently anti‑Semitic newspapers to help incite German people into persecution of Jews, noted other examples of hate speech, from Rwanda to Serbia to Kosovo. On the eve of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin described Ukraine as an “artificial creation of the Bolsheviks” and decided that “Ukraine should be de-nazified”, he noted. “What begins with dehumanizing words ends in bloodshed,” he said, noting that the Russian propaganda machinery spread the utterly false claim that Ukraine had committed genocide in Russian-backed separatist-controlled areas. Calling on the international community to stand firmly against genocide-deniers and history-revisionists, he added that the glorification of war criminals can be a major obstacle to reconciliation in post‑conflict situations. “We need better education, critical thinking, free and professional media for informed citizens, and a responsible use of the Internet and social media,” he said., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States) said today’s presentations offer a sober look at how disinformation and misuse of the Internet by the Russian Federation during its brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine is causing suffering among Ukrainians. The United States strongly rejects Moscow’s efforts to distort history for its own political purposes, noting that the General Assembly has rejected its false narrative about Ukraine, and other neighbouring countries, smearing them as neo-fascists and neo-Nazis. He said the Council must uphold the Charter of the United Nations, recalling its special obligation to do so and respond to lies with truth. It must be clear that attempts to change internationally recognized borders of a sovereign States through the use of force are unlawful and dangerous, a lesson drawn from the Second World War. He cited reports of atrocities committed by Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians, namely torture, execution-style killings, rape — sometimes publicly — and the deportation of children to the Russian Federation for adoption, noting that the European Democratic Resilience Initiative will provide $320 million in new funding to defend human rights in Ukraine, with a focus on accountability for war crimes. While some have called for a peaceful settlement, ignoring that the Russian Federation started the conflict by illegally invading its neighbour, he urged Moscow to immediately withdraw its forces and embrace diplomacy., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom), noting that “history has shown us what happens when identity is weaponized”, said that — from the Holocaust to Rwanda to Bosnia — propaganda, disinformation and hate speech have paved the way for war crimes, atrocities and genocide. Underscoring that “Russian propaganda and rhetoric towards Ukraine is therefore profoundly disturbing”, he detailed hate speech and false claims advanced by Russian State-controlled media and senior Russian figures directed at Ukraine and Ukrainians. Against that backdrop, he pointed out that digital and social media platforms are powerful vectors for propaganda, disinformation and hate speech and called on media companies to strengthen their work to address this issue. Adding that “hate speech can also be a war crime”, he called on the Russian Federation to comply with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and stop making such statements., TRINE HEIMERBACK (Norway) cited reports of widespread and blatant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, many of which may amount to war crimes. Condemning the unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine and calling for its immediate end, she recalled that, in March, the International Court of Justice ordered Moscow to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine. “Russia must comply with this legally binding order,” she said, noting that it nevertheless continues its aggression and disinformation. Such rhetoric is not only false, but it is dangerous, she stressed, noting that freedom of speech explicitly does not extend to the advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. Countering incitement to violence requires dialogue, education and objective reporting, for which independent journalism and a free press — protected under international law — are crucial., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France), calling on the international community to address the specific challenges raised by new technologies, said it is vital to ensure that they are tools of peace and not of conflict and crime. Expressing concern about the instant and massive disinformation campaigns online, she noted the power of modern communication tools in fighting crime and reporting news. However, Internet and social networks are vectors for the rapid spread of manipulative and hateful discourse. She said, condemning the war of aggression against Ukraine which claims more and more civilian victims every day. Pointing to the dangers of the online discourse of hate, as well as the drastic restrictions on media within the Russian Federation, she expressed full support for all international, regional and bilateral mechanisms working to document the atrocity crimes in Ukraine. Stressing that accountability is crucial, she emphasized the need to support the International Criminal Court, the commissions of enquiry and the fact-finding missions on the matter., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya), noting that even accusations about human rights violations and war crimes have been weaponized in the information war, added that the surprise being expressed in European forums that this catastrophe is happening in Europe signals a historical blindness. Europe, probably more than most regions, has suffered multiple genocides and hundreds of years of pogroms against minorities, she pointed out. Noting that her country’s Constitution limits the right to freedom of expression to ensure it does not extend the right to propaganda for war and hate speech, she urged all leaders in the warring countries, their allies and supporters, to cease using derogatory concepts about the people of Ukraine or any other peoples. Calling for consistent discipline against soldiers who abuse human rights, she also urged all mainstream media and social media outlets to remain vigilant. The United Nations must undertake a thorough investigation into the human rights violations under way in Ukraine, she said, stressing the need for developing a global code of conduct for companies and early warning tools within a global Internet governance framework., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said history has repeatedly shown that atrocity crimes do not occur in a vacuum. Warning against language that targets particular identities, as well as incendiary language that glorifies the past, she said seeking to rectify perceived grievances by resorting to military action against another State — to annex part of its territory — “has absolutely no place in the twenty-first century”. The Russian Federation must stop its efforts to establish occupying authorities and change the Ukrainian State, she stressed, emphasizing that Moscow’s accusations of genocide against the latter are utterly false and cannot serve to justify the so called “pre-emptive strike back” launched by the Russian Federation. Noting that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Moscow Mechanism’s mission has reported a clear pattern of international law violations by that country, she urged the Russian Federation to withdraw its forces and engage in true dialogue and diplomacy towards peace. In the meantime, it must comply with its international legal obligations., JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico) said the suggested existence of mass graves in Ukraine and evidence of the possible commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity could be unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity, as outlined in the preamble of the Rome Statute. It will be up to the courts to make such decisions. Mexico did not hesitate to support the establishment of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine by the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court’s ongoing investigation to prosecute, try and punish the perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. He called for full cooperation by all States with these mechanisms. Stressing that accountability for international crimes must always be the standard, regardless of where they are committed, he said all these crimes are equal and must be punished on the same footing. He called on the Russian Federation to comply with the International Court of Justice’s 16 March order on provisional measures, stressing that these measures are compulsory. Denouncing that residential areas in Ukraine continue to be targeted, in violation of international humanitarian law, he pressed the Council to support the United Nations towards a negotiated solution., MOHAMED ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), recalling his country’s consistent domestic and international position against hate speech and intolerance, emphasized that constructive dialogue can serve as a basis for reconciliation. Women are critical to long-lasting, peaceful solutions, and therefore, must be full, equal and meaningful participants in all peace efforts. He also called on the Council to address the malicious use of technology to spread hate speech, urging the identification and employment of effective counter-narratives, support for media literacy and close engagement with the private sector. Further, thorough investigations and data collection are essential for accountability, as impartially establishing facts and circumstances is fundamental to achieving justice for victims and survivors, as well as combating impunity more broadly. He went on to stress that “the violence in Ukraine is a stark reminder that this Council must prioritize conflict resolution and de-escalation”, urging focus on a diplomatic solution that will ease human suffering., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), stressing that Ukrainian propaganda has been pushing that country into Nazism and fueling Ukrainian nationalism, said this is one of the key reasons for the current crisis in that country. His delegation raised these issues in the Council in May last year during the informal meeting on neo-Nazism and radical nationalism in Ukraine, he said, adding that, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine, like other post-Soviet republics had the opportunity to build an independent State; however, the elites who came to power made ultra-nationalism a mainstream policy. “The theory of integration” followed by the country’s founding leadership is based on an ideology of hatred and oppression of minorities, he said, adding that, from the beginning, there was a prevalent hatred towards Russian people., When Ukraine became independent, he continued, Russians and Russian speakers were at least 60 per cent of the population; therefore, the Ukrainian authorities had to bide their time. The demonizing of his country, as well as hatred of everything Russian, was introduced slowly year after year, with the support of the United States and other Western allies. Citing various Ukrainian leaders, he said that after the 2014 Maidan coup, the Kyiv regime directly incited violence against Russian-speaking inhabitants of Ukraine. The entire population was divided into first- and second-class citizens, with Russian-speakers and Russians deemed second-class citizens. Further, all who were against the illegal Maidan authorities were dubbed by Kyiv as terrorists, separatist puppets and monsters, he said, adding that the post-Maidan years also saw dozens if not hundreds of murders of Russian-speaking politicians and journalists. “We can talk of Ukrainian nationalism and inhumane speech for a long time,” he said, adding that, to save time, his delegation will be distributing a selection of statements by Ukrainian officials., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil), citing the mounting human costs of the conflict in Ukraine, said deliberate attacks against civilians and indiscriminate shelling in densely populated areas remain unacceptable — especially strikes on houses, hospitals, schools and kindergartens. Reiterating his call for the full protection of civilians to be observed by all parties, he described sexual and gender-based crimes as abhorrent and meriting the strongest repudiation by the international community. Meanwhile, he voiced concern about reports of torture, summary killings, forced deportations and systematic violence, as well as the fact that humanitarian corridors fall short of being fully protected. All parties must ensure safe, timely and unimpeded access for humanitarian personnel. In addition, the conflict has worsened the global food crisis, with devastating impacts on the developing countries that are still struggling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said the war in Ukraine is an experimental laboratory of new ways the international community deals with armed conflict. Stressing that hate speech, particularly on social media, has fuelled hostilities, he said those engaging it are compromising peace prospects. He welcomed that the International Criminal Court launched an inquiry into the conflict in Ukraine, while teams of investigators visited the country shortly after the start of the war to gather evidence of possible war crimes. The judicial system must be upheld, with judicial actors carrying out their work in an impartial, independent manner. Perpetrators must be held accountable for their acts. Noting that the Council has explored the risks faced by women and children when they flee, including of being forced into sexual slavery, he said these matters must be the subject of inquiries that are free from any pressure or ideology. African victims of violence must also be taken into consideration. He urged parties to respect the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, as well as the Council’s own resolutions, stressing that the global community has the tools to bring protagonists into dialogue and plan for peaceful coexistence. He called for a ceasefire and the opening of humanitarian corridors., DAI BING (China) said that the circumstances and causes of violations of international humanitarian law must be ascertained, any allegations thereof must be based on facts and — pending final findings — all parties should avoid unwarranted accusations. He also stressed that sending in more lethal weapons will only fuel animosity, exacerbate conflict, trigger a wider humanitarian crisis and claim more innocent lives. Further, social media must never become a lawless space for spreading hatred and inciting violence. Expressing concern that certain social media platforms have adopted policies for political ends — allowing one-way hate speech — he called for strengthened governance for such platforms, which “should not be given free reign”. He went on to advise certain countries to cease “adding fuel to the fire to serve their own geopolitical interests”, including by forcing other countries to take sides, which fosters antagonism and division within the international community. The cold war mentality, the logic of hegemony and bloc politics “have long outlived their usefulness”, he added., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana), reiterating deep concern over the war in Ukraine, said her country is equally alarmed by the acerbic rhetoric that has accompanied the conflict. “No country or leader can claim to be unaware of the dangers of unrestrained words spoken in anger or with hatred,” she insisted, citing events during the Second World War, in Rwanda in 1994, in Srebrenica in 1995 and recently in Myanmar. Such actions, borne out of a false feeling of superiority by one group over others, have been the bane of humanity, whether during slavery, colonialism or apartheid. The Council must remain vigilant to incitement and hate speech, and act in unison to uphold its promise of “never again”. She expressed support for the conduct of independent and impartial investigations to gather evidence and establish a basis for ensuring accountability for atrocious acts committed in Ukraine, voicing particular concern over fighting in Severodonetsk. The need for a peaceful resolution is urgent and can only be attained through dialogue and diplomacy, she said, calling for greater efforts by the global community and regional partners to support talks between the parties., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India), underscoring his country’s belief in tolerance, harmony and pluralism, described terrorism as the antithesis of all religions and cultures. The United Nations has the responsibility to ensure that countering hate speech and discrimination should not be limited to a select few religions and communities, but should encompass all those affected. The conflict in Ukraine has impacted not just Europe, but the whole world, with destabilizing effects. Calling for its immediate end, he voiced support for all diplomatic efforts — especially talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation — as well as for an independent investigation into atrocities in Ukraine. As rising fuel prices and food shortages are having a disproportionate impact on developing countries, all stakeholders must adequately appreciate the importance of equity, affordability and accessibility when it comes to food grains. “Open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination,” he stressed, noting India’s provision of financial assistance and food to its neighbours., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said the “representative of Putin’s regime” has taken advantage of the Soviet Union’s Council seat to shift the responsibility for the current war on everyone else but his own country. When a predator gains an advantage by presenting as a victim, it is similar to blaming the victim of rape for provoking the rape, he said, adding that, just as Nazis were brought to account in Nuremberg, future trials will provide comprehensive answers on how the Russian Federation turned into “an aggressive and inhumane regime”. Recalling a history of appeasement, he said that, in December 1991, the Soviet Ambassador, then Council President, adjourned one meeting and then opened the next one as the representative of the Russian Federation. Despite the 1994 war launched by that country on Chechnya, the country received an invitation to Council of Europe membership. Despite committing in 1999 to withdraw its troops from the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, the Russian Federation continues to deploy troops in the Republic of Moldova. Further, the world did not respond adequately to the Russian aggression against Georgia in 2008, he added, noting that the attempted annexation of Crimea six years later and the conflict in Donbass are a logical development of that., Noting how these developments led the Russian Federation to its current aggression, he added: “Fascist aesthetics are easily traceable in the promotion of the ‘Z’ symbol, in the organization of mass rallies, in the consolidation of the propaganda of war and the incitement of hatred towards Ukraine and Ukrainians.” Calling on the Council not to be deceived by that country’s anti‑fascist rhetoric, he descried it as “another manifestation of aggressive mimicry”. As Ukraine is bleeding, fighting for its right to exist, there is no place for a dilemma between appeasement and accountability, he said, adding that, a week ago, Putin claimed that “the former Soviet Union was historical Russia”. “What is next?”, he asked, wondering if the country’s representative will request a swap of nameplates in the Council from Russian Federation to Soviet Union. The country's conversion to an aggressive fascist regime has already been demonstrated, he said, stressing that his own country will fight it with resoluteness and bravery, as well as the unprecedented international solidarity., RYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), also speaking on behalf of Estonia and Latvia, voiced support for United Nations efforts to respond to situations where populations are at risk of atrocities or where crimes are being committed. Emphasizing States’ responsibility to mitigate the risk of such crimes and to counter incitement to violence, he said that, for years, Ukraine has been among key targets of the Russian Federation’s disinformation, aimed at justifying an invasion. High-level Russian officials and State media commentators have repeatedly denied the existence of a distinct Ukrainian identity, and false narratives have implied that those who identify themselves as Ukrainians are Nazis — and are therefore deserving of punishment or even elimination. Meanwhile, Russian authorities have rewarded the soldiers suspected of mass killings and other atrocity crimes in Ukraine. He urged Moscow to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its troops and equipment from Ukrainian territory. “Russian bellicose rhetoric unveils its true imperialistic intentions — if there is no clear and strong international response to stop it, the aggression against Ukraine will be just the beginning,” he warned, citing Moscow’s threats to also “take back” the territories of other neighbouring countries., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia) said that Russian State propaganda led to numerous horrific crimes committed in Ukraine and underscored that awarding the soldiers who might be directly responsible for international crimes committed in Bucha and other Ukrainian villages is not only a mockery of innocent victims, but also a striking endorsement of the Russian Federation’s culture of impunity. Expressing concern over Russian war propaganda, he said that the pretexts under which that country invaded Ukraine resemble past patterns of framing a targeted group as an existential threat to justify atrocities and characterize war as defensive and inevitable. In the context of alleged genocide committed by Ukraine as a pretext for invasion, he called on the Russian Federation to comply with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice’s 16 March decision. Stressing that initial incitements to violence has turned to the commission of atrocities in Ukraine on an almost-daily basis, he detailed Slovakia’s efforts to properly investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of crimes committed in Ukraine on the national, bilateral, regional and international levels., For information media.

 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 936 casualties (184 killed and 752 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,434 casualties (1,905 killed and 2,529 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 19 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 20 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 20 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-20-june-2022-enruuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Jun 2022,"Food, water purification tablets, hygiene and other critical household items were delivered by UN agencies and NGOs in war-affected Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, (Kyiv, 21 June 2022) The United Nations and its humanitarian partners delivered yesterday 12 trucks of critical relief supplies for nearly 64,000 people in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, in the Government-controlled areas of the eastern Donetska oblast. Months of escalating and intense fighting in Ukraine is taking an enormous toll on civilians and over 2.2 million people in Donetska oblast alone need life-saving assistance., The situation in Sloviansk, formerly home to 100,000 people, is particularly concerning.
Hostilities have damaged the water system, leaving the 25,000 people who remain in the city— mainly the elderly and the most vulnerable—without piped water. Electricity is limited and basic supplies are lacking in the few shops still working, with increasing prices further impacting people’s access to food and other vital items. “The city is only 10 km away from the front line, and has experienced intense shelling over the past weeks. Almost nobody goes to the street. They spend their days hiding from the constant bombardment, without access to basic services,” explained the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani., In Sloviansk, humanitarians delivered water purification tablets and vital hygiene supplies to cover the needs of 20,000 people, critical household items to around 2,000 people and enough food to feed around 5,000 people for a month. In Kramatorsk, approximately 37,850 people—out of nearly 78,000 who remain in the city—will receive critical assistance, including kits to purify water and hygiene supplies for more than 20,000 people and food assistance for at least 10,000 women, men, girls and boys., This humanitarian convoy—coordinated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which notified both parties to the conflict to guarantee the safety of the operation—was possible thanks to the support of the international community to UN agencies and NGOs working to support people whose lives have been overturned by the war., Across the country, more than 300 humanitarian organizations—two-thirds of them national NGOs—have provided over 8.8 million people with the life-saving assistance. However, the war has left almost 16 million people in Ukraine in need of humanitarian aid. “We have consistently and insistently engaged the parties to the conflict to make sure we can support people in Ukraine, wherever they are. Yet, we have been prevented from reaching areas where we know people need support now, including Mariupol, Kherson, and most recently Sievierodonetsk. We call on the parties to the conflict to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all regions of Ukraine, so we can expand relief operations even further and support people who have now suffered with these four months of war,” concluded Ms. Lubrani., Note to editors:, Yesterday’s convoy had supplies provided by:, International Organization for Migration (IOM), UN High Commission for Refugees (UNCHR), UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Food Program (WFP), Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), People in Need, Save the Children, For further information, please contact OCHA Ukraine:, Saviano Abreu, +380 504 223 943, deabreuisidoro@un.org, Viktoriya Hrubas, +380 50 382 4541, viktoriya.hrubas@un.org, OCHA press releases are available at www.unocha.org or www.reliefweb.int.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarians-deliver-life-saving-supplies-people-caught-fighting-donetska-oblast-enukru

Education: Impact of the War in Ukraine (May 2022),Analysis,World Bank,Education,18 May 2022,"This brief presents the prospects for sustaining enrollment of Ukrainian students in educational services and addressing accumulating learning losses., Displacement of Students and Educators. The war in Ukraine has resulted in more than 6 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighboring countries. This includes nearly 665,000 students (16% of total number of enrolled students) and over 25,000 educators (6% of total educators in the country). Another 8 million Ukrainians are displaced internally.1 Refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) include primarily children, women, and older people. Over 74% of IDPs have children within their households.
Displacement has had a significant impact on education service delivery, along with damage and destruction of educational facilities. As of May 6, 2022, according to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MoES), 1,635 schools and universities (5% of total) have been damaged from the war and 126 have been destroyed., Current Efforts of the Education System to Sustain Student Enrollment and Service Delivery. The current imperative need is to keep students engaged and enable them to successfully complete the 2022 academic year. Currently, around 86% of schools in Ukraine have ‘officially’ resumed classes (following short-term closures after the invasion), but almost exclusively via online/distance modalities. Over 91,000 IDP students have re-enrolled in schools at places of their temporary residence (especially in Lviv Oblast). There are various online schooling initiatives to maintain access to education during the war, both for students within Ukraine and refugee students outside Ukraine, though there are significant gaps in coverage. Needs assessment surveys are underway. Universities have relatively better coverage, followed by schools (grades 5-11), which have access to the AllUkrainian Online School e-platform for distance and blended learning, established during the pandemic to ensure access to curricula and learning materials for grades 5-11 students. Although the average daily traffic has grown 20-fold since the war started, the online platform is static, and many teachers do not regularly use it as it offers little opportunity for direct student-teacher interaction. There is significantly less online content available for young children (preschool to 4th grade)., Impact on Opportunity to Learn and Learning Outcomes. School disruptions due to war or pandemics can have persistent negative effects on learning because they impact all elements of a student’s opportunity to learn: (i) less time spent on learning and (ii) lower quality of instruction via remote/online modalities, leading to (iii) less content covered during instruction. Ukraine performed at par with its regional neighbors in eastern Europe2 prior to the pandemic, and it outpaced them in terms of students’ learning resilience3 ; however, estimates of learning losses due to the Russian invasion suggest that learning outcomes are now below the lowest-performing countries in Europe. Continued school closures only exacerbate learning losses in Ukraine. Schools were closed or disrupted due to Covid-19 for 31 weeks in Ukraine, or nearly 8 months, leading to an estimated learning loss of around 20 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) points (based on OECD averages of learning per year).
We add another two months due to the war to date. Despite the above-mentioned efforts to sustain learning, many Ukrainian children will likely not go back to school before the fall, losing at least five more months of school time. In total, learning losses in Ukraine can amount to over one year, due to extended pandemic-related closures and the war. HLO estimates due to this length of school closure could fall from 481 to about 451 points, below the lowest performing countries in Europe, Moldova, and Armenia.4 The long-term effect could be substantial, with future earnings losses of more than 10% a year per student.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/education-impact-war-ukraine-may-2022

Global Climate Context of the Ukraine War (June 2022),News and Press Release,WFP,"Climate Change and Environment
Food and Nutrition",21 Jun 2022,"Summary, • The invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces has far reaching consequences for food security across areas of the globe geographically very far from the conflict location, given that both countries are major producers of key agricultural commodities., • On the climate front, unusual features are coming into play that can interact in many ways with the consequences of the Ukraine War, lingering pandemic effects and protracted conflict situations and either lead or aggravate major humanitarian crisis., • Recent global climate features have been driven by two back-to-back La Niña events that started in late 2020 and which may extend into a third consecutive one, lasting until early 2023, according to latest forecasts, something that has only happened twice in the last 75 years., • Many of the climate events we see being played out across the globe since late 2020 are typical of La Niña seasons, such as the 4 consecutive dry seasons in Horn of Africa, dryness across Europe, Maghreb and the Middle East, tropical storms across Southern Africa, though their persistence and extent may be unusual. A third La Niña may see the same broad patterns repeating themselves for another year, in same places intensifying what are already humanitarian catastrophes., • Parts of the Horn of Africa (Somalia, eastern Kenya and southeast Ethiopia) are now likely to endure a fifth drought season in a row in late 2022 – the devastation of pastoralist livelihoods will be felt for years as livestock herds take years to rebuild, while the impacts of severe food insecurity and starvation will be felt in the long term., • Besides the features consistent with La Niña patterns, climate variability has thrown up features that translate into critical hazards with major humanitarian implications – the severe multi-year drought in parts of Madagascar and a protracted landscapetransforming flood event in South Sudan are two examples of long-lived hazard events that may well last beyond the current La Niña and its potential follow-up., • This report covers the recent impacts of the first La Niña and provides an outlook for the likely impacts of the current one and scenarios for a third one. After a global overview, details are provided in detail for each WFP region, highlighting countries where the situation is of greatest concern.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/global-climate-context-ukraine-war-june-2022
Ukraine: Briefing on “Incitement to Violence Leading to Atrocity Crimes”,News and Press Release,Security Council Report,Protection and Human Rights,20 Jun 2022,"Tomorrow morning (21 June), the Security Council will hold a briefing on the situation in Ukraine. The focus of the meeting, which was called by Albania, will be on “Incitement to violence leading to atrocity crimes”. Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu and two civil society representatives are expected to brief. Ukraine and Lithuania are expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure., Nearly four months since the start of Russia’s military offensive, the humanitarian situation across Ukraine continues to rapidly deteriorate, with civilian casualties exceeding 10,000. As at 20 June, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had documented 4,569 deaths and 5,691 injuries. Moreover, approximately 12.1 million people have been forcibly displaced by the hostilities, according to a 15 June OCHA humanitarian impact situation report. That figure includes 7.1 million internally displaced people and five million refugees who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries., At tomorrow’s meeting, Council members are expected to express sharply diverging views about the effects of hate speech and incitement to violence in the context of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine and several Council members—including the US and European Council members—have accused Russia of spreading false narratives about Ukraine and using them as a pretext for its invasion. These member states contend that Russia’s dehumanising narratives amount to hate speech and have led Russian troops to commit atrocity crimes against Ukrainians during the war, including in areas that were temporarily under Russian control such as the town of Bucha., Russia for its part has long accused Ukrainian authorities of systemically subverting the interests of ethnic Russian minorities living in Ukraine. On 22 December 2021, against the backdrop of its military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, Russia organised an Arria-formula meeting on “the situation of national minorities and the glorification of Nazism in the Baltic and Black Sea regions”. In this meeting and on other occasions, Russia has argued that Kyiv had been overrun by Nazis and that violent nationalism posed an existential threat to ethnic Russians residing in Ukraine. At the 22 December 2021 Arria-formula meeting, the US accused Russia of using the Arria-formula format to “amplify its disinformation against Ukraine”, while the UK said that Moscow is using the meeting to “distort history for its own political purposes”. (For background, see our 21 December 2021 What’s in Blue story.), More recently, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Moscow has accused Ukrainian troops of committing war crimes, including against Russian prisoners of war. It has also argued that Western countries and international mechanisms such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission are wilfully ignoring these violations. Russia has also categorically denied any accusations of atrocities committed by its troops in Ukraine. It has accused Ukraine and the West of fabricating evidence and spreading false narratives regarding the events in Bucha and other northern towns and villages. Russia has taken such positions on several occasions, including during an Arria-formula meeting it organised on 6 May. (For background, see our 5 May What’s in Blue story.), At tomorrow’s meeting, Nderitu may describe the effects of hate speech on the conflict in Ukraine and urge constructive dialogue between the parties to find a peaceful solution. In an 18 March statement, Nderitu expressed her commitment to supporting reconciliation efforts in Ukraine and urged the prioritisation of dialogue initiatives to find an end to the conflict. On 6 April, Nderitu issued a statement condemning the alleged atrocities committed by Russian armed forces while in control of Bucha and calling for an independent investigation leading to criminal accountability over the killing of civilians., Tomorrow’s meeting will take place following the first International Day for Countering Hate Speech, which was held on 18 June, in line with the 21 July 2021 General Assembly resolution on “promoting inter-religious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance in countering hate speech”. During a high-level General Assembly meeting marking this occasion, which took place this morning (20 June), Albania said that “if left unchecked, hate speech and disinformation have the potential to harm peace and development, as it lays the ground for conflicts and tensions, [and] wide scale human rights violations”. It further stressed that “addressing hate speech and its destructive force must remain an urgent priority for the international community”., At tomorrow’s meeting, some members may also comment on the role of misinformation in fuelling the conflict in Ukraine. In a 4 May joint statement, representatives and rapporteurs on the freedom of expression from various international organisations—including the UN, the African Commission of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and the OSCE—expressed concern at the spread of disinformation regarding the Ukraine war in Russian state-owned media and on digital and social media platforms. Underlining that propaganda for war and national hatred—which constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence—is prohibited under article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the statement called on Russia to “immediately refrain from these unlawful practices”., Concerns regarding Russia’s disinformation campaigns prompted Twitter to introduce restrictive measures against Russian government accounts on 5 April. On 27 April, the EU announced a ban on Russian state-owned television networks operating in Europe and, on 25 May, it unveiled plans to enhance its code of practice on online disinformation, requiring that social media companies commit to a set of measures aimed at reducing the spread and proliferation of fake news., Several Council members may highlight the role of technology and social media companies in limiting the reach of inflammatory statements by political actors and disinformation. In his message marking the International Day for Countering Hate Speech, Secretary-General António Guterres warned that hate speech “dehumanizes individuals and communities” and that “the internet and social media have turbocharged hate speech, enabling it to spread like wildfire across borders”. The Council has become increasingly involved in addressing online hate speech and its effects on international peace and security. On 28 October 2021, Kenya and the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect co-organised a closed Arria-formula meeting on “Addressing and Countering Hate Speech and Preventing Incitement to Discrimination, Hostility, and Violence on Social Media”. The objective of the meeting was to facilitate a dialogue between Council members, the UN, and social media companies to improve responses to hate speech and incitement in conflict situations., Some Council members may highlight the important role played by religious leaders in combatting hate speech. On 16 June, the UK imposed sanctions on Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, for his “prominent support of Russian military aggression in Ukraine”., Several members may also raise other pressing issues of concern regarding the war in Ukraine, including the need for an exit route for Ukrainian grain and other food items to global markets and the humanitarian situation in the eastern city of Severodonetsk.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-briefing-incitement-violence-leading-atrocity-crimes

"With EU and UNDP support, emergency rescuers in war-torn eastern Ukraine receive shipments of new protective equipment [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,20 Jun 2022,"Kyiv, 20 June 2022– The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with the financial support of the European Union, procured a shipment of personal protective equipment for the rescue units of the State Emergency Service (SES) in the war-ravaged east of the country, where the most intense fighting continues., The supplies included 240 bulletproof vests, helmets and first aid kits, which were delivered to the SES warehouse in Lviv. From there, the protective equipment will be distributed among the units currently involved in rescue operations in towns and villages of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa oblasts., Martin Schroeder, Head of the Local and Human Development Section at the EU Delegation to Ukraine said the long-standing cooperation between the EU and UNDP in the support to the SES allows to timely respond to the needs that arise among rescuers and the civilian population living in the communities most heavily affected by the war, as active hostilities continue., “During the war, the State Emergency Service has proven to be a reliable support for all Ukrainians and thanks to the SES many lives were saved. This is the best proof for us that our partnership is effective indeed,” Mr. Schroeder said. “We are glad to continue uniting and stepping up our efforts to lay a solid foundation for the accelerated recovery of the war-torn communities, where every Ukrainian will feel protected and safe.”, Manal Fouani, acting UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said UNDP is expanding its support to the State Emergency Services to enhance their level of preparedness for rescue and emergency activities. Provision of such critical protection and life-saving equipment are in shortage in such times of war and UNDP stands ready to scale up its support to local institutions for effective emergency response., “The professionalism and utmost commitment with which the Ukrainian rescuers continue to perform their critical tasks, often putting their own lives on the line, is only a demonstration of their resilience and resolve,” Fouani said. “Our key goal here is to address their priority needs as quickly as possible because by strengthening the response capacity of the rescue teams, we are actually helping to save lives of civilians caught up in the conflict.”, **Viktor Vitovetskyi,**Director of the Department for the Civil Protection Measures of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, said the supplies will enhance the ability of rescue units to respond more effectively to many threats posed by the war in Ukraine., “We are grateful to our UNDP partners, who continue to support the SES in these difficult times for the country,” he said. “Thanks to the protective equipment received, our rescuers, working often in the hottest spots, will feel safer and will save even more lives.”, The total cost of the protective equipment and first aid kits is US$250,000 (UAH 6 million) and was procured within the context of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme., Background, **The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP)**is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland., Media enquiries, Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Lead; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org, Photo credit: Ivan Chernichkin / UNDP Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-and-undp-support-emergency-rescuers-war-torn-eastern-ukraine-receive-shipments-new-protective-equipment-enuk

In the past month, PIN’s Ukraine team has grown to 189 employees working to bring relief to people in the affected areas. Thanks to our partner organisations, we have delivered humanitarian aid to shelled towns in eastern Ukraine. We delivered thousands of litres of drinking water to help the more than 2,000 people sheltering in cellars in the Donetsk city of Avdiivka. We have helped more than 260,000 people in Ukraine since the invasion., In the Czech Republic, we are helping Ukrainian refugees and local governments in 10 of the 13 regions to find accommodation, process documents, and provide health care. We are also helping Ukrainian students access education. We organise and coordinate assistance in refugee centres in Pilsen, Klatovy, Tachov, Karlovy Vary, and Beroun, and we will open another one next week in Olomouc. Every day, we deal with dozens of new applications and longer-term cases on our Ukrainian helpline., Thanks to the response to our SOS UKRAINE emergency appeal, people and companies have contributed more than €76,8 million to help victims of war. In total, we have provided more than €20 million worth of aid., Read the latest summary of People in Need’s aid in Ukraine and the Czech Republic., AID IN UKRAINE, Water and food supplied to shelters and collective centres
Aid worth €14,6 million, Over the past month, we have been helping people across Ukraine. In the west of the country, we mainly work in collective centres for internal refugees; in the east, we have delivered water and food to besieged towns and villages. Since the invasion, we have dispatched 15 trains and 39 trucks full of humanitarian aid from the Czech Republic., In the east of Ukraine, especially in the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, the humanitarian situation is deteriorating due to fierce fighting. Tens of thousands of people are still hiding in cellars and shelters, without food, water, medicine, or hygiene supplies. Since the end of May, the Luhansk Oblast has been cut off from water supplies, which cannot be restored because of the fighting. Thanks to local volunteers and organisations, we can still deliver humanitarian aid to the areas close to the frontline., In the last four weeks, we have helped more than 21,000 people in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast with non-perishable foodstuffs. Additionally, we set up an outdoor kitchen where around 2,000 people eat every day. In the towns of Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk, and Hirsk in the Luhansk Oblast, we have delivered 13,170 litres of drinking water to 1,000 people, food for more than 5,300 people and home-baking bread packages to 1,200 people. In Vuhledar and other places in the Donetsk Oblast, we supplied more than 22,000 litres of water to 4,000 people and provided food for 4,500 people., We are also involved in rehabilitating damaged centralised water supply systems in recently liberated areas. ""In the Kyiv Oblast, we support local water companies with repairs in localities such as Irpin and Borodyanka. We have delivered five new pumping stations to Borodyanka , which will provide better access to water for 10,000 people. We are providing similar support to local authorities in the Chernihiv Oblast, where we have delivered two new pumping stations. This is possible thanks to the financial support of the European Union,"" says Petr Drbohlav, People in Need's Director for the Eastern Partnership and the Balkans., In the north and west of the country, we continue to equip collective centres and support towns and villages where the people are returning home. Collective centres in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast have received fridges, bedding, and kitchen equipment. We have also helped 2,800 people who fled to the safety of collective centres in the Lviv Oblast., We are helping financially where local markets still work or in places where we don't have our own teams, Aid worth €3 million, Funds from donors in the Czech Republic also help in areas where we do not have our own teams. The funds enable us to support partner volunteer associations to deliver humanitarian aid in the form of drinking water, food, mattresses, and generators right up to the edge of the frontline. Our local partners also provide psychosocial assistance and tutoring in collective centres. In total, we have provided more than 200 grants to local organisations., One of the most effective forms of aid is direct financial assistance. We provide this in places where the shops operate. People themselves know best what their needs are, and by providing them with cash assistance, we support their dignity and the local market. Direct financial assistance is paid out in small amounts over three months, and we aim to help 18,900 people in this way., Preparing for winter and repairing damaged houses, In addition to food and water deliveries, we are beginning to focus on longer-term aid in devastated areas, particularly preparing for winter. ""We are already planning how to position ourselves to support people ahead of the coming winter. We are planning housing repairs and small infrastructure projects,"" says People in Need director Šimon Pánek. Collective centres for internal refugees and individual families living in their own homes will need our help to prepare for the cold. We are already starting to help with small house repairs, and we will deliver basic materials and tools to Chernihiv and Sumy regions., HELP IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, Aid worth €2,6 million, We are helping refugees on the ground in 10 of 13 Czech regions, As a member of the consortium of NGOs working with migrants in the Czech Republic, People in Need is coordinating with other aid organisations. ""We also meet regularly with the management of the National Assistance Centre for Ukrainians, participate in many working groups, and provide information from the field,"" said Jan Černý, Director of Social Integration Programmes., From the beginning, we have been highlighting the importance of the early integration of refugees. We call on the Czech government to manage the refugee crisis centrally and unambiguously. We stand by our proposal for a solution to the distribution of refugees in the country, primarily according to the availability of free school capacity, followed by housing and job opportunities. We are finalising our longer-term support plan for new arrivals. We are also continuously updating information in Ukrainian in an article that has become the most visited piece on our website., We are monitoring the situation in the help centres, Social work and counselling are provided to Ukrainians by our field teams in 10 regions of the Czech Republic. We are working in help centres and participating in creating new community and integration sites in various cities. We continue to monitor the situation in mass hostels and deal with all situations of refugees, mostly women with children and the elderly. We provide food aid, clothing, interpreting, help with the necessary documents, humanitarian benefits, and finding housing, work, or medical care., We focus on the most vulnerable refugees, for example, those with health problems or other special needs. We are involved in helping expectant and new Ukrainian mothers, most of whom are not oriented and not employable. We also organised a club for Ukrainian seniors in Beroun. We organise and coordinate refugee help centres in Pilsen, Klatovy, Tachov, and Karlovy Vary, and we are opening another one next week in Olomouc., Since the beginning of the war, we have employed 40 Ukrainians to work with refugees, including refugees and Ukrainian citizens living in the Czech Republic for more extended periods of time. We employed another 16 Ukrainians on a short-term basis. They found employment as adaptation group workers, psychologist/crisis workers, field workers, field social workers, translators or helpline counsellors., On our Ukrainian helpline, we are dealing with dozens of cases every day The Ukrainian helpline team (+420 770 600 800) continues to handle dozens of calls for help on weekdays. Most requests relate to housing. However, we also deal with queries related to the interpretation of Lex Ukraine, various residential complications, medical conditions, and frequently births and deaths. Refugees turn to us when looking for jobs and for help understanding the complicated processes for humanitarian benefits., We have supported nearly 100 aid organisations, Across the country, we continue to support organisations and initiatives working with refugees and coordinating aid. With the money we have raised, we have s supported over 90 organisations with more than €1,9 million. Among other things, we have focused on supporting affordable healthcare and, in some locations, adaptation groups for Ukrainian children. We have also supported university students so that they do not have to interrupt their studies. Additionally, we cooperate with the Hlavák Initiative and other similar organisations helping to address the situation of Roma refugees from Ukraine., We are supporting education and teaching staff, In addition to the activities outlined above, we also focus on alleviating the educational and social decline of secondary school students who may not start school in the Czech Republic and are at risk of dropping out. We are considering opening a high school club in the Pilsen region. Our education programme Varianty is currently organising a roundtable on the topic of the inclusion of Ukrainian pupils in secondary schools with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Education, regions, and Meta., We expect high demand for assistance for preschool children who may not be able to enrol in kindergartens or playgroups and whose mothers will be unable to work as a result. We also support integration activities for all age groups, helping them improve their Czech language skills. We are also preparing suburban summer camps for Ukrainian children and holiday Czech language tutoring., Across the education and social services, we are helping with school enrolment. In some cases, we also help arrange educational and psychological counselling. In cooperation with the VMLYR agency, we have prepared a new part of the Life in Czech campaign, focussing on school from the perspective of Ukrainian children. We are creating more educational materials, videos, and courses on the topic of migration., To support the education of Ukrainian children, we are recruiting people in some of our branches, and we are supportive of the involvement of Ukrainian educators in the Czech education system. In cooperation with the Czech Centre Kyiv and Educasoft, we continue to develop an online course to help them with professional Czech. We are also working to support Czech teachers who will teach pupils from Ukraine., ASSISTANCE IN MOLDOVA, Aid worth €234 000, In Moldova, we have long provided financial support to families who have taken in refugees from Ukraine. Moldovan families have provided Ukrainians with a roof over their heads. In total, we have supported several thousand families in the north and south of the country. In June, we continued to register and verify families for the second phase of this assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/20-million-euro-worth-aid-ukraine-we-are-helping-people-forced-live-cellars-and-shelters-czech-republic-we-are-supporting-integration

We have rapidly scaled up our own projects to implement directly - delivering essential aid to hospitals and host communities in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, working with World Food Programme to hire a team and deliver cash to host communities in Moldova, and creating new programmes giving children safe environments to learn and play in Romania and Georgia., However, above all this has been a response about partnering, and we are incredibly proud of the wide range of partners we are working with, from coalitions of social workers in Romania, to large international NGOs in Ukraine.

Ukraine: Not all scars of war are visible,News and Press Release,ICRC,Health,20 Jun 2022,"Mental health is key to our overall health. Islam Alaraj, who heads up the ICRC's mental health and psychosocial work in Ukraine, explains the importance of mental health support in the country., We all get scared when we’re alone in the dark. In the last four months, people in Ukraine have come to know life in the dark. The cold darkness of an underground shelter. The eerie city streets under blackout., While everyone in Ukraine has become accustomed to moving between light and dark, the internal psychological darkness brought on by war is harder to shift., Every day brings new physical scars. The destruction and injuries are plain to see. Much less obvious, but perhaps more destructive, are the invisible wounds of war., A psychological wound can cut deeper, last longer and harm people far beyond the direct victim. In places affected by conflict, mental health needs increase as violence creates new trauma and deepens pre-existing conditions., Almost everyone affected by an emergency will experience stress reactions. For most, the symptoms will decrease over time., But if you live in a conflict zone you’re three times more likely to suffer with a mental health condition. However, you’re much less likely to get the help you need as conflict depletes and destroys community resources., Getting help early, In years gone by, humanitarian responses have placed the emphasis on ‘traditional’ forms of aid – food, water, shelter, health care, livelihood assistance. Of course, these are all vital, but they’re not always people’s main priority., As an example, one of my colleagues, who was registering people for cash assistance, was told by an elderly Ukrainian lady:, “Do you think I need money? You are mistaken. I want to sleep.”, Trauma related symptoms take a number of forms: withdrawal and isolation, hyper alertness, depression, confusion, anxiety, anger, fatigue, disturbed sleep, flashbacks, to name but a few., Every day our MHPSS (mental health and psychosocial support) hotline, operated by four ICRC psychologists, receives calls from people displaying such symptoms., In the first couple of weeks, this hotline was our only means of providing psychological support as insecurity restricted our access. We don’t need to solve people’s problems at the outset. We just need to listen and understand, that is all anyone wants., The majority of callers are women asking for advice about how to help their children who are struggling with sleep or displaying behavioural problems. Children are particularly vulnerable., Not only are they more sensitive to traumatic experiences, but they will also be affected by parents who are struggling to cope. When parents open up about their children, they often present their own emotional difficulties., Some cases are more severe. One man had buried his wife’s body in the garden because no one was able to collect the corpse or arrange for a proper burial. He was completely crushed and clearly struggling to function., It is vital that people get help early to aid the recovery process, as trauma symptoms can get worse and lead to wider health problems, such as high blood pressure, psychosomatic symptoms and PTSD., Simply put, mental health is central to overall health. Addressing the issues today will help to avert a crisis tomorrow., Rebuilding inner and outer strength, In early April, we started our MHPSS programme in several areas heavily hit by the conflict., It includes: direct psychological support; psychosocial training for local community volunteers, raising awareness about mental health; and psychoeducation sessions to promote positive mental health and resilience., We are also providing direct support to families after they have identified the mortal remains of loved ones., Having a psychologist available for people to speak to is vital as the identification process is extremely painful and something that no one should go through alone., It is difficult to comprehend the traumatic events that people have experienced. For those who live through them, such experiences can shatter your perception of life., But with the help of a psychologist, an individual can re-build their inner world to create a holistic picture that will add these events to our life experience, so they do not dominate forever., Our external strength comes from the community. Friends, family and community connections where you can draw strength from. But when your whole community has gone through the same trauma, what then?, The road to recovery will be harder and it will need community initiatives, such as creating support groups, raising awareness of trauma symptoms so people can look out for each other and training volunteers to provide basic mental health support., In other conflict zones, we have supported efforts to rebuild damaged structures that have a significance to the community in order to rekindle a sense of belonging., It will take time for people experiencing trauma symptoms to rebuild their strength – weeks, if not months. Together with our colleagues at the Ukrainian Red Cross, we will support people on this journey., However, we know that the services we are able to provide today are a drop in the ocean. There are clearly mental health needs that we are unable to meet and gaps in health services that we cannot plug., People across Ukraine – or any conflict zone for that matter – must have access to mental health and psychosocial support services., In times of war, mental health support can save lives. That’s why it must be integrated into humanitarian efforts in the midst of conflict, as well as in the aftermath when communities are attempting to move past the traumas of war., We know people in warzones are remarkably resilient. But sometimes we all need a little help to escape the darkness., Islam Alaraj is the mental health and psychosocial support programme manager for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-not-all-scars-war-are-visible

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the President of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine, Ms. Iryna Venediktova and to all representatives of relevant ministries, agencies and of the diplomatic community who dedicated time to meet with me during this visit despite the exceptionally difficult circumstances currently faced by all in Ukraine., On the first day of my visit I travelled to Kharkiv, in the east of Ukraine, witnessing the extensive damage caused to this city and listening to the accounts of suffering endured by civilians. My message to those I spoke with was clear: the law remains with them on the front lines. They have fundamental rights which must be vindicated even during a time of war. I told them that my Office was acting with urgency to demonstrate to all those involved in this conflict that they have responsibilities under international law to which there are no exceptions., Every person who picks up a gun, drives a tank or launches a missile should know that they can be held accountable where crimes are committed. My team is already working extensively on the ground in Ukraine and we will continue to engage with all partners to identify alleged crimes falling within our jurisdiction and uncover the truth., During my visit, I met with the President of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his senior advisers. I was grateful for our positive discussions and for their expression of steadfast support for the independent investigative activities of my Office., Based on these consultations, and those with other relevant officials during my time in Kyiv, I can confirm the imminent opening of a field office of the International Criminal Court to further support the continued and increased presence of our personnel on the ground. This will be crucial in deepening our engagement with all actors in Ukraine and accelerating our investigative activities., On 15 June, my delegation and I participated in a roundtable meeting with senior representatives of relevant ministries, agencies and intelligence services. During those discussions I outlined priority areas for action in support of the independent investigations conducted by my Office. We identified a number of ways in which the cooperation between Ukraine and my Office can be further strengthened in accordance with the principle of complementarity that lies at the heart of the Rome Statute. In this regard, I would wish in particular to commend the continued strong cooperation and determined efforts of the Office of Prosecutor-General Venediktova., I would like to conclude by underlining my personal commitment to ensuring that those involved in conflict, in Ukraine and in all situations addressed by my Office, feel that the law is something relevant to their lives. Now more than ever it is crucial we bring our work closer to victims and survivors and demonstrate our continued commitment to work together, to the best of our abilities, to ensure that the perpetrators of international crimes are held accountable., For further details on ""preliminary examinations"" and ""situations and cases"" before the Court, click here, and here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-qc-visits-kharkiv-ukraine-15-june-2022
UN in Ukraine calls for accountability for conflict-related sexual violence and remedy for survivors [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UN RC/HC Ukraine,Protection and Human Rights,18 Jun 2022,"Russia's war on Ukraine has caused enormous suffering for civilians, including civilian deaths, injuries and mass destruction, and has also been marred by incidents of conflict-related sexual violence., Although conflict-related sexual violence is mostly perpetrated against women, OHCHR has verified cases of sexual violence against women, men and girls. Due to active hostilities, mass internal displacement, the stigma associated with sexual violence and the breakdown of the referral pathways, survivors are often unable or unwilling to report to law enforcement authorities or service providers. Reporting of cases for accountability purposes often takes place only after survivors are in physical and emotional safety and have access to services, including medical and psychological assistance., Last month, the United Nations and the Government of Ukraine signed a framework for cooperation that supports the design and delivery of priority interventions in the areas of justice and accountability as a central pillar of deterrence and prevention., The agreement also addresses comprehensive service provision for survivors, including sexual and reproductive health services, medical and specialised mental health services, legal assistance, and livelihood support., UN Women will continue supporting national partners' efforts to raise awareness, and prevent conflict related sexual violence, especially within the frameworks of an updated National Action Plan on the Implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325., Following the survivor-centred approach and with strong UNFPA involvement, the online platform Aurora was launched last week. Aurora provides specialised psychotherapy for survivors of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence. The platform provides remote specialised assistance for survivors in any part of Ukraine, including non-government-controlled areas and abroad., On this International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, we reiterate that conflict-related sexual violence is a crime under international human rights and humanitarian law. Adopting a survivor-centred approach to service provision, investigating and documenting all allegations, and ensuring accountability and justice is paramount. It's also of vital importance to create a safe environment and enhance gender-sensitive mechanisms that will enable and empower survivors to report such violations without fearing of being discriminated against, stigmatised or blamed., UN Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-ukraine-calls-accountability-conflict-related-sexual-violence-and-remedy-survivors-enuk
"In the words of Larysa Denysenko, Ukrainian legal expert: “Sexual violence is a tactic of intimidation, torture and humiliation”",News and Press Release,UN Women,Protection and Human Rights,17 Jun 2022,"Larysa Denysenko is a journalist, attorney, human rights activist and co-founder of the Association of Women’s Lawyers of Ukraine “JurFem”. Before the war, Denysenko and JurFem mainly advocated for women’s leadership in legal professions, provided mentorship and supported strategic court cases related to domestic violence and gender-based discrimination. Now, this has extended to representing the interests of those who have survived conflict-related sexual violence allegedly perpetrated by the Russian military in Ukraine., During the first days of the invasion, we were providing legal advice to refugees and internally displaced people, in terms of the procedures, necessary documents, etc. At the beginning of March, the nature of the cases changed significantly. Both women and men – but mostly, women – were calling the hotline to report sexual violence that they, or their closed ones, had been subjected to in the context of the war., Any violence – including conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) – is about power relations and dominance. Perpetrators want to demonstrate their power; they want to prevail. That is why sexual violence is so common during wars and armed conflicts. The root of this aggression and impunity lies in domestic violence. The ratification of the Istanbul Convention is therefore crucial in this context today. The violence against women and girls that denies a woman’s agency cannot be neglected as something unimportant., It is also crucial for the media, public officials and activists to adhere to the standards of gender-sensitive reporting, so as not to cause any additional harm to those who’ve suffered CRSV – both in terms of retraumatization and protecting their personal identity, which has life-saving importance in the context of active war., Any war is a very masculine thing. Women must be included in the negotiating delegations to ensure the progress and sustainability of efforts. Commitments of good faith behaviour towards civilians and the prohibition of sexual violence (and the threat thereof) towards women and men prisoners of war must be officially recorded in relevant documents. Sexual violence, threats and blackmail against women, men and children who are evacuating or remain in temporarily occupied territories are absolutely unacceptable., I welcome that both the President of Ukraine and the Minister of Defence often refer to their “women and men defenders”. This is an important message that recognizes the equal contribution of women and men in defence efforts. Women’s voices sound louder today but we must not stop supporting them. There is still a lot to be done to ensure women’s meaningful participation., It is very important that we preserve our successes in the gender equality achieved as of today. We need to keep the balance and leave no one behind. Women work as volunteers and doctors. They support local businesses, educate and care for children and elderly family members in Ukraine and abroad. Women are defending our country in the army on equal terms with their fellow men. We also need not forget about women’s contribution to diplomatic efforts and those working in information, cultural and other fronts."", UN Women partnered with the JurFem NGO to launch the initiative “JurFem: Support” to assist survivors of CRSV in Ukraine, and to ensure justice and accountability as key factors to prevent these crimes. The initiative includes free legal advice and further legal support as well as psychological aid for CRSV survivors., This material was created under the media partnership with Wonderzine Ukraine media as part of a series of publications under the UN Women Ukraine project “Transformational approaches to achieving gender equality in Ukraine”, funded by the Government of Sweden.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/words-larysa-denysenko-ukrainian-legal-expert-sexual-violence-tactic-intimidation-torture-and-humiliation

In addition, 2,576,509 people have been able to access safe drinking water and 265,952 people have been reached with WASH supplies., Since 24 February, 919,784 children and caregivers have benefitted from mental health and psychosocial support to help them deal with the trauma of war and displacement. A total of 57,869 children and their families have benefited from specialized services through case management and referral to support services and 30,103 women and children have been reached by UNICEF-supported gender-based violence prevention, risk mitigation and response services., Since 24 February, 288,853 children have benefited from learning interventions with supplies provided by UNICEF and 336,380 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education., 24,764 households have been reached with multi-purpose cash assistance with a total value of over US$25.2 million., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF has received US$449.7 million for its response inside Ukraine out of the US$624.2 million total funding requirement under Pillar 1 (Ukraine) in its revised 2022 Ukraine and Refugee Outflow Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal (March–August 2022). A more detailed update on the contributions received against UNICEF’s Humanitarian Appeal is available here., Generous contributions have come from the people and Governments of Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the United States of America, USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), the European Commission, and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)., Ongoing fundraising campaigns by UNICEF National Committees and country offices have generated timely, and 89 per cent flexible support from the private sector including from corporate partners, foundations, philanthropy partners and individual donors, with actual funds already remitted amounting to US$430 million. Private sector support has been unprecedented with donations received fromover 601 businesses, 194 philanthropy partners, 103 foundations and a large base of individual donors across over 24 countries.

Close consultations are also being held with Presidential advisors, key ministries (Foreign Affairs; Social Policy; Education; Youth; and Health), and mayors in several cities (including through 35 Child and Youth Friendly Cities) and the Ombudspersons Office. Through its long-standing presence in Ukraine, UNICEF has established partnerships in key hromadas (municipalities) and will continue to expand these in all oblasts (regions). Nearly 90 government and civil society partners have been engaged with UNICEF to respond to the critical needs of children and families across Ukraine., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, As the war in Ukraine persists, the fighting has intensified in the east; with intense fighting in Severodonetsk, Lysychansk. In southern Ukraine, the intensity of the fighting seems to have decreased notably since last week in Mariupol. Local authorities in Mariupol (Donetsk oblast) recently warned that poor sanitary conditions linked to the lack of drinking water and a non functioning sewage system could potentially result in outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera, in the coming months. Over 7.13 million people are currently internally displaced in Ukraine. The humanitarian community is also looking at winterization preparedness., The ongoing fighting has continued to hinder the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the population remaining in certain areas. UNICEF has continued to deliver and preposition lifesaving supplies as close to the frontline as possible, but lost access to Lyman and Severodonetsk last week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-15-24-may-14-jun-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 Jun 2022,"Our Response, The USAID Mission in Ukraine continues to transform its programming to meet the urgent needs of the Ukrainian people following Russia’s invasion.All USAID/Ukraine programs remain active and we continue to invest in more than 40 activities run by more than 700 implementing partner staff still in the country. All of this helps to make Ukraine stronger, more democratic, and more prosperous, and helps Ukrainians realize the promise of the Revolution of Dignity., Assistance to Critical Sectors, Agriculture, Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, we have provided inputs and services to more than 6,000 farm- ers, accounting for 12% of Ukraine’s agricultural enterprises.We have supplied high-quality seed potatoes to 4,000 farmers in 13 oblasts, including in the hard-hit regions of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kyiv, and Zaporizhzhia. We have provided 700 farmers with fertilizers, pesticides, and spraying services.We continue to support three agriculture financing applications that have helped more than 300 farmers obtain business loans worth more than UAH 1 billion ($34 million)., Support for IDPs, USAID’s main governance activity in eastern Ukraine is supporting the evacuation of persons in the front- line oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson, as well as efforts in neighboring oblasts to meet the needs of large numbers of IDPs.This activity has provided local authorities with emergency response equipment including personal protective equipment (PPE), power generators, satellite phones, walkie-talkies, and drones. USAID-provided walkie-talkies helped local officials effectively coordinate the evacuation of roughly 25,000 people from Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Hirtske, and Popasna., Energy, With USAID support, Ukraine made further progress integrating its electricity grid with the European electricity system. On June 7, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) agreed to allow limited electricity imports from Ukraine, an important vote of confidence in Ukraine’s ability to manage its electricity grid.This comes after USAID assistance helped Ukraine successfully synchronize with the European electricity system on March 16., Youth, USAID’s youth empowerment activity helps young people access critical services amid Russia’s invasion while supporting youth-led initiatives to deliver humanitarian aid to citizens and communities in need. Through the Government of Ukraine’s SpivDiia platform, we helped mobilize youth volunteers to deliver humanitarian assistance to more than 87,000 people across Ukraine, including in hard-hit cities in the coun- try’s south and east. USAID also provides mentorship, psychological support, and skills training to internal- ly-displaced youth who have moved from eastern to western Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion., Civil Society, Our Civil Society activity, through a sub-grant, helped create a mobile app that supported the evacuations of roughly 1,000 persons with disabilities and mobilized the delivery of humanitarian assistance to nearly 6,000 peo- ple.The program has also helped 49 civil society organizations across Ukraine reorient their activities to meet the urgent needs of IDPs and other Ukrainians in need., Local Governance, USAID provides comprehensive assistance to local governments in six recently-liberated communities in Cherni- hiv, Kherson, and Kharkiv oblasts.The liberated communities are receiving assistance in: public service delivery; local economic development; financial management; civic engagement; and emergency assistance.Two communities in Chernihiv received humanitarian assistance such as food kits and hygiene items, while three communities (two in Kherson and one in Kharkiv) received Starlink satellite Internet terminals to ensure continued communications capabilities. USAID provided 40 power generators to regional local governments in Lviv to help them better meet the needs of internally-displaced persons (IDPs). The generators will power critical infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, and accommodation centers for IDPs., Private Sector, USAID has provided 33 grants to 31 different businesses and business associations since the start of Rus- sia’s invasion.These grants have helped 85 businesses relocate away from the front lines, helping more than 1,000 people keep their jobs amid Russia’s invasion.This has benefited more than 650 businesses (grant recipients, suppliers, and sub-contractors). Participating businesses are located in liberated and frontline oblasts (Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk), as well as those farther from ongoing hostilities (Lviv, Cherkasy, Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, Zakartpattia)., Human Rights, USAID extended its Human Rights activity following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, expanding the network of USAID-supported legal aid centers from nine to 22.The centers support local communities by documenting war crimes and damages to civilian property and providing direct legal assistance to victims.They also assist the Government of Ukraine and international partners in international court cases.The extension also allows the activity to provide 24/7 legal assistance and information to conflict-affected civilian populations across the entirety of Ukraine., Media, USAID has provided journalists with 855 protective vests, 775 helmets, and 1,870 tactical first aid kits since the start of Russia’s invasion.We have also trained journalists on operating in a conflict environment.We are supporting 148 national and local media entities to counter disinformation by sharing credible informa- tion with citizens in the form of videos, infographics, and articles.We have also provided rapid assistance to 66 local media outlets in southern and eastern Ukraine to help them continue reporting. Our support has helped Ukraine’s independent public service broadcaster reach more than 1 million subscribers through Telegram, a critical platform for reaching people during Russia’s invasion., **Cybersecurity **, Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, USAID has provided more than 6,750 emergency communications devices, including satellite phones and data terminals.These devices have been distributed nationally, including to restore internet connectivity in war-affected areas. USAID also continues to provide expert support and advice to the Government of Ukraine to prevent cyberattacks and repair systems after an attack has occurred., Health, USAID, through PEPFAR, has procured and imported more than 25 million doses of life-saving antiretro-viral drugs (ARVs) to help ensure continuity of treatment for more than 100,000 Ukrainians living with HIV. USAID’s local Ukrainian partner, 100 Percent Life, is distributing around the country, including in the frontline oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv., Countering Disinformation, USAID is providing the Government of Ukraine’s Center for Strategic Communications (CSCIS) with media monitoring data that helps it counter disinformation while reaching citizens with fact-based information in the form of videos, infographics, and articles. Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, USAID has helped the CSCIS produce more than 750 pieces of content and reach more than 58 million people. USAID-fund- ed media partners are also continuing to provide real-time reporting and, to the extent possible, documenting war crimes in an effort to raise awareness about the situation on the ground.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/usaidukraine-rapid-response-russias-invasion-ukraine-june-16-2022

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 16 June 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,17 Jun 2022,"Date: 17 June 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 16 June 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 10,094 civilian casualties in the country: 4,509 killed and 5,585 injured. This included:, a total of 4,509 killed (1,747 men, 1,166 women, 124 girls, and 129 boys, as well as 41 children and 1,302 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,585 injured (1,138 men, 792 women, 125 girls, and 166 boys, as well as 172 children and 3,192 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,745 casualties (2,628 killed and 3,117 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,845 casualties (2,452 killed and 2,393 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 900 casualties (176 killed and 724 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,349 casualties (1,881 killed and 2,468 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna, Lysychansk, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 15 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 16 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 16 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-16-june-2022-enruuk
