Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"Geneva – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is mobilizing teams and boosting capacity in Ukraine and neighbouring countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of Ukrainians forced to flee the country, those internally displaced, and stranded third country nationals., According to initial figures from IOM teams in neighboring countries, at least 600,000 people fled Ukraine in the first five days following the start of military operations and the escalation in hostilities., The Organization’s number one priority is the safety and protection of all those fleeing the country - including third country nationals – and their ability to access assistance. It will also be crucial to screen for and assess potential short-term and longer-term vulnerabilities, including for human trafficking, child protection, health and mental health, and the arrival of more vulnerable people with special needs, including elderly, wounded or sick people., Based on IOM estimates, there are over 470,000 third country nationals – many stranded – from various nationalities within Ukraine including a large number of overseas students and labour migrants., At least 6,000 have arrived in Moldova and Slovakia alone., Several States have already requested IOM’s assistance to help with the return of their nationals to Africa, the Middle East and Asia. More than 50 Tunisian nationals who crossed into Moldova are being assisted by IOM to relocate to Romania before they return home through a charter flight, in coordination with relevant authorities., IOM welcomes the decision by several countries to take steps to support Ukrainian diaspora through visa extensions and appeals to States to grant protection and access to territory to all those who seek to leave the country, without discrimination., IOM also welcomes the European Union (EU) discussions on granting Temporary Protection under the 2001 Directive to provide adequate protection and assistance to all those in need., The Organization has a large operational footprint and capacity across Ukraine and neighboring countries and is expanding its assistance to support governments in light of the increasing number of people fleeing the country and rising humanitarian needs., In Luhansk, Ukraine, IOM provided much-needed core relief items on Sunday to civil society, and local government institutions to ensure continuity in aid delivery., IOM in Poland is at the border to monitor and assess reception conditions and the most urgent needs of those arriving from Ukraine, specifically non-food items, mental health, protection, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and information provision. IOM is also working with various embassies to support the transportation of their nationals from the border to Warsaw and facilitate their return home and has set up an information and support hotline for persons fleeing Ukraine., IOM is supporting Romania’s national emergency response effort by providing information to arriving Ukrainians and third country nationals through a purpose-built portal, in coordination with the Romanian government and “Code for Romania”. We are also assisting the government’s Emergency Response Unit to match pledges for food, non-food items and services from civil society and the general public with needs identified at border points and in reception shelters., ***, Note:, IOM Hotline Numbers:, Ukraine: 527 (free from mobile phones), 0800505501 (free from landline phones), Poland: +48 22 490 20 44, Romania: the online support platform dopomoha.ro (developed by Code4Romania with support from IOM Romania) is now live: https://romania.iom.int/news/online-platform-dopomoharo-developed-code4romania-support-iom-romania-now-live, Lithuania: +370 525 14352 is run by IOM's Migration Information Centre, also available through live chat on this website https://www.renkuosilietuva.lt/ru/, Slovakia: from abroad 00421 5263 0023, locally 0850 211 478, Telegram/Signal: 00421 908 767 853 (voice only) , https://www.mic.iom.sk/en/, For more information, please contact:, In Geneva: Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int, In Vienna: Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int, In Brussels: Ryan Schroeder, rschroeder@iom.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-scales-response-ukraine-crisis-and-appeals-inclusive-protection-measures

High Commissioner’s Statement to the United Nations Security Council on Ukraine (28 February 2022),News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"By Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr President,, Greetings from Geneva., Today and in recent days, you have heard that the United Nations humanitarian organizations, together with their NGO partners, have remained in Ukraine. Let me start by saying how proud I am that we decided to do so, just like we did in Afghanistan a few months ago., But naturally, as we just heard, our colleagues on the ground – like the rest of the civilian population – are now caught up in this deadly conflict. Many of them were relocated and military attacks might force them to move again. Yet they are still striving to deliver help to people in need whenever a small window of relative security allows for humanitarian aid to be distributed – working with partners, including, especially, national NGOs, often in extremely dangerous circumstances., But we know that we are not even scratching the surface to meet the needs of Ukrainians, including an unknown but surely very substantial number who have been forced to flee their homes over the past days. The situation is moving so quickly, and the levels of risk are so high by now, that it is impossible for humanitarians to distribute systematically the aid, the help that Ukrainians desperately need., I therefore echo as well the urgent call made by the Secretary-General, and just a few minutes ago by the Emergency Relief Coordinator and by others indeed: civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected and spared, and humanitarian access must be granted for those delivering aid to those impacted by war. A failure to do so will compound the already extraordinary levels of human suffering., Mr President,, In addition to the grave situation inside Ukraine, and as Martin just told us, hundreds of thousands are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. They need safety and protection, first and foremost, but also shelter, food, hygiene and other support; and they need it urgently., As we speak, there are 520,000 refugees from Ukraine in neighbouring countries. This figure has been rising exponentially, hour after hour, literally, since Thursday. I have worked in refugee crises for almost 40 years and I have rarely seen such an incredibly fast-rising exodus of people – the largest, surely, within Europe, since the Balkan wars. Over 280,000 have fled to Poland. Another 94,000 to Hungary, nearly 40,000 are currently in Moldova; 34,000 in Romania, 30,000 in Slovakia; tens of thousands in other European countries. We are also aware that a sizeable number have gone to the Russian Federation., I want to commend the governments of receiving countries for allowing refugees access to their territory. The challenge to admit and register, to meet the needs and ensure the protection of those fleeing, are daunting, but so far they have been met, though I am seriously concerned about the likely, and further escalation in the number of arrivals. Mr President, we may have just seen the beginning., So my message today is one of gratitude to the governments of Ukraine’s neighbours, and also – through them – my heartfelt thanks to the citizens of those countries., Ordinary Poles, Hungarians, Moldovans, Romanians, Slovaks and citizens of other European countries have undertaken extraordinary acts of humanity and kindness. This is the humanitarian instinct that is so needed in times of crisis. I encourage governments to continue to maintain access to territory for all those fleeing: Ukrainians, of course, but also third-country nationals living in Ukraine – people there to work and to study, and in some cases people that are in Ukraine as refugees – and all of whom are now similarly forced to escape the violence. At this critical juncture there can be no discrimination against any person or any group., I am aware that the European Union, its member States and other governments have already provided countries receiving refugees from Ukraine with bilateral support, which I hope will continue. UNHCR, with its United Nations partner agencies, and national and international NGOs, is present in all these countries and we are scaling up. We encourage host countries to avail themselves of our support and expert advice as they address the situation and uphold their international obligations., We are helping and can do more in areas like protection and registration, organizing reception capacity, providing emergency relief and cash assistance, and in identifying and responding to the needs of the most vulnerable, many of them women and children, including a growing number of unaccompanied and separated children., Mr President,, I regret to say that unless there is, as Martin said, an immediate halt to conflict, Ukrainians will simply continue to flee. We are currently planning – repeat: planning – for up to four million refugees in the coming days and weeks. Such a rapid increase would be a huge burden for receiving states and would no doubt stress reception systems and related resources. Like all countries hosting refugees around the world, they cannot be left alone to shoulder this responsibility., I therefore welcome the support expressed by many European States at yesterday’s European Union Justice and Home Affairs Council, to activate the Temporary Protection Directive for people fleeing Ukraine. This would enable if activated immediate and temporary refuge in the European Union. It would also facilitate the sharing of responsibility for people fleeing Ukraine among European States., As Martin mentioned, we will launch the UN Humanitarian Appeal for Ukraine tomorrow – for activities both inside and outside the country. Private citizens and companies from around the world have already offered extraordinary financial support through thousands of donations – over US$40 million to UNHCR alone, in a couple of days – and I am counting on governments to do the same – and quickly. Ukrainians – and countries hosting refugees from Ukraine – cannot wait., Finally, Mr President, a reminder that Ukrainian refugees – like all others (and please let us not forget the continuing plight of Afghans, of Syrians, of Ethiopians, of the Rohingya people from Myanmar, and of many others) – all of them never wanted to be refugees. They never wanted to be forced to flee their homes, and they all hope to return to their country as quickly as possible., Mr President,, Members of the Security Council,, It is not very often that I get to brief the Security Council. Let me take this opportunity, therefore, to echo what I said to the Council the last time you invited me, a few months ago – that humanitarian workers are courageous, resourceful and experienced, but they cannot keep the pace of conflicts constantly growing in numbers and gravity around the world., I speak to you as a sixth night of anguish falls over Europe, struck once again by war, and as millions of innocent Ukrainian civilians huddle in bunkers, scramble to board overcrowded trains, and think with trepidation about the future of their children., Let me say – as an old humanitarian worker myself – that the responsibility that you have – to ensure that eventually peace and security for all prevails over power struggles and narrow national interests – has never been as urgent, and as indispensable a task, as it is tonight., If you fail – if we fail – it might be too late for us all., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-commissioner-s-statement-united-nations-security-council-ukraine-28-february
World Food Programme set to assist people affected by conflict in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,28 Feb 2022,"WFP calls for US$570 million as 422,000 people cross into neighbouring countries such as Poland, The World Food Programme (WFP) is launching an emergency operation to provide food assistance for people fleeing the conflict inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, following an official request from the country’s Government., “We are deeply concerned for the impact of hostilities on the lives and livelihoods of civilians,” said Margot van der Velden, WFP’s Director of Emergencies. “As the situation evolves, there is a need to ensure that affected communities have continued access to any humanitarian support they may require and that the safety of humanitarian staff on the ground is guaranteed.”, The food assistance operation is expected to cover Romania and Poland initially, and then possibly Moldovia and Slovakia, guided by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, humanity and independence., While it is difficult to estimate the humanitarian consequences of this developing war, UNHCR – the UN Refugee Agency – estimates that 422,000 Ukrainians have already fled the country and sought refuge in neighbouring countries since the beginning of the conflict. Miles-long traffic jams are being seen towards Ukraine’s neighbours to the west., The majority of the people fleeing to the Polish border are women and children, as men are not allowed to leave the country. The waiting time to cross the 14 km backlog into Poland can be up to 40 hours, with temperatures as low as -2°C at night. Families are desperate, cold, afraid and hungry., Food and drinking water shortages are reported in pockets of the capital Kyiv and in Kharkiv, the two cities currently bearing the brunt of the ongoing conflict., WFP staff in the capital say that food supplies are running low, with grocery store shelves almost empty. Food shortages will be another obstacle facing residents of Kyiv, many of whom have taken shelter in metro stations., WFP teams are on the ground in the city and in a number of the neighbouring countries leading the emergency telecoms and logistics push on behalf of the UN., The Black Sea basin is one of the world’s most important areas for grain and agricultural production, and the food security impact of the conflict will likely be felt beyond Ukraine’s borders., In a year of unprecedented humanitarian needs, this will also affect WFP’s efforts to supply food to some of its biggest emergencies., “We get 50 percent of our grains out of the Ukraine-Russia area, it’s going have a dramatic impact on food costs, shipping costs, oil and fuel,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley in a social media video posted from Yemen. “This is catastrophe on top of catastrophe.”, WFP is currently calling for US$570 million for its emergency response in Ukraine., Between 2014 and 2018, WFP ran an operation in the east of the country, reaching more than 1 million people through cash, food vouchers or locally purchased food rations, operating in both Government- and non-Government-controlled areas., The current crisis comes as WFP warns 811 million people go to bed hungry every night around the world, with the number of those facing acute food insecurity having jumped from 135 million to 283 million since 2019 – a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic., A total of 45 million people in 43 countries are teetering on the edge of famine – in addition to working to ensure that the needs of people in, and feeling from, Ukraine are met, WFP is working around the clock to make sure critical supplies to its operations around the world suffer minimal interruption.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-food-programme-set-assist-people-affected-conflict-ukraine

It covers the period from 5 p.m. (EET) 27 February 2022 to 3 p.m. (EET) 28 February 2022., HIGHLIGHTS, • As heavy fighting continues, reports of civilian casualties and civilian infrastructure damage continue to increase. Government-controlled areas of Donetska, Luhanska and Kharkivska oblasts in eastern Ukraine are among the hardest-hit areas, with several cities, towns and villages within oblasts at the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe., • The human cost of the violence is becoming more apparent with each passing day. Between 4:00 a.m. 24 February and midnight on 27 February, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) confirmed at least 406 civil casualties, including 102 deaths, with the real figures feared to be much higher., • Across the country, especially in eastern Ukraine, water infrastructure has suffered severe damage; repair works have been hindered by ongoing shelling and de-mining is required. The continued operation of critical hospital services is being threatened by constant power outages and the persistent risk of ambulances and health personnel being caught in the crossfire., • As thousands of people flee towards the western part of the country, there is a desperate need for food, water and shelter to complement overstretched response capacities at local levels. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that more than half a million people have fled to neighbouring countries; more than 100,000 people have been displaced within the country amid below freezing winter temperatures., • Despite immense response challenges, UN agencies and humanitarian partners, especially local non-governmental and civil society organizations, continue to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance, including in hard-to-reach areas., • On 1 March, the UN and humanitarian partners will launch a Flash Appeal to address the acute humanitarian needs of crisis-affected people within Ukraine. This appeal is coordinated with the Regional Refugee Response Plan, led by UNHCR., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Despite continued attempts at reaching a diplomatic solution to the crisis, violence across Ukraine rages on. The human cost of the conflict continues to become more apparent with each passing day. Between 4:00 a.m. 24 February and midnight on 27 February, OHCHR confirmed at least 406 civil casualties, including 102 killed, with the real figures feared to be much higher., More than half of all civilian casualties so far have been recorded in the conflict hotbeds of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, with the Government-controlled areas of these oblasts particularly hard-hit by ongoing hostilities. Casualties have also been reported in the capital Kyiv, Cherkasy (central Ukraine), Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Sumy (north) and Zaporizhzhia (south-east). OHCHR reports that most civilian casualties have been caused by explosive weapons, including shelling from heavy artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), and air strikes., In the early hours of 27 February, a missile hit the radioactive waste disposal site of the State-operated Radon company in Kyiv, an ominous reminder of the possible environmental health consequences of ongoing hostilities. Preliminary assessments suggest that the incident does not pose a direct threat to people outside the protected zone of the disposal site. In the morning of 28 February, more than 300,000 people across certain parts of Ukraine were without electricity, while more than 11,600 people no longer have access to gas supply in Chernihivska (north), Kharkivska (north-east), Kyivska (north), Rivnenska, Sumska (north), Zaporizka (south-east) and Zhytomyrska (north) oblasts., In Kyiv, grocery stores and public transport re-opened after a mandatory curfew; constant warnings of airstrikes still force people into hiding. Despite heavy fighting in Chernihiv (north) and Kharkiv (north-east) Government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine continue to be the worst-affected part of the country. After days of continuous shelling, people in Stanytsia Luhanska and Shchastia in the Government-controlled Luhanska oblast are in desperate need of emergency assistance., Around 21,000 people in Volnovakha in the Government-controlled parts of Donetska oblast are on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe as shelling damaged numerous homes and critical infrastructure, including a hospital with some 400 patients. People have been cut off from water, food and fuel for three days. Accessing communities with aid, however, is extremely challenging; the severe security situation is also preventing the possibility of evacuation, exacerbating, The ongoing Omicron-driven surge in COVID-19, with around 1,700 patients currently in hospitals across the country, further complicates the already-difficult health response amid ongoing hostilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the oxygen supply in Ukraine is running dangerously low, with most hospitals at risk of exhausting their oxygen reserves in the next 24 hours, putting thousands of lives at risk. Compounding the situation, the continuance of critical hospital services is being threatened by constant power outages and the persistent risk of ambulances and health personnel being caught in the crossfire. Safe and sustained provision of essential medical supplies and uninterrupted access to emergency medical is critical., Across the country, especially in eastern Ukraine, water infrastructure has suffered severe damage. The repair works have been hindered by ongoing shelling and mine contamination. As of 27 February, the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster reports that around 2.7 million on both sides of the “contact line” receive water twice per day, while some 124,000 are without any access to water. The most affected people are those across nine settlements in Volnovakha (60,185 people), Avdiivka (34,000 people), and in Dokuchaievsk, Yasne and Olenivka (29,056 people) in the non-Government controlled area of Donetska oblast., As thousands of people continue to flee violence towards western part of the country, there is a desperate need for food, water and shelter as raions (districts) and oblasts (regions) are running out of resources to deal with the massive influx of internally displaced people., The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that more than half a million people have fled to neighbouring countries, while more than 100,000 have been displaced within the country amid frigid winter temperatures. Displaced people at international borders are reportedly stuck in lines 15 km-long for as many as three days.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-28-february-2022
Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell calling for a suspension of hostilities to carry out urgent humanitarian action in Ukraine [EN/AR/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"NEW YORK, 28 February 2022 – “The situation for children caught up in the conflict in Ukraine grows worse by the minute., “We are receiving reports of hospitals, schools, water and sanitation facilities and orphanages under fire. Explosive weapons in populated areas and explosive remnants of war are real and present dangers for the children of Ukraine., “Children have been killed. Children have been wounded. And children are being profoundly traumatized by the violence all around them., “We appeal for a suspension of ongoing military actions in Ukraine. Such a suspension would allow for humanitarian help to reach people cut off after five days of intense airstrikes and fierce ground fighting nationwide. It would also allow families in the worst affected areas to venture out to get food and water, to seek medical care, or to leave in search of safety., “We renew our call on all parties to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure – and to abide by all legal and moral obligations to keep children out of the line of fire., “We must protect all children in Ukraine.

"Human Rights Council Hears from 21 Dignitaries as it Continues High-Level Segment, with Speakers Condemning Russia’s Military Aggression against Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"MIDDAY　　, 28 February 2022, The Human Rights Council in a midday meeting continued its high-level segment, hearing statements from 21 dignitaries from Croatia, San Marino, Angola, Andorra, South Africa, Luxembourg, Brazil, France, Iceland, Greece, New Zealand, Canada, Peru, Morocco, Liechtenstein, Pakistan, Sweden, Iran, Turkey, Finland and Philippines., Speakers said that the ongoing Ukrainian crisis had devastating consequences for Ukrainian people but also for European and global security. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine was a clear act of aggression; a blatant breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; and a violation of international law, all gravely endangering the rules-based world order. The humanitarian dimension of this conflict was of grave concern and States pledged to assist Ukraine and its people in these challenging times with humanitarian aid. On COVID-19, speakers said that the pandemic alone had exacerbated many pre-existing situations of fragility and inequality, causing even more damage to vulnerable and marginalised groups. The international community must stand firm in its convictions to protect those most in need, shaping the future to make it a place that could welcome everyone with equal dignity, starting with people with disabilities, the elderly, women, young people and children, who had suffered most from the recent pandemic., Global warming, the energy crisis, pollution, extreme weather phenomena and all forms of abuse of planet earth would inevitably lead to further unacceptable inequalities among human beings, speakers warned. States were reminded that Ukraine was far from being the only live conflict, with human rights being abused in conflicts in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen. The hard-won rights of women and girls had tragically gone backwards over the past year - most notably in Afghanistan. The plight of civilians in Mali was highlighted along with the coups in Myanmar and Sudan. In the Middle East, a two-State solution risked being replaced by a one-State reality of perpetual conflict. China should grant meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for United Nations experts, and other independent observers. Some speakers said the Council was a proper multilateral forum. It must remain true to its mandate and avoid pitfalls that could ruin it., The following speakers took the floor: Gordan Grlić Radman, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia; Luca Beccari, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Economic Cooperation and Telecommunications of San Marino; Esmeralda Mendonça, Secretary of State for External Relations of Angola on behalf of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries; Maria Ubach Font, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Andorra; Naledi Pandor, Minister for International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa; Jean Asselborn, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs for Luxembourg; Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France; Þórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörð Gylfadóttir, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development Cooperation of Iceland; Nikos Dendias, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece; Nanaia Mahuta, Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand; Mélanie Joly, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada; César Landa Arroyo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru; Abdellatif Ouahbi, Minister of Justice of Morocco; Dominique Hasler, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein; Shireen Mazari, Federal Minister for Human Rights of Pakistan; Ann Linde, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden; Kazem Gharibabadi, Deputy Judiciary for International Affairs and Secretary for High Council for Human Rights of Iran; Pekka Haavisto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland; Faruk Kaymakcı, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director for European Union Affairs of Turkey; and Menardo I. Guevarra, Secretary of Justice of the Philippines., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., At 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 February, the Council will hold its annual high-level panel on human rights mainstreaming. This year’s theme is the contribution of universal participation to the mainstreaming of human rights throughout the United Nations system on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the work of the Human Rights Council., Statements, GORDAN GRLIĆ RADMAN, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of Croatia, said the ongoing Ukrainian crisis was leaving devastating consequences for Ukrainian people and European and global security. Croatia strongly condemned Russia's unprecedented military aggression against Ukraine. This unprovoked and unjustified invasion presented a gross violation of international law and was gravely endangering and undermining the rules-based world order. Grave human rights violations were happening while the world counted civilian casualties of this senseless and unjustified war. The humanitarian dimension of this conflict was of grave concern. Croatia would assist Ukraine and its people in these challenging times with humanitarian aid and technical assistance. All relevant stakeholders must continue to mitigate both the humanitarian and the human rights situation across Ukraine and raise internationally the awareness on all of its dimensions., For Croatia, the universal human right to health was not a commodity to be traded with. The effects of climate change and environment degradation continued to affect progressively people around the world. Prolonged conflicts, as well as the breakout of new ones were reflected in an unprecedented number of the Council’s special sessions in 2021. The situation in Afghanistan or the armed conflict in Tigray and Sudan were some of the many crises the international community had to address. The international community must do better to prevent and respond to cybercrime and other online offences, and contain the spread of hate speech, racism and xenophobia, discrimination and violence around the world, both online and offline. In conclusion, the Minister said that strengthening human rights and promoting inclusive policies brought stability, prosperity and human dignity to all., LUCA BECCARI, Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Economic Cooperation and Telecommunications of San Marino, said the foreign policy of San Marino had always been based on the solid cornerstone of the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, peace and freedom. This vocation had always been reflected in internal policies. Unfortunately, the world was increasingly witnessing dangerous regressions, which threatened the resilience of the global democratic system. The pandemic alone had exacerbated many pre-existing situations of fragility and inequality, causing even more damage to vulnerable and marginalised groups. It was thanks to the Universal Periodic Review that the international community could look forward to improvement, moving swiftly towards effective compliance with international standards for the promotion and protection of human rights., San Marino had always been a great supporter of multilateralism and international cooperation. Now more than ever, the international community must stand firm in its convictions and in the choice to protect those most in need, with a view to leaving no one behind, shaping the future to make it a place that could welcome everyone with equal dignity, starting with people with disabilities, the elderly, women, young people and children, who had suffered most from the recent pandemic. Sustainability, in all its many forms, was also of fundamental importance in the future that must be created. Global warming, the energy crisis, pollution, extreme weather phenomena and all forms of abuse of planet earth would inevitably lead to further unacceptable inequalities among human beings. Implementing the 2030 Agenda Goals as soon as possible remained the only way to imagine and live the tolerant, respectful and radiant future envisioned., ESMERALDA MENDONÇA, Secretary of State for Foreign Relations of Angola, speaking on behalf of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, reiterated the commitment of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries to upholding human rights. Like all countries, the members of the Community had been harshly affected by the onset of COVID-19 along with simultaneous environmental challenges. In line with the Luanda Declaration, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries was committed to ensure the ability of each Member State to further the cause of social development and implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As such, all Member States of the Community underscored the need to uphold and promote gender equality., Environmental rights were also impacting the members of the Community harshly, notably the small island States. Ms. Mendonça called for the strengthening of solidarity, to ensure no one was left behind. Now was the time to think about how to build sustainable economies for the future. All the members of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries were supporting the membership of Timor West and Brazil for the Council for the period 2024-2026, and they reiterated their overall support for the Human Rights Council and all of its work., MARIA UBACH FONT, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Andorra, said the recent attacks against Ukraine were steadfastly condemned, and reminded all that the values of multilateralism could not be taken for granted, and it was up to all to work constantly to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights were the pillar of the work done at the United Nations. The Russian Federation should halt its operations as soon as possible and respect international humanitarian law. The United Nations Charter was all the more relevant in these dark times, and it was up to all to make sure it was fully enforced. The Human Rights Council was commended for the excellent work undertaken, particularly the Universal Periodic Review mechanism., The COVID-19 pandemic had eroded the rights of all, in particular the protection of the most vulnerable. Andorra was fully committed to protecting the rights of all, including women and children, who were drivers for development. It was in the Human Rights Council that multilateralism was the most relevant. Multilateralism should be the preferred method for resolving conflicts and convincing all of the need to work together to protect and promote human rights. The current situation of the world was a stark reminder of what would happen otherwise. Multilateralism worked for small countries that on an individual level perhaps would not be heard, but working together and as partners could speak together in a louder voice. This allowed all to tackle global challenges such as the pandemic, climate change, and armed conflicts, but this could only be done if the whole international community was engaged in cooperative and supportive multilateralism, leaving no one behind., NALEDI PANDOR, Minister for International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa, said South Africa was deeply concerned by the situation in Ukraine, and welcomed the decision by Ukraine and Russia to hold talks without preconditions. The pandemic was confronting many countries. All inadequacies revealed during the pandemic had to be addressed. Developing countries had to be ensured access to vaccines, while developed countries had to assist those less developed in their socio-economic struggles. South Africa’s constitution contained the hopes of people who had endured great suffering and gross human rights violations for over 350 years, experiencing colonialism, racism and apartheid. Nelson Mandela had paid tribute to the great role that the international community had played in achieving equality and assisting in human rights promotion in South Africa. Such a struggle had to be led by the Council in Ukraine as well. The Council could be a place for balancing, unlike the Security Council, allowing these two nations to come together and achieve peace., South Africa was committed to the advancement of peace, not just within the country, but also across Africa and globally. Human rights had to be given practical meaning, with real and tangible consequences. It had to be done in the spirit of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, interrelated with human rights and promoted as interdependent and on the same footing for all people. The Council was a proper multilateral forum, and it must remain true to its mandate and avoid pitfalls that could ruin it. The Council had to be free of politicisation and double standards and each problem had to be addressed on its own, looking at full dimensions of the problem, be they thematic or country specific. One way to develop this would be by filling gaps in the international human rights law and ensuring adequate funding., JEAN ASSELBORN, Minister of Foreign and European Affairs for Luxembourg, reminded the Council that the worst human rights abuses were perpetrated during acts of conflict, and condemned Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. He reminded the Council that Ukraine was far from being the only live conflict, with human rights being abused in conflicts in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Yemen, where the failure to renew the mandate of the Panel of Eminent Experts had not helped. In Myanmar, the military junta was repressing civilians, and in the Middle East, a two-State solution risked being replaced by a one-State reality of perpetual conflict. Mr. Asselborn regretted that armed conflicts were on the increase at the very time when humanity must face the multiple global scourges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis as well as socio-economic injustices and the political crises that may result from them., Luxembourg would undergo its fourth Universal Periodic Review next year and would also continue its work as co-chair of the core group of the resolution on the 2030 Agenda and human rights. Luxembourg continued to oppose all forms of reprisals targeting civil society and to support the full participation of independent non-governmental organizations in the work of the Council., DAMARES ALVES, Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights of Brazil, said the Government had delivered achievements following the mandate given to it by the population. Over 830 million doses of vaccine had been delivered. The Bolsonaro Government had always been promoting and developing peace, as well as freedom and life from the moment of conception, the most essential moment of life. Every death caused by the pandemic was regretted. The Government had aimed to protect its population from the crisis, making emergency aid available, and had defended extending care services at the State level. There was an integrated human rights system that involved federal and municipal levels, allowing swifter responses to human rights violations. More people had been made visible, and systems had been strengthened to tackle aggression, strengthening policies to protect the victims of violence., The essential right of access to drinking water had been protected. The 30 million people living in the Amazon region were being protected, with a sustainable, human rights-based programme. There were protection systems for those who had received death threats, and an education system ensuring that rights were provided to all, as well as a programme for protecting early childhood. There was a decrease in the number of deaths of the young people dying in violent attacks. International human rights law did not in any way back abortion as a family-planning method. The Government was of Brazil was living up to the highest standards of human rights in supporting democracy and hoped for peace and stability for all., JEAN-YVES LE DRIAN, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, said that violations of human rights were a challenge for multilateralism that the international community had been building. Common commitments had to be honoured, and human rights could not be put in relative terms. France was trying to overcome challenges for the common future and reiterated its full support to the work of the Council. The mass military attack that Vladimir Putin chose to unleash on Ukraine required all to be vigilant and resolute when it came to the protection of Ukrainians. Russia’s premeditated choice had brought the war back to Europe and now they must face the humanitarian consequences together., Since the Taliban took power last August, the regime in Kabul had been a threat to women and girls and France could not be a partner to such a regime. The Syrian population was facing martyrdom, following a decade of horror, as reflected in continued shelling of Idlib and its civilian population, with chemical attacks targeting civilians. There were huge numbers of displaced and if Syrian refugees were not returning home, it was because the regime was not offering them an olive branch. In Yemen, the whole region was destabilised. In Ethiopia, efforts of all sides were needed to combat violence against women. The coup in Myanmar was unacceptable. The situation in West Africa was also concerning, especially the situation faced by civilians in Mali. France was resolutely committed to put human rights standards at the heart of response for challenges of the twenty-first century. The Council had recognised a right to a healthy environment, which had to be pursued., ÞÓRDÍS KOLBRÚN R. GYLFADÓTTIR, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland, condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and stated that Belarus was acting as an autocratic enabler of that conflict. This attack was not only an attack on Ukraine but was part of an ideological battle to undermine democratic norms around the world. In addition to the suffering imposed on Ukrainians, the Minister extended her thoughts to the people of Russia, who were also suffering as a result of these actions. As such she reiterated Iceland’s support for an urgent debate on Ukraine. Iceland had decided to run for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2025-2027. If elected, Iceland would be absolutely resolute in its support for the Council´s mandate and would not shy away from calling on all and any of the members of this Council to live up to their human rights obligations and commitments. , The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iceland called on all members of the Council to resist the push back against democratic norms. Autocratic pressures and voices were on the rise, seeking to intensify political polarisation and infringe on fundamental human rights. These trends had been exacerbated by the pandemic, as too many governments had used COVID-19 as an excuse to weaken the pillars of democratic societies. She regretted how easily such rights had been curbed without adequate public debate. The international rules-based order provided a platform for States to operate in peace and prosperity, and as such, support for this system must be resolute. She reiterated the importance of ensuring gender rights in all countries., NIKOS DENDIAS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, said unilateral actions affected countries, but first and foremost people. The military attacks in Ukraine fundamentally affected the situation of human rights in that country. What was happening had plunged Europe into an era where such actions had no place. International humanitarian law had been affected. Attacks on civilians must cease immediately. Greece was ready to contribute to all efforts for de-escalation in regional and international fora, with the aim of avoiding a humanitarian disaster., Action must be taken to protect the rights of involuntary migrants. The United Nations and the Human Rights Council had a mandate to protect and promote human rights. Thousands were losing their lives across the globe every day due to conflict, and many more from COVID-19. The welfare of every human being and the protection of the right to life was the heart of the social conscience. It was owed to next generations to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, and the Human Rights Council could play a pivotal role in this regard. Combatting discrimination and alleviating social inequalities and biases were a must in the policies of Greece. Despite the unfavourable environment of misleading information and unfounded allegations, efforts had to continue, as they were in Greece, to protect and promote democratic institutions. Greece would continue to engage with all partners in protecting and promoting human rights., NANAIA MAHUTA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a clear act of aggression; a blatant breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; and a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter by a Permanent Member of the Security Council. There was no victor in unjustified and unprovoked aggression. The Russian Government had repeatedly ignored opportunities for diplomacy, negotiation and de-escalation, and had instead chosen aggression. Russia’s actions would have far-reaching and serious humanitarian, security and economic implications for Ukraine, Russia, Europe, and the rest of the world., Armed conflicts, including in Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen, continued to cause egregious human rights abuses and humanitarian crises. Democratic rights, such as freedom of expression and media freedoms, were being eroded. The hard-won rights of women and girls had tragically gone backwards over the past year - most notably in Afghanistan. China should grant meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for United Nations experts, and other independent observers. Human rights embodied universal values. But these values were at risk if the international community did not accept the collective responsibility to protect and uphold the dignity of all people, individually and collectively, irrespective of the context or situation in which they lived. The Council must be a forum for all States to engage openly on human rights, to share experiences and progress, and to hold each other to account., MÉLANIE JOLY, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada, said the Human Rights Council was created as a milestone in a shared effort to improve the state of human rights; a long quest whose origin dated back to the start of human civilization itself, a quest which had been recently marked by a new war. The capital of a sovereign and equal Member State was under direct threats, with heart-breaking images of it flashing collective screens. This invasion and war were the choice of one country, the Russian Federation, its government and leadership, and in particular the decision of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. It was a cold, calculated and carefully planned series of events by the Kremlin. Russia was trying to justify the war by spreading a false rhetoric and attempting to manipulate the principles of human rights to support their illegal and illegitimate violence. Human rights were universal and could not be manipulated to justify wars and crimes. The Russian regime was challenging the international system of peace and law, and the very Charter that the international community had been building since the end of the Second World War., All States were equal and sovereign, and human rights were essential to human dignity, said Ms. Joly. Rules were indispensable since they prevented abuses of power and corruption. This invasion endangered the lives of millions of people, and as such, Canada stood by Ukraine and Ukrainians, calling on Russia to respect the rights not only of Ukrainians but also of its own citizens. Russia's invasion of Ukraine made the work of protecting human rights even more urgent. “We continue to call on Russia to cease its attack immediately, Ukrainian sovereignty must be respected"", she concluded., CÉSAR LANDA ARROYO, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru, reaffirmed Peru’s unwavering commitment to an ethical vision of international relations. Tragic events in Ukraine had been the focus of the entire international community over the past few days. The Russian attack had violated the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Peru called for the cessation of hostilities, including immediate negotiations towards a peaceful situation. Every day they waited would make the situation for civilians more difficult. Access to humanitarian aid was essential to help those who were most in need and in vulnerable situations. Resolution 6/251 of the General Assembly stipulated that those members elected to the Council had to apply the strictest standards when it came to human rights and cooperate with the Council. Peru echoed the High Commissioner’s call to fully respect international humanitarian law, as well as human rights law, including respect of proportionality as well as protection of civilians and their assets. These principles reflected Peru’s commitment towards multiculturalism., The pandemic had uncovered shortages of international cooperation and solidarity. Peru was convinced of a need to build an effective democracy that could improve the quality of life of people and address the challenges all faced. The human rights approach had to be bolstered, including respect for the rule of law. Since its creation, Peru had made a steady commitment towards building its institutions. Peru hoped to be a member of the Council in the period 2024-2026., ABDELLATIF OUAHBI, Minister of Justice of Morocco, said Morocco supported the territorial integrity of all Member States of the United Nations, and adhered to the non-use of force to settle disputes between States, encouraging all initiatives and measures towards promoting the peaceful settlement of such issues. COVID-19 had brought forward some issues, particularly economic and social rights, which needed to be dealt with credibly. The countries of the South had faced a clear and persistent violation of the right to health, which was a basic principle. As well as the threat to economic and social rights, there was a need to intensify international peace and security, including access to vaccines. Morocco had adopted a holistic approach to confront the consequences of the pandemic., Morocco was committed to the democratic choice and had organized elections in which all persons had a large presence. This had allowed for a consolidation of many rights. Morocco had moved towards protecting the social pillars for all. The issue of women had emerged as one of the greatest challenges, both for civil society and the State alike, and Morocco was dealing with the situation in great seriousness. The Kingdom was open to dialogue with all United Nations mechanisms and organizations, in line with its democratic rights. Morocco reaffirmed its commitment to continuous efforts to achieve international peace and security as the greatest threats to human rights, and to continue its cooperation with friendly countries in promoting the values of friendship and tolerance, as well as African values., DOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein, wished the Council had gathered in less sinister circumstances, as the international order was being violated in an unprecedented manner that affected the interest of anyone committed to the United Nations Charter. Concerning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Liechtenstein unequivocally supported the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine as this military operation was ""a repeated act of aggression on Ukraine but also an attack on all of us"". For Liechtenstein, the respect for sovereignty and international law was of vital importance, thus it considered this crime of aggression as an attack against Liechtenstein and the values it stood for., Referring to other humanitarian crisis, the Minister expressed concerns regarding the crisis in Afghanistan, notably the violation of women and girls' human rights, including the right to education. She regretted the dramatic deterioration of an already precarious situation of human rights. Liechtenstein continued to be concerned by the situation in Syria where civilians had been victims of a conflict that had been ongoing for more than a decade. The Minister called for justice for the countless atrocities committed and still ongoing and expressed her full support to the impartial Council's mechanisms on Syria. Liechtenstein recognised European States holding trials for those who had committed serious crimes. Ms. Joly further expressed deep worries about the situation in Myanmar and the unconstitutional military coup which happened a year ago, noting that the human rights situation of the country had deteriorated rapidly. The military authorities continue their abuse of civilians, with hundreds fleeing from the violence as a part of a systematic attack on the population., SHIREEN MAZARI, Federal Minister for Human Rights of Pakistan, said that despite global treaties and international law, powerful States had for decades continued systematic abuses. Woman and children in Kashmir continued to be victims. The world had faced vaccine nationalism during the pandemic. The realisation of basic rights and recovery from the pandemic had to be ensured. The Council had to step up and respond to halted progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Measures that Pakistan had taken to improve human rights protection nationally were outlined, including adoption of the National Action Plan on business and human rights that was launched after extensive consultations with stakeholders. Pakistan was advancing the safety of journalists and had established new mechanisms to reduce inequalities, eradicate poverty and empower women and girls., Concerning the deteriorating human rights situation in Kashmir, the Indian occupation machinery had been intensified, changing the demographic situation. India had legalised its permanent illegal settlements, breaching the Fourth Geneva Convention. India was converting the Kashmiri majority into a minority, denying them of their right to self-determination. The Indian regime first tried to demonise Kashmiri residents by labelling them as terrorists. India was pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing, using summary executions, torture, destruction of civilian infrastructure and use of rape as a form of collective punishment. These were just some examples of India’s State-led terrorism., ANN LINDE, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, said in these challenging times, universal human rights supported by a rule-based international order and a strong human rights-based perspective were more important. A new dark chapter in European history had begun, with a full-scale war in Europe, a flagrant violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter and the international global order. Sweden strongly condemned the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, which was unprovoked, illegal and indefensible, with no justification. Russia bore full responsibility for this action and the loss of life. It also condemned the involvement of Belarus in the aggression. Sweden stood in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people, who were fighting to preserve their independence and democracy. Russia should withdraw all people and equipment immediately and respect the independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine., The respect for international law, including human rights and international humanitarian law, had continuously deteriorated, with an immense impact on the civilian population. The urgent debate on the situation in Ukraine was welcomed. Today, human rights were under increasing pressure in many parts of the world. By promoting international cooperation and developing the normative framework, progress could be made. Members of the Council themselves needed to meet all international standards. Human rights defenders should be allowed to carry out their work without fear of reprisals and in full independence. Time and again, democracy had proved to be the superior form of government, allowing for debate, free speech, the rule of law, and legislation protecting human rights, providing the ability to face the challenges posed by authoritarianism. Human rights were universal and should be enjoyed by all, irrespective of background, religious or gender identity., KAZEM GHARIB ABADI, Deputy Judiciary for International Affairs and Secretary-General of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, said the principal policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran relied on protecting and promoting human rights for all members of society. The Western sanctions imposed on Iran were a crime perpetrated against the population of Iran. In addition to these sanctions, Iran was facing terrorism by operatives of the Mujahideen organization. These had operational centres in Europe and the United States. Countries that supported this group had the blood of thousands of civilians on their hands. The United Nations must prevent the free movement of those responsible for sheltering these groups., Iran condemned the assassination of General Suleimani, who had championed the fight against terrorism in the region. The Iranian State was determined to hold accountable those who had committed his murder. Iran also wanted to investigate the murder of five Iranian nuclear scientists by the State of Israel. Mr. Abadi asked all members of the Council to resist the politicisation of the Human Rights Council. He reminded the Council that the people of Palestine continued to be let down by the international community and called for agenda item 7 to be preserved until the people of Palestine were free. He regretted the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Yemen and called for the lifting of the economic siege on that country. Protecting human rights required the end of the politicisation of the work of the United Nations, which should operate on the basis of non-interference in the domestic affairs of others. Iran remained committed to continue its interaction with the United Nations., FARUK KAYMAKCI, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director for European Union Affairs of Turkey, said that the Russian violation of international law in Ukraine was unacceptable. Turkey respected Ukrainian territorial integrity, including Crimea. Turkey respected the right of Crimean Tatars to live freely and safely in their homeland. Negative trends in the rise of xenophobia and religious intolerance had been observed. Earlier this month 19 migrants were found frozen to death, as a result of the pushback policy of Greece. Since 2020, nearly 35,000 migrants had been saved from the pushbacks. Greece and the European Union were urged to respect the right to life., Mr. Kaymakci said terrorism remained one of the biggest challenges to the right of life. Syria offered a picture of what happened when the international community could not come together. The Syrian regime refused to agree to a political solution and to engage with the United Nations facilitated political process. Turkey hosted 3.7 million migrants and offered the only hub for the United Nations humanitarian aid to Syria. In Afghanistan, human rights remained under threat. In order for the Taliban to start respecting human rights, especially the rights of women, there was a necessity for gradual engagement with them and there was now an increased understanding about this in the international community. In Ethiopia, Turkey was working hard on finding a peaceful solution and was engaging with all stakeholders to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to Tigray. Thanks to Turkish efforts, there was a substantive chance to achieve peace in South Caucasus., PEKKA HAAVISTO, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland, said Finland stood with Ukraine. Russia had brought war into Europe - a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Human Rights Council. There was no justification for this, nor for the violations committed over the last eight years. Finland strongly condemned the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by Russia. The international community’s commitment to protecting and promoting human rights was at stake. People across the globe needed the determination of the Council more than ever. The Council should live up to its important mandate., Recently, the Council had shown leadership on the situation in Afghanistan and on the environment. Women and girls deserved full attention: all women, including indigenous as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons. One in three women worldwide experienced violence, a devastating impact on the victim and her rights, and with devastating societal implications. The Human Rights Council could make a difference in this regard. An open debate culture was vital: human rights defenders must be able to work freely without fear of reprisals. There was concern for the developments in many countries. The crackdown on civil society in countries such as Belarus and Russia was of concern. Human rights activists required courage in the midst of this. Everyone needed to contribute to the work against racism. Finland would continue to work to keep human rights at the forefront., MENARDO I. GUEVARRA, Secretary of Justice of the Philippines, re-affirmed that constructive engagement had helped promote the peace of communities and the safety of peoples within the Philippines. The review panel recently formed under the Philippines Department of Justice was preparing to investigate 250 cases that had resulted in death, as part of the Government's operations in Luzon. Fifteen special investigations teams had been looking into cases of extrajudicial killings, and prosecutions were underway against a number of law enforcement officials who had violated civil society actors. The Government of the Philippines had been reviewing its work alongside the United Nations and partner governments, and in accordance with the 1991 Minnesota Protocol on Investigations into Unlawful Deaths., In addition to the establishment of technical working groups, the Government of the Philippines had invited two Special Rapporteurs to investigate matters of the sale of children, and of breaches of freedom of expression. Mr. Guevarra reminded that a change in administration would take place by 30 June 2022, but the Philippines’ commitment to human rights and the rule of law and accountability would continue. Furthermore, the Philippines assured the international community of its commitment to build on the advances that had already been made in the field of human rights., https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/02/debat-de-haut-niveau-du-conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-de-nombreux",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-council-hears-21-dignitaries-it-continues-high-level-segment-speakers
IRC calls for adherence to international humanitarian law as civilians are killed and infrastructure is destroyed in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IRC,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"New York, NY, February 28, 2022 — The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is extremely alarmed by the targeting of civilian residences and public infrastructure as the war continues in Ukraine. At least 100 civilians have been killed, more than 160,000 people reportedly have been displaced within Ukraine and over 422,000 have been forced to flee across borders into neighboring Moldova, Poland and other European states. Europe must not just offer protection to Ukrainian nationals who have visa-free access to the EU, but to people of all citizenship and nationalities who face grave dangers as conflict escalates. Public infrastructure has also been destroyed, meaning thousands of people are without adequate water, electricity and access to markets where roads and bridges have been destroyed. The IRC strongly supports the UN Secretary General’s call on Russia to adhere to International Humanitarian Law, especially the protection of civilians and vulnerable groups such as women and girls., Lani Fortier, Senior Director of Delivery in Emergencies at the IRC said:, “Last week, a hospital was damaged during the initial stages of invasion; a grave breach of International Humanitarian Law. Active conflict will increasingly put pressure on Ukraine’s health system, already stretched by a 555% surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few weeks and 8 years of war. It is imperative International Humanitarian Law is adhered to in order to protect essential services. As it is when people become displaced, they leave their homes with very little provisions. To then have people cut off from basic services,will only drive further human suffering., “The IRC is also extremely concerned about the over 422,000 people who have fled borders into Poland, Moldova and other European states, as well as the 160,000 who have been displaced within Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities suggest that if the war continues at the current pace, 5 million people could become refugees. In Poland, which is preparing to receive up to 1 million refugees, the IRC is working to scale up support to the government and civil society and to provide for the basic needs of people fleeing the conflict. The IRC has connected with partners to establish a response that will provide critical support to civilians forced to flee their homes.”, MEDIA CONTACTS

"Amid Violence, Mass Forced Displacement, ‘Lives of Millions’ of Ukrainian Civilians at Stake, Humanitarian Affairs Chief Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
8983RD MEETING (PM)
SC/14812
28 FEBRUARY 2022, Delegate Says Russian Federation ‘Riding Roughshod’ over Geneva Conventions, The humanitarian situation in conflict-ravaged Ukraine is dire, the top United Nations officials for humanitarian affairs and refugees told the Security Council today, as they outlined the need for increased aid amid the violence and mass forced displacement unleashed by the Russian Federation’s military offensive., “The lives of millions of civilians are simply at stake,” Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told the Security Council as he briefed them on the situation in Ukraine. He highlighted that, on 1 March, the Secretary-General will launch a humanitarian appeal that includes both a flash appeal and a refugee response plan., “We have all been watching the military offensive in Ukraine with a sense of disbelief and horror,” he continued, noting that the recent events have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis caused by eight years of fighting in the eastern part of the country. Those needs have increased exponentially and now expand across the entire nation. As a result, the United Nations has increased its humanitarian presence, he said, noting that its movements have been hampered by an initial lack of assurances that they will be protected. Today, he finally received assurances in that regard, he said. In the meantime, local groups, including the Ukrainian Red Cross, are coming to the aid of civilians and evacuations., He went on to describe the damages to critical civilian infrastructure, such as health, electricity and water and sanitation, caused by fighting in cities and towns. “This effectively leaves civilians without the basics for day-to-day life,” he said. They are the ones who will bear the brunt of aggression, he underscored, emphasizing that, the longer the offensive continues, the greater the cost, with women facing greater risks of gender-based violence and children being exposed to physical harm. In addition, the economy could implode, causing a ripple effect that will exceed national borders., Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that, unless the conflict halted immediately, the global community should expect to see up to 4 million refugees in the coming weeks, an overwhelming burden for those countries receiving them. In the face of this, he noted that citizens and private companies have donated over $40 million to his agency in just a few days and he called on Governments to contribute, as well., Hundreds of thousands of people are seeking refuge in countries bordering Ukraine, seeking food, shelter and support, he continued. It is the largest exodus in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s and includes 280,000 refugees going to Poland, 94,000 to Hungary, 40,000 to the Republic of Moldova and 30,000 to Romania and other States. “We may have just seen the beginning,” he cautioned, commending those Governments in allowing access to those in flight, both Ukrainians and third-party nationals alike., Noting that Ukrainian refugees will join the swelling ranks of those from Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere, he stressed that humanitarian workers could not keep pace. “The responsibility that you have to ensure peace and security prevail over power struggles and narrow national interests has never been as urgent and indispensable a task as it is tonight,” he said, emphasizing: “If you fail and we fail, it may be too late.”, Ukraine’s delegate said that the Russian Federation has attacked kindergartens, hospitals and orphanages, mobile aid brigades and ambulance crews in his country. “There is no debate — these are war crimes,” he said. Against that backdrop, he applauded the decision by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor to open an investigation on possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as the appointment of an Assistant-Secretary-General to serve as the United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine., In the context of the provision of humanitarian corridors for civilians, he cautioned that, despite assurances of security, “Russian words often do not match their deeds”, and these corridors may instead become military targets. “Do not listen to Russian lies — listen to Ukrainian cries,” he said. In a similar vein, he urged delegates not to be misled by Russian Federation allegations of racial discrimination of refugees. If any cases become known, they will be investigated, he said., The Russian Federation’s delegate, President of the Security Council for the month of February, speaking in his national capacity, emphasized that “the special military operation conducted by the Russian military does not have the goal of occupying Ukraine or harming the local population.” There is no evidence of the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces, even though the opposite is being claimed as “dirty lies replicated in Western mass media very unfortunately have become a dangerous mark of our times”., He underscored that Moscow’s goal is to demilitarize the country and protect the people of Donbas and of Ukraine. As a result, there are no humanitarian concerns in the territories held by the Russian Federation’s armed forces. After the radicals departed, local authorities were able to provide all necessary services. However, there are humanitarian concerns in towns where the Ukrainian authorities hold sway, as they have given an order to provide arms to all citizens who request them, including newly released prisoners. The end result of this is mass killings, robberies and looting, he said., The special operation conducted by the Russian Federation does not impact civilian infrastructure, he continued. Over five days, there has not been a single documented case of targeted destruction and no evidence of the death of civilians caused by the Russian military. The opposite is constantly being claimed., France’s representative stressed that the Russian Federation is violating the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and “riding roughshod” over the Geneva Conventions. The humanitarian devastation is tragic, he said, noting the escalating number of civilian victims, including children. With that in mind, the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers is paramount, he said, calling for unimpeded and unhampered access to all those in need of assistance., The United Kingdom’s delegate decried Russian Federation President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, which has resulted in the threat of a humanitarian disaster for 44 million people. She went on to describe people hiding underground in Kyiv to escape violence, while missiles rain down on Kharkiv and cluster munitions destroy residential areas. The Russian Federation’s representative may dismiss the United Nations reporting on this as hysteria, she said, but over half a million people have already fled Ukraine’s borders, while another 7 million are displaced., India’s representative applauded the beginning of direct talks between the parties to the conflict. Differences, he said, can only be resolved by sustained diplomatic efforts. He highlighted his Government’s provision of humanitarian aid, including medical supplies, while also expressing his concern over the plight of Indian nationals trapped in Ukraine, noting that Government officials stood ready in neighbouring countries to offer assistance., China’s delegate warned against politicizing the process of the provision of humanitarian aid and said the United Nations and the international community should approach the matter with neutrality and impartiality. With that in mind, he underscored the need for direct dialogue between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Security Council should play a constructive role in any action it takes, he stressed., The Russian Federation’s delegate, who is also the President of the Security Council for February, began the meeting by announcing that 12 of the staff of his Government’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations were being expelled. It is a gross violation by the host country of the Vienna Convention, he said. His delegation needed to start an arbitration procedure on the host country in order to maintain a normally functioning Mission., In response, the representative of the United States said that it was not the subject of the current meeting, particularly given the gravity of the subject under discussion. The steps taken were in full accordance with the Headquarters Agreement, he said, noting that those diplomats asked to leave were engaged in activities that were not in accordance with their responsibilities as diplomats., Also speaking today were Mexico, Kenya, Ireland, Norway, Albania, Ghana, Gabon, United Arab Emirates and Brazil., The meeting began at 3:10 p.m. and ended at 4:55 p.m., Briefings, MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, briefing the Security Council from Geneva via video‑teleconference, said): “We have all been watching the military offensive in Ukraine with a sense of disbelief and horror.” The scale of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure has been alarming. Humanitarian needs are skyrocketing in the hardest-hit areas, and civilian children, women and men are being injured and killed. On Monday, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead. The real figure could be considerably higher, as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed. At least 160,000 people have been internally displaced across Ukraine, fleeing for safety. Again, the actual figure is likely much higher and could potentially be a significant proportion of the entire population, he noted, adding that more than half a million refugees have been forced to flee their country in search of safety., Aerial attacks and fighting in urban areas are damaging critical civilian facilities and disrupting essential services such as health, electricity, water and sanitation, he continued. “This effectively leaves civilians without the basics for day-to-day life,” he pointed out. Bridges and roads have been destroyed, cutting off people’s access to critical supplies and services. The use of explosive weapons in urban areas carries a high risk of indiscriminate impact, which is of particular concern in places like Kyiv and Kharkiv. Civilians will undeservedly suffer the most from these attacks on densely populated urban centres. Calling on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and spare all civilians and civilian objects from harm throughout their military operations, he stressed that the longer the offensive continues, the greater the cost will be for civilians. Children will miss school and face a greater risk of physical harm, displacement and severe emotional distress. Women, so often disproportionately affected by conflict, will be at even greater risk of gender‑based violence. The economy could implode, which will further exacerbate humanitarian needs and create a ripple effect that will travel far beyond Ukraine's borders., The upheavals in recent days are deepening a pre-existing humanitarian crisis, he said. Eight gruelling years of conflict in eastern Ukraine have already left 3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance on both sides of the contact line in the Donbas region. Humanitarian needs are much greater now and include large-scale displacement, across and beyond the whole country and not only in one region. The United Nations has expanded its humanitarian presence in Ukraine and will continue to do so. For the last three days, however, the Organization’s movements have been seriously constrained as a result of ongoing fighting, along with a lack of assurances from parties to the conflict that humanitarian movements will be protected. Nonetheless, this evening, he began to receive assurances that such aid will be protected, he said, expressing his hope that this will become a reality. Local organizations and institutions are doing a truly remarkable job responding, he said, highlighting that non-governmental organizations and the Ukrainian Red Cross are working to support civilians and evacuation operations., The most pressing humanitarian needs are for emergency medical services, including sexual and reproductive health services, critical medicine, health supplies and equipment, safe water for drinking and hygiene, as well as shelter and protection for the displaced, he continued. More people need to be reached with aid, and parties to the conflict must provide assurances that humanitarian workers and movements will be protected “even during the most severe days of the conflict”, he emphasized. Additionally, more resources are needed. On Wednesday, the Secretary-General will launch a humanitarian appeal for this crisis with two components: a three-month flash appeal for the situation inside the country and a regional refugee response plan for the situation outside, he said, calling on Member States to show support with quick, generous and flexible funding. “The lives of millions of civilians are simply at stake,” he stressed, reiterating the Secretary-General’s call for an immediate cessation of hostilities., FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, speaking via video‑teleconference and expressing pride that humanitarian workers had decided to remain in Ukraine, also noted that colleagues on the ground are now caught up in the deadly conflict. Already displaced, military attacks might force them to move again, but they are still striving to deliver help to those in need whenever the small window of relative security allows it, in partnership with non‑governmental organizations. The situation is moving so quickly and the levels of risk so high that it is impossible for humanitarian workers to systematically deploy the help needed. He echoed the Secretary-General’s urgent call to protect civilians and infrastructure and permit humanitarian access. Failure will compound the already extraordinary levels of suffering., In addition, hundreds of thousands of people are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries, needing food, shelter and support, he continued, pointing out that there are 520,000 refugees already in those countries. In 40 years, he noted he has rarely seen such an incredibly fast-rising exodus, the largest in Europe since the Balkan wars, including 280,000 refugees to Poland; 94,000 to Hungary; 40,000 to Republic of Moldova; and 30,000 to Romania and other States. Commending the Governments of receiving countries for allowing entry, he expressed serious concern over the likely escalation in number. “We may have just seen the beginning,” he warned. He encouraged those Governments to continue maintaining access for all fleeing — Ukrainians and also third-party nationals, with no discrimination. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partner agencies and non-governmental organization are scaling up, encouraging host countries to avail themselves of support and expert advice in many organizational and response capacities., Expressing regret that, unless there is an immediate halt to conflict, Ukrainians will continue to flee, he said organizations are planning for up to 4 million refugees in coming days and weeks — a huge burden for receiving States. Citing the launch of a United Nations humanitarian appeal for Ukraine tomorrow, he noted private companies and citizens worldwide have donated over $40 million to UNHCR alone in just a few days; he called on Governments to do the same. Ukrainian refugees — like Syrians, Afghans, Ethiopians and others — all hope to return to their countries as quickly as possible. He reiterated what he had told the Security Council a few months previous: humanitarian workers are dedicated but cannot keep pace with the growing number and gravity of crises. “The responsibility that you have to ensure peace and security prevail over power struggles and narrow national interests has never been as urgent and indispensable a task as it is tonight,” he said, adding: “If you fail and we fail, it may be too late.”, Statements, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) describing the humanitarian consequences of the Russian Federation offensive in Ukraine tragic, said that the number of civilian victims, including children continues to increase and civilian infrastructure is being destroyed. Further, some 500,000 have been forced to flee and this figure continues to climb hour by hour. Hailing the solidarity shown by neighbouring States, he said that the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — is violating the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, trampling on international humanitarian and human rights law and riding roughshod over the Geneva Conventions. The protection of civilians and humanitarian personnel is an absolute priority and there is no compromise on this, he stressed, reiterating his call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need. France and its partners in the European Union stand firmly beside Ukraine and its population. The European Union has already announced €90 million in humanitarian assistance. France has sent 33 tons of humanitarian assistance to Poland to help Ukrainians and is sending more to the Republic of Moldova. He also hailed the upcoming launch of a United Nations flash appeal for Ukraine and a refugee response plan for Ukrainians. France and Mexico will bring a draft resolution to the Security Council that calls for full respect for humanitarian law and unobstructed humanitarian access to respond to the urgent needs of the civilian population, he said., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said the figures and scenes described by briefers reveal a humanitarian situation of increasing gravity. His delegation will join France in presenting a draft resolution to seek the cessation of hostilities, safety of civilians and access for humanitarian workers. Underscoring that the use of explosive weapons in populated areas is unacceptable, he expressed concern that populations are deprived of electricity, water and basic infrastructure. Further, humanitarian workers must be afforded access to those in need without restriction. Noting that the alarming figures of refugees will rise rapidly, he urged States to keep borders open so the principle of non-refoulement is respected. Ukraine needs international solidarity today, he stressed, calling on all parties to respect international humanitarian law., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), underlining that the humanitarian suffering in Ukraine is unnecessary, expressed his regret over the mounting casualties and the hundreds of thousands internally displaced people, including those exiting Ukraine as refugees, as well as the growing damage to civilian objects and infrastructure. He thanked the Governments of Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia for working with Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enable its citizens in Ukraine visa‑free entry. However, in the unfolding emergency, there have been disturbing reports about the racist treatment of Africans and people of African descent seeking to flee Ukraine to safety, he said, noting that the media is covering these appalling incidents. Indeed, several States have confirmed that their citizens are suffering such treatment. He strongly condemned this racism, emphasizing that the mistreatment of African peoples on Europe’s borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or crossing the Mediterranean. He also went on to stress that the extensive unilateral economic sanctions that have been announced against the Russian Federation are almost certain to have serious humanitarian consequences. “Their effect, in total, may even amount to a form of blockade,” he said, noting that such considerable sanctions, rather than opening the path to peace may lead to an escalation, and broadening, of the conflict. The only way out of this increasingly dangerous crisis is for the prioritization of diplomacy to limit all military manoeuvres and to open the path to negotiation for peace, he said., RICHARD MILLS, JR. (United States) said that, in a matter of days, the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and premeditated attack on Ukraine has unleashed great suffering in the country. The international community must document and address all violations of international law and international human rights law. With half a million people already fleeing Ukraine, not including those who are displaced, “a nightmare is unfolding before our eyes”, he warned, with no clear idea of when President Vladimir V. Putin will end his war of choice against the country. Thanking those neighbouring Governments who have opened their borders, he stressed that refugees are refugees, regardless of race and creed. Those who remain face cash and fuel constraints affecting all aid delivery. The spectre of hunger also looms, with the World Food Programme (WFP) noting that the impact of the crisis will be felt far beyond Ukraine. An estimated 283 million people in 80 countries are food insecure and this conflict will only exacerbate that situation. Expressing grave concern over reports of damage to apartment buildings, schools and hospitals, as well as to bridges and roads damaged by shelling, he noted the United States is providing nearly $54 million in additional aid to Ukraine, with much more coming. “No matter what happens next, we must do everything — everything — we can do to help the people of Ukraine,” he said., JIM KELLY (Ireland) said that the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine has created a humanitarian catastrophe, compounding the suffering of millions with a rapidly rising toll of internally displaced persons and refugees in need of humanitarian assistance. “Millions of people in Ukraine are grappling with the humanitarian consequences of a war not of their making,” he said, underscoring that innocent civilians, including children, are paying the terrible price of conflict. Any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of international law, including the principles of the United Nations Charter, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Statute. He expressed great concern regarding the deployment of weapons and armaments and the conducting of missile strikes directly from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Ireland and its European Union partners are providing significant humanitarian support and stand ready to do more. “When conflicts rage, unpredictable, even barely conceivable outcomes can become all too real,” he said, warning that “threats to unleash forces that cannot be controlled, including threats of nuclear weapons, are utterly unacceptable”. He urged the Russian Federation to turn away from war and choose the path of dialogue and diplomacy., MONA JUUL (Norway) said that her country is stepping up its support to the civilian population and will provide $226 million to the humanitarian response. The Russian Federation alone bears the sole responsibility for this humanitarian crisis through its unprovoked military aggression, which violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The parties must comply with their obligations under international law and ensure the protection of the civilian population in all of Ukraine. She called on parties to protect all humanitarian personnel and ensure safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian access to those in need. Fighting is going on in and around urban areas with the use of heavy explosive weapons, she said, expressing her concern about the long-term harm to civilians, especially children, as well as to civilian infrastructure. She also expressed her deep concern over the reported use of cluster munitions. Explosive remnants of war will continue after the conflict ends. She demanded the unconditional withdrawal of Russian Federation troops from Ukraine and called for respect of international law., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the Russian Federation’s unprovoked aggression is causing a crisis unseen in Europe in decades, underlining those conflicts equal innocent victims and destruction. “Those who initiate conflicts do know this,” he stressed, highlighting the staggering numbers of people fleeing in a matter of days. International law is clear that targeting civilian and infrastructure constitutes serious crimes. He expressed support for the ongoing strong presence of United Nations agencies and their partners on the ground, as well as for safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian workers. Albania is happy to shelter Ukrainians fleeing the crisis, he said, adding that his country has joined European Union sanctions and has closed its airspace to Russian Federation planes except for emergency flights. “What is happening in Ukraine should not happen anywhere,” he said., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) welcomed the commencement of direct talks between the parties, as differences can only be bridged by sustained diplomacy. Citing the urgent and unprecedented emergency situation, he stressed that the core principles of humanitarian assistance must be honoured. His Government will provide urgent supplies, including medical aid. Expressing deep concern over the safety of thousands of Indian nationals stranded in Ukraine, including students, he said that senior Indian Government ministers have been deployed to neighbouring countries and stand ready to help his country’s citizens, as well as those of neighbouring countries and developing countries who are also stranded in Ukraine and might be seeking assistance. He expressed support for the appointment by the Secretary‑General of Amin Awad of Sudan as United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, to lead the coordination of all United Nations efforts, including the humanitarian response, on both sides of the contact line., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that, as a result of President Putin’s decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, that country of 44 million people has been brought to the brink of humanitarian catastrophe. Despite the Russian Federation’s claims, the international community can see indiscriminate attacks against men, women and children across Ukraine and the Russian Federation’s disregard for international humanitarian law. Missiles have rained down on Kharkiv, cluster munitions have hit residential areas and there has been disruption to supply chains causing food shortages in Kramatorsk. Violence in Kyiv has forced people to seek refuge underground, with many thousands, including the elderly and disabled unable to evacuate. Whether or not the Russian Federation delegate may try to paint the United Nations reporting as hysteria, half a million people have already fled to Poland, Hungary, Romania, Republic of Moldova and other countries, with 7 million displaced and United Nations agencies and humanitarian partners forced to suspend operations. Yesterday’s announcement of $54 million in United Kingdom aid to Ukraine brings the total amount pledged this year to $190 million, with a guarantee of up to $500 million of loans to Ukraine through multilateral development banks and United Kingdom humanitarian experts deployed to the region to support those fleeing the violence. As a humanitarian response is not enough to save the Ukrainian people from the disaster inflicted on them, she called “once again, for the sake of humanity”, for President Putin to stop this war and withdraw his forces from Ukraine., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) expressed her concern over the unfolding humanitarian situation. The indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas have spread fear and panic among the population, who have been forced to take shelter in subways. As well, more than half a million have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries as refugees. She called on the parties to grant unfettered access to humanitarian agencies and guarantee their safety. She also called for the parties to guarantee safe passage to civilians seeking to leave Ukraine. She urged the parties to assert the path of peace and seek an early resolution through dialogue and diplomacy., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that his Government does not want a war against a United Nations Member State. He expressed his concern over attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, and called on the belligerents to refrain from using weapons whose attacks would be indiscriminate. Humanitarian assistance should be supplied to the population in need without discrimination or hinderance. While commending the generosity of neighbouring countries to those who are fleeing the war, he also expressed alarm over the situation of African students fleeing Ukraine who have encountered discrimination as they flee and seek refuge. Commenting on several reports he has received in this regard, he stressed that such racism is unacceptable. The distress of the people can only stop when the hostilities stop, he emphasized, appealing for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), highlighting the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the hundreds of thousands of people suffering, due to lack of essential services and destruction of infrastructure, said his Government is looking into providing supplies, including medical equipment, based on its consistent efforts to alleviate civilian suffering. He reiterated the need for a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Continued fighting will lead to further worsening of the humanitarian situation, exacerbated by the extreme temperatures this winter, as civilians seek refuge and safe havens. Urging all parties to implement their obligations under international law, including by allowing humanitarian aid to reach those in need and to refrain from targeting civilians, he underlined the need to comply with the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, especially with respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States. These principles apply to all Member States, regardless of their resources, capabilities or geographical size., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) expressed his Government’s solidarity to all families who have lost someone in this war, to all those left without a home, water and electricity, to those who are fleeing in fear and to everyone who is trapped in a conflict zone, desperately attempting to find refuge. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have already fled Ukraine and many more will certainly follow, perhaps millions. He called on all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law and uphold the principles of distinction, proportionality, precaution, necessity and humanity. It is of paramount import to ensure the protection of civilians and of critical civilian infrastructure, as well as to ensure unhindered humanitarian access to all those in need and the protection of refugees and displaced persons. Beyond any discussions in the Security Council on the reasons for this war, the international community must come together to adopt measures to minimize the humanitarian impact of the conflict. Noting that the Russian Federation has placed its nuclear forces on high alert, he stressed that the use of these is contrary to international law. Any use of nuclear weapons would have unacceptable humanitarian consequences in Ukraine and beyond, he said., ZHANG JUN (China) underscored that what is unfolding is heart-wrenching, calling on all parties to exercise restraint. The safety and security of life and property of all civilians, including foreign nationals must be ensured. He emphasized that the United Nations and the international community must provide humanitarian assistance in the spirit of neutrality and impartiality, to avoid politicizing the process. Stressing it is crucial to return to the diplomatic track and promote de-escalation, he expressed support for direct dialogue between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, with any Council action placing it in a better position to play a productive role rather than leading to further escalation., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), Council President for February, spoke in his national capacity, noting that the situation in Ukraine gives rise to serious concern for the ordinary people “who ended up being held hostage by the Ukrainian radicals and nationalists that are clinging to power at any price”. In those territories under the control of the Russian armed forces, people are not undergoing humanitarian issues. The local authorities, after the radicals have left, are providing all the necessary services to the people. Issues only remain in those towns where the Ukrainian authorities issued an irresponsible order to distribute arms to anyone who wants it, including to criminals who were let out of prisons for this purpose. This resulted in mass killings, robberies and looting. Further, there are many instances where, later on, the victims of looters were “shamelessly presented as having perished at the hands of the so-called Russian infiltrators”., Addressing the people in Kyiv held by the radicals as human shields, he said that the Russian Federation’s Ministry of Defence has confirmed that all peaceful citizens of Kyiv can leave the capital of Ukraine via the Kyiv-Vasilkov highway. “This road is open and safe,” he said. “The special military operation conducted by the Russian armed forces does not have the goal of occupying Ukraine or harming the local population,” he continued, noting that its aim is the demilitarization of the country, which is crammed with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) weapons. It is also aimed at protecting the long-suffering people in Donbas and Ukraine. The special operation conducted by the Russian Federation does not impact civilian infrastructure. Over five days, there has not been a single documented case of targeted destruction and no evidence of the death of civilians caused by the Russian military. The opposite is constantly being claimed. He cautioned that “dirty lies replicated in Western mass media very unfortunately have become a dangerous mark of our times”. In the meeting today, delegates were told of the bombings of residential areas, hospitals, schools and kindergartens. However, it is Ukrainian radicals who are placing their attack weaponry in residential areas in direct violation of international humanitarian law. He asked Mr. Griffiths and Mr. Grandi to comment., In 2014, the Russian Federation extended assistance to the peaceful people in Donbas, who were encountering relentless shelling by the Ukrainian army, he continued. Even today, not a single Western colleague has mentioned the citizens of Donbas and their suffering for eight years. The Russian Federation currently has 110,000 refugees from Donbas who had to leave their homes a week ago when Kyiv tried to resolve the Donbas issue militarily, in violation of the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements. The blame also lies with Western partners who pumped Ukraine full of weapons. Since the beginning of 2014, about 3 million Ukrainian citizens have left for the Russian Federation. “Russia did not start the war; it is trying to end it,” he said, adding that Ukraine started the war in 2014. Noting the comment by the delegate of France who said sanctions do not violate international law, he pointed out that this is a duplicitous statement that has been heard before in the context of other countries. On the draft resolution that will be drafted by France and Mexico, he said that his delegation needs to study the text carefully before it issues any assessment., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said every new day of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked war against Ukraine increases human suffering. Welcoming the appointment of Amin Awad of Sudan as Assistant Secretary-General to serve as United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, he noted that job will be difficult during Russian Federation activities, which have been equated to war crimes. This is not only a security crisis, but a humanitarian crisis, and is not just a violation of international law, but a violation of the conscience of the world, he said. He called on the international community for humanitarian assistance, and to register all cases of violations of international law and international humanitarian law. According to latest reports from his Government, this is the most horrible large-scale invasion since the Second World War, with the shelling of Kharkiv and with Kyiv now sitting within Russian crosshairs. Over 352 people have been killed, including 16 children, with 2040 wounded., He went on to say that the Russian Federation has attacked kindergartens, orphanages and hospitals, firing on mobile aid brigades and ambulance crews. “This is not the action of a State with legitimate security concerns,” he stressed, adding: ""There is no debate; these are war crimes.” None of the facilities cited are legitimate military targets. He welcomed the statement from the International Criminal Court Prosecutor about the decision to proceed with opening an investigation regarding possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russian Federation military aggression kills not only Ukrainians, but thousands of foreigners, he pointed out, noting that his Government is doing its best to ensure their safety. He cautioned the Security Council to not be misled by Russian disinformation of alleged racial discrimination in refugee contexts. If there have been cases, they will be investigated. He also highlighted that children have been crossing borders without their parents and that 350,000 schoolchildren have no access to education., While it is urgent to agree on humanitarian corridors for civilians, he noted that, in regard to Russian assurances of security, “Russian words often do not match their deeds”. Those corridors may be easy military targets. Noting that the Council has heard the lies from the Russian side, he appealed to the 15‑nation organ: “Do not listen to Russian lies; listen to Ukrainian cries.” Citing the Russian Federation delegate’s earlier comment about the United States expulsion of 12 parties from their mission, he described them as a dozen spies who will no longer enjoy the benefits of American life. Meanwhile, he was looking forward to midnight, despite it being the most dangerous time in Ukraine, because it will mark the end of the abomination of the Russian Federation presidency of the Security Council, he said., Mr. GRIFFITHS, responding to the question by the Russian Federation delegate on the placement of heavy weaponry, said there is no confirmation of such reports of radicals placing such weaponry in residential areas. Accountability at this stage for breaches of international law — at this level of the conflict, at this level of the violence and at this level of the uncertainty — are very difficult to establish. “We are truly in a period of a fog of war, a fog that obscures the futures of so many people of Ukraine,” he said. He stressed that he had made a number of points in his briefing about fears of the impact on civilian objects and infrastructure as the result of urban warfare. He reiterated that large-scale urban warfare also requires the need to avoid the wide area of explosive weapons. He expressed his concern over what is being seen in the streets of some of the key large, modern cities in Ukraine and the way in which the people are voting with their feet, the way in which basic services are being interrupted and the way in which civilian infrastructure is being damaged. It will be discovered “who did what and who broke which requirements of international humanitarian law”, he said., Mr. GRANDI, saying that he did not wish to take the floor, expressed his support for the comments made by the Under-Secretary-General., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), speaking in his national capacity, took the floor a second time and pointed out that, of all the reports, videos and information on Ukraine, some are taken as fact while others — unquestionably reliable — are being considered inaccurate, unreliable and unverifiable. He said he would have to draw lessons from that, and he expected that the United Nations leadership would share how the Ukrainian activities will be considered., As it was the last scheduled meeting for the Russian Federation’s Council presidency in February, he expressed the appreciation of his delegation to the members of the Council and the secretariat for all their support. “It was a busy month, we managed to get consensus on many issues within our purview, although, as you know, not every one,” he said., For information media.

Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"New York, 28 February 2022
As delivered, Mr. President,, I speak to you from Geneva., Wherever you are in the world, we have all been watching the military offensive in Ukraine with a sense of disbelief and horror., As we all feared, civilians are already paying the price. The scale of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, even in these very early days, is alarming., Humanitarian needs are growing at an alarming pace in the hardest-hit areas., Civilian children, women and men have been injured and killed. Homes have been damaged and sometimes destroyed., As of yesterday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported at least 406 civilian casualties, including at least 102 dead in these few days. The real figure could be considerably higher, as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed., We know, and we will hear, of course, much more from Filippo, that at least 160,000 people have been internally displaced across Ukraine, fleeing for safety. We know that figure is likely much higher – potentially a significant proportion of the entire population. And, of course, as Filippo will tell you, we believe more than half a million refugees have been forced to choose to flee their country in search of safety., So, families are separated., The elderly and people with disabilities find themselves trapped and unable to flee, not even able to get that small comfort., The picture is grim – and could get worse still., Aerial attacks and fighting in urban areas are damaging critical civilian facilities and disrupting essential services such as health, electricity, water and sanitation, which effectively leaves civilians without the basics for day-to-day life., Bridges and roads have been destroyed, cutting off people’s access to critical supplies and services., The use of explosive weapons in urban areas carries a high risk of indiscriminate impact. This is of particular concern in places like Kyiv and Kharkiv., Civilians will undeservedly suffer the most from these attacks on densely populated urban centres, it follows., All parties must respect international humanitarian law; take constant care to spare all civilians and civilian objects from harm throughout their military operations., And parties should also, of course, avoid the use of wide-area explosive weapons in populated areas., And the longer this goes on, the greater the cost will be for civilians., Children will miss school and face a greater risk of physical harm, displacement and unimaginably severe emotional distress., Women, so often disproportionately affected by conflict, as so often discussed in this chamber, will be at even greater risk of gender-based violence. Women and children may be exposed to other forms of exploitation.The economy of Ukraine could implode, which will further exacerbate humanitarian needs and create a ripple effect that travels far beyond Ukraine's borders., Already the upheavals in recent days are deepening a pre-existing humanitarian crisis., Eight gruelling years of the conflict in eastern Ukraine had already left 3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance on both sides of the contact line in the Donbas region., And it goes without saying that humanitarian needs are now much greater, including the large-scale displacement, to which I have already referred across and beyond the whole country and not only in one region thereof., Humanitarian workers are doing their best to respond. The UN has expanded its humanitarian presence in Ukraine. We shall continue to do so., We are working to ensure we can scale up our operations as quickly as possible. And we had been preparing for this for some time., I must say that for the last three days, however, the movements of our dear colleagues in Ukraine have been seriously constrained as a result of ongoing fighting, and our inability to receive assurances from parties to the conflict that humanitarian movements will be protected. And only this evening I was fortunate to receive the beginning of some assurances to that effect. We must hope that comes into reality., In the meantime, local organizations and institutions are doing, as usual, the truly remarkable job that they do in all such situations responding to needs., Local NGOs and the Ukrainian Red Cross are working tirelessly to support civilians and evacuation operations., Health workers are working day and night to care for the injured. Aid organizations are providing psychosocial support to traumatized children and delivering first aid kits., And we are all here this afternoon to support their efforts. Today, our most pressing humanitarian needs are for emergency medical services, including sexual and reproductive health services, critical medicine, health supplies and equipment, safe water for drinking and hygiene, shelter and protection for the displaced., In all, 119 humanitarian organizations are operating in Ukraine, able to provide some form of humanitarian assistance, though clearly stilted in these particular days., Right now, we urgently need progress on two fronts if we want to reach more people with aid that they need, that they deserve., First, we need assurances from parties to the conflict that humanitarian workers and movements will be protected even during the most severe days of the conflict and not waiting for the conflict to subside. Even now, even today, we need to provide those protections to those workers to do the job that they want to do., Under international humanitarian law, all parties must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of impartial humanitarian relief for civilians in need and must ensure the freedom of movement of humanitarians – a point we have been making in many different ways in these past four days., And secondly, of course, we desperately need more resources., Tomorrow, the Secretary-General will launch a humanitarian appeal for this crisis with two components: a three-month Flash Appeal for the situation inside the country, and a Regional Refugee Response Plan for the situation outside, under the leadership of Filippo Grandi and his office., The Secretary-General, alongside Filippo, our NGO colleagues, and I will all call on Member States to show support with quick, generous and flexible funding., And cash will be a major source of delivery of humanitarian assistance in the particular circumstances that obtain in Ukraine., But this is certainly not enough., The lives of millions of civilians are simply at stake. We know from other recent conflicts how brutal, deadly and protracted urban warfare can be., We know how countries’ economies can be devasted. Infrastructure investment and development gains set back an entire generation. And we know enough to know that we do not yet know what will be the consequences of the events that we observe today., These things should never happen in any country anywhere., Every effort, of course, must be made to de-escalate the conflict., The hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have taken the decision to leave their homes to seek safety elsewhere in their country or beyond, and those, even more of them, who remain at peril for the loss of basic services – of pensions, of support, of the services their children need, of the safety of the day that may come and may not., I reiterate finally, Mr. President, the Secretary-General’s calls for the only thing that we must all pray for: an immediate cessation of hostilities., Mr. President,, Thank you very much.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-martin

ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 1ST & 2ND MEETINGS (AM & PM)
GA/12404
28 FEBRUARY 2022, Future of Rules-Based World Order at Risk, Several Delegates Warn;
Speakers for Kyiv, Moscow Both Say They Are Exercising Right to Self-Defence, The United Nations stands with the people of Ukraine, including more than 500,000 who crossed the country’s borders fleeing relentless attacks by Russian forces, Secretary-General António Guterres told an emergency special session of the General Assembly today, warning of potentially dire consequences for the world at large., Dozens of delegates from among the Assembly’s 193 Member States took part in the historic session, which is just the eleventh such meeting in the United Nations 77-year history. Many speakers warned that, amid the first full-scale international aggression in Europe since the end of the Second World War, the very future of the rules-based world order now hangs in the balance., [Today’s special session was mandated by a 27 February vote in the Security Council, following its failure to adopt a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s recent actions in Ukraine. See Press Releases SC/14808 and SC/14809 for details.], “Enough is enough,” said Mr. Guterres, adding: “The fighting in Ukraine must stop now.” Noting that bombardments by the Russian Federation have been pounding the country day and night, he said the capital, Kyiv, now finds itself surrounded. Ukrainians have been forced to shelter in subway stations and more than half a million have fled across the country’s borders. Citing credible accounts of serious damage sustained by residential buildings and other non-military infrastructure, he described the attacks as unacceptable and stressed that Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected., Warning of potentially dire repercussions for the region and the entire world, he went on to note that the United Nations has assured Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that it will not abandon his country during its time of need. The Organization is already providing humanitarian assistance to some 3 million people on both sides of the contact line. “We are fully committed to staying and delivering,” he said, calling on all sides to uphold their obligations to allow safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian aid and on the world’s nations to mobilize support. “Humanity cannot afford to be locked in a mindset that dredges up the worst of the last century,” he stressed., Abdulla Shahid (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, echoed those sentiments, calling on the parties to exercise maximum restraint and return to diplomacy and dialogue. Noting that a rare window of opportunity for dialogue has opened — with representatives of Moscow and Kyiv meeting today for the first time since fighting erupted — he urged the sides to seize that chance and rapidly de-escalate the situation. For its part, the General Assembly and its members continue to represent the collective conscience of humanity, and its strength is rooted in its moral authority. “Let’s demonstrate that moral courage and use today’s debate not to whip up war rhetoric, but to give peace a chance,” he stressed., Throughout the debate, many delegates voiced their views on a draft resolution to be taken up by the Assembly later this week, which is similar to the text which was vetoed by the Russian Federation in the Security Council. Should the resolution pass by a majority vote, it is widely expected to condemn the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine., Ukraine’s representative, taking the floor first, thanked the Secretary-General for his strong stance in support of peace and the United Nations Charter. He noted that, just this morning, the Russian army launched a major attack on the residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Many residential buildings have been destroyed and kindergartens and medical facilities have been struck. While Ukraine has activated its right to self-defence in line with the Charter, he urged the Assembly to demand an end to all acts of aggression against a sovereign and independent State. Indeed, should the United Nations fail to respond to the crisis, it will face much more than criticism — it will face oblivion. “If Ukraine does not survive, international peace will not survive,” he stressed., The representative of the Russian Federation, rebuking those comments, said the root of the current crisis lies instead with Ukraine itself. Kyiv flouted the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, failed to engage in dialogue with the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and turned a blind eye to the people of Donbas. Against that backdrop, President Vladimir Putin decided to react. “There is a need to de-Nazify Ukraine,” he stressed, adding that his country is exercising its right to self-defence from Ukraine, which strives to obtain nuclear weapons, seeks North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership and is making false territorial claims against the Russian Federation., The representative of France declared that abstaining in the Assembly’s upcoming vote is “not an option”. In taking up that text, the Assembly has a historic responsibility to call for an end to war and for the Russian Federation to remove its troops from Ukraine, he said, calling on all Member States to vote in favour of the proposed draft. Emphasizing that no country can or should avert their gaze from the armed aggression and those who are seeking refuge, he went on to note that the Assembly’s special session does not imply that the Security Council has renounced its responsibilities. In fact, the 15-member Council will meet this afternoon to take up a draft resolution on the humanitarian impacts of the crisis., The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, condemned in the strongest possible terms the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces. Also condemning the involvement of Belarus in that aggression, he declared: “Russia bears full responsibility for this aggression and the resulting destruction and loss of life.” Moscow must immediately cease its military operations and unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from Ukraine, while engaging in earnest in dialogue with a view to a diplomatic solution. “The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the twenty-first century,” he added., Poland’s delegate, expressing his support for the resolution to be tabled in the Assembly, said the global community is facing one of the worst humanitarian crises in Europe since the Second World War. Noting that Poland’s borders are open to those fleeing Moscow’s aggression in neighbouring Ukraine, he said it has already welcomed people from 125 nationalities. Noting the outpouring of spontaneous readiness to help by individuals in Poland, he said a dedicated website was set up for volunteers to register. “Poland may not be a geopolitical super-Power, but we want to be a solidarity super-Power,” he said, also paying tribute to the Ukrainians defending their motherland and standing for their country’s freedom., The representative of Brazil declared: “This is a defining moment for our Organization and for the world.” Noting that his country voted in favour of the resolution before the Security Council and regretting that it was not adopted, he noted that, in recent years, the world has seen a deterioration of security and the balance of power in Eeastern Europe, which paved the way for the current crisis. However, that in no way justifies the use of force against a sovereign Member State. Urging an end to belligerent acts before it is too late, he also called upon all actors to reassess their decisions concerning the supply of weapons and the application of sanctions, particularly those which could affect the global economy in such critical areas as food security., In similarly nuanced remarks, the representative of China said the situation in Ukraine is rapidly evolving to a point which his country “does not wish to see and which is not in the interest of any party”. Calling on all sides to exercise restraint and step up diplomatic efforts, he rejected any approach that might exacerbate tensions. “The cold war has long ended, and […] nothing can be gained from stirring up a new cold war,” he said, warning that one country’s security must not come at the expense of another’s and cautioning against the expansion of any military blocs., Bolivia’s representative, striking a similar tone, said responsibility for the current crisis rests not only on the shoulders of the Russian Federation but also on those of Western Powers who jeopardized peace and security through the expansion of NATO. Rejecting all wars of aggression, he spotlighted invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine and, today, Ukraine. Recalling the bombing of Yugoslavia which occurred without the authorization of the Council, he condemned the moral double standards shown by certain Powers which are fanning the flames of confrontation, rather than seeking peace., Singapore’s representative emphasized that it is particularly crucial for small countries, such as his, to “send a clear signal that we are united to uphold international law”. Indeed, the Russian Federation’s unprovoked invasion violates the United Nations Charter and presents an existential issue for a tiny nation like Singapore, he said, adding that a world in which “might makes right” would jeopardize the sovereignty of small nations. Member States must act swiftly and with great purpose, he said, recalling that “the world is watching” the Assembly’s historic special session., At the meeting’s outset, the Assembly adopted, without a vote, the provisional agenda of its eleventh emergency special session (document A/ES-11/2). It decided that the Credentials Committee of its eleventh emergency special session would have the same membership as that of the Assembly’s seventy-sixth regular session, namely the Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, China, Namibia, Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Sweden and the United States. In light of the urgency of the session, it further decided to accept the credentials approved for the seventy-sixth regular session for the purposes of the eleventh emergency special session., Also speaking today were the representatives of Denmark (on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic countries), United Kingdom, Georgia, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland, New Zealand, Panama (on behalf of the Alliance for Development in Democracy), Bulgaria, Italy, Canada, Uruguay, Slovakia, Belgium, Netherlands, Fiji (on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum), Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, Croatia, Turkey, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Kenya, Barbados, Maldives, Costa Rica, Greece, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala, Albania, Syria, India and Chile., The General Assembly will reconvene Tuesday, 1 March, at 10 a.m. to continue its emergency special session., Opening Remarks, ABDULLA SHAHID (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, emphasizing that the military offensive by the Russian Federation is a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, renewed the call for an immediate ceasefire, for all parties to exercise maximum restraint and for a full return to diplomacy and dialogue. Convening of this eleventh emergency special session, rooted in the Charter and resolution 377A(V), “Uniting for peace”, is a new opportunity to ensure that the leadership of the United Nations meets the expectation of the people it serves on matters related to peace and security. Welcoming the Secretary-General’s announcement that $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund will be allocated to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, he said security and access for humanitarian efforts must be guaranteed. The ongoing military offensive is inconsistent with the Charter, drafted so soon after the Second World War and based on the principle of sovereign equality to outline a world where Member States settle their international disputes by peaceful means, without the threat or use of force., “Let us remind ourselves that we founded the United Nations to maintain international peace and security,” he continued. To that end, he said Member States must take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations. Recalling a rare window of opportunity opened on 27 February for dialogue, he said this chance must be used to meaningfully and rapidly de-escalate the situation. The General Assembly with its 193 Member States represents the collective conscience of humanity, and its strength is rooted in its moral authority. In this vein, he said: “Let’s demonstrate that moral courage and use today’s debate not to whip up war rhetoric, but to give peace a chance; let’s ignite the fire of love, humanity and compassion. Guns are better off when knotted. Let peace prevail.”, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared that the “the fighting in Ukraine must stop now”. Bombardments by the Russian Federation have been pounding the country day and night, and the capital, Kyiv, is now surrounded on all sides. Emphasizing that ordinary Ukrainians have been forced to shelter in subway stations and more than 500,000 have fled across the country’s borders, he also cited credible accounts of serious damage sustained by residential buildings and other non-military infrastructure. “Enough is enough,” he stressed, describing those attacks against Ukraine as unacceptable. Civilians must be protected and international law upheld, and Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders must be respected., Warning of potentially dire consequences for the wider region and the entire world, he recalled that on 27 February the Russian Federation put the country’s nuclear forces on high alert. Welcoming the generosity of Ukraine’s neighbours, he recalled that during a recent call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy he reassured him that the United Nations will not abandon Ukraine during its time of need. The Organization is already providing humanitarian assistance to some 3 million people on both sides of the contact line. “We are fully committed to staying and delivering,” he said, noting that operations are expanding to quickly get help to those who need it. Among other things, he has allocated $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund and appointed Amin Awad as Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine. On 1 March, the United Nations will launch two coordinated humanitarian appeals, one addressing the needs inside Ukraine, and the other seeking to support those crossing the country’s borders., Calling on all sides to uphold their obligations to facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance, he urged all Member States to mobilize in support of the humanitarian appeals to help those in and outside Ukraine “whose numbers will only grow” given the magnitude of the crisis. However, while aid is critical, the only true solution to the crisis is peace. The attack on Ukraine challenges international law and the global rules-based order, he said, spotlighting the possible widespread economic implications of the crisis. “The guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open,” he said, expressing hope that the current talks taking place between the two sides will end the fighting and pave a path to lasting peace. Describing war as a distraction from the real crises facing humanity today, he stressed: “Humanity cannot afford to be locked in a mindset that dredges up the worst of the last century.”, Statements, SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that, for the first time since the birth of the United Nations, there is a full-fledged war in the heart of Europe. “Everyone in this hall, and everyone in the world, knows that Russia and Russia alone started this invasion,” he said. Speaking in Russian, he read from a series of mobile phone text messages between a Russian soldier and his mother, moments before he was killed. That death toll is only rising, he said, stressing that a large global Power — seeking military greatness — has launched a full-scale attack on its smaller neighbour. “Does this remind you of something?”, he asked, spotlighting direct parallels between the current situation and the beginning of the Second World War. Just this morning, the Russian army launched a major attack on the residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city., Thanking the Secretary-General for his strong stance in support of peace and the United Nations Charter, he said Ukraine was forced to call for today’s emergency special session given the extraordinary circumstances it faces, and following the defeat of an important draft resolution in the Security Council last week. “We do not accept the Russian logic that the Council was unable to act due to one-sided rhetoric,” he said. Today, Moscow’s missiles are aimed at critical infrastructure near Kyiv, including bridges, airports and water reservoirs. Many residential buildings have been destroyed and kindergartens and medical facilities have been struck. Noting that Russian forces have also seized the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, with radiation levels increasing significantly, he emphasized that Ukraine has activated its right to self-defence in line with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter., In response to all those actions, he said, the General Assembly should be vocal in demanding an end to all acts of aggression against a sovereign and independent State. Those demands must include a full and immediate withdrawal of Russian forces, a reversal of the Russian Federation’s decision regarding the status of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, and the recognition of the treacherous role played by Belarus in supporting those actions. “What is happening now in Ukraine has already had humanitarian and security implications for all of you,” he said, citing impacts on food systems, energy supplies and financial markets., He warned that, should the United Nations fail to respond to the crisis, it will face much more than criticism — it will face oblivion. As his country continues to pay the ultimate price for freedom, he stressed: “If Ukraine does not survive, international peace will not survive.” The fate of the United Nations is also at stake. Concluding, he posited that while the Russian Federation has done everything possible to legitimize its presence at the United Nations, its membership is not legitimate, as the General Assembly never voted on its admission to the Organization following the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the root of the crisis lies in Ukraine itself, which flouted the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements, failed to engage in dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk and denied recognizing them. In February, provocation continued against the people of Donbas, which requested assistance from Moscow at a time when a flood of refugees were entering the Russian Federation as Western partners turned an uncompassionate blind eye. As such, President Putin decided to react, in line with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, with the goal being to protect those people who had suffered torment and genocide, he said, adding that: “There is a need to de-Nazify Ukraine.” Indeed, the issue of sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States feature in accusations against the Russian Federation, but these principles must apply to States that conduct themselves in line with existing norms, which Ukraine has not. His delegation is exercising its right to self-defence from Ukraine, which strives to obtain nuclear weapons, seeks North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership and is making territorial claims against the Russian Federation, which is protecting itself from a nationalist threat. Instead of compelling Kyiv to comply with its obligations, the West is repeating the senseless mantra that the Minsk agreements are not being implemented by the Russian Federation, which is not even part of those instruments., The Western countries have “created a bubble that cannot but pop”, he said, noting the warnings issued in 2008 that members of NATO should think “three times” before allowing Ukraine and Georgia to join its alliance. Yet, in 2014, a brutal anti-constitutional coup in Kyiv saw nationalists and radicals seizing power to create an anti-Russian policy and a push to join NATO. Emphasizing that “for Ukraine to join NATO is a red line”, he said these actions compelled the Russian Federation to adopt measures in response. Recently, Moscow had proposed that agreements would be made between the United States and NATO, but this was rebuffed with counter-offers to discuss secondary issues. The United Nations can help to bring stakeholders together to address the situation. However, lacking any attempts to date to calmly discuss this issue, the Russian Federation voted against the draft Security Council resolution on 25 February, which was an anti-Russian and anti-Ukraine attempt to salvage and cement Kyiv authorities who have brought the country to the brink of tragedy. The Russian Federation also vetoed the draft due to issues unaddressed in its provisions: how the 2014 coup resulted with the Maidan junta raining bombs on the people of Donetsk and Luhansk, with the blessing of Western partners; how death squads and neo-Nazis shelled women and children in Donbas for eight years; and how protestors were burned alive, shot by snipers flaunting their presence., The root of the conflict lies at the feet of the Ukraine authorities and the Western countries supporting them, he said. Right now lies are being spread across media outlets, including that the Russian Federation is shelling civilians. Nationalists, however, are deploying heavy equipment and operating in civilian areas — tactics used by terrorists that must be condemned. For eight years, a human rights body has reported how the neo-Nazis were born and are being maintained in Ukraine, with condemned criminals and convicts carrying out grave crimes, 25,000 machine guns being distributed without documentation, and with parties being tasked with slaughtering communities. On social networks, an information war has been unleashed, he said, citing 1.2 million pieces of fake news, including the correspondence just recited by his counterpart from Ukraine. To disregard the concerns of the Russian Federation runs counter to international principles. The Russian Federation did not begin these hostilities, which were unleashed by Ukraine, he said, adding that “Russia is seeking to end this war.”, OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, condemned in the strongest possible terms the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russian armed forces in violation of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The bloc also condemns the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and calls on the Russian Federation and Belarus to abide by their international obligations. Alarmed by the Russian Federation’s raising of the nuclear alert level, he called on that country to de-escalate, immediately return to the previous alert level of its nuclear arsenal and avoid any actions that could risk the safety or security of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine, a non-nuclear weapon State under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. “Russia bears full responsibility for this aggression and the resulting destruction and loss of life,” he said, demanding that it cease its military operations immediately and unconditionally and withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. He also called on the Russian Federation to engage in earnest in dialogue with a view to a political and diplomatic solution., The Russian Federation’s actions grossly violate international law and clearly breach the United Nations Charter and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Helsinki Final Act, as well as the Russian Federation’s specific commitments to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, he said. “This is arguably the biggest aggression in Europe since the end of the Second World War,” he said, adding that it follows similar Russian aggression against its neighbours in 2008 and 2014. Failure by the Assembly to immediately and effectively acknowledge and address the Russian Federation’s actions would erode trust in the rules-based global order. “The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the twenty-first century,” he said, stressing that tensions and conflict should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. The European Union and like-minded partners have been united in making unprecedented efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution. The bloc will continue to do its utmost to protect the integrity of the rules-based international system, he said, calling on all United Nations Member States to do the same., MARTIN BILLE HERMANN (Denmark), speaking on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic Eight, said the Russian Federation counted on the world to remain silent, but “we are acting, and on this day — and until peace prevails and every Ukrainian can safely return to their homes — we stand with Ukraine.” If unanswered, the Russian aggression against Ukraine will have global and long-term negative consequences, challenging the rules-based international order, he said, adding that: “We will continue to look at every single instrument in our toolbox”. Sanctions have been enacted to cripple President Putin’s ability to finance his war machine, with the role of the Lukashenko regime in Belarus in enabling the attack also demanding a firm response. Nordic-Baltic countries have been delivering financial, humanitarian and military assistance to the people of Ukraine, and every nation must look at how to further their support. Calling on the Russian Federation to stop this senseless war, he demanded an immediate ceasefire, urging Moscow to withdraw all its forces from Ukraine and return genuinely to the path of dialogue and negotiation. Every civilian death and every war crime will be recorded and perpetrators will be held accountable and brought to justice, he said, noting Ukraine’s request to the International Court of Justice and adding: “History has its eyes on us; every legal avenue available will be used to hold the aggressor to account.”, The matter is now in the hands of the General Assembly, he said, where one veto cannot overrule the United Nations membership and where the power and legitimacy are manifested in numbers. The Russian Federation’s shameful use of the veto in the Security Council on 25 February on a matter it bears full responsibility for is completely unacceptable, and its status as a permanent Council member gives it a special responsibility of maintaining peace and security, not to violate Charter principles. The latest Council meetings showed the need for reform and demonstrated who had the firmness and valour to defend the United Nations Charter. The General Assembly has the power to send a firm message to President Putin, he said, emphasizing that: “What we say today and how we vote on the resolution presented will make a difference on the ground in Ukraine and to the Ukrainian people; they will be watching us.” The Russian Federation’s unlawful and brutal armed attack on Ukraine will affect and impact everyone. “If we do not join our forces to turn back this tide today, we will be even less equipped to deal with similar crimes in the future — wherever, on whichever continent they occur”, he said, adding that the world will hold accountable the Russian Federation, as the main aggressor, and Belarus, as the enabler., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), condemning the ongoing violence, said the Russian Federation’s acts of aggression violate Charter principles and it flouted its responsibility as a Security Council member when it vetoed a resolution co-sponsored by 82 Member States. The General Assembly has a historic responsibility to call for an end to war and for the Russian Federation to remove its troops from Ukraine. France supports the efforts to draft a resolution demanding the Russian Federation respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. He called on all Member States to vote in favour of the proposed draft. No one can or should avert their gaze from the armed aggression and those who are seeking refuge. Abstaining from the vote is “not an option”, he said, calling on the United Nations membership to support the draft resolution. Convening this emergency session does not mean that the Security Council renounces its responsibilities, he said, noting that the 15-member Council will meet this afternoon on the situation in Ukraine, at which France and Mexico will table a draft resolution to guarantee the safe and unhindered access to those in need in Ukraine. Noting the European Union’s €90 million humanitarian aid package, he said France has taken steps to mobilize an international response to the Russian Federation’s aggression, has imposed sanctions against the Russian Federation and will offer defence equipment to Ukraine., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) recalled that on 25 February 81 Member States supported a Security Council resolution to stop the war in Ukraine. Moscow was completely isolated in rejecting that text. The facts are clear: “Russia has invaded Ukraine without provocation and without justification.” Brave men and women are withstanding the barrage of attacks and fighting for Ukraine’s future as a free and independent nation. However, the humanitarian consequences are already immense, she said, citing fresh news today of shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv and noting that some 7 million Ukrainians have been displaced. Describing the international response to the Russian Federation’s aggression as united and swift, she warned: “If we do not stand up for them now, the safety of every nation’s borders and independence are at risk.” In that context, she voiced the United Kingdom’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and called on President Vladimir Putin to end the senseless war, urging all Member States to speak up for Ukraine and defend the United Nations Charter., KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia), aligning himself with the European Union, said the Assembly has gathered in an emergency session because the Council once again failed to act as a guardian of peace and security. It is up to the Assembly to stand up and make certain the United Nations delivers on the purpose for which it was created. The use of armed force by a Member State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another Member State violates Article 2(4) of the Charter and constitutes an act of aggression, as defined by Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX), adopted by consensus. “Russia’s full-scale military aggression against Georgia should have served as a wake-up call for all,” he said. Georgia knows the toll of war and its disastrous consequences. It is devastating not only for those who live through it, but passes down to generations. The core principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for a New Europe and the commitments taken under the Budapest Memorandum are non-negotiable nor subject to revision by any country no matter how large and powerful it may be. Territorial acquisition through use of force, or a threat to do so, is illegal and impermissible. He called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its military activities, withdraw all its forces and armaments from Ukraine, and reverse its decisions related to the status of integral parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea. Moreover, the Russian Federation should do the same in Georgia: withdraw forces, allow humanitarian access and reverse the status-related decision with regards to the occupied territories there., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) fully agreed with the text of the resolution to be tabled by Ukraine and called on all Member States to stand firmly behind it as it will demonstrate the Assembly’s adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter. To achieve peace, Poland, as the current OSCE Chairmanship-in-Office, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine to let humanitarian organizations deliver assistance. There is no doubt that the international community is confronted with one of the biggest humanitarian crises in Europe since the Second World War. In the first three days of the Russian aggression, facilitated by the complicity of the Belarussian regime of Aleksandr Lukashenko, nearly 500,000 people left Ukraine and 300,000 found refuge in Poland. “Poland keeps its borders open,” he said, adding: “The nationals of all countries who suffered from Russian aggression, or whose life is at risk, can seek shelter in Poland.” Today alone, it has already welcomed people from 125 nationalities, including 100 Russians, he said, dismissing as a “complete lie and terrible insult” reports of discriminatory practices at the Ukraine-Poland border based on race or religion., In addition to providing refuge, Poland gives those who suffer very practical and tangible help, he said, noting the birth of the first Ukrainian refugee babies in Poland and that 7,000 hospital beds in 20 hospitals are ready for Ukraine’s wounded. Poland is ready to cooperate closely with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and any other humanitarian organizations to ease the burden on civilians targeted by Russian aggression. Noting the outpouring of spontaneous readiness to help by individuals in Poland, he said a “Helping Ukraine” website was set up for volunteers to register. “Poland may not be a geopolitical super-Power, but we want to be a solidarity super-Power,” he said, also paying tribute to the Ukrainians defending their motherland and standing for their country’s freedom., ALEXANDER MARSCHIK (Austria), associating himself with the European Union, said he cannot remain silent in the face of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. Noting that such questions as the one being discussed today should be addressed by the Security Council — which also cannot remain silent when the United Nations Charter is trampled by military boots — he asked whether the system of veto power is still fit to oversee matters of peace and security. It is now the Assembly’s obligation to take up a resolution condemning Moscow’s aggression. “By voting yes, we show the world that the United Nations is still able to take up its responsibility to defend the rule of law,” and show the Ukrainian people that they are not alone. Noting that an attack on one Member State is an attack on all, he said that if a country with one of the world’s largest arsenals still feels insecure, it should pursue diplomacy and disarmament, not attacks on neighbours. He also cautioned against “what-about-ism”, stressing that misdeeds today cannot be justified by pointing to the past faults of others., JAKUB KULHÁNEK (Czech Republic), associating himself with the European Union, urged the Russian Federation to immediately stop its military actions and to unconditionally withdraw its forces and military equipment from the territory of Ukraine. The Assembly is meeting today after a permanent member of the Security Council started a war of aggression against a fellow Member State, in flagrant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. Echoing concern about horrific humanitarian reports coming out of Ukraine, he declared: “Let me make it crystal clear — Russia and its people are under no threat from Ukraine or NATO.” The Russian Federation’s veto in the Security Council on 25 February is yet more proof of its blatant disrespect for the United Nations. Noting that the Czech Republic stands firmly with the Ukrainian people and will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Assembly, he urged others to do the same, declaring: “Vote with your conscience […] let us not forget that the whole world is watching.”, PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL (Switzerland) recalled that veto of the Russian Federation — a permanent Council member — of Friday’s draft resolution runs counter to Article 27 of the Charter and that, as a party to the conflict, that country should have abstained from voting. Expressing support for the Assembly’s draft resolution, she called on all Member States to do the same. The Russian Federation’s attempts to legitimize its action are not credible; there was no provocation to justify such an attack. Calling on the Russian Federation, like all nuclear-weapon States, to refrain from any threat to use these weapons, or even from using them, she noted that the Russian Federation has just joined a declaration of the five permanent Council members, which reaffirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Calling on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and human rights, she condemned all violations, including in cyberspace. Welcoming the Secretary-General’s offer of good offices, diplomatic efforts of the Member States and news that the parties to the conflict have met today for initial negotiations, she said: “This conflict — like all conflicts — can only be solved through dialogue.”, CAROLYN JANE WEATHERALL SCHWALGER (New Zealand), voicing support for the Secretary-General’s assessment that Moscow’s decision to recognize the “independent republics” violates Charter principles, said: “We cannot pick and choose when to espouse the centrality of the Charter.” This emergency special session is a direct result of the Russian Federation’s actions and because its disgraceful veto had prevented the Council from condemning those acts. “There is no place for the veto in the Security Council,” she said, noting that New Zealand, with a group of small States, has long opposed the granting of this power to the permanent Council members. New Zealand strongly supports international efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis diplomatically, she said, adding: “We, the international community, must act now to prevent further pointless loss of innocent life and to support those who now find themselves displaced through no fault of their own.” New Zealand is supporting humanitarian aid efforts and has joined others in implementing sanctions. She called on Moscow to act consistently with its international obligations, cease military operations, permanently withdraw, take all possible steps to protect civilians and return to diplomatic negotiations as a pathway to resolve the conflict., MARKOVA CONCEPCIÓN JARAMILLO (Panama), speaking on behalf of the Alliance for Development in Democracy, called for negotiations on the basis of shared respect for the Charter and international law and condemned the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. The Alliance respects the Secretary-General’s call for a cessation in hostilities and calls for moderation and reason and for international rights and humanitarian law to be respected, she said. All efforts should be made to provide rapid and unhindered access to all those in need. The serious situation is a challenge to the complex global crisis created by the pandemic. The Alliance has made joint efforts to ensure the safe transit of its nationals across the Ukraine border. Dialogue and negotiation, accompanied by respect for the Charter and Assembly resolutions, are the only guarantee for a lasting solution to the conflict affecting Eastern Europe, she said calling on all parties to return to diplomatic dialogue., ZHANG JUN (China) said the situation in Ukraine is rapidly evolving to a point which his country “does not wish to see and which is not in the interest of any party”. Calling on all sides to exercise restraint and step up diplomatic efforts, he said Ukraine should serve as a bridge of communication between East and West instead of as a frontline for geopolitical rivalries. Rejecting any approach that might further exacerbate tensions and voicing support for continued humanitarian efforts, he stressed that civilian life and property must be guaranteed. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China is unequivocal that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity must be upheld. “The cold war has long ended, and […] nothing can be gained from stirring up a new cold war,” he said, warning that one country’s security must not come at the expense of another’s and cautioning against the expansion of any military blocs., LACHEZARA STOEVA (Bulgaria), aligning himself with the European Union, said the Assembly has gathered under extraordinary circumstances that defy reason but unfortunately are reality — that the Russian Federation, a permanent Council member, is executing an act of aggression against Ukraine, a founding United Nations member. Condemning in the strongest possible terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, he said it not only undermines global security and stability but also puts the international rules-based order in jeopardy. “It is deplorable that the Russian Federation used its veto power to prevent the Security Council from exercising its primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security,” he said. Yet the Council’s decision to urgently refer the matter to the Assembly demonstrates the resolve of the other Council members to do everything possible to address this serious act of aggression. The fact that the Council has taken this decision, for the first time in 40 years, speaks of the situation’s gravity., He demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its military actions, unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from all of Ukraine and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. “The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the twenty-first century,” he said, also strongly condemning the involvement of Belarus, including by providing its territory to be used as a launching ground for the Russian aggression. Belarus must refrain from such action and abide by its international obligations. Likewise, indiscriminate acts against the civilian population in Ukraine are unacceptable and must stop immediately. The international community cannot turn a blind eye to a blatant act of aggression against a sovereign, peace-loving nation, he said, adding: “Today it is against Ukraine.”, MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy), associating himself with the European Union, said the Assembly has the responsibility to make its voice heard in the face of the current grave threat to international peace and security. Italy has made its position in support of the Ukrainian people, and against the blatant aggression being committed by the Russian Federation, clear. Also condemning the role being played by Belarus, he said the European Union has implemented strong measures against both Moscow and Minsk, and urged the Russian Federation to abide by the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Minsk agreements package. “Russia’s actions are causing enormous human suffering and triggering a humanitarian disaster,” he warned, demanding safe and unhindered humanitarian access. He also noted that Italy is scaling up its support for Ukraine’s military capacity through a contribution of 110 million euros, as well as the provision of credit and grants., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) declared: “This is a defining moment for our Organization and for the world.” Noting that his country voted in favour of the resolution before the Security Council and regretting that it was not adopted, he said the urgency of the situation then convinced his delegation of the need to add the General Assembly’s voice to the conversation. “This is the moment for the principal organs of the Organization to work together […] to save us from the scourge of war.” Over recent years, the world has seen a deterioration of security and the balance of power in Eastern Europe, which paved the way for the current crisis. However, that “in no way justifies the use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of any Member State”. Urging an end to belligerent acts before it is too late, he also called upon all actors to reassess their decisions concerning the supply of weapons and the application of sanctions, particularly those which could affect the global economy in such critical areas as food security., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said Moscow has unleashed a war of aggression fuelled by President Putin’s desire to restore colonialism. The Russian Federation illegitimately used its veto power in the Council and is threatening to use nuclear weapons, flagrantly violating the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races made in January. Through today’s draft, Member States have a chance to stand up and rebuke the evil notion that might makes right, he said, calling on all to support it. There must be accountability, he said, raising deep concerns about Belarus over Charter violations, aiding the Russian Federation’s invasion, sending forces into Ukraine and revoking its non-nuclear weapon State status. Speaking to the Ukrainian people, he said Canada stands ready to assist in defending their country and to hold parties accountable. To the people of the Russian Federation who are opposed to the war, he said: “Canada and the world see you.” President Putin has sorely miscalculated and severely misjudged the resolve of the world to stand against him, he said, adding that: “We say, together: President Putin, stop the war. Stop it before there is more death. Stop the use of threats. Take your finger away from the nuclear button. Come to grips with the reality of our time.” It is never too late to make a turn to diplomacy, dialogue and negotiation. The alternative cannot happen, he said, emphasizing that: “It now falls to all of us […] to stand up for the principles of the Charter and to heal the hurt and pain that has been caused by this terrible war of aggression; this responsibility belongs to us, and we must seize this moment of accountability, democracy and justice, together.”, BURHAN GAFOOR (Singapore), welcoming the convening of this session for allowing even small States to raise concerns, said the Russian Federation’s unprovoked invasion violates the Charter and presents an existential issue for a tiny nation like his country. A world order where might makes right would jeopardize small nations. Indeed, there is no justification for invading an independent State, especially based on such claims as “historical errors and crazy decisions”, he said, deploring the Russian Federation’s military operations across Ukraine. Noting with great sadness and regret the loss of innocent lives, he said the scale of humanitarian assistance is clear. The sovereignty of all States must be respected. Expressing support for the Secretary-General’s recent announcements and actions, he said: “The world is watching us as we meet in the General Assembly.” Member States must act swiftly and with great purpose, he said, adding that Singapore supports the draft and will always vote to uphold the Charter. This resolution is not about taking sides, but about upholding international law and the Charter. “The United Nations is being tested today,” he said, noting that all countries, especially small States, “must send a clear signal that we are united to uphold international law.”, CARLOS AMORÍN (Uruguay), condemning the invasion, said Member States have the responsibility to protect peace and security. It is unacceptable that Ukraine and its rights are being assaulted. The recognition of the separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk and the Russian Federation’s deployment of troops violate global order and these acts must be denounced and condemned by the international community. The peaceful settlement of disputes is a guiding thread in Uruguay’s policies, he said, urging parties to resolve differences peacefully in a manner that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, principles that underpin international law. The occupation of territories by force runs counter to international law, he said, urging the Russian Federation to withdraw all troops from Ukrainian territory and calling on the parties to negotiate and ensure peace., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating himself with the European Union, said the Russian Federation cannot veto the truth. The Russian Federation’s à la carte application of the Charter makes it seem that it uses the instrument as a napkin after the main course. Condemning President Putin’s announcement of putting nuclear weapons on alert, he said such threats do not belong in the twenty-first century but in the dustbins of history. Recalling the 1968 incident when Soviet tanks entered the former Czechoslovakia, he denounced current fake news, narratives and the distortion of history. Slovakia is in favour of very tough sanctions against the Russian Federation. Praising brave Russian citizens who have protested against the war, he said they show what basic moral principles mean. Slovakia remains committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbour, Ukraine, he said, calling for the withdrawal of all Russian troops, including in Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. The gross use of force will have consequences, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to ensure humanitarian access for those in need. Highlighting the many offers to refugees, he said Slovakia and its citizens will continue to provide aid and support to Ukraine., PHILIPPE KRIDELKA (Belgium), calling on the Russian Federation and Belarus to end the violence and withdraw troops, said his delegation joins the international community in seeking a peaceful solution. Every day that passes sees more civilians fleeing, he said, calling on the parties to protect them, especially children, and provide safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. For its part, Belgium has contributed aid to Ukraine. Turning to the draft resolution being considered by the General Assembly, he said: “abstention is not a choice” when the international rules-based order is being threatened. As such, he called on all to support the draft resolution proposed today., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), aligning herself with the European Union, offered unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its democratic freedom. Strongly condemning the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, she said: “It is unprovoked and unjustified. Russia alone is responsible for this war.” She also condemned Belarus for facilitating an attack which, under international law, is also an act of aggression. The Russian Federation’s action affects all Member States and is an attack on the rules-based order that is the very foundation of security. The Charter was written precisely to prevent a military invasion like the one the Russian Federation is undertaking. The Russian veto prevented the Council from acting and the Assembly must now step in. Reports about civilian casualties and attacks against civilian infrastructure are deeply concerning and the perpetrators of these crimes are being watched, followed and will be identified. The evidence is being compiled with a view to their prosecution for crimes. Peace and stability will only be possible if the Russian Federation pulls back its military forces, fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and returns to the path of diplomacy, she said., SATYENDRA PRASAD (Fiji), speaking on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum, called for withdrawal of Russian armed forces and an end to the aggression, which violates the Charter. He also called on the Russian Federation to reverse its decision to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. The world must now join to call for the peaceful settlement of the conflict, he said, adding that climate change and COVID-19 demonstrate the importance of a united front. In his national capacity, he said the current situation poses the question of whether the Charter applies in all its parts to all women, men and children in Ukraine. The Assembly’s Member States are the custodians of the United Nations Charter, which applies in full measure to all Ukrainians. He called on Member States to be united, resolute and firm in the resolve that the Charter applies to everyone in Ukraine, as it extends to all nations. Calling on the Russian Federation to cease hostilities, withdraw troops and protect humanitarian workers, he underlined the importance of taking steps towards peace. “This conflict will end through diplomacy alone,” he said. The world needs its diplomats and all its leaders to address climate change and can only do so once peace is restored in Ukraine., ARRMANATHA CHRISTIAWAN NASIR (Indonesia) said the latest military attack on Ukraine is unacceptable, having put lives in grave danger and threatening regional and global peace and stability. All parties must pursue a peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy, he stressed, adding that respect for nations’ sovereignty and territorial integrity must be upheld. Calling on all parties to ensure safe passage for humanitarian aid and for civilians seeking to flee the conflict, he emphasized that “conflict and tensions benefit no one”, in particular at a time when the world continues to grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outcome of the Assembly’s special session must contribute to an environment where dialogue and negotiation can take place, he stressed., CHRISTIAN WENAWESER (Liechtenstein) said it is vital that the Assembly address the act of aggression against Ukraine committed by those in positions of power in the Russian Federation. Liechtenstein stands in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and pays the deepest respect to the personal leadership of their political leaders. “They are putting us all to shame by resisting with incredible bravery a brutal attack on their country, an unconscionable act of aggression, in direct violation of the Charter of the United Nations, an aggression as defined by this very Assembly in 1974 by consensus — in the middle of the cold war,” he said. Liechtenstein also expresses its solidarity with the Russian people, those who have taken to the streets to demand an end of the war, and those who have been forced to participate in an illegal armed conflict they did not choose. The draft resolution vetoed by the Russian Federation in the Council on Friday night makes clear that Ukraine has been subject to aggression and that the Russian Federation was the aggressor. The Assembly must condemn the Russian Federation’s attack against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in unequivocal terms, he said., BOŠTJAN MALOVRH (Slovenia), echoing support for Ukraine, condemned the aggression and called for action to end it, underlining that international law, peaceful settlement of disputes and respecting decisions of international tribunals and their full implementation are the foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and just world. The International Court of Justice, where Ukraine already filed proceedings, should have a key role as well as the International Criminal Court, where the Office of the Prosecutor is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine. The Russian Federation’s invasion represents a most serious threat to European and global security and stability while breaching the Helsinki Final Act. Slovenia also condemns the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine, he said, calling on that country to abide by its international obligations and raising extreme concern over the constitutional referendum in Belarus on 27 February — which resulted in the deletion of article 18 on its non-nuclear status. Support to Ukraine and solidarity with its people at this difficult time is desperately needed right now, he said, noting Slovenia’s contributions. The General Assembly has a responsibility to address the Russian Federation’s actions, and today’s emergency special session is a crucial and historical moment to act and hold Moscow accountable and make appropriate recommendations for collective measures which will restore peace and security., IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), aligning himself with the European Union, noted that images from Ukraine evoke painful memories in his country, which has experienced the ugly face of aggression, with tanks roaming in the streets, violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity as desperate civilians carried family photos, their most valuable possessions, in plastic bags while fleeing and wondering how the world let that happen and why was it not helping. Addressing the people of Ukraine, he said: “We feel your pain, your sorrow and your anger. We experienced it, as did our neighbours in Bosnia and Herzegovina and many others represented in the General Assembly Hall today.” If the Security Council remained paralyzed to react to the aggression and sufferings in Ukraine because of the Russian Federation’s veto, the General Assembly should not, he said, declaring that: “If we do not remain faithful to the United Nations Charter, our Organization is losing its meaning, our countries are losing credibility, and we, as human beings, are losing our souls.” Croatia offers support and aid, but this is not enough, as it is a political, moral and legal duty to urge occupying Russian forces and their commander to immediately withdraw from Ukraine. The International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s warning that if atrocity crimes are committed in Ukraine they will be prosecuted should be taken seriously. He also called on Belarus to stop being an accomplice to this crime of aggression. Urging Member States to speak with one voice to stop the war, he said: “We have to act now; we are the United Nations.”, FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU (Turkey) said the Russian Federation’s attack on Ukraine is a clear and grave violation of international law, stressing that only the Ukrainian people can determine their own destiny. Turkey rejects the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk republics, as it has rejected the illegal annexation of Crimea, and calls for its revocation. While several countries, including his own, have sought to facilitate negotiations, he said that the Russian Federation has chosen another path, calling on it to hear the pleas of the international community and of its own people on the streets to stop its military operations, withdraw all its forces from Ukraine, and return to diplomacy and dialogue without delay. He called upon both parties to start negotiations based on the Minsk agreements and security concerns of all. “It is not too late to do the right thing,” he said. Stressing that the role of the United Nations cannot be reduced to a post-conflict humanitarian intervention service, he said Member States can and should defend the Charter. They must defend the people they have pledged to serve, and they must do it more effectively than the Security Council. Noting that the Assembly will be presented with a draft resolution for adoption, he said it is a simple choice between right and wrong, and between rule of law and chaos. The Assembly has the power to pave the way for a peaceful solution. “But if we fail to take action, the rising death toll will rest on the conscience of humanity for decades to come,” he said, stressing “history will not judge us kindly”., JIM KELLY (Ireland) said the Russian Federation’s use of the veto at the Security Council was a reprehensible attempt to excuse its own military aggression against Ukraine. However, that will not deter Member States from holding the Russian Federation accountable for its actions. He called on the Assembly to step up where the Council has failed, to uphold the principles of the Charter, condemn aggression and support a return to the path of diplomacy and peace. Recalling that the United Nations rose from the ashes of two world wars, he said the commitments of Member States are binding on every one of them, including Belarus. Pointing out that the Russian Federation has not acted alone, he condemned Belarus’ involvement and reminded it of its responsibility to abide by international law. In that regard, the deletion of the reference to Belarus’s non-nuclear status in its Constitution is of deep concern, he said. The Russian Federation must allow safe, unhindered passage of humanitarian assistance to those in need. It must protect all civilians in Ukraine, allow them unfettered passage to destinations outside the country, and respect international law. As women and girls face heightened risks and are particularly vulnerable in conflict, his country has begun providing humanitarian support, announcing a €10 million humanitarian package, and stands ready to do more., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan), expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine, said he had hoped not to make this statement. Reiterating that the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country, he added that it also shakes the very foundation of international order. The Russian Federation’s actions are a clear violation of the Charter, he said, adding that the country must immediately withdraw its forces and come back to the path of diplomacy. Calling for international cooperation in tackling this issue, he said his Government is taking measures to freeze the assets of designated individuals. Also voicing support for international efforts to remove select Russian banks from the SWIFT system, he noted that Belarus is clearly involved in the aggression. “We, the people, are at a critical juncture in upholding rule of law,” he stressed., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) highlighted the General Assembly’s crucial role in ending the suffering of Ukraine’s people, given that the Security Council was not able to discharge its mandate and adopt the measures needed to end the acts of aggression. Reiterating his country’s rejection of the so-called right of veto, he recalled that during the San Francisco Conference, the States that would later become the permanent Security Council members issued a joint statement in which they declared that the veto would not be used to hinder the Council’s functioning. “The reality which emerged has been quite different,” he said, calling upon the permanent Council members to refrain from using the veto in situations in which they themselves are directly involved or in situations of mass atrocities. In order to guarantee accountability, the Assembly must have a mechanism which allows it to convene a meeting where a permanent member who used the veto in such a situation explains why they used it. Stressing the binding nature of the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, he underscored the need for immediate cessation of hostilities and urgent humanitarian aid. His delegation and that of France will present a draft resolution in the Council regarding this, he noted., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), regretting that the Council was unable to carry out its responsibility to maintain international peace and security in relation to the Ukraine conflict, urged delegations to insert fresh urgency to negotiations on Security Council reform. Cautioning that considerable sanctions against the Russian Federation could cause the conflict to escalate and broaden, he said bold statesmanship is most needed to steer the international community away from the rocky precipice towards which it is being swept. Deeply disturbed by the racism that has characterized the expressions of solidarity in parts of Europe, he said prominent figures in multiple media channels are expressing their solidarity in shockingly racist terms. Rather than join hands with the world, they are pushing the demeaning and inaccurate view that violent conflict only belongs to the global South. There is credible news of African students being made to stand in the back of the queue when getting on trains and buses to safety. He condemned such racism against Africans and people of African descent, thanking those countries neighbouring Ukraine that are helping Kenyan students to cross the borders. Pointing to the tide of sophisticated misinformation circulating that appears to want to spark a broader conflict, including between nuclear-armed States, he urged all relevant organizations, including media houses and social media companies, to exercise caution in the management of information., FRANÇOIS JACKMAN (Barbados), associating himself with the Caribbean Community’s statement on 24 February, said his country is gravely concerned by the actions taken by the Russian authorities. Underscoring the importance of the United Nations Charter and the agreement of Member States to refrain from the threat or use of force against another State, he said those principles have special meaning for small States like his whose existence depends not on their military might or hard power but on respect for and upholding of those principles. He called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its hostilities and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine., THILMEEZA HUSSAIN (Maldives), calling for respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, said that as a small State, her country has always taken a principled stand on violations of the territorial integrity of a sovereign country. Recalling that in 1989 the Maldives advocated for General Assembly resolution 46/43 on the protection and security of small States, she said this position is based on a bedrock belief in the equality of all States and unconditional respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter. In the face of a mightier adversary, countries such as hers cannot rely on force, she pointed out, adding that instead they rely on international law and the multilateral system. “We know we do not possess powerful weapons of destruction; instead we rely on our principles and the solidarity of nations,” she said, noting that Ukraine has already witnessed death and destruction. Highlighting the need for safe passage for Maldivian students in the region, she noted that her Government has granted extensions of tourist visas to Ukrainian nationals in her country., DIEGO PARY RODRÍGUEZ (Bolivia), recalling that it took two world wars and the loss of 70 million lives before the international community realized the need for a multilateral organization to preserve international peace and security, cautioned that the world was moving again towards a point of no return. As a constitutionally peace-loving State, Bolivia rejects all wars of aggression, he said, adding that within this constitutional framework, his country continues to reject all invasions and unilateral actions by various powers throughout recent history, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine and, today, Ukraine. The responsibility for the current conflict rests not only on the shoulders of the country that has decided to unilaterally undertake a military operation, but also on the shoulders of Western Powers who jeopardized the security and peace of other States through NATO. By using some States as middlemen to favor the expansionist ambitions of Western Powers, NATO threatens security, he said, stressing: “NATO is not a guarantee of security; on the contrary, it is a threat to international security.” Recalling the bombing of Yugoslavia which occurred without the Council’s authorization, he condemned the moral double standards shown by certain powers which are fanning the flames of confrontation rather than seeking peace. Welcoming the beginning of negotiations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, on the border with Belarus, he called it a glimmer of hope and cautioned against unilateral sanctions., RODRIGO A. CARAZO (Costa Rica) said the Russian Federation ordered its nuclear weapons to be put on alert — a result from Moscow’s own acts of aggression — which violates international law and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Russian Federation has also violated other agreements, including by using cluster munitions, targeting civilians and launching cyberattacks in its aggression against Ukraine alongside ongoing human rights abuses in certain areas of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. The repercussions of these acts will be felt for a long time, and the international community must keep a record of all these crimes by the Russian Federation and any other party. Demanding that all nuclear forces be taken off high alert, he called on nuclear-weapon States to comply with their obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, inviting all nations to join the instrument. Calling for humanitarian access in Ukraine, he asked the General Assembly to appoint a special envoy to address the needs of Ukrainians refugees. All members of the General Assembly must condemn the use of explosive devices in populated areas and work to achieve a diplomatic solution to this conflict, he said, calling for a ceasefire, troop withdrawal and an end to military action. “If violence is put aside, we can return to diplomacy,” he said, calling for an end of the mentality that has brought the world to this point. Costa Rica will vote in favour of the draft resolution to demonstrate that States can reshape history., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), associating herself with the European Union, said the United Nations Charter is clear: all States must refrain from threats or use of force. She condemned the Russian Federation’s attack, which challenges fundamental concepts of international law and rules-based global order and are “threats to us all”. Revisionism is the main threat to world peace and will not be tolerated. Alarmed at Moscow’s raising of the nuclear threat, she called on the Russian Federation to de-escalate and return to the de-alert level. Turning to the humanitarian consequences of the conflict, she said the deaths and suffering are unnecessary. Attacks must stop immediately, with a priority being protecting and meeting the urgent needs of civilians. Greek communities around Mariupol have suffered deaths and injuries, she said, adding that Greece has mobilized with partners to project a unified response, including sanctions and commitments to address the grave humanitarian crisis. This is the beginning of a new era, and the current situation will have major consequences, she said, emphasizing that the Assembly has a historic responsibility to address this attack., CRISTIAN ESPINOSA CAÑIZARES (Ecuador), recalling various recent meetings of the Security Council on the situation in Ukraine, noted his delegation’s surprise and regret at the rejection of diplomatic means to resolve the crisis. Emphasizing that peace is a pillar of Ecuador’s foreign policy, he underlined the need to “leave the door open” to all parties. The Assembly’s special session must serve as a precedent so that, should such regrettable incidents recur, they will be dealt with in the same serious manner as the situation today. Ecuador has been unequivocal in its condemnation of those who violate international law and its support of those who seek to resolve the dispute, he said, voicing support for the work of the Secretary-General, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other global bodies in Ukraine. Ecuador itself has safely repatriated many of its own students from Ukraine in recent days, he added, urging all countries to support the draft resolution before the Assembly., JOSÉ MANUEL RODRÍGUEZ CUADROS (Peru) said the international system governing relations between countries and peoples is underpinned by two crucial principles — namely, the obligation not to use force or threaten to use force against other sovereign States, and the obligation to resolve disputes through peaceful means. Those principles have been violated by the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine, counter to the United Nations Charter and international law. Strongly condemning those aggressions and calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict, he said Peru’s external relations are built upon respect for sovereignty and international humanitarian law. He went on to endorse ICRC’s appeal to urgently address the refugee crisis in Ukraine, as well as its demand that all parties respect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while voicing support for the draft resolution currently before the Assembly., LUIS ANTONIO LAM PADILLA (Guatemala) said that as a founding member of the United Nations, Guatemala firmly believes in the principles and values of the Charter. These principles include the crucial pillars and purposes that led to the inception of the United Nations, which was created so the suffering of the first and second World Wars never happens again. Guatemala condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the military aggression against the territorial integrity of the Ukraine, the aggression against its people and against international human rights laws. It condemns the military decisions and actions of the Russian Federation, which include the senseless loss of lives. These actions also threaten regional and global security. Guatemala stands in solidarity with the Government of Ukraine and calls for the immediate withdrawal from its illegally occupied territories. As a permanent member of the Council, the Russian Federation has a particular obligation to uphold peace. There is still time to return to the negotiating table and end the conflict. The international community cannot allow history to be repeated. “Guatemala is speaking out in favour of life, in favour of peace, in favour of global security,” he said., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), noting Member States’ continued efforts to rally the world to condemn the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine and hold it accountable, said “the Soviet Union is dead and nothing, no fantasy, no nostalgia, no war will never ever bring it back”. He condemned Belarus’ involvement in the aggression against Ukraine and called on it to abide by its international obligations. Albania has joined nations that have imposed sanctions and other restrictive measures against the Russian Federation and has subscribed to the entire package adopted by the European Union. Also, his country has closed its air space to Russian operators and joined the sanctions on the freezing of assets of individuals, including those of the Russian Federation’s President and which will apply to 654 individuals and 52 entities. Economic sanctions include restrictive measures in finance, energy, transport and technology. In addition, Albania will no longer participate in any sports activity with the Russian Federation until it ceases its aggression against Ukraine. Given the worsening humanitarian situation, his country has committed to sheltering refugees. “If we agree, willingly or by indifference, to let what is commonly agreed unravel, in front of our eyes as this act of aggression does, what respect do we have for what has been built during 76 years since World War II?”, he asked. Albania has co-sponsored the draft resolution, he said, calling on all Members States to do so., BASSAM SABBAGH (Syria) said that despite successive crises and major challenges that have confronted the international community for decades, Western States have never demonstrated so much excitement in calling an emergency special session of the General Assembly, which demonstrates a politics of hypocrisy and double standards, based on interests and not principles. The memories and files of the United Nations have ample proof of illegitimate acts of intervention by the United States and its NATO allies that have caused millions of innocent deaths in Korea, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, not to mention the blockades imposed on people in Latin America and elsewhere to achieve their own objectives. He condemned the campaign organized and led by the West and their media against the Russian Federation, in particular the deliberate spreading of fake news and insidious allegations to prevent that country from exercising its right to defend its sovereignty and to protect its people., Noting that Western countries have ignored the historical links between the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, he said they are ignoring the suffering of the people of the Donbas region. Moreover, those States have ignored the Russian Federation’s legitimate security concerns and have not hesitated to provide weapons, including missiles, to Ukraine while downplaying the effects of their own decisions on regional security and stability, he noted. Nonetheless, the Russian Federation has always made pragmatic proposals, although they have been ignored, he said. The unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States and the West are in contravention of international law and are harming people in the region, he added. Condemning those punitive measures, he said that being on the right side of history means rejecting the West’s bellicose policies., T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) reiterated his delegation’s previous calls for an immediate cessation of violence and an end to hostilities, noting that all United Nations Member States are not only obliged to follow the Charter but also to respect international law, territorial integrity and State sovereignty. There is no other choice but to return to the path of diplomacy, he emphasized, recalling that Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated that sentiment strongly in his recent conversations with the leadership of both the Russian Federation and Ukraine. India, for its part, will be providing urgent relief supplies, including medicines, to the Ukrainian people in the coming days, and is working to undertake the urgent evacuation of its nationals still stranded in that country. Thanking neighbouring countries which have opened their borders to Indian citizens, he said that his country stands ready to support them., MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile) said the fact that the Assembly is meeting in emergency format for the first time in decades bears witness to the international community’s frustration at the Security Council’s failure to adopt a decision in favour of peace. Reaffirming his country’s commitment to the principles enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter, he rejected the use or threat to use force in international relations. Disputes between States must be resolved by exclusively peaceful means, in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Charter, he emphasized, expressing support for the resolution submitted today, which condemns the aggression against Ukraine. Calling for the immediate cessation of that aggression and for the withdrawal of occupying troops, he stressed the need for protection of civilians and for access to humanitarian aid., For information media.

"We Stand with Those Fighting Back, as Few Companies Reap Rich Rewards, while Ignoring Rights of Poorest, Secretary-General Tells Human Rights Council",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Climate Change and Environment
Health
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"SG/SM/21160, Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video remarks at the opening of the forty-ninth regular session of the Human Rights Council, in Geneva today:, Distinguished President of the Human Rights Council, Madam High Commissioner, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,, Human rights are under assault, everywhere. Autocracies are in the ascendant. Populism, nativism, racism and extremism are undermining societies. The COVID-19 pandemic, inequalities and the climate crisis are crushing the social and economic rights of entire continents and regions., Divisions are deepening. Suspicion and self-interest are on the rise. We are here today to talk about solutions. Solutions that are anchored in our fundamental and enduring human rights and freedoms. Solutions rooted in the indivisible and interlinked political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights that are inherent and intrinsic to being human., Human rights cannot be confiscated by dictators or erased by poverty. Nor are they a luxury that can be left for later. They are inescapable — and powerful. People everywhere know that intuitively. And autocrats, especially, know that human rights pose the greatest threat to their rule. That’s why they stop at nothing to deny, dismiss and distract people, as they trample on basic rights and freedoms., Closing down a celebrated human rights organization with a proud history and global links is not the sign of a strong State. It is the sign of a State that fears the power of human rights. Abducting women’s rights activists and beating women on the street are the actions of a suffocating patriarchy that fears for its survival. Oppressing and controlling minorities, denying them the freedom to speak in their own language and practise their religion in peace, demonstrates a State’s weakness, not its strength., People are hard-wired to claim their rights and freedoms. Every march against oppression, every liberation movement, every protest against injustice is an affirmation of human rights. That’s why the United Nations works every day, everywhere, to uphold and promote human rights for all., Excellencies,, Last month, I presented my priorities to the General Assembly in the form of five alarms: COVID-19, global finance, climate action, lawlessness in cyberspace, and peace and security. The solutions to these crises are all rooted in human rights., First, COVID-19. The pandemic is a clear demonstration of the universality and indivisibility of all human rights — civil, political, social, economic and cultural. The vulnerable and marginalized continue to suffer most. High-income countries have administered 13 times more doses per person than low-income countries. Vaccine inequality demonstrates an utter disregard for the human rights of entire countries and regions., Health-care rights are human rights. Vaccines developed with public money must be used equitably for the public good. I urge all Governments, pharmaceutical companies, and partners, to give urgent political and financial support to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global strategy to vaccinate 70 per cent of people in all countries. And I urge them to act now on patent waivers and technology transfers., Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to undermine the economic and social rights of people everywhere, pushing hundreds of millions of people into hunger and poverty. It has also been used as cover for a pandemic of civil and political rights violations, from mass surveillance to discrimination and curbs on freedom of expression., We can best address these human-rights abuses by centring our response around rights themselves — an approach set out in my Call to Action on Human Rights, the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We need rights-based solutions and inclusive, sustainable development, rooted in rights and opportunities for all., Excellencies,, Second, the unequal recovery from the pandemic has revealed the moral bankruptcy of our global financial system. That system has failed to protect the rights of millions of people in the global South. The pandemic has squeezed developing economies dry. Many face debt defaults. Few will be able to invest in a strong and sustainable recovery. Education is a crisis within a crisis. Years out of school could affect hundreds of millions of children for their entire lives., The solutions to these self-defeating injustices lie in human rights. A new global deal that ensures power, wealth and opportunities are shared more broadly and fairly, is a human-rights imperative. This must include an overhaul of the global financial system so that developing countries can invest in the SDGs., A renewed social contract, based on rights and opportunities for all, is essential to tackle poverty and hunger, invest in education and lifelong learning, and rebuild trust and social cohesion. The rights of women and girls must be at the forefront. The recovery is an opportunity for targeted investments in women’s education, employment, training and decent work, to make up ground lost during the pandemic., Excellencies,, Third, the climate crisis is a human rights crisis. The triple planetary emergency of climate change, pollution and nature loss poses a threat to all human rights. Today’s report on adaptation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is another death knell for the world we know., Floods, droughts and rising sea levels will lead to even greater humanitarian catastrophes, food shortages and migration. Up to one fifth of the planet could be too hot for humans to survive. Let’s be clear: a few countries are trampling on the rights of the rest of the world. A few companies are reaping rich rewards, while ignoring the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable., Young people, women and girls, small island States and indigenous communities are leading the fight back. We stand with them. I welcome this Council’s recognition of the right to a healthy environment — an important tool for accountability and climate justice. Many of the proposals in my report on Our Common Agenda offer critical opportunities to advance this right., The Paris Agreement is intrinsically linked to human rights. Its limit of 1.5 degrees of warming is essential to preventing human suffering on a scale far greater than the worst crimes against humanity., Excellencies,, Fourth, digital technology is the wild west for human rights. From a yawning digital divide of 2.9 billion people to Internet shutdowns, disinformation campaigns and the proliferation of spyware, digital technology is often discriminatory and detrimental to human rights. Censorship and online attacks have been normalized, particularly against ethnic and religious minorities, members of the LGBTIQ+ community, young people, indigenous communities and women’s rights activists. Artificial intelligence (AI) enables algorithms to discriminate and exclude., Science and reason are under siege as lies and conspiracy theories spread like wildfire. Cyberwarfare and the development of AI-enabled weapons pose an unprecedented threat to human rights. The Internet must be treated as a global public good. It should benefit everyone, everywhere. We need a digital public square that is inclusive and safe for all, and social media platforms that support human rights and freedoms., While guardrails are essential, they must never be used to shut down legitimate debate. That is why regulatory frameworks must be anchored in human rights and agreed through inclusive consultations. This is the approach taken in my proposed global code of conduct to promote integrity in public information and my proposed global digital compact., Excellencies,, Fifth, the expansion of violence and conflicts around the world denies the human rights of millions of people. The escalation of military operations by the Russian Federation in Ukraine is leading to escalating human rights violations. We know the inevitable result of war: civilian casualties; women, children and men forced from their homes; hunger; poverty; and huge economic disruption., Conflict is the utter negation of human rights across the board. Freedom of expression is under attack with reports of journalists and activists arrested. I have consistently called for the end of the offensive and return to the path of dialogue and diplomacy. Meanwhile, our Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is continuing its work and our humanitarian agencies will step up their operations. We must show all people in Ukraine that we stand by them in their time of need., Excellencies,, Civilians caught up in conflict suffer not only violations of their rights to safety and protection, but often their rights to food, clean water, health care, education and jobs. The grim irony is that these conflicts are themselves frequently rooted in the denial of human rights, from discrimination against minorities to gaping inequalities and injustice. Protecting minorities and promoting their economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights are among the most important conflict-prevention tools we have., Diversity defines the richness of human civilization. Around the world, we need a much sharper and more sustained focus on minority rights. I urge the authorities in countries from Myanmar to Afghanistan, Ethiopia and beyond to step up the protection of minorities and respect the equal rights of all their people, during and after war., Refugees and migrants are a group that need special protection. More than 5,200 people died on migration routes in 2021. Hostile asylum and migration policies, and the xenophobic rhetoric that often accompanies them, threaten the lives of migrants and refugees and make hypocrites of those who purport to lead by example on human rights. Effective migration policies must be based on cooperation between States and on full respect for the rights and dignity of all., I want once again to express my strong support for the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to protect and enhance human rights everywhere. I recently returned from a visit to China, where I expressed my expectation that the current discussions will allow for a credible visit by the High Commissioner to China, including Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Minorities everywhere must be able to retain and celebrate their cultural and religious identity, while contributing to society as a whole., Excellencies,, The human rights movement is an affirmation of our basic humanity. I thank everyone working for the Human Rights Council — and my gratitude and respect extend far beyond this beautiful hall. Most human-rights work happens in cramped offices, courtrooms and newsrooms, detention centres and prisons. It happens wherever people are working to promote access to health care, education, shelter, food security, water and sanitation for the most vulnerable people in the world., Environmental campaigners, many of them women and young people, are on the front lines of human-rights work. Through the daily grind of advocacy, monitoring and investigation, human-rights defenders — including journalists and lawyers — are standing up for our common humanity, often at great personal risk. Together, they are helping to build a world of dignity and equality for all. I salute them and honour their work., Thank you., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Feb 2022,"Budapest/Geneva, 28 February 2022 – The conflict in Ukraine is shaping up to be one of the biggest humanitarian emergencies in Europe for years to come, says the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)., As the fighting continues for the fifth day, millions of people in Ukraine desperately need safe drinking water and food, as roads are impassable, and electricity and water supplies are cut off. The most pressing needs are emergency medical care, medicine, clean water and shelter for people who have had to leave their homes., In recent days, the Ukrainian Red Cross has provided first aid training for more than 2,000 people sheltering in metro stations and bomb shelters so they can help treat family and friends in the event of injury. Its volunteers are helping to evacuate people with disabilities and emergency response teams are assisting firefighters, medical and civil protection teams – helping to save many lives. The National Society has already distributed its complete stock of 30,000 food and hygiene parcels for people on the move. Volunteers are also helping at reception centres set up in schools and coordinating with the Polish Red Cross to assist people at the border., “Our teams are fully committed to helping as many people as possible. At the moment, it is often too dangerous to be outside and we cannot reach people without risking our own lives, but we continue to try our best. Yet, in the past few days, more than a thousand people have joined as Red Cross volunteers, which shows just how keen people are to help their communities in these dark times,” says Maksym Dotsenko, Director General of the Ukrainian Red Cross., Due to the armed conflict, hundreds of thousands of people have left their homes and crossed into neighbouring countries. As of 28 February afternoon, UNHCR reports that at least 500,000 people have left, but the number is growing by the hour as people queue at border crossing points., To support the Ukrainian Red Cross and National Societies in neighbouring countries, the IFRC has already released one million Swiss francs from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund, ahead of a multi-million francs Emergency Appeal to be launched tomorrow., Red Cross teams in Croatia, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovakia have immediately mobilized to help people arriving from Ukraine. Temporary accommodation has been set up along the borders to offer shelter or respite for the night. Volunteers are distributing food, water, bedding, clothes and basic aid items on both sides of the border and providing medical care and psychosocial support for those in need. They’re also handing out SIM cards, so that people can stay in touch with their loved ones., “It is heart-breaking to see so many individual tragedies unfold at our doorstep. Humanitarian actors like National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies should be given safe access to people who are injured, hungry and desperate, no matter who or where they are. There’s no end in sight for this conflict, and no telling when people can safely return home. Until that day, we will be there to support them,” says Birgitte Bischoff Ebbesen, IFRC Regional Director for Europe., For more information, please contact:, In Budapest: Nora Peter, +36 70 265 4020,*nora.peter@ifrc.org, In Budapest: Corinne Ambler, +36 704 306 506, corinne.ambler@ifrc.org, In Geneva: Caroline Haga, +358 50 598 0500, caroline.haga@ifrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/red-cross-providing-life-saving-assistance-hundreds-thousands-displaced-ukraine

"Nearly half a million have fled Ukraine, UN refugee agency reports",News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"Fighting in Ukraine has so far pushed roughly a half million people across the border, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reported on Monday., “This is a massive outflow that we’re witnessing, and this has all just happened in the space of five days, so this is a fast-growing refugee emergency,” Spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told UN News., Olga, a 36-year-old mother from the capital, Kyiv, is among the refugees. She set off from the city by car on Thursday, accompanied by her daughter, 8, and son, 2, along with a neighbour and her daughter., After three days on the road, they arrived at the Polish border town of Zosin., Waiting for hours, “We fled as soon as the first bombs fell. It took us 12 hours just to get out of Kyiv,” Olga told UNHCR on Saturday. Normally, the journey would have taken seven hours., Agency staff caught up with Olga when her car was in a line of thousands on the bridge over the River Bug, which marks the border between Ukraine and Poland., “We’ve been [waiting] here for 36 hours now,” she said at the time, referring to the 14-kilometre long queue. People arriving on foot can skip the long traffic line and enter Poland much quicker., Ukrainians have been fleeing their homeland since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the “special military operation” on Thursday, following weeks of troop and weapons buildup near the borders., ‘We had no choice’, The majority have headed west to Poland, most of whom are women and children.  Others are entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and beyond., Olga looked relieved to have made it to Zosin.  She explained that during the entire journey, they were not able to find a hot meal or toilet., “I’m sure others are worse off. And at least we are healthy,” she said.  When asked how they coped in the car, she replied “we had no choice.”, Support for refugees, Ukrainian refugees are being registered by national authorities in the countries that have received them., UNHCR and its partners are on the ground at main border areas to support these efforts., Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has stressed that security and access for humanitarian action must be guaranteed., “UNHCR is also working with Governments in neighboring countries, calling on them to keep borders open to those seeking safety and protection,” he said in a statement issued in the wake of the crisis. , “We stand ready to support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement.”, Desire to return home, Meanwhile, the UN has underlined its commitment to Ukraine. Secretary-General António Guterres last week released $20 million in emergency funding for the country and will launch a humanitarian appeal on Tuesday., Though safe for now, Olga is uncertain about what the future holds., Her biggest concern is the safety of her husband. “He stayed in Kyiv, donates blood all the time and takes care of the old people who couldn’t escape,” she said., Asked what her hopes were, Olga hugged her daughter and said: “That the bombs stop. That the killing stops. And that we can go home again.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nearly-half-million-have-fled-ukraine-un-refugee-agency-reports
Update 4 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (28 February 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,28 Feb 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the country’s nuclear power plants were continuing to be operated safely and securely, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, adding that he remained gravely concerned about maintaining their safety and security during the current conflict., Ukraine’s nuclear power programme – 15 reactors at four sites – usually accounts for roughly half its electricity production., On 27 February, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry informed the IAEA that Russian military forces were advancing close to the largest of the sites – the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in eastern Ukraine. Additional information received on 28 February from the operator confirmed that the Russian forces were operational near the site but had not entered it at the time of reporting. In this context, Director General Grossi stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the plant’s safety or security must be avoided., The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the IAEA that it was continuing to gather information and in this morning’s update to the IAEA, the SNRIU said there had been no change in the “physical protection regime” of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that its six units were in safe condition., Director General Grossi said: “I continue to follow developments in Ukraine very closely and with grave concern, especially the conflict’s potential impact on the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities. It is extremely important that the nuclear power plants are not put at risk in any way.” He added: “An accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment.”, Underlining such risks, the SNRIU informed the IAEA on Sunday that missiles had hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in the capital Kyiv, but there was no damage to the building and no reports of a radioactive release., Director General Grossi said it was of critical importance to maintain the capabilities of operational teams to ensure safety. In addition, vital supply chains should remain available to ensure that necessary services, equipment and components can be delivered to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at all times, for example to carry out any emergency repairs., Ukraine last week informed the IAEA that Russian forces had taken control of the facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP, located within the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. The regulator said today that the shift supervisor at the site had not been replaced since 24 February but that he continued to perform his duties. SNRIU also provided radiation readings from the site which the IAEA assessed as low and in line with near background levels., Director General Grossi stressed again that staff at all nuclear facilities must be able to work and rest. He reiterated his call upon those in effective control of such sites not to take any actions that could compromise their safety or put them under undue pressure., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors. The IAEA remains in constant contact with its counterpart and will continue to provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-4-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-28-february-2022-enru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",2 Mar 2022,"SITUATION OVERVIEW, On 24 February, a new phase in the armed conflict in Ukraine started with the intensification and spread of the hostilities that are now affecting most parts of the country and causing major concern for the protection of civilians and essential civilian infrastructure. This comes after months of rising political and military tensions and eight years of conflict in and around Eastern Ukraine where an estimated 2.9 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance and 1.4 million were internally displaced., With the onset of hostilities, hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine have left their homes, with more than 160,000 people reportedly internally displaced and as of 28 February, over 360,000 having crossed the borders into the neighbouring countries of Poland (over 200,000), Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Belarus –within just four days since the start of intensified hostilities. More than 120,000 people were also evacuated to Russia from eastern Ukraine in the day before the hostilities intensified., This rapid evolution of the situation on Ukraine’s borders and ongoing active military action inside Ukraine does not allow the humanitarian community to have much clarity on existing and immediate needs, particularly inside Ukraine. However, the needs are expected to be massive and to affect all regions of Ukraine, neighbouring countries and beyond. Current estimates and scenarios indicate that as many as five million people can be displaced as the situation evolves, with many more impacted, including those already in need and displaced in Eastern Ukraine at the onset of this ongoing escalation., In the meantime, the COVID-19 pandemic and high transmissibility of the Omicron variant is still a serious concern. Ukraine and many neighbouring countries have low vaccination rates. Sanitary restrictions are still enforced and will need to be coped with, even in the midst of this large-scale armed conflict and massdisplacements in neighbouring countries., The current situation in Ukraine is governed by the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, its First Additional Protocol from 1977 and customary international humanitarian law. The International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) calls upon concerned authorities to support and facilitate the humanitarian response of Movement partners, including by ensuring that any restrictive measures contain effective protection of the humanitarian space, by managing any support to the parties responsibly as well as supporting the parties in fulfilling their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-ukraine-and-impacted-countries-crisis-preliminary-emergency-appeal-no-mgr65002

UN experts call for end to Russian aggression against Ukraine and urgent protection of human rights [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"GENEVA (28 February 2022) - UN human rights experts* today called on the Russian Federation to immediately end its aggression against Ukraine and call off its unnecessary and unprovoked military attack. They issue the following statement:, “We are collectively outraged and distressed by the Russian Federation’s aggression on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Use of force by one State against another is fundamentally unacceptable and strikes at the very heart of the object and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations., The consequences of this military attack on the protection and promotion of human rights in Ukraine will be profound and long-lasting and will cause immense suffering and irreparable harm through human rights and humanitarian law violations, forced displacement of civilians and environmental destruction. The consequences will last for generations., We are profoundly concerned about the safety and protection of everyone in Ukraine and the well-founded fear which now pervades the daily life of every member of that society, and which has forced many to flee their country for safety., The UN Charter, from which our collective work as experts on human rights flows, was created expressly to settle differences between States and to peacefully prevent armed conflict and protect the right to self-determination. By doing so, it establishes the basis for protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people., We express our profound dismay at the violations of the right to life, liberty and security that have already occurred. The right to life is the bedrock right of our international legal order and the core human right which enables all other rights to be exercised. We are also profoundly troubled by the impact of the conflict on freedom of assembly, association and expression, including restrictions within the Russian Federation and call for all those arrested and detained to be treated consistently with the Russian Federation’s international human rights obligations., We strongly urge the Russian Federation to listen to the collective voice of the international community which has unequivocally condemned its military actions as unacceptable to all., As human rights experts, we urge the Russian Federation to observe and respect the principles of international law including the laws and customs of war related to the protection of the civilian populations, to end these hostilities immediately and unconditionally, and to restore the ability of the Ukrainian people to exercise all of their fundamental rights without military or external interference.”, ENDS, *The experts: Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism*; Tlaleng Mofokeng, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;Siobhán Mullally, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children;Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Irene Khan, Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Mary Lawlor, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Clément Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Olivier De Schutter,Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights; Sorcha MacLeod(Chair-Rapporteur), Jelena Aparac, Ravindran Daniel, Chris Kwaja,Working Group on the use of mercenaries; Melissa Upreti (Chair), Dorothy Estrada Tanck (Vice-Chair), Elizabeth Broderick, Ivana Radačić, and Meskerem Geset Techane, Working Group on discrimination against women and girls; Tomoya Obokata, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences;Elina Steinerte (Chair-Rapporteur), Leigh Toomey,** Mumba Malila**,Priya Gopalan, Working Group on arbitrary detention; Vitit Muntarbhorn, Special Rapporteur on Cambodia; Obiora Okafor, Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity; **Fernand de Varennes, Special Rapporteur on minority issues; Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; Saad Alfarargi, Special Rapporteur on the right to development; Alexandra Xanthaki,Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights; **Claudia Mahler, Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons; Gerard Quinn, Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; Felipe González Morales, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants; Fabián Salvioli, Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; Pedro Arrojo Agudo, Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; Ahmed Shaheed,Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; Javaid Rehman, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran; Michael Lynk, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967; Yao Agbetse, Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic; Luciano Hazan (Chair-Rapporteur), Ms. Aua Baldé (Vice Chair), Ms. Gabriella Citroni, Mr. Henrikas Mickevičius and Mr. Tae-Ung Baik, The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; José Francisco Calí Tzay, Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Livingstone Sewanyana, Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order; David R.

"Mere Idea of Nuclear Conflict ‘Simply Inconceivable’, Secretary-General Tells General Assembly Emergency Special Session on Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN SG,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"SG/SM/21161
28 FEBRUARY 2022, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the General Assembly Emergency Special Session on Ukraine, in New York today:, The fighting in Ukraine must stop. It is raging across the country, from air, land and sea. It must stop now., Russian missile and air bombardments are pounding Ukrainian cities day and night. The capital, Kyiv, is encircled from all sides. In the face of the continuing attacks, Kyiv’s 3 million residents are being forced to seek safety in their homes, improvised bomb shelters and in the city’s subways., The Ukrainian Government has distributed a meaningful number of arms to the population with the stated objective to participate in the defence of the country. According to UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees], half a million Ukrainians have already fled across the country’s borders., Although Russian strikes are reportedly largely targeting Ukrainian military facilities, we have credible accounts of residential buildings, critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets sustaining heavy damage. This escalating violence — which is resulting in civilian deaths, including children — is totally unacceptable., Enough is enough. Soldiers need to move back to their barracks. Leaders need to move to peace. Civilians must be protected. International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld. The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, must be respected, in line with the General Assembly resolutions., We are facing a tragedy for Ukraine, but also a major regional crisis with potentially disastrous implications for us all. Yesterday, Russian nuclear forces were put on high alert. This is a chilling development. The mere idea of a nuclear conflict is simply inconceivable. Nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons., We face what could easily become Europe’s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis in decades, with the numbers of refugees and internally displaced multiplying by the minute. I am grateful for the compassion, generosity and solidarity of Ukraine’s neighbours, who are taking in those seeking safety. It is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity. The neighbouring countries will need all our support in the days and weeks to come. The United Nations will continue to assist with these efforts., On Saturday, I spoke with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and assured him that the United Nations would not abandon the Ukrainian people, and conveyed our determination to enhance humanitarian assistance. Even before the events of the past week, the United Nations was providing some 3 million people on both sides of the contact line with humanitarian assistance. The United Nations is now working 24-7 to assess humanitarian needs and scale up the delivery of life-saving support to many more people desperate for protection and shelter — particularly women, children, elderly people and those with disabilities., We are fully committed to staying and delivering for everyone affected by this deadly conflict across the country. Some of our personnel are expanding existing programmes. Others are preparing new operations to get help to those who need it, fast. I want to highlight three concrete actions., First, I have allocated $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund to support emergency operations along the contact line in the eastern oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk, and in other parts of the country. This will allow us to help more vulnerable people get the basics — shelter, food, water and health care — as soon as possible., Second, I have appointed Amin Awad as the United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine. He will liaise with the Government and all relevant actors on the ground, supported by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator and the United Nations country team. At the same time, we are bringing together partners, in and outside the country, and surging personnel into the country., Third, tomorrow, we will launch two coordinated emergency appeals for Ukraine and the region. One that addresses escalating humanitarian needs inside the country — including rising internal displacement — and another that responds to the needs of people crossing international borders to seek refuge in countries neighbouring Ukraine., As we ramp up our efforts, it is essential that the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel in Ukraine are protected, in accordance with international law, and that humanitarian access to vulnerable people and communities is guaranteed. I call on all sides to uphold their obligations to allow freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel and to facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief., I also urge the international community to mobilize in support of our funding appeals to address the needs of all those displaced by this crisis, as well as other vulnerable groups, whose numbers will only grow as the fighting escalates., Humanitarian aid is vital. But it is not a solution. It is simply treating the worst impacts of the conflict. The only true solution is peace. The attack on Ukraine challenges international law and the multilateral system rooted in the United Nations Charter., Some of the possible consequences of a worsening conflict are terrifying to contemplate. Regional tensions are rising. The latest security measures underline the high stakes for all. The economic repercussions of the crisis will have widespread impact. I count on every Member State to live up to the principles of the Charter., The guns are talking now, but the path of dialogue must always remain open. It is never too late to engage in good-faith negotiations and to address all issues peacefully. I hope that the direct talks now taking place between Ukrainian and Russian delegations will produce not only an immediate halt to the fighting, but also a path towards a diplomatic solution. I welcome and encourage all peaceful efforts to end the bloodshed and halt this conflict. I thank the countries who have offered to host and facilitate negotiations. The United Nations is ready to support such efforts., War is not the answer. It is death, human suffering, senseless destruction and an immense distraction from the real challenges facing humanity: the climate crisis and biodiversity loss; vitally needed socioeconomic recovery from the pandemic; healing the divides of race and gender; and so many other pressing twenty-first century challenges., Humanity cannot afford to be locked in a mindset that dredges up the worst of past centuries. We need to look forward as the United Nations to overcome the scourge of war. We need to focus on solving problems, not making them worse. In cities around the world, people are taking to the streets and demanding an end to war. People in Ukraine want and need peace. I believe people in the Russian Federation do, too., We need peace now. Thank you., For information media. Not an official record.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mere-idea-nuclear-conflict-simply-inconceivable-secretary-general-tells-general

It is imperative that the international community unites to immediately develop a system of humanitarian evacuation and protection. It must also pressure the concerned authorities to provide the students with the assistance they need to reach safety., According the Government of Ukraine, there are over 80,000 students from 158 countries enrolled in higher education. The largest numbers of students are from India, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria., Education Above All also condemns the attack on a pre-school in Ukraine's eastern city of Okhtyrka, which killed a child and two adults, and injured another child on Friday. All are believed to have been seeking shelter inside after fleeing the violence. EAA is alarmed at reports from Amnesty International that cluster bombs were used during the attack. Cluster munitions are internationally-banned weapon and highly dangerous because they indiscriminately kill and maim civilians., Education Above All is committed to spearheading a global movement to stop attacks on education and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.

Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"28 February 2022, Distinguished President of the Council,
Distinguished President of the Swiss Confederation,
Excellencies,
Colleagues and friends,, This Council session takes place at a time that calls for strong and visionary leadership., Throughout history, there have been moments of profound gravity, that cut the course of events between a ""before"" – and a very different, more harmful, ""after"". We are at such a tipping point., Remarkable progress that has been made over two decades in every region – in decreasing conflict, reducing poverty and expanding access to education and other rights – is in jeopardy., Depleted by the pandemic, divided by growing polarisation, undermined by growing environmental harm and corroded by digital disinformation, hatred and distortions of democracy, and disregard of the rule of law, many societies are evolving – or plunging – into increased repression and violence; rising poverty; anger; and conflict., The military attack on Ukraine is putting at risk countless lives. Between Thursday morning and last night, our Office has recorded 406 civilian casualties, including 102 killed –including 7 children – and 304 injured. Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher., Meanwhile, millions of civilians, including vulnerable and older people, are forced to huddle in different forms of bomb shelters, such as underground stations, to escape explosions. UNHCR reported that 422,000 people have fled the country – and many more are internally displaced. My thoughts go out to them and to all those across the world who suffer., The calls for peace and human rights that are coming from individuals all over the world warn us that our future must not be a world that has become unmoored from the jointly agreed obligations of international human rights law, and from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights., Over the next three days, an unprecedented number of dignitaries will participate in this high-level segment. This is a vital opportunity to come together and meet this grave and pivotal moment with action. I ask that as we do so, all of us place, first and foremost, the world's people – their shared, and universal, aspirations and rights – at the centre of our deliberations., Excellencies,, It is precisely at a tipping point, or time of crisis, when investment in multilateral and human rights-based action brings swift and effective solutions – as well as laying out the path towards greater, more shared development and peace., Our constant refrain has been that more needs to be done to prevent conflict and human rights crises. It is time, now, for strong preventive action that will match our words., Action to end conflict, respect the UN Charter, and abide by international law., Action to establish the fundamental justice, services, opportunities and rights that build development, resolve grievances and re-establish trust., Action to eradicate discrimination, which impedes people's exercise of every kind of right, and is at the root of so much misery and despair., Action to ensure that digital technology advances rights – rather than undermining them – everywhere., Action to enable the full participation of the people in decision-making – so that they can believe in and trust their institutions., Action to revive the health of our planet, whose destruction is at the root of growing poverty, displacement and harm., We must also, with unprecedented vigor, fight corruption, which robs the public treasury for private gain – creating predatory élites whose interests may sharply diverge from the well-being of the people., Tackling the root causes of grievances and instability, and investing in justice and human dignity is urgent to the task of guiding societies – in every region – away from reckless, and escalating, violence. It will help create deep and long-term solutions to the harm that has been done by the pandemic.

Distinguished President of the Swiss Confederation,
Excellencies,
Colleagues and friends,, This Council session takes place at a time that calls for strong and visionary leadership., Throughout history, there have been moments of profound gravity, that cut the course of events between a ""before"" – and a very different, more harmful, ""after"". We are at such a tipping point., Remarkable progress that has been made over two decades in every region – in decreasing conflict, reducing poverty and expanding access to education and other rights – is in jeopardy., Depleted by the pandemic, divided by growing polarisation, undermined by growing environmental harm and corroded by digital disinformation, hatred and distortions of democracy, and disregard of the rule of law, many societies are evolving – or plunging – into increased repression and violence; rising poverty; anger; and conflict., The military attack on Ukraine is putting at risk countless lives. Between Thursday morning and last night, our Office has recorded 406 civilian casualties, including 102 killed –including 7 children – and 304 injured. Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher., Meanwhile, millions of civilians, including vulnerable and older people, are forced to huddle in different forms of bomb shelters, such as underground stations, to escape explosions. UNHCR reported that 422,000 people have fled the country – and many more are internally displaced. My thoughts go out to them and to all those across the world who suffer., The calls for peace and human rights that are coming from individuals all over the world warn us that our future must not be a world that has become unmoored from the jointly agreed obligations of international human rights law, and from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights., Over the next three days, an unprecedented number of dignitaries will participate in this high-level segment. This is a vital opportunity to come together and meet this grave and pivotal moment with action. I ask that as we do so, all of us place, first and foremost, the world's people – their shared, and universal, aspirations and rights – at the centre of our deliberations., Excellencies,, It is precisely at a tipping point, or time of crisis, when investment in multilateral and human rights-based action brings swift and effective solutions – as well as laying out the path towards greater, more shared development and peace., Our constant refrain has been that more needs to be done to prevent conflict and human rights crises. It is time, now, for strong preventive action that will match our words., Action to end conflict, respect the UN Charter, and abide by international law., Action to establish the fundamental justice, services, opportunities and rights that build development, resolve grievances and re-establish trust., Action to eradicate discrimination, which impedes people's exercise of every kind of right, and is at the root of so much misery and despair., Action to ensure that digital technology advances rights – rather than undermining them – everywhere., Action to enable the full participation of the people in decision-making – so that they can believe in and trust their institutions., Action to revive the health of our planet, whose destruction is at the root of growing poverty, displacement and harm., We must also, with unprecedented vigor, fight corruption, which robs the public treasury for private gain – creating predatory élites whose interests may sharply diverge from the well-being of the people., Tackling the root causes of grievances and instability, and investing in justice and human dignity is urgent to the task of guiding societies – in every region – away from reckless, and escalating, violence. It will help create deep and long-term solutions to the harm that has been done by the pandemic. This preventive work is also essential to meeting the challenge of climate change, and the scourges of extreme poverty and forced displacement., Excellencies,, There are no winners and no losers here. We are all diminished by conflict., Already, conflict is creating humanitarian need on a scale that far exceeds our capacity for assistance. It is shattering lives and economies, driving people from their homes and creating both bitter grievances, and despair., We know that once violence begins to escalate, options for solutions become increasingly difficult. This is true both within societies, and between countries., Decisions that are taken at this crucial time will have lasting impact.

"Human Rights Council Opens Forty-Ninth Session, Decides to Hold an Urgent Debate on Situation in Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"OPENING
28 February 2022, The Human Rights Council this morning opened its forty-ninth regular session, hearing statements from the President of Switzerland, the President of the General Assembly, the United Nations Secretary-General, and the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Council also decided to hold an emergency debate on the situation in Ukraine., Federico Villegas, President of the Council, Ukraine, said he had received a request from Ukraine urging the Council to hold an urgent debate on the “situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression. Following a roll-call vote of 29 votes in favour, 5 against and 13 abstentions, the Council decided to hold the urgent debate., Ukraine and the Russian Federation spoke as countries concerned., Ignazio Cassis, President of Switzerland, said war was raging in the heart of Europe again. Switzerland condemned most firmly the attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. This was a blatant violation of international humanitarian law., Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly, said there was no sustainable peace and development without human rights and invited all members and observers to not lose their sense of collective responsibility in their deliberations in the Council., Antonio Gutteres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the escalation of military operations by the Russian Federation in Ukraine was leading to escalating human rights violations. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine was continuing its work and humanitarian agencies would step up their operations., Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the military attack on Ukraine was putting at risk countless lives. Between Thursday morning and last night, the Office of the High Commissioner had recorded 406 civilian casualties, including 102 killed –including 7 children – and 304 injured., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The Council will next start its high-level segment at 10:30 a.m., Opening Statement by the President of the Council, FEDERICO VILLEGAS, President of the Human Rights Council, said while the COVID-19 pandemic continued, the Human Rights Council continued to demonstrate flexibility and perseverance to ensure that it was able to fulfil the collective responsibility to uphold human rights standards and respond to the human rights challenges exacerbated by times of crisis., Before everything else, there was a matter of urgency in connection with the forty-ninth session. On 24 February 2022, a letter had been received from Yevheniia Filipenko, Permanent Representative of Ukraine, requesting the Human Rights Council to hold an urgent debate on the “situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression” as urgently as possible during this session. Urgent debates were based on a decision by the Council to adjust its programme of work in order to address a human rights matter which was considered to be urgent. The reorganization of the programme of work was made upon the request of a State or a group of States. Such a debate should be organized in a constructive and efficient manner and be as non-disruptive as possible to the programme of work., There have been six urgent debates organized so far. In conformity with these precedents, the urgent debate would be organized under agenda item 1 and would follow the modalities of a general debate. The debate may be followed by the adoption of a resolution on the matter, provided the main sponsors submitted a draft resolution at least 24 hours before its adoption and organized at least one informal consultation. The Bureau had come to the conclusion that the requested urgent debate could take place immediately following the conclusion of the right of reply that would take place following the conclusion of the general segment. The Bureau had agreed only on a possible timing for the holding of the urgent debate, and not on the proposal itself., Request for Urgent Debate on Ukraine, YEVHENIIA FILIPENKO, Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said its call for an urgent debate was supported by many delegations. Russia had attacked Ukraine - this was an attack on every Member State, on the United Nations and on the principles that the Organization was created to defend. After weeks of escalating threats, Russian troops had entered from Russia and Belarus in a wide-scale invasion. The toll had become devastating in only a few days. Hundreds of thousands were displaced, the people were subjected to bombing and shelling., Attacks on Kiev and other cities had forced people to spend days and nights in shelters. Hundreds of thousands of children had been deprived of their basic needs. Thousands were deprived of electricity and water. Russian forces had targeted kindergartens, hospitals and orphanages, committing acts that could amount to war crimes. Russia must be brought to account. The Russian leadership did not hide the fact that the attack was grounded in deep disdain for Ukrainian statehood. Russia’s acts had been unequivocally condemned by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Secretary-General. The Russian aggression was accompanied by a massive flow of disinformation. Some of this would be heard here today. It was the responsibility of the Council to push back against this and strongly respond to the blatant violation of international law. The United Nations Security Council had been unable to take action, but the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council must respond to the violations of international human rights law. The Human Rights Council had to act and put an end to this situation, and members should exercise their responsibility and support the call for an urgent debate., GENNADY GATILOV, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said the proposal to hold this debate was a topic which had nothing to do with the true concerns about the human rights situation in Ukraine. It was the usual attempt of Kiev to distract the attention of the international community about what they had been doing for nearly eight years now, which was a targeted destruction of completely innocent people in Donetsk and Luhansk, women, children and the elderly. The tragic result of this inhumane policy was well known to all. Tens of thousands of human lives had been lost. For eight years, Kiev had continued to bomb its own citizens, with the silence of the Western curators or sponsors. Where had the Western colleagues been for all these years. Why had they not raised their voices in the Human Rights Council whilst the people in the Donbass were dying and when Ukrainian artillery carried out targeted shelling of hospitals and schools. Instead, the Council had talked about the territorial integrity of Ukraine., Mr. Gatilov said he would not go further into this topic as the Human Rights Council was simply not empowered to discuss issues relating to this issue. After Russia’s recognition of the independence of these republics, the shelling had not stopped but in fact had increased, and it was still ongoing today. In this situation, the decision to conduct a special operation to stop the tragedy in Ukraine had been taken. Russia had had no other choice. This operation was targeted in nature and there was no firing on civilian sites. The Russian Federation would continue to speak in an honest and depoliticised dialogue on the situation of human rights in Ukraine. This discussion must be held on an equal footing with an honest approach to all existing problems. It was quite clear that the urgent debate as proposed would clearly not serve this objective. In this context, Russia was against this urgent debate and called for a vote., The results of the vote were as follows: 29 in favour, 5 votes against and 13 abstentions., In favour (29): Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Cote d’Ivoire, Finland, France, Germany, Gambia, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Lithuania, Libya, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Montenegro, Nepal, Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom, United States and Ukraine., Against (5): China, Cuba, Eritrea, Russian Federation and Venezuela., Abstentions (13): Armenia, Cameroon, Gabon, India, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Namibia, Pakistan, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan., FEDERICO VILLEGAS, President of the Human Rights Council, said the results of the vote were 29 in favour, 5 against and 13 abstentions. Therefore, the proposal was adopted. The urgent debate would be added to the programme of work., Mr. Villegas said the Human Rights Council was one of the United Nations bodies that continued to work fully during the pandemic. “We never stopped the joint action wheel to generate greater protection of human rights around the world”, he said, inviting all actors to preserve the space for dialogue, understanding and cooperation to strengthen the Council. There was no sustainable peace and development without human rights, Mr. Villegas continued as he urged all members and observers to not lose their sense of collective responsibility in their deliberations in the Council., The President extended a very warm welcome to all delegations and other stakeholders who were to participate in this session of the Council and explained that due to the prevailing sanitary conditions and the extraordinary modalities for this session, only one of the 12 selected beneficiary delegates supported by the Least Developed Countries - Small Island Developing States Trust Fund would be able to participate in this session in person: the delegate from Benin., Additionally, Mr. Villegas highlighted that the active participation of representatives of civil society and national human rights institutions in the work of the Human Rights Council was essential to the fulfilment of its mandate. As President of the Council, he assured that he would follow up on all allegations brought to his attention of acts of reprisal and intimidation committed against persons in connection to their contribution to the work of the Human Rights Council, its mechanisms and procedures. Mr. Villegas called on everyone to take all necessary measures to prevent such acts in the first place and to ensure that they were promptly and seriously addressed in case they were to happen., Keynote Speakers, IGNACIO CASSIS, President of Switzerland, said Switzerland had a long tradition as a host country on the basis of universal conventions. The Human Rights Council made a fundamental contribution to the respect and promotion of human rights around the world, allowing human rights violations to be denounced, providing accountability, and protecting from future violations. Today the turn of events was unexpected - war was raging in the heart of Europe again. Here in Geneva, an emblematic city of peace, humanitarianism and multilateralism, this needed to be discussed. Switzerland condemned most firmly the attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. This was a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. Russia had violated the most fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The attempts of the Russian Federation to legitimise its actions were not credible. There was nothing that could legitimise this intervention. Russia should withdraw immediately from Ukraine and de-escalate its military., Switzerland was prepared to welcome all persons in need and called upon the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and civil rights. All civilians must be protected and treated with humanity. Medical structures, infrastructure and personnel must be protected in all circumstances. All parties should ensure rapid humanitarian access with no impediments. The Russian people could not have free access to information on the events and could not express themselves freely. The arrest of peaceful demonstrators was condemned. The Geneva humanitarian institutions could make a major contribution to protecting international human rights and human rights in Ukraine. Those who committed grave violations of international law and international human rights law must be brought to account. Switzerland supported the urgent debate. This session of the Human Rights Council would of course be marked by the dramatic events, but there were other matters of concern: stability and prosperity would be better guaranteed in a world where the human rights of all were respected. The respect of human rights was a key element to prevent conflicts and to strengthen democratic structures. Switzerland was committed to taking further account of human rights in the Palais des Nations and ensuring cooperation between the three pillars of the United Nations. Switzerland had submitted its candidacy to the Security Council as a non-permanent member for 2023-2024., ABDULLAH SHAHEED, President of the General Assembly, recognised the tremendous efforts of High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, her Office, and the whole United Nations system in the promotion and protection of all human rights for all. Regarding the COVID pandemic, he reiterated the conclusions of the recent high-level thematic debate on vaccine equity, which stressed the importance of including a human rights perspective when recovering from the pandemic and using the 2030 Agenda as the roadmap to recovery. Beyond COVID, Mr. Shaheed said he would prioritise the needs of the planet in his presidency and welcomed recent progress at this Council on these issues, including two resolutions, on human rights and climate change, and on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. A high-level event in July would highlight the synergies on this issue across the various meetings taking place during his presidency., Gender equality would also take a priority during his presidency, with the President’s cabinet being gender balanced, with more women than men, and the President promised to participate only in panels that were gender balanced. In addition to his commitment to women and girls was an understanding that young people must be empowered. Mr. Shaheed said he had made it a point to include their voices at meetings and events at the General Assembly during this session. Under the Fellowship for HOPE, eight young diplomats from underrepresented countries had joined his team to gain valuable insight into the work of the United Nations. He hoped that they would take these insights and lessons back to their home communities and support their nations in the field of multilateralism. Upholding human rights also meant tackling racism and other forms of discrimination, and as such one of the first meetings he had presided over was the commemorative meeting to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in September 2021. He would also continue to prioritise bringing the voices of civil society back into the halls of the United Nations during his presidency., ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that human rights were under assault everywhere. Human rights could not be confiscated by dictators or erased by poverty. Nor were they a luxury that could be left for later. They were inescapable and powerful. The United Nations worked every day, everywhere, to uphold and promote human rights for all. The solutions to crises were all rooted in human rights, COVID-19 pandemic included. The unequal recovery from the pandemic had revealed the moral bankruptcy of the global financial system. Calling for a renewed social contract, based on rights and opportunities for all, the Secretary-General said that it was essential to tackle poverty and hunger, invest in education and lifelong learning, and rebuild trust and social cohesion. The rights of women and girls must be at the forefront and the recovery was an opportunity for targeted investments in women’s education, employment, training and decent work, to make up ground lost during the pandemic., The climate crisis was a human rights crisis, Mr. Guterres said. Today’s report on adaptation from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was another death knell for the world that they knew. Floods, droughts and rising sea levels would lead to even greater humanitarian catastrophes, food shortages and migration. Up to one-fifth of the planet could be too hot for humans to survive. A few countries were trampling on the rights of the rest of the world and a few companies were reaping rich rewards, while ignoring the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable. Welcoming the Council’s recognition of the right to a healthy environment, “an important tool for accountability and climate justice”, the Secretary-General said the Paris Agreement was intrinsically linked to human rights., Digital technology was “the Wild West” for human rights and the internet must be treated as a global public good that should benefit everyone, everywhere. The world needed a digital public square that was inclusive and safe for all, and social media platforms that supported human rights and freedoms., The escalation of military operations by the Russian Federation in Ukraine was leading to escalating human rights violations. The Secretary-General said conflict was the utter negation of human rights across the board. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine was continuing its work and humanitarian agencies would step up their operations. The grim irony, he continued, was that conflicts were themselves frequently rooted in the denial of human rights, from discrimination against minorities to gaping inequalities and injustice. He said protecting minorities and promoting their economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights were among the most important conflict prevention tools that were available. Around the world, a much sharper and more sustained focus on minority rights was needed. The Secretary-General urged the authorities in countries from Myanmar to Afghanistan, Ethiopia and beyond to step up the protection of minorities and respect the equal rights of all their people, during and after war., Supporting that diversity defined the richness of human civilization, he highlighted the need for a much sharper and more sustained focus on minority rights. ""Refugees and migrants are a group that need special protection"", he said, adding that hostile asylum and migration policies, as well as the xenophobic rhetoric that often accompanied them, threatened the lives of migrants and refugees and made hypocrites of those who purported to lead by example on human rights. He expressed his strong support for the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to protect and enhance human rights everywhere. The Secretary-General stated that the human rights movement was an affirmation of basic humanity. “Through the daily grind of advocacy, monitoring, and investigation, human rights defenders, including journalists and lawyers, are standing up for our common humanity – often at great personal risk” he stated. Mr. Guterres concluded by saluting them and honouring their work., MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said this Council session was taking place at a time that called for strong and visionary leadership. Remarkable progress that had been made over two decades in every region – in decreasing conflict, reducing poverty and expanding access to education and other rights – was in jeopardy. Depleted by the pandemic, divided by growing polarisation, undermined by growing environmental harm and corroded by digital disinformation, hatred and distortions of democracy, and disregard of the rule of law, many societies were evolving – or plunging – into increased repression and violence; rising poverty; anger; and conflict. The military attack on Ukraine was putting at risk countless lives. Between Thursday morning and last night, the Office of the High Commissioner had recorded 406 civilian casualties, including 102 killed –including 7 children – and 304 injured. Meanwhile, millions of civilians, including vulnerable and older people, were forced to huddle in different forms of bomb shelters, such as underground stations, to escape explosions. The High Commissioner for Refugees had reported that 422,000 people had fled the country – and many more were internally displaced. Action to end conflict, respect the United Nations Charter, and abide by international law were needed., The international community must also, with unprecedented vigour, fight corruption, which robbed the public treasury for private gain – creating predatory élites whose interests may sharply diverge from the well-being of the people. Tackling the root causes of grievances and instability, and investing in justice and human dignity was urgent to the task of guiding societies – in every region – away from reckless and escalating violence. Already, conflict was creating humanitarian need on a scale that far exceeded the capacity for assistance. It was shattering lives and economies, driving people from their homes and creating both bitter grievances and despair. Decisions that were taken at this crucial time would have lasting impact. They must re-establish a trajectory that benefitted all. The Secretary-General had set the path for that global effort – framing a new approach that was anchored in human rights, and supported by a strong human rights system, at the core of revitalised and strengthened multilateral organizations. The Office of the High Commissioner stood ready to support this crucial work in every way., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/02/le-conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-ouvre-sa-49eme-session-en",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-council-opens-forty-ninth-session-decides-hold-urgent-debate-situation

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Feb 2022,"As the humanitarian situation in Ukraine worsens and neighbouring countries receive Ukrainians fleeing their country, the European Commission is working on all fronts to provide emergency assistance., EU humanitarian aid, The Commission announces an additional €90 million for emergency aid programmes to help civilians affected by the war in Ukraine, as part of an urgent aid appeal by the United Nations. The funding will help people inside Ukraine and in Moldova. This new EU humanitarian aid will provide food, water, health, shelter and help cover their basic needs., EU Civil Protection Mechanism, The Commission is also coordinating the delivery of material assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine, with offers from currently 20 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands -- which includes 8 million essential medical care items and civil protection support. A first truck load from Slovenia arrived yesterday to Ukraine's capital Kyiv., Moldova has activated the Mechanism to support Ukrainians arriving to their country. Already Austria, France and the Netherlands offered emergency support such as shelter items and medical assistance to Moldova., The Commission is in constant contact with other neighbouring countries of Ukraine and stands ready to provide further assistance as requested., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: ""Civilians are paying the highest price of the illegal Russian military aggression on Ukraine. The war risks displacing millions of Ukrainians, leading to a sharp rise in humanitarian needs. Inside Ukraine, but also in neighbouring countries where Ukrainians seek safety. The EU stands in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our initial funding will allow our humanitarian partners to deliver urgently needed assistance. I urge the entire international donor community to also generously respond."", Background, Following an invasion by Russia into Ukraine, the humanitarian needs are expected to be disastrous. The armed violence is causing widespread human suffering, civilian casualties, damage to civilian infrastructures, large-scale displacement and the exacerbation of the existing humanitarian needs stemming from years of conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic., The EU has been supporting displaced and affected by the conflict people in eastern Ukraine since 2014. The EU has allocated more than €193 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since 2014 to help thousands of displaced people and residents in non-government and government controlled areas., For more information:, Ukraine factsheet, Press contact, Miriam GARCIA FERRER

Ukraine crisis humanitarian need grows with children at heightened risk of trauma and exploitation,News and Press Release,World Vision,Protection and Human Rights,27 Feb 2022,"For immediate release, International aid organisation, World Vision, has today warned of the detrimental psychological impact the ongoing crisis in Ukraine will have on children and families. The child-focused NGO, who has been present in Eastern Europe for decades, is scaling up its operation in response to refugees entering Romania from Ukraine and plans to provide psychological first aid for children who have been traumatised by this conflict, as well as basic relief supplies for refugees., World Vision has also expressed concern about children potentially being separated from their parents and families during displacement from their homes and communities, exposing them to heightened risks of violence, exploitation, and abuse., In Moldova, World Vision is setting up partnerships with local NGOs to coordinate and support refugee hosting efforts. The agency is also planning to provide educational continuity to Ukrainian children who now have no access to education. Discussions are underway with several partners to support their work inside Ukraine as well., Eleanor Monbiot OBE, World Vision's Regional Leader for Middle East and Eastern Europe, says:, ""We are genuinely concerned about the growing humanitarian and psychological needs of the children and families most affected by the crisis in Ukraine. The situation is changing rapidly, but we are seeing in Ukraine, as we have seen in other conflicts around the world, that there is a growing psychological impact on children and families., ""Due to this, as well as distributing aid packages, including hygiene and child-friendly kits, World Vision is on the ground in Romania and planning a cross border response in Moldova to prepare essential support to refugees. We will start by providing practical things like water and other supplies, but we are also looking at offering psychological first aid to children and individuals arriving from Ukraine.

Deployment of nuclear weapons presents a huge risk in Ukraine conflict,News and Press Release,PAX,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,25 Feb 2022,"25 February 2022 | Not only has Russia actually started a war in Ukraine, it has also threatened to use nuclear weapons to defend its sovereignty. Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands had already hinted at this during his interview with the Dutch current affairs TV programme Nieuwsuur on 16 February, and President Putin repeated the threat in his declaration of war on 24 February. This development in the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia claims is intended to defend its own interests, is extremely disquieting. All states with nuclear weapons should instead work towards disarmament., Catastrophic, The situation in Ukraine once again lays bare the danger inherent in the fact that many states still possess weapons of mass destruction. In the heat of a conflict such as the one now being waged in Ukraine the risk of nuclear weapons being deployed is greater than ever. Their use would by definition be catastrophic for civilians. Given the high number of victims, the destruction of infrastructure and the hazards caused by radiation, any assistance following a nuclear explosion would be impossible. The environmental consequences would also be enormous, as contaminated land would be unusable. It is a saddening fact that the potential consequences can already be seen in Ukraine itself, as the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986 released radiation on a scale that continues to be a public health hazard to this very day., History, Nuclear weapons have been hovering in the background to the conflict in Ukraine for a long time. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine transferred the Soviet nuclear arms on its territory to Russia after which, in 1994, it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agreements made in it were subsequently sealed in the Budapest Memorandum, under which the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia undertook to respect Ukraine's boundaries in accordance with the UN Charter. The violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity therefore breaches not only international law but also the agreements made in that memorandum., Disarmament is the only solution, In his 21 February speech, President Putin claimed that Ukraine was working to produce new nuclear weapons. Experts say there is no evidence of this whatsoever. In neighbouring Belarus, however, an amendment to the constitution is currently being prepared that would allow the country to host nuclear weapons again. President Lukashenko of Belarus had previously invited Russia to redeploy Russian nuclear weapons in his country, a dangerous development that would increase the number of territories with nuclear arms and one that should be immediately censured. Other countries that still possess nuclear weapons are China, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, the United States, France and the United Kingdom. In addition, under NATO's nuclear sharing policy, US nuclear weapons are currently stationed in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Turkey., Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, The only way to reduce the risk posed by nuclear arms is to dismantle them. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has been in force since 2021 and has already been ratified by 59 countries. This is a strong signal from non-nuclear states to countries that do have nuclear weapons to put an end to the global and unacceptable threat inherent in those weapons., More information on nuclear weapons in relation to the escalating crisis in Ukraine can be found on the website of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN). This is a coalition of NGOs, including PAX, across 100 countries that support the TPNW and promote its implementation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/deployment-nuclear-weapons-presents-huge-risk-ukraine-conflict
Norway to increase support to Ukraine and provide military equipment,News and Press Release,Govt. Norway,Contributions,27 Feb 2022,"The Norwegian Government has allocated up to NOK 2 billion for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and will provide military equipment such as helmets and bulletproof vests to the war-torn country. The Government will also align itself with the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia and will ensure that its sovereign wealth fund divests its Russian assets., 'Russia's military attacks in Ukraine are causing widespread loss of life and suffering in the civilian population, destroying vital infrastructure and forcing people to flee their homes. In the light of this, we are increasing our humanitarian support in connection with the crisis in Ukraine to NOK 2 billion,' said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre., Today, Norway and other members of the UN Security Council requested an emergency meeting of the Council to discuss the humanitarian situation in Ukraine., Norway has already provided NOK 250 million in humanitarian support in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, primarily to the UN Refugee Agency, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund. This has now been increased to a total of NOK 2 billion., 'Today I have met with several of the key humanitarian actors working in Ukraine. We share deep concerns over the grave impacts of the hostilities on the civilian population. A large number of people in Ukraine will be in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, and this will have major consequences for neighbouring countries experiencing an influx of refugees,' said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt., The extraordinary allocation to Ukraine is intended to enhance the efforts of humanitarian actors to help the most vulnerable groups, including children. The funds will be used for humanitarian activities by the UN, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Norwegian humanitarian organisations in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries that are receiving refugees. The support is being provided as flexible funding to ensure that the actors involved can target the areas where the needs are greatest., The Government has decided to send military equipment such as helmets and bulletproof vests to Ukraine., 'The Ukrainian people are fighting for survival against a superior military force. Under these special circumstances we are authorising the provision of military equipment to a country at war. The Government will be donating military equipment such as helmets and bulletproof vests to Ukraine. Russia's attack on Ukraine is threatening European security in a way we have not experienced since the Second World War. It poses a threat to the norms, values and principles on which our democratic societies are founded,' said Mr Gahr Støre., 'This is equipment that Ukraine has requested and that we can donate quickly,' said Minister of Defence Odd Roger Enoksen., All the parliamentary leaders in the Storting have been consulted on the decision, and a meeting of the Enlarged Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence will be held later on Sunday evening., The Minister of Finance will ask the Government Pension Fund Global, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, to freeze all its investments in Russia immediately. In addition, he will ask the fund to divest from Russia., 'Given the way the situation has evolved, we consider it necessary for the fund to divest its Russian assets,' said Minister of Finance Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/norway-increase-support-ukraine-and-provide-military-equipment

Ukraine: Cluster munitions kill child and two other civilians taking shelter at a preschool,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",27 Feb 2022,"A preschool in north-eastern Ukraine was hit on the morning of 25 February with widely-banned cluster munitions while civilians took shelter inside, killing three of them, including a child, and wounding another child, Amnesty International said today. The attack appears to have been carried out by Russian forces, which were operating nearby, and which have a shameful record of using cluster munitions in populated areas., Amnesty International has confirmed that a 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast, where local people were seeking safety from the fighting. The strike may constitute a war crime., “There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary-General of Amnesty International. “This attack bears all the hallmarks of Russia’s use of this inherently indiscriminate and internationally-banned weapon, and shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.”, The strike violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks and damaged a school, a structure legally entitled to special protection. Under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions — a treaty backed by more than 100 states, but which Ukraine and Russia have not joined — the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions is prohibited under all circumstances. Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions. Launching indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime., Drone video footage taken from the scene shows that cluster munitions struck at least seven locations on or near the building, four on the roof and three on the pavement immediately outside the school. Two injured or dead civilians are also visible in the footage, as are pools of blood. An additional 65 photos and videos that Amnesty International acquired from a local source shows more details of the scene, the victims and their family members, and the damage to the school., “While I was walking down [with] my wife, there were immediate explosions,” an older man told a contact working with Amnesty International. “You see, everyone is covered with blood, everything. Look at it…[expletive], it kills me the fact it’s a kindergarten. What’s this they shoot at? At military objects? Where are those?”, The 220mm Uragan rocket, either a 9M27K or 9M27K1, carries 30 9N210 or 9N235 cluster munitions, which are nearly identical and differ only in the length of the time delay of their self-destruct feature. The seven impacts on and near the school show damage, including distinctive spalling on the ground, consistent with the expected damage from 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions., As first reported by the open source investigation organization Bellingcat, the remains of the nose cone and cargo compartment of the 9M27K rocket were discovered 200 metres to the east. Open source reports indicate there were Russian forces to the west of Okhtyrka, the source of the rocket launch based upon the flight trajectory, at the time of the attack. A logistics storage yard 300 metres north of the school may have been the target of the attack. However, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), like the 220mm Uragan rockets used in this attack, are unguided and notoriously inaccurate, and should never be used in civilian populated areas., In addition, because they scatter munitions over a wide area and have an extremely high dud rate of up to 20% — and because of the consequent threat they pose to civilians — cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons that are internationally banned by a treaty backed by more than 100 states. The use of these weapons violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks., Attacks on schools, This is the fourth attack in this conflict that has struck a school that Amnesty International has verified., On 17 February, during increased shelling along the line of control, Russian-backed forces struck a kindergarten in the town of Stanytsia Luhanska, wounding three civilians. On the evening of 25 February, a missile damaged School No. 48 in Mariupol, blowing in windows and pockmarking the walls with metal fragments. And, on 26 February, an explosive weapon, most likely an artillery shell, hit the second story of a kindergarten in Chernihiv, starting a fire that was likely detected by VIIRS environmental satellite sensors., Under international humanitarian law, educational facilities are entitled to heightened protections as long as they are not used for military purposes. (None of the schools damaged in the incidents documented by Amnesty International appear to have been used for military purposes.) Parties to a conflict are required to take special care to avoid destroying or damaging them, a requirement that Russian forces do not appear to be meeting, judging from the growing number of attacks., In 2019, Ukraine endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, which includes commitments to strengthen the protection of schools during armed conflict and to restrict their use for military purposes. All parties to the current conflict should respect the Safe Schools Declaration and its Guidelines., “It is stomach turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe-haven. Plain and simple, this should be investigated as a war crime,” said Agnès Callamard., “As this human tragedy unfolds in Ukraine, any person who commits war crimes should be held individually accountable before the International Criminal Court (ICC) or another international criminal justice process at the national or international level. It is imperative that UN member states and the ICC urgently consider how to ensure the timely and effective collection and preservation of evidence of any crimes under international law committed in Ukraine.”, While Russia and Ukraine are not parties to the ICC, in 2015 Ukraine accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed on its territory from 20 February 2014.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cluster-munitions-kill-child-and-two-other-civilians-taking-shelter-preschool

"Security Council Calls for Emergency Session of General Assembly on Ukraine Crisis, Adopting Resolution 2623 (2022) by 11 Votes in Favour, 1 Against, 3 Abstentions",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",27 Feb 2022,"SC/14809, SECURITY COUNCIL
8980TH MEETING (AM), Kyiv’s Permanent Representative Condemns Moscow’s Nuclear Blackmail’, Russian Counterpart Says Ukraine Nationalists to Blame for Attacks on Civilians, The Security Council, at its fourth meeting on the situation in Ukraine in the last week, called an emergency special session of the General Assembly in the next 24 hours at which the world body can decide whether to use armed force, when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security., By a recorded vote of 11 in favour to 1 against (Russian Federation), with 3 abstentions (China, India, United Arab Emirates), the Council adopted resolution 2623 (2022) (to be issued as document S/RES/2623(2022), taking into account that the lack of unanimity of its permanent members at its meeting on 25 February has prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. (For details of that meeting, see Press Release SC/14808.), The procedural resolution precludes the use of a veto by the Council’s permanent members (China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, United States). An emergency special session of the General Assembly shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any nine members, or by a majority of the members of the United Nations., [The Security Council had last called for convening an emergency special session of the General Assembly in 1982, with regard to the situation involving Syria and Israel, and in 1980, after the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan war, when the former Soviet Union vetoed a draft resolution, leading members to invoke General Assembly resolution 377A(V), “Uniting for peace”, adopted in 1950.], Under General Assembly resolution 377A(V), the world body resolved that if the Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, it shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures. This includes, in a case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression, the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security., Following the adoption, Council members explained their positions., The delegate from the Russian Federation, Council President for February, spoke in his national capacity, saying that each permanent member has a right to use the veto for such specific reasons as achieving global stability. Any attempt to circumvent the Russian Federation’s rights in this regard only undermines the Charter of the United Nations, he said, adding that the veto is not a privilege, but rather a mechanism to ensure balance in the world. The goal is to find common ground, unlike the actions of some Western members, which have blocked the Russian Federation’s concerns about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)., Urging members to stop aiding and abetting the current social media misinformation war against the Russian Federation, he said: “We hear lies and deceit about the indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian facilities, hospitals and schools” when “the Russian army does not threaten civilians in Ukraine; it does not shell civilian infrastructure”. Instead, it is the Ukrainian “nationalists” who are using civilians as humans shields and deploying rocket launchers in civilian areas — acts that are used by terrorists and must be condemned, he said., China’s delegate, reiterating that his delegation’s unchanged position remains about the situation in Ukraine, said the priority is for all parties to do all they can to prevent the situation from deteriorating. At the same time, the Council must prioritize regional peace and play a constructive role in resolving the situation, with efforts facilitating a diplomatic solution. Efforts must also address Russian Federation and European security-related concerns., Several members rejected the Russian Federation’s use of veto on the 25 February draft resolution aimed at ending the violence and called on Moscow to end its aggression against and engage in dialogue with Ukraine. Reiterating his delegation’s strong commitment against veto use in the Council since 1945, Mexico’s representative said it is not a privilege, but an enormous responsibility, especially when used by one of the parties involved in the situation concerned., France’s delegate said the Russian Federation’s veto on 25 February only prevents the Council from exercising its responsibility to uphold international peace and security. Noting that President Emmanuel Macron has called for a Council meeting on 28 February to address the humanitarian situation, he said France and Mexico have co-sponsored a related draft resolution calling for unfettered access to meet the needs of the people in Ukraine., The speaker for the United States said the Russian Federation may have vetoed Friday’s resolution, but Moscow cannot veto the Ukrainian people and cannot veto the United Nations Charter. Recalling President Vladimir Putin’s declaration that nuclear weapons will be put on alert, she called on Moscow to tone down such dangerous rhetoric, which threatens all nations. The world must show Ukrainians they are not alone and that the United Nations has a purpose, she said, noting that the United States has contributed $350 million in aid, including security assistance, and stressing: “Let us do everything we can to help the people of Ukraine.”, In a similar vein, Brazil’s representative said: “Let us be exceedingly cautious in the General Assembly,” warning that such measures as cyberattacks and sanctions can jeopardize the situation, potentially leading to famine and enhancing the risk of direct confrontation between the Russian Federation and NATO. He also thanked nations welcoming the more than 420,000 refugees that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported are currently fleeing the conflict. Norway’s representative also raised concerns about the plight of the Ukrainian people, announcing that Oslo is providing $226 million in humanitarian aid. Reiterating other Council members’ calls, she insisted that the Russian Federation unconditionally stops fighting and withdraws all its forces from the territory of Ukraine., Ukraine’s representative thanked delegates who voted to call a General Assembly emergency special session and told those who appeared to see no reason to do so to look at the images of what is unfolding across his country, where day to day, night to night, citizens face warnings of air raids and are asked to proceed to shelters. Elaborating on other consequences of violence across Ukraine, he voiced extreme alarm at the Russian Federation’s “nuclear blackmail”, a threat the world must take very seriously. Those who see what is taking place can find no justification for the attack against his country, he said, emphasizing that Ukraine has filed a case against the Russian Federation at the International Court of Justice. “Ukraine will bring the Russian Federation to account,” he declared., Also speaking tonight were representatives of Albania, Ireland, United Kingdom, India, Gabon, United Arab Emirates and Ghana., The meeting began at 3:10 p.m. and ended at 4:05 p.m., Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), explaining her delegation’s position, said the Russian Federation had vetoed Friday’s resolution, but Moscow cannot veto the Ukrainian people and cannot veto the Charter of the United Nations. The Council has, for the first time in decades, called for an emergency special session, she said, recalling that today, President Vladimir Putin announced that nuclear weapons were put on alert. This additional step “threatens us all”, she said, calling on the Russian Federation to tone down its dangerous rhetoric on the use of nuclear weapons. Member States will vote on a resolution that holds the Russian Federation to account for its violations of the United Nations Charter, she said, stressing that rockets continue to rein down on Ukraine, Moscow continues to propagate outrageous lies about Kyiv’s conduct in its defence and videos continue to show that Russian forces are bringing lethal weaponry into Ukraine., To the Russian officers and soldiers, she said: “the world is watching”, photographic and video evidence is mounting, and “you will be held accountable; we will not let atrocities slide.” Noting that the United States has already sent humanitarian aid, she said $350 million in security assistance is on its way to Ukraine. Member States have shown strength and can look at the Ukrainian people for the inspiration, she said, welcoming Ukraine’s continued willingness to partake in peace talks. Recalling the recent birth of the baby named Mia, born in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, she said the world must show Ukrainians they are not alone, that the United Nations has a purpose, emphasizing: “Let us do everything we can to help the people of Ukraine.”, FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said this procedural resolution was short in nature but historic in meaning. The United Nations needs the General Assembly to speak out against a pure act of aggression, upholding the United Nations Charter and sending a clear message of what is and is not acceptable. The Russian Federation must be stopped in its attempt to break the international rules-based order. It is time to learn from past mistakes and not repeat them. The Russian Federation can at any moment return to reason. It must reverse its actions, join peace, and not threaten an apocalypse, he said, adding that “it is time to stand up”., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), recalling that the Russian Federation alone on Friday blocked a resolution co-sponsored by 82 Member States of the United Nations, said France cannot accept this action, which prevents the Council from exercising its responsibility to uphold international peace and security. Stating that France’s President Emmanuel Macron called for a Council meeting tomorrow to address the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he added that his country has co-sponsored with Mexico a resolution for unfettered humanitarian access to meet the needs of the people in Ukraine. France stands steadfastly with Ukraine and its people., JIM KELLY (Ireland) condemned the unjustified and unprovoked attack by the Russian Federation on Ukraine, which has intensified since Friday, causing great hardship for the people of Ukraine, who have shown remarkable resilience and resolve. Ireland expresses its full solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The Council has a responsibility to act in the face of this conflict and to respond to the grave threat to international peace and security, he said, noting that it was rendered powerless to do so despite the resolve of 11 of its members, due to the use of the veto by a permanent member which flagrantly excused its own military attempt. “The use of its anachronistic veto in such tragic circumstances undermines the legitimacy of the Council in the eyes of the watching world,” he stressed, adding that such actions will not deter attempts by Council members to hold the Russian Federation accountable for its actions. Therefore, Ireland voted in favour of the resolution to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly, he said, calling on fellow Member States to step up where the Council failed, to uphold the United Nations Charter, and support the return to the path of diplomacy and peace., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said his delegation strongly supports invoking General Assembly resolution 377A (V), “Uniting for Peace”, to convene the eleventh special session of the world body. Since 1945, Mexico has maintained an unwavering stance on the use of the veto, which should not be a privilege. Rather it constitutes an enormous responsibility, especially when used by one of the parties involved in the situation concerned. Echoing France’s statement, he said a meeting will also be convened to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground to determine needs., ZHANG JUN (China), noting that his delegation’s position on the situation in Ukraine remains unchanged, said the priority is for all parties to do all they can to prevent the situation from deteriorating. China welcomes the earliest possible direct dialogue between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. At the same time, China supports talks with the Russian Federation and Europe to form a balanced security mechanism. The Security Council should prioritize regional peace and stability and play a constructive role in resolving the situation in Ukraine, he said, emphasizing that efforts must facilitate a diplomatic solution., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that voting in favour of convening a special session demonstrates that the Russian Federation is isolated in voting against it. As each day passes in this unjustified war, support for the Ukrainian people grows, she said, urging all United Nations Member States to use their voices on Monday to call on the Russian Federation to end the war., T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) expressed regret that the situation in Ukraine has worsened since the Council last convened on Friday and called for an immediate cessation of violence and an end to hostilities. There is no choice but to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue. He welcomed the announcement of talks on the Belarus-Ukraine border and reaffirmed his commitment to a global order agreed on the principles of the United Nations Charter. He went on to express deep concern about the safety and security of a large number of Indian nationals — including students — in Ukraine, pointing out that attempts to evacuate them have been impacted by the complex situation at the border. Their situation must urgently be addressed. Considering the totality of circumstances, India decided to abstain from the vote., MONA JUUL (Norway), recalling that the Russian Federation was isolated in the last meeting of the Council two days ago, stressed that its action is unacceptable and violates the core principles of international law that the United Nations stands for. On Friday, the Council failed in its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security, due to a veto by the aggressor, she said, adding that this made it necessary to reconvene an emergency special session of the General Assembly with the purpose of making recommendations for collective measures to address the situation. Expressing deep concern at the alarm at the protracted harm experienced by the civilian population as a consequence of the horrifying conflict, she said that Norway is providing $226 million in humanitarian aid to help the Ukrainian people. Norway insists that the Russian Federation unconditionally stops fighting and withdraws all its forces from the territory of Ukraine, she stressed., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil), recalling that according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 420,000 refugees are currently fleeing the conflict, underlined the Security Council’s important role. While the current situation in Ukraine requires adding the voice of the General Assembly, he said the Council, as the primary entity responsible for international peace and security, has yet to use all the tools available to restore peace. The Council must work towards bringing a peaceful solution through, among other things, dialogue between the parties, he said, also calling for a ceasefire and for Ukraine and the Russian Federation to let all persons wishing to leave to do so. He thanked Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Republic of Moldova and other States providing refuge for those fleeing the conflict. “Let us be exceedingly cautious in the General Assembly,” he said, warning that such measures as cyberattacks and sanctions can jeopardize the situation, potentially leading to famine and enhancing the risk of direct confrontation between the Russian Federation and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). “We need to engage in serious negotiations that could allow the restoration of Ukraine’s territory and strategic security in Europe.”, EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon), raising grave concerns about ongoing violence and the consequences facing Ukrainians, recalled that thousands are fleeing the country. Pointing to reports of attacks against civilians, she called for a cessation of violence. There is an urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and the start of frank dialogue, she said, adding that it is always better to choose discussions over confrontation., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) expressed regret about the worsening conflict, calling for the cessation of hostilities and for the return to dialogue and diplomacy. Welcoming the announcement of talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border, he underlined the importance of securing regional peace and security, amid an escalation in the security situation. Civilians must be able to leave Ukraine unhindered, the space for humanitarian assistance must be preserved, and the necessary aid must be delivered to those in need. He emphasized that international law must be upheld, as must the principles of the United Nations Charter, including respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all Member States., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), observing that the world is living through “dangerous moments”, emphasized the need for diplomacy to triumph over war. Ghana maintains its commitment to dialogue and for the objectives of peace. Last Friday, due to an exercise of the veto, the Council was unable to act on its primary responsibility, to act in response to a threat to international peace, following the Russian Federation’s aggression upon Ukraine. Therefore, it is time for the General Assembly to pronounce on the matter, which is why Ghana voted in favour of the resolution just adopted. Noting that all Member States agreed to the terms of the United Nations Charter, he said: “Today, the peace we say we love is threatened.” He called on all Member States to participate in the session in a constructive manner and take steps to stop the unjustified assault that is needlessly costing lives., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), recalling the Council’s meeting on 25 February, said there was no hint at even an attempt to reach a constructive solution, leading to his delegation blocking the draft resolution because of its one-sidedness. The Council has the vested right of permanent members to block drafts for a reason, among them being to achieve global stability, he said, adding that any attempt to circumvent the Russian Federation’s rights in this regard only undermines the United Nations Charter. The veto is not a privilege, but rather a mechanism to ensure balance in the world. The goal is to find common ground, unlike the actions of some Western members, which have blocked the Russian Federation’s concerns about NATO, he continued., This crisis broke out must earlier than in 2022, he said, noting that no one tonight had even raised the issue of the suffering facing the people of Donbas, turning a blind eye for the past eight years to the Ukrainian armed forces’ destruction of homes and claiming Russian forces are responsible. Instead, “we hear lies and deceit about the indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian facilities, hospitals and schools,” he said, stressing that “the Russian army does not threaten civilians in Ukraine. It does not shell civilian infrastructure”. Indeed, the Ukrainian “nationalists” are using civilians as humans shields and deploying rocket launchers in civilian areas — acts that are used by ISIL terrorists and must be condemned. The residents of Ukraine are also threatened by radicals, prison escapees and criminals, as witnessed in Kyiv and other cities. Pointing to an ongoing information war against the Russian Federation being unleashed on social media, he pointed to a range of fabricated photos and urged colleagues to not aid and abet the perpetuation of such misinformation., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), expressing gratitude to those who voted to call for the emergency session of the General Assembly, regretted, once again, the lack of proper application of Rule 20 of the Provisional Rules of the Council by the Council President, adding: “It is a relief that this rape [of the Council presidency] will be over in less than 48 hours.” He directed those who appeared to see no reason in supporting the session to the pictures of what is unfolding in Ukraine, where day to day, night to night, citizens face warnings of air raids and are asked to proceed to shelters. “I will continue to invite all Council members to join the catharsis; the purgation of the institution that will save it for the next generation,” he said. Stating that the Russian Federation is persisting in its aggression, he said that its failure has prompted its “mad leadership” in the shelling of civilian areas and critical infrastructure, in retaliation for the resilience demonstrated by Ukrainians. Moreover, he expressed extreme alarm that the Russian President is resorting to “nuclear blackmail”, stressing: “The world must take this threat very seriously”., Fighting is unfolding across Ukraine, from Kyiv, to cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, as well as in the south, he continued, including through the deployment of long-range aircraft and multiple rocket launcher systems. In the town of Vasylkiv, a recent missile strike hit an oil depot, causing a large-scale fire, while shelling in the city of Kharkiv damaged an oil pipeline. He went on to cite statistics from the Ministry of Education, which reported that 16 children had been killed from 24 February. Moreover, maternity hospitals had ceased to operate due to the security situation in a number of cities, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, and as a result, children are being born in bomb shelters, he said. Noting that more than 350,000 children lacked access to education, and that 33 schools were closed due to insecurity in civilian areas, he said he had relayed these appalling facts to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), requesting it to respond to the situation., Turning to the fighting, which had led to enemy losses amounting to almost 4,300 personnel killed and over 200 taken as prisoners of war, as of early 27 February, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, he noted that “as always”, the Russian Federation is denying such facts. Therefore, Ukraine has opened hotlines, titled “Come back alive from Ukraine”, for the relatives of Russian soldiers who cannot contact them, he said, noting that the hotline received more than 100 calls from Russian mothers within the first hour of its operation. However, the line was subsequently shut down due to the decision of the Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation, he said, before specifying the number for anyone wishing to make inquiries: 380-89-420-1860., He went on to condemn Belarus’s participation in the armed aggression against Ukraine. Noting that Iskander missiles were fired into Ukraine from Belarus, he said: “What an invitation for the negotiation at the border with Belarus, on the eve of the negotiation.” He noted that Ukraine has filed a case against the Russian Federation at the International Court of Justice, seeking an emergency hearing and requesting an order of provisional measures to be imposed on the country. The Court has jurisdiction to hear the case, he said, pointing to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. However, he pointed out that the Russian Federation has “perverted” the Convention, making an “absurd claim” of alleged genocide as a pretext for its own aggression against Ukraine. “Ukraine will bring the Russian Federation to account,” he said., Switching to Russian, addressing the Council President, the delegate from the Russian Federation, he said he would be ready to take back his words, uttered in a previous meeting, about parents who must be ashamed by the steps taken by their kin, if the Russian delegate followed the cue of his colleague Oleg Anisimov, who at a recent closed-door meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated: “Those who see what is taking place can find no justification for the attack against Ukraine”. Concluding, he stressed: “One can remain a human being, a person, or one can choose to always defend evil.”, For information media.

Ucrania: una munición de racimo rusa detona en un hospital [ES/PT],News and Press Release,HRW,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"Cuatro civiles muertos, diez heridos, (Berlín) – Un misil balístico ruso que transportaba una munición de racimo impactó justo a las afueras de un hospital en Vuhledar, una ciudad en la región de Donetska controlada por el gobierno ucraniano, el 24 de febrero de 2022, dijo hoy Human Rights Watch. El ataque acabó con la vida de cuatro civiles e hirió a otros 10, seis de ellos trabajadores sanitarios, y resultaron dañados el hospital, una ambulancia y varios vehículos civiles., Human Rights Watch entrevistó por separado y por teléfono a un médico y a un funcionario del hospital, conocido como el Hospital de la Ciudad Central, que dieron los nombres de los heridos y muertos, y compartieron fotografías de dos de los fallecidos. Human Rights Watch también verificó fotografías publicadas en las redes sociales y las que fueron enviadas directamente por el personal del hospital que muestran los daños del ataque, incluidos dos cadáveres, y los restos del arma que aparentemente se utilizó, un misil balístico Tochka de la serie 9M79 con una ojiva de munición de racimo 9N123., “Este despiadado ataque ha matado y herido a civiles, y ha dañado un hospital”, dijo Steve Goose, director de la división de armas de Human Rights Watch. “Las fuerzas rusas deben dejar de utilizar municiones de racimo y poner fin a los ataques ilegales con armas que matan y mutilan indiscriminadamente”., Se ha adoptado un tratado internacional que prohíbe las municiones de racimo debido a su efecto indiscriminado generalizado y a su peligro prolongado para los civiles. Las municiones de racimo suelen explotar en el aire y envían docenas, incluso cientos, de pequeñas cargas explosivas sobre un área del tamaño de un campo de fútbol. Las submuniciones de racimo a menudo no detonan con el primer impacto, dejando restos que actúan como minas terrestres. Ni Rusia ni Ucrania se encuentran entre los 110 Estados parte del tratado de prohibición., El 24 de febrero, el presidente ruso Vladimir Putin anunció operaciones militares contra Ucrania. Tras el anuncio, las fuerzas armadas rusas iniciaron ataques aéreos y terrestres contra instalaciones militares en toda Ucrania. El anuncio se produjo durante una sesión de emergencia del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, cuando las tensiones entre Rusia y el gobierno ucraniano alcanzaron su punto álgido tras la acumulación de tropas rusas en las fronteras de Ucrania durante meses., La invasión a gran escala de Ucrania por parte de las fuerzas rusas estuvo precedida por la firma por parte del presidente Putin de los decretos que reconocen a las autoproclamadas “República Popular de Donetsk” (“RPD”) y “República Popular de Luhansk” (“RPL”) como territorios independientes y autorizan a las tropas a ocupar esas zonas el 21 de febrero., La doctora jefe del hospital, Natalia Sosyura, describió el ataque de la siguiente manera: “Estaba en el primer piso de nuestro edificio de dos plantas. Escuché una fuerte explosión fuera y salimos corriendo al pasillo. Por suerte, no teníamos muchos pacientes. Eran alrededor de las 10:30 de la mañana. Todos caímos al suelo”., La doctora Sosyura facilitó los nombres de cuatro civiles muertos y dijo que el hospital había atendido a otros 10 heridos, entre ellos seis trabajadores sanitarios. Una ambulancia y tres coches civiles resultaron dañados, dijo. Human Rights Watch verificó dos fotografías de los coches dañados., Human Rights Watch también habló con Tetyana Tyurina, jefa del departamento de información y comunicaciones de la administración regional de Donetska, quien también dijo que cuatro civiles murieron y 10 resultaron heridos, seis de ellos trabajadores sanitarios. Dos de los heridos fueron trasladados al Hospital Regional Central de Velykonovosilkivska para recibir tratamiento, mientras que los demás fueron tratados como pacientes externos, señaló., Los civiles muertos en el ataque, dos hombres y dos mujeres, eran Maksim Sidorenko, de 34 años; Antonina Sidorenko, de 65; Sergei Sivukhin, de 56; y Olga Shramko, de 50., Human Rights Watch verificó dos fotografías de las secuelas inmediatas del ataque que circularon por las redes sociales y una tercera que mostraba un resto del misil balístico que aparentemente fue el que se utilizó. Una de estas fotografías mostraba dos cadáveres parcialmente cubiertos por una lona frente a la entrada del hospital y daños en el edificio y en los vehículos cercanos. Human Rights Watch también recibió y verificó 22 imágenes del hospital tomadas el 25 de febrero por el personal del hospital. Estas imágenes muestran daños en los edificios del hospital, incluyendo ventanas rotas, y tres vehículos civiles dañados., A partir de la fotografía, Human Rights Watch identificó los restos del arma como el cono de la nariz y la antena del altímetro del radar de una ojiva de munición de racimo 9N123 lanzada por un misil balístico Tochka de la serie 9M79. La cabeza de munición de racimo contiene 50 submuniciones de fragmentación 9N24. Según el fabricante ruso, cada submunición contiene 1,45 kilogramos de explosivos y se rompe en aproximadamente 316 fragmentos de tamaño uniforme., Las fotografías tomadas justo después del ataque muestran huellas de impacto de una aparente detonación de submunición en el asfalto cerca de dos de los vehículos, daños por fragmentación de tamaño uniforme en el edificio del hospital, y las heridas por fragmentación aparentemente mortales de las víctimas cerca de una detonación de submunición que es característica del uso de municiones de racimo., Tanto Rusia como Ucrania cuentan con un arsenal del misil balístico Tochka equipado con una ojiva de munición de racimo., Las fuerzas gubernamentales ucranianas y los grupos armados respaldados por Rusia utilizaron municiones de racimo en el este de Ucrania entre julio de 2014 y febrero de 2015, según las investigaciones realizadas por Human Rights Watch, la misión de observación de la Organización para la Seguridad y la Cooperación en Europa (OSCE) y otras entidades., Human Rights Watch documentó el uso del mismo tipo de munición de racimo en un ataque de las fuerzas rusas y sirias contra Sarmin, en la gobernación de Idlib, en enero de 2020., “Todos los Estados parte de la Convención sobre Municiones en Racimo de 2008 deberían condenar inequívocamente este ataque y cualquier otro uso de esta deplorable arma”, dijo Goose. “Los riesgos para los civiles son intolerablemente altos.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ucrania-una-munici-n-de-racimo-rusa-detona-en-un-hospital-sppt

It covers the period from 5 p.m. (EET) 26 February 2022 to 5 p.m. (EET) 27 February 2022., HIGHLIGHTS, After three days of intense clashes across certain areas in Ukraine, the number of civilian casualties and damage to critical infrastructure are growing, triggering severe humanitarian consequences on people in the hardest-hit areas. The ongoing hostilities also continue to disrupt local supply chains and access to food and other basic items, hitting the already conflict-stricken areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts hardest., At least 376 civilian casualties have been confirmed, including 94 deaths, by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) before midnight 26 February. The actual figure could be considerably higher as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed., At least 368,000 people have already crossed into neighbouring countries, fleeing the ongoing hostilities, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as of 7:30 a.m. (CET) on 27 February., The UN and its humanitarian partners are preparing to rapidly scale-up operations once the security situation permits and mobilize emergency financing to facilitate an effective, broad and timely humanitarian response across all affected areas. Organizations already operating in areas affected by the new wave of hostilities have been able to provide some form of humanitarian assistance., On 1 March, the UN and humanitarian partners will launch a Flash Appeal to address the acute humanitarian needs of crisis-affected people within Ukraine. This appeal is coordinated with the Regional Refugee Response Plan, led by UNHCR., SITUATION OVERVIEW, After three days of intense clashes across certain parts of Ukraine, the number of civilian causalities and damage to critical infrastructure are growing, triggering severe humanitarian consequences on people in the hardest-hit areas. Between 24 February and up until midnight 26 February, the OHCHR recorded 376 civilian casualties, with 94 people killed, including seven children; these figures are likely to be considerably higher as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed., In the past 24 hours, hostilities have been observed in Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Kyiv (capital), Mariupol (south-east), Melitopol (south), Mykolaiv (south), Sumy (north) and Zaporizhzhia (south-east), among other areas in the northern, eastern and southern parts of the country., On the night of 26 February, warnings from municipal authorities of an imminent attack forced people in Kyiv to quickly take shelter, seeking refuge in basements, bomb shelters and underground metro stations across the city of nearly 2.9 million people. Many elderly people and people with disabilities found themselves trapped in the city, due to the challenges of evacuation., A suspected missile strike hit an oil depot south of the capital in Vasylkiv, setting the facility ablaze and prompting fears of effects of toxic fumes in nearby communities. In Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, located in the north-east, a gas pipeline was hit. On 26 February, missiles rained down over Kharkiv – home to 1.4 million people – where Russian forces are now reportedly on the streets. Residential areas of the city were also attacked, with at least one woman reportedly killed and dozens evacuated from a multi-storey residential building. In the north-eastern town of Okhtyrka, heavy shelling reportedly killed at least six civilians, including a seven-year-old girl., This increasingly intense conflict threatens to trigger a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine and also in neighbouring countries that are already seeing a massive influx of people fleeing hostilities. At the Ukraine-Poland border, local media outlets report at least 15 km-long lines of people trying to cross. According to the UNHCR, at least 368,000 people have already crossed into neighbouring countries – more than 115,000 have arrived in Poland alone – with millions more expected to flee the country in the coming days., The ongoing hostilities continue to disrupt local supply chains and access to food and other basic items. In eastern Ukraine, there are reports of food shortages in Kramatorsk (Donetska oblast) as supplies were mostly coming from Kharkiv. Even before 23 February, the escalating tensions in Donetska oblast had already damaged roads and bridges that subsequently limited access to markets for food on the Government-controlled side of the “contact line” for those residing in nonGovernment-controlled areas. Around 400,000 people were already estimated to be severely and moderately food-insecure in eastern Ukraine. Food insecurity is projected to rise considerably, as more and more people are displaced, where access to food, and possibly even supply, will continue to be a challenge.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-500-pm-eet-27-february-2022

We are committed to supporting Ukraine’s people, especially its women and girls, at this time of greatest need., The current situation jeopardises the safety of all Ukrainians and puts women and girls in particular at increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence, especially those who are refugees or otherwise displaced from their homes. These factors must be taken into account in all efforts to monitor and respond to the situation in Ukraine, so that early warning signs of impact are met with an appropriate and proportionate response. Women's full and meaningful participation is also vital in improving peace and security processes.

Ukraine: Attacks on schools endangering children’s lives and futures,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",27 Feb 2022,"KYIV, 27 February 2022 – Attacks on schools in Ukraine are endangering the lives and futures of the country’s 7.5 million children with reports of up to 10 children killed in the fighting and educational facilities being bombed across the country, Save the Children said., Since 2014, the conflict in Eastern Ukraine has destroyed, damaged or forced the closure of more than 750 schools, disrupting access to education for thousands of children, with many too scared to attend and distressed by the presence of armed soldiers in and around their schools., Last UN figures show at least six educational facilities have faced shelling in recent days, leaving even more children without schools which will have a profound impact on their education. Two teachers were killed on Friday when a missile struck a school in Gorlovka in eastern Ukraine., A kindergarten and an orphanage were among the buildings damaged on Friday in attacks in the northeastern city of Okhtyrka, with a seven-year-old girl among the six people killed, as reported by the UN., Schools in eastern Ukraine closed on 21 February as hostilities escalated, leaving an estimated 350,000 children with no access to education. Some schools in other areas of Ukraine had closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic but others have remained open, with reports that some parents are sending their children wearing stickers denoting their blood type as they fear for their safety., Save the Children said schools must be inviolable safe spaces for children and teachers, which are granted protection even in times of conflict., Attacks against schools and hospitals are classified by the United Nations as one of the six grave violations committed against children [i]., Eva*, 15, said she had fled her village with her parents during a lull in shelling with her school hit in the attacks., “But my grandparents, many children, my classmates, old people and people who have no opportunity to leave remained in the village,” she said in an audio testimony., “From those who left the village, I know that almost every second house was damaged and our school also affected. There were direct hits on it.”, Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “Schools must not become the battlefields where wars are waged and students are the casualties.

"Dangerously low medical oxygen supplies in Ukraine due to crisis, warn WHO Director-General and WHO Regional Director for Europe [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,WHO,Health,27 Feb 2022,"Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge call for critical medical supplies to safely reach those who need them, and are working with partners to establish safe transit for shipments through Poland, During the crisis in Ukraine, health must remain a priority pillar of the humanitarian response, with health systems and facilities remaining protected, functional, safe and accessible to all who need essential medical services, and health workers protected so they can continue to save lives., This must include the safe and reliable provision of essential medical supplies, including life-saving medicinal oxygen supplies, which are crucial for patients with a range of conditions, including those with COVID-19 (which number 1,700 in hospital now), and those with other critical illnesses (from neonates to older persons) stemming from complications of pregnancy, childbirth, chronic conditions, sepsis, and injuries and trauma., The oxygen supply situation is nearing a very dangerous point in Ukraine. Trucks are unable to transport oxygen supplies from plants to hospitals across the country, including the capital Kyiv. The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out. This puts thousands of lives at risk., Further, medical oxygen generator manufacturers in several areas are also facing shortages of zeolite, a crucial, mainly imported chemical product necessary to produce safe medical oxygen. Safe deliveries of zeolite from outside Ukraine to these plants is also needed., Compounding the risk to patients, critical hospital services are also being jeopardized by electricity and power shortages, and ambulances transporting patients are in danger of getting caught in the crossfire., In recent years, with WHO support, Ukraine had made significant strides in strengthening its health systems under an ambitious health reform programme. This included the rapid scale-up of oxygen therapy capacity for severely ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the over 600 health facilities nationwide assessed by WHO during the pandemic, close to half were directly supported with supplies, technical know-how and infrastructure investments, enabling health authorities to save tens of thousands of lives., This progress is now at risk of being derailed during the current crisis., WHO is helping health authorities identify the country’s immediate oxygen supply surge needs, assuming a 20% to 25% increase over previous needs before the crisis escalated last week., Despite the challenges posed by the current situation, WHO is working to ensure a supply of oxygen-related medical devices and trauma treatment supplies., To achieve this, WHO is actively looking at solutions to increase supplies that likely would include the importation of oxygen (liquid and cylinders) from regional networks. These supplies would need safe transit, including via a logistics corridor through Poland. It is imperative to ensure that lifesaving medical supplies – including oxygen – reach those who need them., Media Contacts

ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE
FEBRUARY 27, 2022, Our partnership with the people of Ukraine is steadfast and enduring, and we are focused on Ukraine’s urgent humanitarian needs as an important part of our response to Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack. It is with the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind that we are announcing the provision of nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance to those affected by Russia’s further invasion. This funding includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development., The United States is one of the largest humanitarian donors to Ukraine, and our humanitarian assistance now amounts to nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities since Russia invaded Ukraine eight years ago. This latest tranche of humanitarian assistance will flow through independent humanitarian organizations that deliver needs-based assistance with impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence., This additional assistance will enable international humanitarian organizations to further support the people of Ukraine, working closely with the Government of Ukraine and European allies and partners at the forefront of any response. This includes the provision of food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, winterization, and protection. Our funding will also help humanitarian organizations maintain contact between family members who have been separated due to the conflict, hopefully leading to reunification in some cases., The United States commends the hospitality of the neighboring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection. As with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law. We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this crisis response and urge still others to generously support the immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine and the region.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-people-ukraine

Situation Overview, Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the conflict heading west, either crossing the border into neighboring countries or left internally displaced., Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe with approximately 40 million inhabitants. In 2014, Ukrainian peninsula Crimea was occupied by Russia. Since 2014, the South Eastern region of Donbas was affected by war: so-called separatists backed by Russian military occupied parts of Donbass. Occasional shelling and shooting led to approximately 14,000 victims (people killed) since 2014, many of them children. In 2014/15, 1.5 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) left Crimea and the Russian occupied territories in Donbas and are living in Central and Western Ukraine now., A full-scale military attack (invasion) of Ukraine was started by Russia in the night of February 23/24, 2022. Towns and other targets in all regions of Ukraine have been shelled or attacked with rockets and tanks invaded the country from three directions (north, east and south). Fighting is progressing for two days now and is continuing. Residential buildings have been destroyed and lives have been lost. The situation is extremely unclear. Hundreds of thousands of people started their escape from cities to rural areas or are heading west. A major wave of refugees is expected to arrive in neighboring countries such as Romania and Poland.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-emergency-response-situational-report-01-february-2022

Disappointingly we have seen only vague assurances from Government on how they will support Ukrainian refugees – we must quickly see a concrete plan of action. The Government should immediately relax visa requirements to allow family members of Ukrainians in the UK to join them here. It must also work at pace to establish a safe route so people at risk of persecution can apply for a humanitarian visa to travel to the UK to enable them to claim asylum once here., “It is important to recognise that the Government’s Borders Bill currently going through Parliament flagrantly undermines our obligation to give all those who seek asylum a fair hearing on UK soil by discriminating against refugees depending on how they reach our shores. We urge the Government to rethink this harmful and cruel legislation that would criminalise any Ukrainian who took a dangerous journey over land to the UK.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/situation-ukraine-refugee-council-response

Temperatures in the capital are dropping below freezing, and displaced children may face long nights and days exposed to brutal conditions., The situation is unfolding rapidly, with rising numbers of civilian’s casualties. Some incidents of concern include: shelling in residential areas that injured at least 4 civilians and damaged homes and civilian infrastructure in the Donbas region in Ukraine; Human Rights Watch reported that a school in the region was hit last week, with one of the shells landing in the kindergarten’s area., Rob Williams, War Child CEO said:, Armed conflict always affects children, be it through death, injury, the destruction of schools, hospitals and the inevitable humanitarian crisis created by destruction and chaos. The bombardment of civilian areas leaves children terrified and leaves a long term impact on their mental health., We are deeply concerned for children and their families who may be displaced and in need of humanitarian support. Freezing conditions in Ukraine, have created the harshest conditions for those displaced and going without services due to the conflict., War Child calls on all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities and while hostilities are ongoing, all actors must fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law, including by ensuring that civilians and civilian objects, especially schools and hospitals, are protected from attack. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas risks severe harm to civilians, especially children, and should be avoided at all costs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-child-uks-response-conflict-ukraine

Update 3 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (27 February 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,27 Feb 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that missiles hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv overnight but there were no reports of damage to the building or any indications of a radioactive release, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the IAEA that both its communications with the facility – the Kyiv branch of the State Specialized Enterprise ""Radon"" – and the radiation monitoring system at the site had been restored during the morning. SNRIU said it expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring. Staff at the facility were forced to take shelter during the night but could later assess the situation., The incident came a day after SNRIU said an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been damaged, also without any reports of a radioactive release. Such facilities typically hold disused radioactive sources and other low-level waste from hospitals and industry., “These two incidents highlight the very real risk that facilities with radioactive material will suffer damage during the conflict, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” Director General Grossi said., “Once again, I urgently and strongly appeal to all parties to refrain from any military or other action that could threaten the safety and security of these facilities,” he added., While these disposal sites do not contain high-level radioactive waste, the stored and disposed radioactive waste can still cause a serious radiological impact event, underlining the necessity to protect them, the Director General said. He praised the SNRIU and staff at the affected facilities for their vigilance and courage in ensuring continued safety and security., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors.

Note that due to the current limited access to information from the ground, this report is not comprehensive. 17/02 - a 35 kV powerline was damaged by heavy shelling, near Mayorsk. As a result, the booster pumping station “Mayorsk”, which is located within the compound of the larger 3rd Lift Pumping Station (LPS) of Siverskyi Donets Donbas channel (3rd LPS), was deenergized., 19/02 - In the morning of Saturday 19th, two transformers (10 kVA each) of 1st LPS of South Donbas Water Way were damaged by shelling and stopped. These transformers cannot be repaired. Almost 90,000 people who received water from Velyko-Anadolska Filter Stations are expected to depend on water trucking in Volnovakha rajon. This population is currently accessing water from reservoirs but with a limited capacity for just a few days (depending on how the supply will be scheduled). Cities like Mariupol are similarly shifting to water from reservoirs, which have larger capacity (several months). Pokrovsk is shifting to water from reservoir of untreated water (affecting around 150,000 people). UPD: The transformer was identified in NGCA, but no access to the PS due to intensive shelling. (WASH Cluster IR#294). 19/02 - Same day, Sewerage Pumping station in Novoluhanske, which serves 3,800 people was de-energized because of shelling, and stopped., 21/02: - on 21st February 2022 due to reasons related to shelling in the area, the Donetsk Filter Station (DFS) was de-energized and stopped. Donetsk Filter Station supplies water to around 380,000 people living on both sides of the line of contact. Avdiivka is without water, other settlements were switched to Verkhniokamiuska FS. UPD: damaged cable was identified, VD is ready to re-launch the FS, but there is no access, due to the intensive shelling. (WASH Cluster IR#295). 21/02 – damage and stop functioning of pipeline from GCA to NGCA in Luhanska Oblast, near Zolote village (cutting water supply to 460,000 people).
21/02 – due to shelling, Shastie TPP was de-energized, as a result, Shastie and Stanitsa-Luhanska are without water (26,000 people).
21/02 - two main water pipelines were damaged in Donetsk city. These two pipelines are part of the Northern Water Unit of Voda Donbasa system and supply water to Donetsk city. Because of this incident, 5 rajons receive now reduced amount of water (they currently receive an estimated 30 to 50 % of the original supply). Together with the de-mining brigades, Voda Donbasa (VD) repair team were in the field on 22nd February, while shelling started again. Repair brigades identified a hole in one pipeline and second projectile did damage a pipe, however, it did not explode and is got stuck inside the pipeline, after landing. Update: On 25th one pipe was repaired but due to blast wave, pipe has cracks not far from the damaged place. It will be fixed on 27th if the access allows.
25/02 – Horlivka Central Wastewater Treatment Plant was de-energized and stopped, due to hostilities in the area. 25/02 - After shelling, Sieverskyi Donets Donbass channel was stopped, due to de-energized 3rd Lift Pumping Station. 3rd Lift PS supplies water to 9 filter Stations, around 3 million people in total. All Filter Stations started use water from water reservoirs for 50% of its capacity (scheduled water), in order to have water as long as possible. As an example, Verkhniokalmiuska Filte Station (FS) has 12.5 mln m3 of water and it is enough for approximately one month, Makiivska FS has 9 mln m3., As of 27th of February, 2.7 million people on both sides of the LoC receive water by schedule two times per day, while 124.000 people are without water at all., Voda Donbasa is ready to re-start DFS and First Lift PS of SDWW but cannot receive access to that area because of continuous heavy shelling. Without water source from SDD channel, there will be no improvement of the situation. There is also very intensive heavy shelling around 3rd Lift PS of SDD, so it is unclear when it will be possible to repair that PS. Most affected people are in Avdiivka (34,000 people), 9 settlements in Volnovakha rajon (60,185 people) and in Dokuchaievsk, Yasne, Olenivka in NGCA (29,056 people) who have no current access to safe water supply.

As a result, the booster pumping station “Mayorsk”, which is located within the compound of the larger 3rd Lift Pumping Station (LPS) of Siverskyi Donets Donbas channel (3rd LPS), was deenergized., 19/02 - In the morning of Saturday 19th, two transformers (10 kVA each) of 1st LPS of South Donbas Water Way were damaged by shelling and stopped. These transformers cannot be repaired. Almost 90,000 people who received water from Velyko-Anadolska Filter Stations are expected to depend on water trucking in Volnovakha rajon. This population is currently accessing water from reservoirs but with a limited capacity for just a few days (depending on how the supply will be scheduled). Cities like Mariupol are similarly shifting to water from reservoirs, which have larger capacity (several months). Pokrovsk is shifting to water from reservoir of untreated water (affecting around 150,000 people). UPD: The transformer was identified in NGCA, but no access to the PS due to intensive shelling. (WASH Cluster IR#294). 19/02 - Same day, Sewerage Pumping station in Novoluhanske, which serves 3,800 people was de-energized because of shelling, and stopped., 21/02: - on 21st February 2022 due to reasons related to shelling in the area, the Donetsk Filter Station (DFS) was de-energized and stopped. Donetsk Filter Station supplies water to around 380,000 people living on both sides of the line of contact. Avdiivka is without water, other settlements were switched to Verkhniokamiuska FS. UPD: damaged cable was identified, VD is ready to re-launch the FS, but there is no access, due to the intensive shelling. (WASH Cluster IR#295). 21/02 – damage and stop functioning of pipeline from GCA to NGCA in Luhanska Oblast, near Zolote village (cutting water supply to 460,000 people).
21/02 – due to shelling, Shastie TPP was de-energized, as a result, Shastie and Stanitsa-Luhanska are without water (26,000 people).
21/02 - two main water pipelines were damaged in Donetsk city. These two pipelines are part of the Northern Water Unit of Voda Donbasa system and supply water to Donetsk city. Because of this incident, 5 rajons receive now reduced amount of water (they currently receive an estimated 30 to 50 % of the original supply). Together with the de-mining brigades, Voda Donbasa (VD) repair team were in the field on 22nd February, while shelling started again. Repair brigades identified a hole in one pipeline and second projectile did damage a pipe, however, it did not explode and is got stuck inside the pipeline, after landing. Update: On 25th one pipe was repaired but due to blast wave, pipe has cracks not far from the damaged place. It will be fixed on 27th if the access allows.
25/02 – Horlivka Central Wastewater Treatment Plant was de-energized and stopped, due to hostilities in the area. 25/02 - After shelling, Sieverskyi Donets Donbass channel was stopped, due to de-energized 3rd Lift Pumping Station. 3rd Lift PS supplies water to 9 filter Stations, around 3 million people in total. All Filter Stations started use water from water reservoirs for 50% of its capacity (scheduled water), in order to have water as long as possible. As an example, Verkhniokalmiuska Filte Station (FS) has 12.5 mln m3 of water and it is enough for approximately one month, Makiivska FS has 9 mln m3., As of 27th of February, 2.7 million people on both sides of the LoC receive water by schedule two times per day, while 124.000 people are without water at all., Voda Donbasa is ready to re-start DFS and First Lift PS of SDWW but cannot receive access to that area because of continuous heavy shelling. Without water source from SDD channel, there will be no improvement of the situation. There is also very intensive heavy shelling around 3rd Lift PS of SDD, so it is unclear when it will be possible to repair that PS. Most affected people are in Avdiivka (34,000 people), 9 settlements in Volnovakha rajon (60,185 people) and in Dokuchaievsk, Yasne, Olenivka in NGCA (29,056 people) who have no current access to safe water supply.
In addition to the above list, multiple smaller incidents have occurred. For practical purposes, this report compiles only main incidents.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wash-cluster-flash-update-wash-situation-donetsk-oblast-27022022

UN to launch appeal to fund humanitarian operations in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,26 Feb 2022,"Secretary-General António Guterres has announced that the UN will launch an appeal to fund its humanitarian operations in Ukraine, amid reports on Saturday of casualties and people fleeing their homes to seek safety as Russian military operations in the country intensify., A readout issued by a UN spokesperson said that Mr. Guterres had spoken on the phone earlier in the afternoon with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy., “The Secretary-General conveyed to the President the determination of the United Nations to enhance humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, according to the readout., It added that the UN chief had informed the President that the United Nations would launch on Tuesday an appeal to fund our humanitarian operations in Ukraine., The Secretary-General's phone call and the announcement of a humanitarian appeal follow his decision this past Thursday to release $20 million from the UN emergency relief fund, known as CERF, to meet urgent needs in Ukraine., Lifeline of support, “We and our humanitarian partners are committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need,” he told reporters at the time., The UN chief struck a similar tone of determination speaking to reporters Friday evening after the Russian Federation vetoed a resolution tabled in the Security Council that would have denounced its attacks in Ukraine and called for the withdrawal of all Russian troops., “Especially in a moment like this, it is important to remember that the UN is not just the chamber behind me. It is tens of thousands of women and men around the world... standing, delivering, extending a lifeline of hope,” the Secretary-General said, and stressed that “despite the growing operational challenges, the UN is scaling up the delivery of life-saving support.”, The Secretary-General also announced the appointment of Amin Awad as UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine to lead the coordination of all UN efforts, including its humanitarian response, on both sides of the contact line., Also on Friday, Martin Griffiths, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) echoed the Secretary-General in stressing that UN humanitarians are committed to continue and expand its presence., “We have not left. We are not leaving Ukraine,” he told reporters at UN Headquarters., As people there are “bunkered down,” Mr. Griffiths said that the UN is scaling up its efforts to help meet the needs of those effected, “and we have been doing this for some weeks.”, Fast-deteriorating situation, Meanwhile, also on Saturday, Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, expressed grave concern about the fast-deteriorating situation and ongoing military action in Ukraine., “We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety. Civilian lives and civilian infrastructure must be protected and safeguarded at all times, in line with international humanitarian law,” Mr. Grandi said in a statement, warning that the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating., Accordingly, he said that UNHCR had stepped up its operations and capacity in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. “We remain firmly committed to support all affected populations in Ukraine and countries in the region,” he added.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-launch-appeal-fund-humanitarian-operations-ukraine

Government of Ukraine declares State of Emergency and martial law., As of 5:00 p.m. on 26 February, OHCHR reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 dead. Damage to civilian infrastructure has left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity or water. Hundreds of homes have been damaged or destroyed, while bridges and roads damaged by shelling have left some communities cut off from markets., According to UNHCR, more than 160,000 people have reportedly been internally displaced and over 116,000 have been forced to flee across international borders into neighbouring European countries. Government estimates as many as 5 million refugees in worst-case scenario., UN agencies and humanitarian partners have been forced to suspend operations due to the deteriorating security situation. The UN and its partners maintain their presence across the country and remain committed to staying on the ground and responding to growing humanitarian needs and protection risks once the situation permits., UN has released US$20 million in Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) financing to support the humanitarian response. A Flash Appeal will be launched in the coming days., SITUATION OVERVIEW, After weeks of heightened tensions and escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine, on 24 February, Russian troops entered the country. Major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, spreading widespread fear and panic that forced many people into shelters and subways as air raid sirens rang out in the streets of the capital. Russian troops have quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in other major cities, like Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south-west), Sumy (north), among other major cities in northern, eastern and southern parts of the country, while the pre-existing hostilities in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts have significantly intensified., As tensions escalated, on 23 February, the Government of Ukraine declared an initial 30-day State of Emergency, with the exception of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, where a special security regime has been in place since 2014. The following day, on 24 February, the Government declared martial law and imposed a nightly curfew in Kyiv. The curfew is currently in place from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. In Kyiv, the curfew was put in place until 8:00 a.m. on 28 February 2022. The Ukrainian airspace remains closed as of 24 February, while the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has recommended exercising extreme caution in airspace within 185 km of both the Belarus-Ukraine and Russia-Ukraine borders. NATO has stated that it will not establish a ‘no-fly zone’ over Ukraine., President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has endorsed the rollout of civil-military administrations across all oblasts and decreed a universal mobilization that facilitates the mobilization of conscripts and reservists to support the Armed Forces, banning men between 18 and 60 years old from leaving the country. On 23 February, Ukraine's parliament voted to approve in the first reading a draft law which gives permission to Ukrainians to carry firearms and act in self-defence., Humanitarian impacts, In recent days, the long-standing conflict in eastern Ukraine has escalated, while new hotspots beyond the traditional hotbed of conflict in the Donbas region have emerged across Ukraine. The ongoing conflict continues to have severe human costs, causing a growing number of civilian casualties, interrupting livelihoods and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, including hundreds of homes, water and sanitation infrastructure, schools and health facilities., Between 4:00 a.m. on 24 February and 5:00 p.m. on 26 February, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports that at least 240 civilian casualties, including 64 dead and 176 injured across the country due to aerial and ground attacks, nearly 85 per cent recorded in Government-controlled areas, figures could rise in the coming days. President Zelenskyy announced more than 130 people military personnel were killed and more than 310 others injured after the first day of Russian military operations., Significant infrastructural damage has left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity or water, while bridges and roads damaged by shelling have left communities cut off from markets for food and other basic supplies. The most pressing humanitarian needs are emergency medical services, critical medicines, health supplies and equipment, safe water for drinking and hygiene, and shelter and protection for those displaced from their homes., As conflict intensified in recent days, people began to flee the capital – home to nearly 3 million people – and other conflictaffected areas of Ukraine, internally displacing more than 160,000 people and pushing more than 116,000 to move across borders to neighbouring European countries, including Poland – where border authorities say some 100,000 people have arrived in recent days – Moldova and Romania. While the scale and scope of displacement will only likely become apparent in the coming days and weeks, Ukrainian authorities estimate that as many as 5 million people could flee the country, triggering a refugee crisis that will test response capacities in neighbouring countries., The recent escalation in conflict comes as Ukraine deals with an Omicron-driven surge in COVID-19, which saw active cases increase by a staggering 555 per cent between 15 January and 25 February, a figure that may actually be much higher due to a lack of testing. As increasing numbers of people are displaced, the increased risk of COVID-19 contagion, combined with growing numbers of injured people in need of emergency medical services, will put additional pressure on the country’s already-stretched health system., The current situation is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in the Donbas region and generating new multisectoral needs across the country. Even before the current deterioration in the situation, the prolonged conflict in Ukraine had led to more than 3,000 deaths and more than 7,000 injured, while damaging or destroying approximately 55,000 homes. Around 2.9 million people already required humanitarian assistance, a figure that is expected to rise exponentially as a result of the intensification of armed conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-no-1-500-pm-26-february-2022

We will also continue to work hand in hand with the World Bank Group and other partners to coordinate our support and ensure the maximum benefit for Ukraine., “The Fund has a number of instruments in its toolkit and, as the situation in Ukraine evolves, we will continue to discuss with the authorities how we can best assist them. These discussions are being conducted remotely with staff participating from Washington. In addition to ongoing policy advice, we are exploring all options for further financial support, including under the existing Stand-By Arrangement for an outstanding amount of US$2.2 billion. The authorities have also requested IMF emergency financing., “Beyond Ukraine, the repercussions of the conflict pose significant economic risks in the region and around the world. We are assessing the potential implications, including for the functioning of the financial system, commodity markets, and the direct impact on countries with economic ties to the region. We stand ready to support our members as needed, in close coordination with our international partners.”, IMF Communications Department

Safety and Security",26 Feb 2022,"Even before the recent events that “convulsed the world” last week, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator reminded that an eight-year-long conflict in Eastern Ukraine had already level three million people in need of humanitarian assistance “on both sides of the contact line”., Martin Griffiths, who also serves as the humanitarian affairs chief, told journalists on Friday that the UN and its partners had been responding to that need for these many years., “This year alone, for example, UN coordinated humanitarian convoys delivered over 150 tons of assistance to the most vulnerable people in the non-Government controlled areas in the Donbas,” he said., Ukraine under fire, Women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, those living close to the contact line and those living in the non-Government areas are currently the most in need., “They continue to require food, shelter, health care, water and sanitation and protection,” the senior UN official said., He painted a grim picture of shelling on urban centres across Ukraine and unconfirmed reports of human casualties and damage to residential infrastructure, expressing extreme concern over the impact of the ongoing escalation., “We are concerned about reports of population movement…fleeing in search of safety and protection,” continued Mr. Griffiths, saying that hundreds of thousands of people are “on the move in Ukraine and out of Ukraine, as we speak.”, UN remains in Ukraine, The UN emergency coordinator echoed the Secretary-General in stressing that UN humanitarians are committed to continue and expand its presence., “We have not left.

International humanitarian law is clear: all parties to the conflict have a legal obligation to ensure that military operations are planned and conducted in a way as to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian objects., They must take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injuries and loss of life. Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited, and ICRC therefore strongly urges the parties to avoid the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in populated areas and to avoid locating military objectives within or near such areas., Considering mounting tensions and more arms in the streets, it will also be vital to keep taking steps to ensure law and order is maintained so the civilian population is not placed at further risk., Any disruption to essential services like water, power, health facilities, can cause huge ripple effects. We have seen too many times in conflicts that the use of explosive weapons that have wide area effects can cause death, damage and destruction on a dramatic scale., They leave deadly reminders of their destructive capacity, with unexploded ordnance that do not explode on impact often remaining buried in the ground or amid the rubble, endangering people long after the fighting ends., After a grueling eight years of conflict, the last thing people need is more violence, death, destruction and despair. We call for all states to do everything in their power and influence to avoid escalating a conflict whose cost and consequences for civilian populations outpaces the capacity to protect and assist them."", Note to Editors:, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries., The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014.

Ukraine: Russian Cluster Munition Hits Hospital [EN/RU/DE],News and Press Release,HRW,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"4 Civilians Killed, 10 Wounded, (Berlin) – A Russian ballistic missile carrying a cluster munition struck just outside a hospital in Vuhledar, a town in the Ukrainian government-controlled Donetska region, on February 24, 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. The attack killed four civilians and injured another 10, six of them healthcare workers, and damaged the hospital, an ambulance, and civilian vehicles., Human Rights Watch interviewed separately by phone a doctor and an official from the hospital, known as the Central City Hospital, who gave the names of those who were wounded or killed, and shared photographs of two of the dead. Human Rights Watch also verified photographs posted to social media or sent directly by hospital staff that show damage from the attack, including two dead bodies, and the remnant of the weapon that was apparently used, a 9M79-series Tochka ballistic missile with a 9N123 cluster munition warhead., “This callous attack has killed and injured civilians, and damaged a hospital,” said Steve Goose, arms director of Human Rights Watch. “Russian forces should stop using cluster munitions and end unlawful attacks with weapons that indiscriminately kill and maim.”, An international treaty banning cluster munitions has been adopted because of their widespread indiscriminate effect and long-lasting danger to civilians. Cluster munitions typically explode in the air and send dozens, even hundreds, of small bomblets over an area the size of a football field. Cluster submunitions often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is among the ban treaty’s 110 states parties., On February 24, President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced military operations against Ukraine. Following the announcement, Russian armed forces began air and ground attacks on military installations across Ukraine. The announcement came during an emergency session of the UN Security Council, as tensions between Russia and the Ukrainian government peaked following a months-long build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders., The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces was preceded by President Putin’s signing of decrees recognizing the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DNR”) and “Luhansk People’s Republics” (“LNR”) as independent territories and authorizing troops to occupy those areas on February 21., The hospital’s chief doctor, Natalia Sosyura, described the attack: “I was on the first floor of our two-story building. I heard a loud explosion outside, we ran into the hallway. Luckily, we didn't have many patients. It was around 10:30 in the morning. We all fell to the floor.”, Dr. Sosyura provided the names of four civilians who were killed and said the hospital had treated 10 others for injuries, including six medical workers. An ambulance and three civilian cars were damaged, she said. Human Rights Watch verified two photographs of the damaged cars., Human Rights Watch also spoke to Tetyana Tyurina, head of the Donetska regional administration’s information and communications department, who also said that four civilians were killed and 10 were injured, six of them medical workers. Two of the injured were taken to the Velykonovosilkivska Central Regional Hospital for treatment while the others were treated as outpatients, she said., The civilians killed in the attack, two men and two women, were Maksim Sidorenko, 34; Antonina Sidorenko, 65; Sergei Sivukhin, 56; and Olga Shramko, 50., Human Rights Watch verified two photographs of the immediate aftermath of the attack that circulated on social media and a third that showed a remnant of the ballistic missile that was apparently used. One of these photographs showed two dead bodies partially covered by a tarp outside the hospital entrance and damage to the building and nearby vehicles. Human Rights Watch also received and verified 22 images of the hospital taken on February 25 by hospital staff. These images show damage to the hospital buildings, including smashed windows, and three damaged civilian vehicles., Based on the photograph, Human Rights Watch identified the remnant of the weapon as the nose cone and radar altimeter antenna of a 9N123 cluster munition warhead delivered by a 9M79-series Tochka ballistic missile. The cluster munition warhead contains 50 9N24 fragmentation submunitions. According to the Russian manufacturer, each submunition contains 1.45 kilograms of explosives and shatters into approximately 316 uniform-sized fragments., Photographs taken just after the attack show impact spatters of an apparent submunition detonation in the asphalt near two of the vehicles, uniform-sized fragmentation damage to the hospital building, and the apparently fatal fragmentation injuries to the victims near a submunition detonation that is characteristic of cluster munitions use., Both Russia and Ukraine stockpile the Tochka ballistic missile equipped with a cluster munition warhead., Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed armed groups used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine between July 2014 and February 2015, according to investigations conducted by Human Rights Watch, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission, and others., Human Rights Watch documented the use of the same type of cluster munition in an attack by Russian and Syrian forces on Sarmin, Idlib governorate, in January 2020., “All states party to the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions should unequivocally condemn this attack and any other use of his horrid weapon,” Goose said. “The risks to civilians are intolerably high.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-cluster-munition-hits-hospital-enrude

"Security Council Fails to Adopt Draft Resolution on Ending Ukraine Crisis, as Russian Federation Wields Veto",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"SC/14808, SECURITY COUNCIL
8979TH MEETING (PM), Kyiv’s Permanent Representative Tells Council President, ‘Your Words Have Less Value Than a Hole in a New York Pretzel’, Meeting today amid the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, the Security Council rejected a draft resolution intended to end the Russian Federation’s military offensive against that neighbouring State., The draft, submitted by Albania and the United States, garnered support from 11 members but was vetoed by the Russian Federation. China, India and the United Arab Emirates all abstained., Also by the draft, the 15-member Council would have deplored, in the strongest terms, the Russian Federation’s aggression as being in violation of Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter of the United Nations — an obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State., The draft would also have the Council decide that the Russian Federation should immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine, and withdraw all its military forces immediately, completely, and unconditionally from that country’s territory., Similarly, the draft would have the Council deplore the Russian Federation’s 21 February decision related to the status of certain areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and decide that Moscow must immediately and unconditionally reverse that decision as it violates Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity., By other terms of the draft, the Council would have called upon the parties to abide by the Minsk agreements and to work constructively in relevant international frameworks, including the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russian Federation) and the Trilateral Contact Group (Ukraine, Russian Federation, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE))., In addition, the Council would have called upon all parties to allow and facilitate the rapid, safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those in need, to protect civilians, including humanitarian personnel, and persons in vulnerable situations, including children., The Council would also have urged continued efforts by the Secretary-General, Member States, OSCE and other international and regional organizations, to support de-escalation in the current situation, as well as United Nations efforts to respond to the humanitarian and refugee crisis created by the Russian Federation’s aggression., Today’s vote followed two late-night emergency meetings on the situation in Ukraine, on 21 and 23 February. The Russian Federation announced a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine while the second emergency meeting was in session. (See Press Releases SC/14798 of 21 February and SC/14803 of 23 February.), Speaking before the vote, the representative of the United States said her country and Albania proposed the draft resolution to hold the Russian Federation accountable. Council members should vote “yes” if they believe in upholding the Charter and supporting Ukraine’s or any State’s sovereignty, and otherwise vote “no” or abstain if they do not, she added., Albania’s delegate stated that today will be long remembered as future generations will see who stood up for respecting human life and international law, and who did not., Following the vote, the Russian Federation’s delegate explained that his delegation voted against the draft, as it contravenes the interests of the Ukrainian people — who have experienced a tragedy over the last eight years. He said the negative vote is due to what was left out of the text: that those who seized power in the coup d’état of 2014 have shelled the people of Donetsk and Luhansk; that Ukraine did not implement the Minsk agreements; and that neo-Nazis and militias continue to kill civilians, adding to such blood-chilling crimes as sniper attacks on protestors in the Maidan. How can there be a resolution without such issues? he asked., He went on to emphasize that his country’s troops are not bombing cities nor targeting civilians. Noting the difficulty of competing with the United States, which excels in the number of invasions it has undertaken, he said Washington, D.C., is in no position to moralize. Moscow’s objectives will soon be achieved and the citizens of Ukraine will be able to determine their future, he added., The United Kingdom’s delegate noted that whereas a large majority of Council members voted in favour of a draft resolution aimed at stopping war, the text was not adopted because of a single veto by a permanent member who perpetrated that conflict. That country’s claim that its invasion is in self-defence is “absurd”, she said., China’s representative said he abstained because the Council’s response should be taken with great caution, with actions to defuse and not add fuel to the fire. Ukraine should be a bridge between the East and the West, not an outpost for major Powers, he added., Ukraine’s representative, thanking those who supported the draft resolution, recalled multiple instances when his Russian counterpart denied intention of invasion, adding: “Your words have less value than a hole in a New York pretzel.” He argued that the Russian Federation’s presidency violates Rule 20 of the Council’s Provisional Rules of Procedure as that delegation cannot preside over an issue directly connected to its State. He went on to emphasize that nothing justifies today’s shelling of a kindergarten and an orphanage. War crimes and violations of the Rome Statute will be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, he added., He deplored that what may stop the war will unfortunately be the bodies of thousands of Russian soldiers delivered home to their mothers, he continued, pointing out that thousands of Ukrainians have joined the territorial defence force — proof that the country will never surrender, even if temporarily occupied., Also speaking today were the representatives of Gabon, Mexico, Brazil, India, Norway, Ireland, France, Ghana, United Arab Emirates and Kenya., The meeting began at 5:10 p.m. and ended at 6:59 p.m., Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), speaking in explanation of position before the vote, said the Council was meeting because of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and unconscionable war on Ukraine — a war of choice. Moscow chose to invade its neighbour, inflicting untold suffering on Ukraine’s people and its own citizens, while violating that country’s sovereignty, international law and the Charter of the United Nations, she pointed out. Noting that people are fleeing for their lives from Kyiv and Kharkiv with only the belongings in their backpacks, she said they are turning subway stations into bomb shelters. There have been attacks on kindergartens and newborns are being taken to intensive care, she added, describing scenes of fathers sobbing as they send their children away while they stay behind to defend their country. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), she noted, 50,000 people have fled in less than 48 hours, while citizens in the Russian Federation protest against President Vladimir Putin., Recalling that the Council was created to prevent exactly this kind of aggression, she emphasized: “We have a solemn obligation to not look away.” Ukrainians experiencing the horrors of war will need food, water, shelter and medical aid. She went on to state that the United States and Albania proposed the draft resolution holding the Russian Federation to account, affirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and demanding that Moscow immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraws its forces. She noted that many States are taking other actions to impose upon the Russian Federation severe and immediate economic costs, financial sanctions and export controls to cut off access to vital technological input, as well as to curb its strategic ambitions to exert influence on the world stage., Noting that the President of the United States announced sanctions against President Putin, Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov, and other government members, she declared: “History will judge us for our actions, or lack thereof.” Describing the notion that all parties are culpable as “a clear cop-out”, she stressed that the Russian Federation is the aggressor, and there is no middle ground. As for the idea that a special history between the Russian Federation and Ukraine justifies Moscow’s action, she said: “Think about who might be next”, pointing out President Putin just threatened Finland and Sweden with military and political repercussions. She called upon Council members to vote “yes” if they believe in upholding the Charter, in supporting Ukraine’s or any State’s right to sovereignty, and in holding the Russian Federation to account, and to vote “no” or abstain if they do not., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), endorsing the statement delivered by the representative of the United States, said that, as the Council meets, Ukraine is being bombed and its people killed. A European country is being destroyed by its more powerful neighbour, which has decided it wants to turn the historical clock backwards, he added. A permanent member of the Council, he emphasized, has decided to rule and inflict death and untold pain, “staining the Charter of the United Nations with innocent blood” and burying it under the rubble of Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Underscoring that “it is not too late to stop this madness”, he said today’s resolution calls upon the Russian Federation to cease its aggression, withdraw its forces, abide by the Minsk agreement and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to a number in need that is growing by the hour in Ukraine. “This is the minimum we can do,” he added, stressing: “We owe it to Ukraine, its people and the world.” He went on to state that today will be long remembered, as future generations will see who stood up for respecting human life and international law, and who did not., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), citing the text of the United Nations Charter, underlined its fundamental purpose: to protect people from violence and conflict. Noting that civilians all over Ukraine are currently sheltering from the Russian Federation’s military onslaught, she recalled that Moscow first claimed that the controversy around Ukraine was a result of “Western hysteria”, then it was about Donetsk and Luhansk. “Now, they are bombing Kyiv,” she said, pointing out that Ukraine is being attacked on all fronts as the world witnesses “dreadful images of tanks crushing civilians in the capital”. The rules-based international order must be defended, she emphasized. “Otherwise, who might be next?” Praising the brave Russian citizens protesting their country’s aggression, she said it is clear that President Putin has launched a massive offensive to remove the Government of Ukraine and subjugate its people. “No fog of war is thick enough to obscure a truth this clear,” she stressed, condemning “this unprovoked, unjustified war”., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said the Security Council finds itself face to face with its responsibility to reaffirm the very principles that undergird its existence. Recalling that the United Nations was founded on the ashes of war, and that its main aim is to prevent any act of belligerence, he emphasized that the world needs neither war nor any new sources of fear. Describing the traumas of war as devastating and irreparable, he said Gabon is wedded to peace and the principles of the Charter and condemns the war against a Member of the United Nations. The international community is called upon to seize this momentum, he said, stressing that throughout the world, any war of choice, war of hegemony, or any war, is dehumanizing. “The international stage should not be the reflection of a jungle where nations are either predators or prey.” Reiterating calls for an immediate ceasefire and for de-escalation, he said the belligerents should not hinder humanitarian aid to those in need. The responsibilities assumed today should always be reflected in the renewal of the international community’s commitments to save present and succeeding generations from the scourge of war, he added., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), explaining his delegation’s intention to vote in favour of the draft resolution, said the current aggression violates the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX). He recalled the invasions of his country by the United States and France, noting that it lost a large part of its territory. Mexico rejects the use of force, he said, emphasizing that its foreign policy is based on peace, founded on the Charter. Condemning the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, he called on the parties to end hostilities., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said the Council should strive to demonstrate united resolve in seeking agreement on the Ukraine crisis, with the priority being to stop the ongoing hostilities. It must react swiftly on the use of force against the territorial integrity of a Member State and setting the conditions for dialogue, he said, cautioning that threats and force will not lead to a lasting settlement of the crisis. The Council’s mission is not over, he emphasized, adding: “If our efforts have so far failed to prevent a war, we should strive to restore peace to Ukraine; there is no alternative to negotiation to solve the present crisis.” Recalling the Russian Federation’s previously stated concerns about the strategic balance in Europe, he said that does not give Moscow the right to do what it is doing now. In the end, peace and international order must prevail, he said, stressing “we will not rest” until that mission is accomplished., The Council then rejected the text by a vote of 1 against (Russian Federation) to 11 in favour, with 3 abstentions (China, India, United Arab Emirates)., Mr. HOXHA (Albania) expressed regret that the Russian Federation’s representative wielded the veto. The text was blocked, but this is not the end of efforts to stop Moscow’s aggression, he said, adding that his delegation continues to condemn it. History shows no country can kill freedom, he emphasized, pledging that Albania stands ready to shelter Ukrainians fleeing to safety., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that, unsurprisingly, the Russian Federation used veto power to defend its unconscionable aggression. “Let me be clear,” she said, “you can veto the resolution” — but not Member States’ voices, the truth, or principles, nor can it veto the Charter or the principle of accountability. Responsible Council member States will stand with Ukraine despite a reckless and irresponsible permanent member abusing its power to attack its neighbour and subvert the Charter, she emphasized, noting that the matter will be addressed in the General Assembly, where the Russian Federation’s veto does not apply. She recalled that President Biden spoke with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, to commend the tremendous courage shown by the Ukrainian people, and to underline ongoing multilevel support. She went on to commend people in the Russian Federation protesting the war despite grave risks to their personal safety. “As we move forward, I hope more Member States take their cues from this courage and honour all of this bravery with more of our own,” she said., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) said his delegation is disturbed by developments in Ukraine and called for efforts be made to ensure an immediate cessation of hostilities. He also expressed concern about the welfare and security of Ukraine’s Indian community. Noting that the contemporary global order is built on the United Nations Charter, international law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, he said that, as such, all Member States must honour those principles in seeking a way forward. Dialogue is the only way to settle disputes, he emphasized, expressing regret that diplomacy was abandoned and calling for a return to that path. It was for those reasons that India chose to abstain from today’s vote., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), speaking after the vote, said that a large majority of the Council voted in favour of a resolution aimed at stopping war; however, it was not adopted because of a single veto by a permanent member who perpetrated that conflict. While the Russian Federation claims its invasion is in self-defence, she stressed, “This is absurd. Its only act of self-defence is the vote they’ve cast against the resolution.” She went on to state that the Russian Federation is isolated and has received no support for its invasion of Ukraine. “History will record how we voted, and which countries stood up to be counted in defence of the United Nations Charter,” she said. The United Kingdom stands steadfast in support of the Ukrainian people and will hold the Russian Federation accountable for this aggression., MONA JUUL (Norway), speaking after the vote, said she voted in favour of the draft resolution, and expressed deep regret about the Russian Federation’s veto, stating that a veto cast by the aggressor undermines the purpose of the Security Council, to prevent and end acts of aggression. It is a violation of the very foundation of the United Nations Charter. Further, she pointed out that the Russian Federation, as a party, should have abstained from voting on this draft resolution. Recalling the sight of the “shocking first images” on 23 February of “what now amounts to a full-scale Russian invasion of a free and independent United Nations Member State”, she said Moscow’s aggression — with its tanks, missiles, bombs, planes, warships and cyberattacks — violates the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine and constitutes a serious breach to international peace and security. Norway insists that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally stop all fighting and withdraw all forces from the territory of Ukraine and expresses full solidarity with the Ukrainian people in the face of this aggression. She expressed deep concern about the protracted harm to civilians caused by the warfare, which is unfolding in and around urban areas. She also condemned Belarus for facilitating the attack. Norway will join its allies and partners in swift and concrete countermeasures, including the intensified sanctions of the European Union., JIM KELLY (Ireland), speaking after the vote, said his country voted in favour of the draft resolution in response to the flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, of international law and of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Moscow has turned its back on diplomacy, spurning genuine offers of dialogue and rejecting repeated calls from the international community for de-escalation. “It has launched an unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine; an attack that continues today to rain death and destruction on Ukraine and its people,” he said, condemning such actions and expressing full solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Noting that the Council has a responsibility to act in the face of conflict, to protect international peace and security and to uphold the principles the world agreed upon in response to the utter devastation of the Second World War, he stressed that Ireland was prevented from discharging this responsibility today, despite the clear and declared will of a majority of this Council’s members. Expressing deep regret for the Russian Federation’s use of the veto, which he called “an anachronism”, he said its use in “blatant defence of military aggression is reprehensible”. Ireland strongly supports the comprehensive sanctions announced by the European Union on 24 February and stands ready to support further measures if Moscow does not reverse course. Calling the unfolding horror in recent days a tragedy for the people of Ukraine and a nightmare for Europe, he stressed: “Only dialogue and diplomacy offer escape from those nightmares.”, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said no Council member supports the Russian Federation’s current actions in Ukraine. Regarding the vote on the resolution, he condemned the Russian Federation’s use of the veto. Indeed, “the Russian Federation is alone”, riding roughshod over its responsibilities to the Council and violating the United Nations Charter, he said, adding that France and its partners will continue to cooperate in its support for Ukraine., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said his delegation voted in favour of the text because it is a minimum duty his country owes to the United Nations Charter. The Russian Federation breached Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter. It also threatened the global order and the balance of peace and security, he stressed, calling on Moscow to withdraw its forces and recommit to dialogue. The Russian Federation had explained that its military build-up along the border with Ukraine was a normal military exercise, and the country had no intention of crossing the border. Now, the whole world knows better. The Russian Federation breached trust, which is crucial for diplomacy. Ghana is deeply disappointed by the actions of a permanent member — a guardian of peace and security — which bears not only a special privilege but also a special responsibility., Mr. COSTA FILHO (Brazil) expressed regret that the Council was unable to react to an ongoing breach of international peace and security. During negotiations, Brazil favoured a text that could be agreed upon by all parties while sending a message to save the world from a war of wide proportions. However, framing the current use of force as an act of aggression — a precedent seldom used in the Council — signals its gravity, but may also downplay other times when acts upon Member States see no similar reaction. Under the current circumstances, not even a different text could have seen the Council fulfil its responsibility, he said, warning that the body’s paralysis when world peace is at stake can ultimately lead to its irrelevance when it is most needed in the future., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates), noting that her country has consistently called for de-escalation and dialogue throughout this crisis, emphasized the importance of ensuring that humanitarian assistance reaches those in need, and called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law. Every Member State has the right to security, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. As a Middle Eastern country, the United Arab Emirates is aware of the critical importance of ensuring a regional security environment based on de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue. She expressed support for the draft resolution’s emphasis on the need to adhere to international law and the Charter of the United Nations, which must be the basis for resumed dialogue and the path forward now that the text has not been adopted. While noting that “the results of the vote were a foregone conclusion”, she stressed that avenues for dialogue and diplomacy must remain open., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), speaking after the vote, said his country voted in favour of the resolution to affirm Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, as it opposed the breaching of a Member State’s sovereignty. As Kenya voted, he said, its heart was heavy with sympathy for the people of Ukraine. It also bore in mind past interventions by States, which led to terrible turmoil, including the hasty, ill-considered intervention in Libya 10 years ago, which did not lead to peace and safety, but rather unleashed terror, including in countries to the south of that country. Without urgent leadership pushing in the opposite direction, today’s action leaves the fabric of the United Nations Charter “torn and trampled”, he stressed, adding: “If the United Nations Charter could speak for itself, it would vote for the resolution […], and it would remind all members of the Council — and the United Nations — that it contains tools for the pacific settlement of their disputes by negotiation” and other peaceful means. He expressed deep regret that the Council today failed to stop the infringement of the sovereignty of a Member State of the United Nations., ZHANG JUN (China) expressed deep concern over the situation in Ukraine. “China always forms its own position on the basis of the merits of the matter at hand”, he said, noting that it respects the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and the Charter of the United Nations. Parties should address concerns through peaceful means, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In the past week, the Security Council has held two emergency meetings and all parties have elaborated their positions and concerns on the current situation. Faced with a complex situation, the Council should make a necessary response. That response should be taken with great caution, with actions that defuse, not add fuel. As such, China abstained from the vote, he said, stressing that the issue of Ukraine is not one that emerged today; nor did the current situation emerge suddenly overnight. Rather, it represents the interplay of various factors over a long period of time. Stressing that the security of one country cannot come at the cost of that of another, he said Ukraine should be a bridge between the East and the West, not an “outpost for major Powers”. He urged all parties to engage in dialogue and consultation for a comprehensive settlement of the Ukraine issue., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), Council President for February, explained in his national capacity his delegation’s vote against the resolution. Emphasizing that the resolution runs counter to the interests of the Ukrainian people — who have experienced a tragedy over the last eight years — he said the negative vote is due to what was left out of the text: that those who seized power in the coup of 2014 had shelled the people of Donetsk and Luhansk; that Ukraine, with the West’s support, did not implement the Minsk agreements; and that neo-Nazis and militias continue to kill civilians, adding to such blood-chilling crimes as sniper attacks on Maidan protestors. How can there be a resolution without such issues, he wondered, adding that Western partners have issued a carte blanche to Kyiv to attack the Russian language. The authorities have been murdering political opponents and shuttering media outlets, making Ukraine a pawn in their game. The responsibility lies with the Government of Ukraine, “but also lies at your feet”, he said, noting that the resolution is yet another brutal move on the chess board., Urging neighbours not to yield to provocation, he recalled that President Vladimir Putin said strikes would not target civilians. Actors, however, are using civilians as human shields and are using rocket launchers, violating the Geneva Conventions. Indeed, the situation is being exploited by political and media outlets, he said, citing examples of the “height of propaganda”, including the misuse of images from Donbas as demonstrations of Russian aggression. In this vein, he pointed to the British Broadcasting Corporation, which had published an article revealing that many images were being misused. Responding to statements by his counterparts from France, the United Kingdom and the United States, he said the Russian Federation’s troops are not bombing cities nor targeting civilians. Noting the difficulty of competing with the United States in terms of the number of its invasions, he said Washington, D.C., is in no position to moralize. The objectives will soon be achieved, and the citizens will be able to determine their future, he said., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) took the floor for a third time to acknowledge the text’s co-sponsors whose names were left out in the initial announcement., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said he would not dignify the Russian Federation delegate’s diabolical script as anything more than “a letter of application for an upscale seat in hell”. Instead, he thanked the parents of every ambassador present in the Council, and the people of democratic nations who put them in their seats, who should be proud of those who voted in favour of the resolution. The draft recalled the obligation of all States under Article 2 of the Charter to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or independence of any State and called on the Russian Federation to halt the aggression., Recalling the 23 February emergency Council session, during which Moscow launched deadly air strikes and crossed the border into Ukraine, also launching missiles from Belarus, he stressed that “last night was the most horrific for Kyiv since 1941”. Despite claims to fight neo-Nazism, the Russian Federation seems keen on a Nazi-style course of action. Recalling multiple instances when that representative said there would be no invasion, he charged: “your words have less value than a hole in a New York pretzel”. The Russian Federation’s presidency of the Council for February violates Rule 20 of its Provisional Rules of Procedure, he noted, as that delegate cannot preside during an issue directly connected to his State. Given the lack of adherence to the rules of order, he would also “be unruly”, he said, asking the Council to dedicate a moment of complete silence, in prayer or meditation, for the souls of those who have been or may be killed, inviting the Russian Federation delegate to pray for salvation., The representative of the Russian Federation asked the Council to also pray for those who had perished in Donbas., Mr. KYSLYTSYA of Ukraine continued that he was saddened to see a small handful of delegates tolerating the war, as they should oppose it to protect their own nationals in that country. Nothing justifies today’s shelling of a kindergarten and orphanage — war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute, which will be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. He further cited the deliberate shelling of a Moldovan-flagged chemical vessel with its own Russian crew, as well as a Panamanian-flagged vessel, and the seizure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site, detaining its staff. Control levels of gamma radiation in the exclusion zone have already been exceeded., With 140 killed and over 300 wounded on the Ukrainian side since midnight, he warned there will be no hospitality for Russian troops on its territory. Referring to the delegate’s reading of the Charter as “lunacy”, he cautioned that what may stop the war, unfortunately, will be the bodies of thousands of Russian soldiers delivered home to their mothers. Thousands of Ukrainians have joined the territorial defence forces, proof the country will never surrender even if temporarily occupied. Calling for an end to the harassment of the Secretary-General and respect for the institution, he said Ukraine remains open for negotiations, “but do not put words in our mouths.” He referred to Moscow’s call on Ukrainian forces to remove that Government as “crazy”, stating: “It is so painful to think about what your family thinks of you, when you lie every day.”, Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), Council President for February, re-taking the floor in his national capacity, while noting that there is much on which to comment following the statement by the representative of Ukraine, said he would “leave the boorishness” on the latter’s conscience. He also pointed out that units of a Russian paratrooper division took control of the area surrounding the Chernobyl power plant on 24 February. The Russian Federation “does not want Ukraine to generate a dirty bomb”, he said, and personnel are monitoring the radioactive situation. He went on to recall that the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that the level of radiation at the power plant is low and does not pose a threat to the population., For information media.

Update 2 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (26 February 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,26 Feb 2022,"Ukraine today informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the country’s nuclear power plants remained stable and in normal operation, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, reiterating the necessity to avoid any action that could risk their safety or security., In a new update to the IAEA, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) also said its staff maintained regular contacts with the plants. Ukraine has four nuclear power sites with a total of 15 reactors, providing roughly half of its electricity., Director General Grossi said he continued to be gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine and he called on all parties to refrain from any measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear material, and the safe operation of all nuclear facilities, as any such incident could have severe consequences for human health and the environment., ""The safety and security of nuclear sites and material in Ukraine must under no circumstances be endangered. For now, the plants are operating as normal and their nuclear material remains under control. It is of paramount importance that this continues to be the case and that plant staff remain able to carry out their vital work without any undue pressure or stress,” Director General Grossi said., Ukraine has previously informed the IAEA that Russian forces have taken control of the facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP (Nuclear Power Plant), located within the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. The regulator said in an update this morning that the site continued to operate normally. However, the regulator also said that the staff on duty had not changed since 24 February. Director General Grossi said the operations of the zone’s nuclear facilities should not be affected or disrupted in any way and that staff must be able to work and rest as normal. He called upon those in effective control of nuclear facilities not to take any actions that could compromise their safety., On Friday, the regulator reported elevated radiation levels at the Chornobyl site, possibly caused by heavy military vehicles churning up contaminated soil, but the IAEA assessed that the radiation readings remained low and did not pose any danger to the public. No further radiation data from the Exclusion Zone has been received., Near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the SNRIU said an electrical transformer at a low-level radioactive waste disposal site had been damaged, but no release of radioactive material was reported. The Director General indicated this should be a clear and cautionary indication of the compelling need to avoid endangering the safety of any nuclear facility., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear reactors. The IAEA remains in constant contact with its counterpart and will provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-2-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-26-february-2022-enru
A humanitarian catastrophe looms in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Mercy Corps,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"By CRAIG REDMOND
Senior Vice President of Programs, Mercy Corps, We are deeply concerned about the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine and surrounding area which is now unfolding, and threatening many lives and livelihoods. We see risks of food shortages and huge numbers of women, men, and children forced to flee from their homes. The destruction of infrastructure like hospitals and health services could lead to a rapid spread of diseases, including COVID‑19., Mercy Corps provided humanitarian assistance in Ukraine following the 2014 conflict, helping over 200,000 people with emergency cash, food, water, and sanitation supplies. We helped restore war-damaged homes, and provided small business grants and training to help people rebuild their lives and support themselves and their families., Right now, Mercy Corps is mobilizing a team to the region to assess where help is most needed. Here’s what we know:, 2.9 million Ukrainians were already in need of urgent humanitarian assistance prior to the current escalation of conflict, and at least 1.5 million are displaced within their country., As the conflict expands across Ukraine, we anticipate a large-scale humanitarian crisis for the country, beyond the scope of aid operations currently there., We’re particularly concerned about the elderly, who make up one-third of people in need of assistance, and people with disabilities. We’ve seen these populations at risk in other areas of conflict around the world., The current conflict has already initiated large-scale displacement, and could lead to the displacement of millions of civilians who will need basic services and support after fleeing for safety within Ukraine and to neighboring countries. As the crisis in Ukraine escalates by the hour, every effort must be made to minimize a humanitarian catastrophe and protect those most at risk. We will keep our supporters informed on this rapidly changing situation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-catastrophe-looms-ukraine

Ukraine crisis: Terrified families seek shelter underground in capital [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"Amid reported deadly missile attacks from Russia’s so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, including the capital Kiev and other cities, terrified families have been forced to seek shelter underground, the UN said on Friday, adding that at least 100,000 people have likely been displaced by the violence., “There have been major attacks in Kiev that have created greater fear and panic among the population, with families really scared, moving alongside their children into subways and shelters, and this is clearly a terrifying moment for children across the country,” said Afshan Khan, UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Regional Director, Europe and Central Asia, speaking in Geneva., Wrong but ‘not irreversible’, The development follows renewed condemnation for the Russian move by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who on Thursday appealed for peace and allocated $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to meet urgent needs., The use of force by one country against another is “the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold,” which applied to the military offensive in Ukraine, Mr. Guterres insisted., “It is wrong. It is against the Charter. It is unacceptable. But it is not irreversible.”, Civilian deaths confirmed, Two days since Russia launched military operations inside Ukraine, the UN rights office, OHCHR, confirmed that confirmed that many civilians have already been killed and injured., “We’ve received reports of at least 127 civilian casualties; this includes 25 killed and 102 injured in Ukraine, caused by shelling and airstrikes…this is very likely to be an underestimate,” said Ravina Shamdasani, OHCHR spokesperson., Communities are already in need of aid relief, too, UN humanitarians warned., Fuel, cash, medical supply shortages, “When we look at shortages, we’re talking about fuel, which has been well reported in the media, we’re talking about cash, because often in humanitarian situations, cash assistance would be our first support to families, so obviously there’s been a drawdown on banks,” said UNICEF’s Ms. Khan., Echoing that message and in an appeal for guaranteed humanitarian access to the most vulnerable individuals, the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted concerns that medical teams face being overwhelmed., “We don’t have reports yet from the hospitals, when we look to particular injuries and the details of medical,” said Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine., “Where our focus has been now, is that the prepositioned medical kits. We will run out of them soon, so what is important currently...is how to ensure new supplies to come and...[that] there are humanitarian corridors from the neighbouring countries available.”, Priority needs, UN agencies have been active in Ukraine for many years, particularly since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 – a move in large part rejected by the international community., Immediate priorities include assessing what already vulnerable communities need in eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and other oblasts., “We are still trying to monitor what the situation is vis-à-vis civilian infrastructure,” said UNICEF’s Ms. Khan., “As you know, there has been hits of critical infrastructure in the east, particularly in Donbass for some years and they have been cut off, hence the UNICEF water trucking [operations]. In the current scenario we are still trying to see which civilian infrastructure has been hit [and] where.”, Announcing the $20 million emergency funding allocation for the Ukraine crisis, Mr. Guterres underscored that the UN and its humanitarian partners are “committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need.”, Lives shattered, Forced mass displacement has also begun, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) confirmed., “There are more than 100,000 who we estimate have lost their homes and are displaced inside [the] country and we are also aware of several thousand who have crossed international borders in the region, and we’ve seen those really just happening since the onset of the situation,” said UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo., “We’re seeing these reports and we’ve seen for instance yesterday that there were about 5,000 refugee arrivals in Moldova already, but the other movements are being reported in Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Russian Federation.”, Russian protesters warned off, While the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) warned that Ukraine’s people were “terrified of further escalation,"" agency spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani flagged concerns inside of Russia., “Reportedly more than 1,800 were arrested...it’s impossible at this point to know to know exactly how many people there were,” Ms. Shamdasani said referring to anti-war protesters., “It is unclear whether some of them have now been released. What we understand is that among those who were arrested were also some journalists, and they were arrested in over 50 cities across Russia.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-terrified-families-seek-shelter-underground-capital-enru
Ukraine: We’re preparing for large flows of displaced people,News and Press Release,NRC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"“Thousands of desperate people are now being forced to flee. Our colleagues in eastern Ukraine have seen that many are now fleeing to the west. We expect that the vast majority will be displaced inside Ukraine, but we also expect that hundreds of thousands of people will seek protection in neighbouring countries, if the conflict continues to escalate,” says Tiril Skarstein, who leads NRC’s media team. She recently visited the eastern regions of Ukraine. Even before the recent Russian military offensive the conflict had led to the deaths of over 3,000 civilians since 2014, with more than 7,000 injured. Over 50,000 houses had also been completely or partially destroyed., Forced to flee, “Even before Russia’s military offensive almost one million people were displaced within Ukraine after eight years of conflict – and many are now being forced to flee for a second time,” says Skarstein., Skarstein emphasises that if the conflict continues, it could lead to a major crisis., “If the conflict continues, we expect a major humanitarian crisis within Ukraine. Millions of people will be affected, and many will be forced to flee within the country and need emergency aid,” she says., “We must remember, however, that this is a conflict that is taking place within Europe and in an area with relatively resourceful neighbouring countries. Even if millions of people were to be displaced, neighbouring countries – with the support of the rest of the EU and Europe – should be able to handle the refugees in an effective way.”, Help for the most vulnerable, The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) has been present in Ukraine since 2014, helping more than 700,000 people with food, shelter, water, sanitation and legal aid., Read more about our work in Ukraine., “Our colleagues on the ground are now planning how we can step up our relief work and meet the increased humanitarian needs. There will be a need for food, water and shelter. Preliminary reports show that the markets in Ukraine are still functioning, and we will therefore focus on reaching out with financial support to the most vulnerable families, so that they can secure for themselves what they most need in the face of the current crisis,” says Skarstein.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-we-re-preparing-large-flows-displaced-people

Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams in Ukraine are deeply worried about the consequences of the conflict for Ukrainian people and communities. We see on the roads that tens of thousands of people are frightened and on the move., The drastic change in context means we have had to take the painful decision to halt our activities in the country. These included care for people living with HIV in Severodonetsk; care for patients with tuberculosis in Zhytomyr; and improving access to healthcare access in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, where we have been providing much-needed healthcare, including for mental health, to conflict-affected communities., Although these programmes have now mostly stopped, we did all we could to ensure some continuity of care for our patients. The needs were already high, as people had been living through more than seven years of conflict. We are worried about the impact prolonged fighting could have on patients, many of whom are elderly and suffer from chronic diseases., Immediately before the escalation of tensions, we were in contact with several hospitals in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts (provinces) to provide training in emergency medicine and surgical preparedness. Yesterday, our team provided one mass casualty kit to a hospital in Mariupol.

We are looking to send teams to other neighbouring countries to be ready on standby, either for response in Ukraine or to provide humanitarian medical assistance to refugees seeking asylum abroad.

Ukraine: 5 ways to talk to children about conflict,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"LONDON, 25 February 2022 – As hostilities in Ukraine escalate, children may see and hear things about the crisis in the news, leading to feelings of uncertainty, anxiety and fear, which parents and caregivers need to address, Save the Children’s psychologists warn., Ane Lemche, a psychologist and child counsellor with Save the Children, said children around the world might not fully understand what is happening in Ukraine and may have questions about the images, stories, and conversations they are exposed to., Previous Save the Children research in conflicts such as Iraq and Syria has revealed heartbreaking accounts of children terrified by the shelling and airstrikes, anxious about the future, and distraught at not being able to go to school. The majority of children showed signs of severe emotional distress., “What is happening in Ukraine can be frightening for both children and adults. Ignoring or avoiding the topic can lead to children feeling lost, alone and more scared, which can affect their health and wellbeing. It is essential to have open and honest conversations with children to help them process what is happening,” said Ms. Lemche., Experts at Save the Children share five tools and tips that caregivers can use to approach the conversation with children:, 1. Make time and listen when your child wants to talk, Give children the space to tell you what they know, how they feel and to ask you questions. They may have formed a completely different picture of the situation than you have. Take the time to listen to what they think, and what they have seen or heard., 2. Tailor the conversation to the child, Be mindful of the child’s age as you approach the conversation with them. Young children may not understand what conflict or war means and require an age-appropriate explanation. Be careful not to over-explain the situation or go into too much detail as this can make children unnecessarily anxious. Younger children may be satisfied just by understanding that sometimes countries fight. Older children are more likely to understand what war means but may still benefit from talking with you about the situation. In fact, older children will often be more concerned by talk of war because they tend to understand the dangers better than younger children do., 3. Validate their feelings, It is important that children feel supported in the conversation. They should not feel judged or have their concerns dismissed. When children have the chance to have an open and honest conversation about things upsetting them, it can create a sense of relief and safety., 4. Reassure them that adults all over the world are working hard to resolve this, Remind children that this is not their problem to solve. They should not feel guilty about playing, seeing their friends, and doing the things that make them happy. Stay calm when you approach the conversation. Children often copy the sentiments of their caregivers – if you are uneasy about the situation, chances are your child will be uneasy as well., 5. Give them a practical way to help, Support children who want to help. Children who have the opportunity to help those affected by the conflict can feel like they are part of the solution. Children can create fundraisers, send letters to local decision-makers or create drawings calling for peace., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting access to education, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families. Our specialists support children to overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their ability to cope with stress in their daily lives., ENDS, *******************************************************************************************************************, For further enquiries please contact:, Sam Halyk Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org / +44(0)74235 19077, We have child psychologists available to spokesperson., Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-5-ways-talk-children-about-conflict

The extent of the humanitarian disaster is difficult to predict., ""The world is now faced with the unthinkable. Yesterday's dramatic escalation of hostilities is having catastrophic consequences for the people of Ukraine, not to mention wider regional implications.

MOAS Launches Humanitarian Relief Effort for Ukraine,News and Press Release,MOAS,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"MOAS announces the launch of a new humanitarian program designed to bring medical relief and first response services to civilians affected by the escalating violence in Ukraine. From 25th February 2022 MOAS has representatives present in the field and is working to deploy Mobile Medical Teams to the crisis-affected region, alongside ambulance services and pharmaceutical aid. MOAS will coordinate its efforts with the wider Humanitarian Response Coordinators as part of Health Cluster activities., “Emerging information on the widespread impact on the Ukrainian civilian population of the Russian invasion over the past 48 hours is both worrying and utterly unacceptable.” Says Regina Catrambone, MOAS co-founder and Director. “Our sincerest hope was for a democratic and non-violent conclusion to the activities of the past months, but in light of the new military action and the intense risk it brings to children, women and men across the country, our focus must now be on rapidly deploying aid and humanitarian services in support of those in need. MOAS and our teams are doing all we can to ensure we intervene efficiently and effectively to the best of our ability and will continue to do so for as long as we are able.”, With over 854,000 Ukrainians already internally displaced, it is estimated that up to 5 million people may be forced to flee the country in search of safety over the coming weeks, with more than 100,000 already evacuated from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. MOAS’ experience in service provision for displaced communities and rapid response in the face of emergent crises makes it a leader in the field and the team are fully committed to lending capacity in the face of this historic human tragedy., MOAS urges neighbouring nations to establish a solid and efficient reception mechanism for those fleeing the violence with full access to the asylum system as needed. With Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic declaring their readiness to welcome Ukrainian refugees, we hope other European nations will follow suit in a demonstration of the unity and solidarity that the Union represents., Not since the second world war has Europe faced such a crisis of democracy and security and it is vital that civil society, non-governmental entities, and international state representatives stand together in strength and support of the Ukrainian nation and its people., If you want to support the Ukrainian people and help MOAS to deploy life-saving services to those in desperate need please donate now at www.moas.eu/donate, PRESS ENQUIRIES:, Francesca Pierpaoli PR & Communications Officer Tel. +356 79900097 pr@moas.eu",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/moas-launches-humanitarian-relief-effort-ukraine

With some 3 million people in Ukraine already in need of urgent humanitarian assistance even before the Russian military incursion, immediate medical support is needed to prevent the country from spiraling even deeper into a humanitarian crisis that could impact millions of people., Chris Skopec, Executive Vice President of Global Health for Project HOPE, said:, ""The conflict in Ukraine is a devastating blow for millions of Ukrainians who have already been living in a humanitarian crisis even before the first bombs fell. At this point, there is no way to ease the suffering that is to come unless there is a total stop to the conflict. Short of that, millions of people may suffer as the country spirals into a humanitarian crisis that impacts Ukraine's most vulnerable people., ""Civilians have already been killed, just hours into this conflict. At least one hospital has already been hit. Long lines of people are trying to flee major cities. These numbers will get exponentially worse and add to the more than 850,000 internally displaced people already struggling to survive in Ukraine,"" Skopec added., With medical needs anticipated to be high as the conflict grows, Project HOPE is currently working with the World Health Organization to mobilize an initial shipment of medical supplies into Ukraine. Ukraine already faces major health challenges, including high rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which will be worsened by any prolonged conflict as people are forced to go without regular medicine or care., The conflict will also undoubtedly lead to widespread mental and psychosocial health challenges, especially in communities that have previously experienced years of conflict., ""As we have seen time and time again, the human costs of war do not respect borders. This war will lead to devastation inside Ukraine, but it may also touch off a regional crisis across Europe as waves of refugees flee home to seek safety,"" Skopec added. ""We are still in the middle of a pandemic, and a refugee crisis would add further stress to health systems that are already struggling or overwhelmed., ""Ukrainians have lived too long in the shadow of war. Innocent women, children, and men will suffer needlessly because of a conflict they did not ask for or deserve.

Ukraine is no stranger to being on the receiving-end of cyberattacks and the timeline below tracks the most significant incidents to date., The targeting of critical infrastructure raises particular concern as this infrastructure is essential for the survival of the civilian population. Attacks on infrastructure such as energy, water, healthcare, financial institutions, transport and communication services can have devastating consequences on the civilian population., Beyond the risks to critical infrastructure and civilian objects, cyberattacks sow distrust and limit access to accurate information or spread false information. They can also be highly disruptive and create a sense of fear and uncertainty and even lead to the eventual displacement of people.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-timeline-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure-and-civilian-objects-25

As the bombs and shelling have continued to escalate throughout the day, people are fleeing their homes and desperately seeking safety. The IRC strongly supports the UN Secretary General's call for the protection of civilians and adherence to international humanitarian law to avert what would be the worst humanitarian crisis Europe has seen in decades., The resulting humanitarian catastrophe from a full-scale war in Ukraine will lead to grave human suffering. The world will bear witness to innocent deaths, destruction of civilian infrastructure and massive displacement inside the country and across Europe. There will be far reaching humanitarian implications across Europe and the globe, destabilizing the continent, straining resources of Ukraine's neighbors, and impacting food supply for countries like Yemen, Libya and Lebanon - already facing acute levels of food insecurity., Lani Fortier, Senior Director of Emergencies at the IRC said, ""We truly hope we can avert disaster and avoid the human suffering we will inevitably see if this conflict continues to escalate. However, the IRC is ready and preparing for the worst. We are working to quickly mobilize resources and connect with partners to establish a response that will provide life-saving support to civilians forced to flee their homes. The IRC is meeting with partners and local civil society organizations in Poland and Ukraine to assess capacity for responding to an increase of refugees and people in need. We will work to respond where we are needed the most and with the services that are needed urgently. Whatever the needs are, we are preparing to meet them."", As the situation teeters on the edge of full-scale war, civilians must be protected, the UN Charter respected and International Humanitarian Law adhered to. People must be allowed to move freely, and aid agencies must be granted unfettered humanitarian access to those in need of aid. The international community must remain united and apply diplomatic pressure to focus on a political settlement. At the same time, the world must prepare for the worst by investing in humanitarian relief services inside and outside Ukraine to save lives and alleviate human suffering. European countries must welcome their neighbors fleeing Ukraine by keeping borders open and ensuring full access to asylum and adequate reception., The IRC has been responding to humanitarian crises in Europe since 2015, where we launched an emergency response to the peak in migration in Greece and relaunched operations in Serbia. Our teams provided water, health and sanitation, and psychosocial support to refugees and migrants.

The team will lead the U.S. Government’s humanitarian response to help address critical needs caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including responding to the needs of those internally displaced. USAID will coordinate closely with the Department of State as they also support international organization partners responding to the needs of those internally displaced.

This includes contingency and preparedness efforts to increase funding, staffing, program flexibility, and stockpiles of supplies for a range of scenarios including large-scale displacement., Working with partners on the ground, USAID has continued to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance in the areas that can be reached.

I was five years old when the war started and remember how military vehicles were driving down the street. There was nothing to eat. We had to eat grass., “If the war breaks out, I'll stay at home. There is a cellar in my yard, but I won't be able to reach it. I hope my neighbours don't leave me, God bless them. People suffer, they live in fear, everyone is worried and afraid.”, Research carried out by HelpAge in Ukraine after the 2014 conflict, highlights the particular risks older people will face if conflict escalates, including:, HelpAge runs a programme for almost 5,000 older people in eastern Ukraine. 4,000 get support from a network of volunteers, and 800 through community safe spaces. In the run-up to the conflict aid packages were distributed and plans have been put in place to provide continued support for those in need., General activities include the provision of community safe spaces for older people, targeted advocacy and coordination with NGOs, UN agencies and relevant authorities to ensure the inclusion of older people in the delivery of services, and psychosocial support. Peer-to-peer support groups and home-based care activities are provided while assistive devices, and hygiene kits are distributed to those in need., HelpAge ceased all active programme work in mid-February when shelling began in eastern Ukraine but has developed a plan for continued outreach to those at risk and remains in active contact with those it supports through its staff and network of volunteers.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-older-people-face-abandonment-and-isolation-conflict-russia-intensifies

PAX calls upon parties to the conflict in Ukraine to protect civilians,News and Press Release,PAX,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"PAX firmly condemns the invasion and calls for an immediate return of all Russian troops to outside the Ukrainian sovereign territory. This is an unwarranted, ungrounded invasion, in which Russia is responsible for harm and damages. We worry about the fate of all Ukrainian citizens irrespective of their ethnic, religious, political or other affiliations, all the more so because we are aware of the repeated breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law at the hands of Russian forces and Russian backed forces, in Ukraine and in other countries such as Syria., Flagrant violation of international law
PAX considers the invasion of Ukraine a flagrant violation of international law, which should be condemned by the international community and the EU. PAX emphasizes the need for diplomacy and a political strategy as a means of stopping war and calls upon swift and strong sanctions against Russia for their disrespect of international law., Impact of explosive weapons
The escalation of armed violence in Ukraine demonstrates the importance of protecting civilians against the impact from explosive weapons in populated areas. Already on Tuesday the 22nd of February, the Luhansk power station in Schastia was reportedly targeted with GRAD rockets. The ICRC reported severe water shortages in the Donetsk area after active hostilities put several water stations and pipelines out of order.On 23 and 24 February reports on explosions near major Ukrainian cities continued to come in and we are worried that this will continue., Previously PAX reported on the direct impact from explosive weapons in towns and cities on civilians in Ukraine as well as the indirect and reverberating effects this practice has on civilians, for example through the impact on healthcare. We furthermore highlighted the impact on the environment through damage cause in the highly industrialized areas in Eastern Ukraine., When explosive weapons with wide area effects are used in towns and cities, they put civilians at great risk of being killed and injured. Research indicates that 9 out of 10 casualties worldwide from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas are civilians. Explosive weapons also have grave indirect and reverberating effects when used in towns and cities through the impact on infrastructure such as houses, water and electricity networks, hospitals, schools. Such impact creates an interlinked pattern of harm. Hospitals cannot function without electricity or water, education suffers from damage to schools and so on. Antipersonnel landmines are indiscriminate by nature, and will impact societies long after the conflict has ended. Concerns about reports of both victim activated landmines (prohibited by the Mine Ban Treaty) as command activated landmines (not prohibited) have been expressed in the past. Being banned internationally for the civilian harm these weapons cause cluster munitions were also reportedly used in the conflict in Ukraine before., In all these cases civilians will bear the brunt., Protect civilians
PAX calls upon all parties to the conflict to protect civilians against the impact from the use of (controversial) weapons, and specifically upon:, Need for monitoring
Furthermore, we call on the international community to impartially monitor civilian harm in this situation, as a basis for decision making on direct assistance, long term support, and for future legal actions to be taken against all those individuals who violate international humanitarian law and human rights., PAX will continue to monitor the armed violence in Ukraine and its effects on the civilian population. PAX moreover will continue to support its partners in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/pax-calls-upon-parties-conflict-ukraine-protect-civilians

Es imposible creer que en pleno siglo XXI en el centro de Europa la gente tenga que despertarse a las 5 de la mañana por las explosiones y el sonido de las sirenas antiaéreas”. Con estas palabras Tetiana Stawnychy, presidenta de Cáritas Ucrania, ha reaccionado al ataque a gran escala lanzado en la madrugada de hoy en el país., Cáritas está profundamente preocupada por el impacto de esta intervención en la población local, que ya vive en condiciones críticas ocho años después del inicio de la crisis que mató a 14.000 personas y desplazó a otros 1,5 millones., La Confederación Cáritas está lanzando un llamamiento de emergencia para apoyar el trabajo de Cáritas Ucrania. El programa tiene como objetivo apoyar a las personas afectadas por el conflicto con alimentos, agua potable, alojamiento seguro y kits de higiene, así como garantizar un transporte seguro para que las personas vulnerables puedan reunirse con sus seres queridos y acceder a zonas seguras. “Necesitamos vuestro apoyo para tener la oportunidad de responder a la crisis humanitaria y ayudar a las personas afectadas por la guerra”, dice Tetiana Stawnychy., Ya desde finales del verano de 2021, particularmente en el este de Ucrania, Cáritas anticipó una respuesta humanitaria ante la posible escalada del conflicto. Cáritas capacitó al personal y los voluntarios para aumentar su capacidad de satisfacer las necesidades de las comunidades locales y fortalecer su red. También pusieron a punto centros temporales para acoger y garantizar la asistencia a los desplazados internos, cuyo número muy probablemente aumentará considerablemente con el inicio de esta reciente intervención militar., Las cifras de las necesidades de emergencia ya eran dramáticas: “Antes del ataque, ya había 2,9 millones de habitantes locales a ambos lados de la línea de contacto que necesitaban asistencia humanitaria. Hoy, ese número está aumentando exponencialmente”, agrega Stawnychy., Caritas Ucrania cuenta con el apoyo de 36 organizaciones de la Confederación Caritas para ayudar a la población necesitada. “No podemos ignorar las trágicas implicaciones humanitarias de esta guerra”, ha señalado el secretario general de Caritas Internationalis, Aloysius John. “Es deber de la comunidad internacional proteger al pueblo ucraniano y garantizar su acceso a asistencia vital”., Caritas Internationalis subraya la urgencia de que todas las personas puedan acceder a la asistencia humanitaria, en particular los más vulnerables, y que se garantice la libertad de movimiento para quienes huyen del conflicto. “Todos estamos llamados a actuar.

The injured are said to include six doctors., Many civilians are now struck in traffic jams as they rush to flee the areas impacted in the violence this morning, including Kharkiv and Kyiv. There are also queues at the border to Poland, while nearby countries prepare to accept refugees., In recent weeks, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) has monitored an escalation in violence in the Donbas region, which borders Russia, and where violence between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists has occurred since 2014., Between 2014 and 2021, AOAV recorded 5,242 deaths and injuries in Ukraine, including 2,704 civilians and 2,538 armed actors and security personnel. Of the civilian casualties recorded, 2,381 (88%) were caused by explosive weapon use in populated areas., Ground-launched weapons, such as shelling, mortars, rockets, or grenades, for example, have accounted for 2,459 civilian casualties since 2014 – 91% of total civilian casualties., Of the civilian casualties, the vast majority occurred in 2014 and 2015, with 1,428 and 862 civilian deaths and injuries in these years respectively. Despite continued sporadic shelling across the line of control, which divides the region of Donbas, civilian casualties have fallen quite consistently since 2014, with 28 recorded last year. Fewer civilian casualties are also likely to have occurred as numerous civilians have fled the worst impacted areas in Donbas since 2014, leaving an aging population, many of whom cannot leave., In many instances of shelling since 2014, the perpetrator has not been identified, but where they have, Ukrainian separatist forces have been responsible for at least 667 civilian casualties and Ukraine for 783., In the last few days, there has been an increase in shelling across the line of control, which has resulted in seven civilian casualties. At least three civilians were injured on February 17th when separatist shelling hit a school in Luhansk. On the same day, separatist shelling left another woman injured in Marinka as she waited for a bus. Shelling by Ukrainian forces was also reported to have left one woman injured on February 17th. On February 20th, 2 civilian deaths were reported due to Ukrainian shelling in occupied areas of Luhansk. And, on February 21st, a civilian was killed and homes damaged by separatist shelling on Donetsk., This escalation in violence and the Russian invasion today is likely to be disastrous for civilians, as highlighted by the statement released today by the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW), of which AOAV is a founding member., AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.

Statement on the situation in Ukraine,News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"In the early hours of 24 February, the Russian Federation began an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect is deeply alarmed by this act of aggression and the grave risks of atrocities it poses to populations across Ukraine. The Global Centre condemns this blatant breach of the UN Charter that has the capacity to cause widespread suffering to millions of innocent civilians., Reports have cited at least 10 confirmed civilian casualties so far, as well as strikes on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, Donetsk and elsewhere. Russian forces must cease their use of indiscriminate weapons in civilian populated areas, which is in direct defiance of International Humanitarian Law, to avoid any further loss of life. The current crisis also elevates security risks for Ukrainian and Russian human rights defenders, journalists and civil society, especially those critical of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine’s affairs., This dramatic escalation is the latest evolution in a conflict that has been ongoing in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, collectively known as Donbas, since 2014. The conflict in Donbas has claimed the lives of over 3,393 civilians, forcibly displaced more than 1.4 million people and left 2.9 million in need of humanitarian assistance. International human rights groups have documented grave abuses perpetrated by all sides to the armed conflict, including indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas, torture, enforced disappearances and sexual and gender-based violence. These acts may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., The Global Centre’s concerns stem not only from the high risks of atrocity crimes in modern warfare, but also due to the perpetrator of this aggression. Russian forces, contractors, allies and others under the government’s command have facilitated or committed atrocities in Syria, Central African Republic, Libya and elsewhere. The Russian government has shielded perpetrators of atrocities from international scrutiny, fueling impunity and emboldening them to commit further crimes., The Global Centre calls upon the international community to take swift, collective action with the aim of protecting vulnerable populations in Ukraine. States should impose the toughest possible sanctions unilaterally and through regional organizations to isolate Russia and those supporting the government’s offensive., The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) should urgently convene to discuss the crisis and establish a mechanism to monitor and report on human rights abuses, especially those that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Members of the UN Security Council should stand united and vote favorably on a resolution condemning the invasion and the risks it poses to Ukrainian populations, regardless of Russia’s likely veto. The UN General Assembly should also work to suspend Russia’s membership on the HRC for violations of the Charter it has sworn to uphold., While this conflict has deep and long-standing security implications in Europe and beyond, there is an urgent need to address the dire risks of atrocities in Ukraine today. The Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, Savita Pawnday, said that, “With its actions today Russia has flouted the rules and conventions that bind the international community together. We must now stand with the people of Ukraine and work collectively to uphold our political and moral responsibility to protect populations from the very real threat of atrocities.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-situation-ukraine
Is Europe Prepared for a Possible Large-Scale Ukrainian Displacement Crisis?,News and Press Release,MPI,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"By Hanne Beirens, Great uncertainty has been unleashed with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As Europeans woke up to the stunning reality of warfare on their continent, European Union and national-government policymakers immediately turned their attention to two key questions: how many Ukraine citizens may flee towards the bloc and will EU preparations of recent weeks suffice?, With armed conflict being waged in its backyard and the reverberations of the 2015 and subsequent Afghan and Belarussian refugee crises still clearly felt in Brussels and national capitals, the European Union is, more than ever, under pressure to show leadership in jointly responding to any massive displacement that could unfold on its eastern border. Depending on how brutal the invasion is and how deep the Russians reach into Ukraine, it is estimated that anywhere from 50,000 to 1 million or more Ukrainians could move into EU territory. Neighboring countries such as Poland, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Romania would be first affected, but others further afield, such as Estonia, Finland, and Germany, could expect to see arrivals as well., Over the past weeks as the war drums beat louder, governments of those countries and EU leaders in Brussels have sought to reassure friend and foe alike that preparations were underway, including contingency plans to quickly upscale existing reception capacity. Except for the odd leak to reporters, officials left the content of these contingency plans purposively vague. The rationale? To avoid generating a self-fulfilling prophecy of seemingly “inviting” refugees to come, but also to keep information from Russia and its ally Belarus, which last year tried to destabilize the European Union by using migration as a weapon., Amid the vagueness, the ghost of the 2015-16 refugee crisis has resurfaced. And members of the public and policymakers alike are pondering whether the European Union is better prepared than in 2015 and 2016, when more than 2 million migrants and refugees arrived, overtopping the asylum and migrations systems of so many EU countries. Publics will be alert to anything that resembles the chaos they witnessed back then or last autumn on the border with Belarus., Lessons Learned, The 2015 crisis, and subsequent border skirmishes over migrants with Turkey and Belarus, prompted the creation of a vast set of emergency preparedness measures, ranging from investments in early-warning mechanisms and forecasting (e.g. how many will arrive and where?), to upgraded mandates for Frontex, the EU Asylum Agency (EUAA), and Europol to intervene in border or migration crises, and capacity building to address sudden upticks in arrivals. As occurred with last year’s Belarus crisis and the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Europe’s Blueprint Mechanism recently was activated. This mechanism supports the EU emergency and crisis response in migration and brings together the key stakeholders—the European Commission, affected Member States, relevant EU agencies, and select other key players (e.g., the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration)—to closely monitor the situation and take coordinated action if a crisis is triggered or is imminent., The first priority in the event of major arrivals of displaced Ukrainians would be to secure adequate reception: Finding accommodations and supporting new arrivals with material needs such as food, sanitation, and clothing. To quickly expand existing reception capacity, neighboring EU Member States could revert to tested—but at most temporary—strategies, such as using vacant lots, military barracks, or tents., There is a key role for the EU Asylum Agency, which has developed its in-house expertise and ability to mobilize resources, and smooths the gap across Member States that have differing views of their protection role. By providing operational support to frontline Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Malta, and Spain, and now also to countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, the asylum agency has acquired expertise in quickly moving in and supporting the creation of emergency reception facilities. Beyond that, it also is testing new modalities to offer reception that is in line with EU standards., Poland, which already is home to more than 1 million Ukrainians, announced Thursday that it would open reception centers near the border, offering food, medical help, and information. Even as there were reports of thousands of Ukrainians leaving the country, headed for Poland, Moldova, and beyond, buses and trains from Poland to Kyiv and Lyiv were sold out, as some sought to return to Ukraine to fight or reconnect with family members., Refugees by Another Name?, Unlike Syrian, Afghan, and other arrivals to the European Union, Ukrainians already enjoy visa-free travel to the bloc for stays of up to 90 days, and there has been no indication that countries would limit the arrangement. Indeed, the Slovak interior minister said Ukrainians without valid passports would be admitted if they pass an individual assessment conducted by border officials., In a scenario where the conflict becomes protracted and displaced Ukrainians seek to stay on a longer-term basis, they will have several options available. While asylum is an option, the large Ukrainian diaspora already present in Poland, Germany, Czechia, Italy, and Spain could sponsor others through family channels. And others yet may be eligible for labor channels such as that offered already to Ukrainians by Poland., After Russia seized Crimea in 2014, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians headed to EU Member States, but just 34,375 applied for asylum. While governments would have to take steps to permit this type of lane switching without requiring a return trip to Ukraine, using these pathways could alleviate pressure on European asylum systems. And with such a large diaspora, many would rely on friends and family rather than drawing on formal reception systems., Still, regardless of their status, if hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians flee to neighboring countries amid prolonged conflict, the question of solidarity within the EU bloc will rise to the forefront. But how easy will it be for Member States to shape movements in a bid to share responsibility for dealing with the displaced when Ukrainian citizens have a visa-free regime with the European Union and large diaspora communities?, Next to dealing with the most urgent needs of displaced Ukrainians, a bigger issue is at stake here. With the European Union divided on how to jointly respond to migration pressures and frustrated by how its commitments to asylum rights have undermined its position in recent geopolitical conflicts (e.g. Belarus), it will be essential for EU policymakers to demonstrate to the public that the bloc is able to manage and control arrivals, has a plan for how to temporarily receive displaced Ukrainians, and can avoid chaotic border scenes., For it is these scenes of chaos and poor management that have fueled an ever-growing list of reactive and restrictive stances on humanitarian protection and migration across the bloc in the past months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-prepared-possible-large-scale-ukrainian-displacement-crisis
The Humanitarian Toll of Russia’s Invasion,News and Press Release,CSIS,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"After months of military buildup along Ukraine's borders, the Russian military's widespread incursion into Ukraine represents the worst-case scenario from a humanitarian and civilian protection perspective. Humanitarian impacts due to Russian shelling and military activities near and around civilian population centers include loss of life and damage to civilian property and infrastructure, as well as the disruption of basic services in areas with presence of Russian forces., Russia's comprehensive assault included the use of over 160 indiscriminate short- and long-range missiles, in conjunction with cyberattacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure and the apparent deployment of various types of irregular combatants. Russia's widespread incursions limited potential evacuation routes, limiting options for civilians seeking to flee conflict and violence. Missile strikes and incursions as far west as Lviv could potentially inhibit movement westward into neighboring states, forcing some to find refuge elsewhere inside Ukraine, with the uncertainty surrounding Russia's future military plans posing additional stress., Initial accounts have reported nearly 140 Ukrainian deaths and over 100,000 displaced from the incursion. The number of civilian deaths belies the wider humanitarian impact of the invasion. Russian military activity over the past years has demonstrated a wanton disregard for basic principles of international humanitarian law, including efforts to spare civilian life and property. In Syria, Russian airstrikes directly targeted hospitals and other essential healthcare facilities, while Wagner Group mercenaries have carried out atrocities in the Central African Republic, Mozambique, and Mali. With the prospect of a long and deadly insurgency on the horizon, the Ukrainian government on Thursday announced that assault rifles were being distributed to citizens., The prospect of protracted urban warfare with irregular combatants from Russia and Ukraine will undoubtedly have substantial humanitarian consequences. Pitched battles in urban settings generate widespread damage to infrastructure, with reverberating effects for civilians if water, sanitation, and electrical systems become damaged. Furthermore, the arming of the civilian population will raise critical questions around distinguishing fighters from civilians., Russian forces have now seized the Chornobyl nuclear waste site. This initial military activity has led to a rise in radiation levels, likely from the movement of heavy equipment. However, the military activity at Chornobyl also reinforces the concerns around Ukraine's four remaining nuclear power sites---which contain 15 reactors---and the massive humanitarian implications should such sites be targeted or incidentally impacted., Prior to the comprehensive invasion, the escalation of violence in the Donbas region generated casualties and displacement. An ordered evacuation from separatist-controlled parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, planned in advance by Russian-backed authorities, led to nearly 90,000 civilians fleeing into Russia, with no visible indication of preparations to provide basic services., The Russian invasion comes on the heels of eight years of occupation and hostilities in Donbas and the ongoing humanitarian challenges faced by the populations in the region. It also follows a months-long buildup of forces whose presence---by design---generated levels of uncertainty and psychological trauma. The wholesale invasion now substantially disrupts the ability of civilians to find safety and refuge and in the short term disrupts the ability of Ukrainian civil society organizations to respond to the needs of those displaced or otherwise impacted by the conflict., In the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion, UN secretary-general António Guterres announced a $20 million contribution from the Central Emergency Response Fund to support protection and other activities along the contact lines in eastern Ukraine., There is currently a limited international humanitarian presence elsewhere within Ukraine. Many organizations that responded to urgent needs in the aftermath of the 2014 invasion and occupation have subsequently departed, thereby losing access to staff; a nuanced understanding of needs, languages, and cultural sensitivities; and the resources needed to rapidly scale up a response. While the limited international presence within Ukraine may inhibit a rapid scale-up of humanitarian operations, it can also ensure that Ukrainian civil society organizations remain in the lead of any future humanitarian operations. Within Ukraine and in neighboring states, donors should emphasize supporting existing civil society organizations, as opposed to creating duplicate structures., Major humanitarian donors have suggested publicly that contingency planning has been underway, yet public evidence of such planning is limited. While there were reports of joint tabletop exercise carried out by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), many of the nongovernmental partners instrumental to a rapid response were not included or made aware of the contingency plans developed and are now playing catch-up. USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to Poland to coordinate the response, in line with partner organizations. Given the overall insecurity, nongovernmental organizations remain uncertain if they will be able to work inside Ukraine or remain limited to responding to forced displacement in neighboring countries., Despite their proximity, European donors have been similarly vague about contingency planning. Many donor capitals reported that plans were being drawn up and resources set aside but were unwilling to speak to the details for fear of generating unease. On February 15, Ukraine submitted a formal request to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism for humanitarian and other support, with efforts underway by the European Union now to coordinate the contributions., The assault on Ukraine will also generate immediate negative impacts on global food security, as wheat production and shipping will likely be disrupted. This will have second-order impacts on other humanitarian crises that rely on large commodity shipments, further stressing humanitarian systems. When and where possible, humanitarian actors should prioritize cash-based programming in Ukraine and neighboring states, and in ongoing crises elsewhere, to reduce the strains on food systems. Cash-based programming will also allow displaced and vulnerable Ukrainians to determine their own priorities, support existing economic and social structures, and potentially hasten their return should circumstances in their areas of origin improve., The Russian military presence inside Ukraine raises the question of the need for an establishment of a civil-military coordination structure for humanitarian notification and deconfliction. Russia's disregard and exploitation of such systems in Syria necessitate that any coordination and notification system be carefully considered, given the risk of Russian direct targeting of humanitarian actors and civilian populations. Coordination with Ukrainian authorities should be prioritized when possible, while remaining cognizant of Russian attempts to exploit and manipulate humanitarian action for propaganda purposes. Despite Russia's past exploitation of such systems, UN leadership should continue to engage with Russian ministries to reinforce fundamental principles., Humanitarian and human rights organizations, including international bodies, should also immediately push back against the cynical exploitation and misappropriation by Putin of the language of humanitarian considerations and prevention of genocide as a justification for an invasion of Ukraine. While not a new tactic, the use of this terminology to justify an unprovoked assault of this scope and scale further harms truthful, sincere, and necessary efforts to monitor, prevent, and bring to account perpetrators of real genocide., Misinformation and disinformation have been a hallmark of the Russian campaign in Ukraine and elsewhere with Russian military activities. Humanitarian actors and advocates must remain vigilant in their use of sourcing and imagery. Russian propaganda not only relies on spreading misinformation but also benefits from when humanitarian organizations themselves are seen as spreading false information. Triangulation of humanitarian information through reliable sources and confirming accounts of humanitarian and human rights violations before publication is essential to avoid confusion about humanitarian needs and violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and maintain the potential for meaningful accountability in the future, regardless of the perpetrators., Given the massive existing humanitarian needs in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria, and elsewhere, Congress and the Biden administration should immediately and jointly develop a funding package for the Ukrainian response to include resources for civil society organizations inside Ukraine, bilateral support to Ukraine's neighbors, and funding for the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN agencies that will support displaced communities. The United States should also lead by example in extending temporary protected status to Ukrainian citizens living in the United States and providing opportunities for visa waivers to Ukrainians seeking entry into the United States. The Biden administration should also urgently engage with allies and partners throughout Europe to ensure a robust, coherent, and unified response to the humanitarian consequences so that the displacement does not become weaponized and lead to further unrest and political discord., Jacob Kurtzer is director and senior fellow of the Humanitarian Agenda at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., Commentary is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Director General Grossi said it was of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the zone’s nuclear facilities should not be affected or disrupted in any way., Regarding reports earlier today of higher radiation measurements at the Chornobyl site, Ukraine’s regulatory authority said that they may have been caused by heavy military vehicles stirring up soil still contaminated from the 1986 accident., The IAEA assesses that the readings reported by the regulator – of up to 9,46 microSieverts per hour – are low and remain within the operational range measured in the Exclusion Zone since it was established, and therefore do not pose any danger to the public., The IAEA continues to closely monitor this and other developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear reactors. The IAEA is in constant contact with its counterpart, which regularly provides the Agency with updated information, Director General Grossi said, adding that he remained gravely concerned about the overall situation in Ukraine., The IAEA will continue to provide regular updates on the situation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-1-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-25-february-2022-enru
"Russia Must Cease Hostilities, Violations of International Law in Ukraine: PHR",News and Press Release,Physicians for Human Rights,Health,25 Feb 2022,"hysicians for Human Rights (PHR) is gravely concerned by and condemns the wanton aggression, indiscriminate attacks, and violence against civilians perpetrated by the Russian Federation during its ongoing unlawful invasion of Ukraine. Russia must cease hostilities and abide by international law, including ensuring the protection of civilians, PHR said today., Early reports of a ballistic missile strike next to a hospital in Vuhledar, Ukraine raise alarms that Russia may again perpetrate violence against health workers and health care facilities. Since its military intervention in the Syrian crisis in 2015, the Russian Federation and the Syrian government have launched hundreds of attacks on health facilities and workers, in flagrant violation of international law., “PHR is appalled by the early scenes of devastation across Ukraine and calls on the international community to do everything at its disposal to prevent further bloodshed and protect civilians caught in the crossfire,” said Michele Heisler, MD, MPA, medical director at PHR and professor of internal medicine and public health at the University of Michigan. “We are at a perilous moment and the Russian Federation must step back from the brink. All parties to the conflict must abide by international human rights and humanitarian law.”, “After never being held accountable for its brutal and systematic targeting of health care workers and facilities in Syria, Russia is likely emboldened to attack hospitals and health workers in Ukraine. Escalating violence against health workers and patients is a clear and present danger. Hospitals are not a target and all parties must respect the work and independence of medical personnel, including volunteer medics who are rendering aid,” added Dr. Heisler., A PHR team visited Ukraine in 2015, shortly after armed conflict in the country erupted in 2014, with researchers finding that the number of dead and missing overwhelmed the country’s limited capacity to identify them all. PHR researchers also highlighted how medical personnel were targeted by the Moscow-backed government during mass protests in Kyiv, Ukraine in 2014., PHR warns about the acute potential for conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine. Past conflicts in Ukraine and globally have resulted in conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). It is critical that all warring parties refrain from SGBV. PHR also calls on authorities to ensure sustained access to comprehensive health services, including sexual and reproductive health care and mental health care for survivors of SGBV. International law prohibits rape and other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict, including against civilians, members of the armed forces and persons accompanying them, and prisoners of war., Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the UN Charter, 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Convention Against Torture, thus requiring both States to abide by certain conduct and protect civilians., Russia and Ukraine must guarantee humanitarian access for medical supplies and humanitarian organizations offering medical care. Under international law, they also must ensure safety for particularly vulnerable groups, including through providing evacuation corridors, safe passage, and logistical support for civilians who are fleeing to safer areas, especially children, people with disabilities, prisoners, and the elderly. Landmines and cluster munitions should never be used because of their inherently indiscriminate nature., The Biden administration must also expand its efforts to support refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people from Ukraine. To date, the Biden administration has been summarily expelling Ukrainians arriving at the United States border seeking refuge, along with people from other countries. PHR continues its call on the administration to end Title 42 expulsions and to ensure protection from deportation for Ukrainians already in the United States through Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure, and Special Student Relief for Ukraine., Media Contact

Ukraine : Frappe d’une arme à sous-munitions russe contre un hôpital,News and Press Release,HRW,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"L’attaque a tué quatre civils et blessé 10 autres personnes, (Berlin, le 25 février 2022) – Un missile balistique russe contenant une arme à sous-munitions a frappé une rue juste devant un hôpital à Vuhledar, une ville de la région de Donetsk contrôlée par le gouvernement ukrainien, le 24 février 2022, a déclaré Human Rights Watch aujourd'hui. L'attaque a tué quatre civils et en a blessé 10 autres, dont six travailleurs de la santé, et a endommagé l'hôpital, une ambulance et des véhicules de civils., Human Rights Watch a mené des entretiens téléphoniques avec un médecin de l’Hôpital central de la Ville, et une responsable municipale. Ces deux personnes ont fourni les noms des civils blessés et tués, et ont partagé des photographies de deux personnes tuées. Human Rights Watch a également vérifié les photographies publiées sur les réseaux sociaux ou envoyées directement par le personnel de l'hôpital, montrant les corps de deux victimes ainsi que des dommages causés par l'attaque. Une photo montre l’ogive de l'arme apparemment utilisée, un missile balistique Tochka de la série 9M79, contenant des sous-munitions 9N123., « Cette attaque cruelle a tué et blessé des civils et endommagé un hôpital », a déclaré Steve Goose, directeur de la division Armes à Human Rights Watch. « Les forces russes devraient cesser d'utiliser des armes à sous-munitions et mettre fin aux attaques illégales recourant à des armes qui tuent et mutilent sans discrimination. », Un traité international interdisant les armes à sous-munitions a été adopté en raison de leur effet indiscriminé généralisé et du danger durable qu’elles représentent pour les civils. Les bombes à sous-munitions (BASM) explosent généralement dans le ciel, dispersant de multiples petites bombes (sous-munitions) au-dessus d’une vaste zone, d’une superficie d’un terrain de football. Toutefois, de nombreuses sous-munitions n'explosent pas lors de l'impact initial, ce qui laisse sur le sol de des fragments explosifs comparables a des mines terrestres. Ni la Russie ni l'Ukraine ne font partie des 110 États parties au traité qui interdit ces armes., Le 24 février, le président russe Vladimir Poutine a annoncé le lancement d’opérations militaires contre l'Ukraine. Suite à cette annonce, les forces armées russes ont lancé des attaques aériennes et terrestres contre des installations militaires à travers l'Ukraine., Le médecin-chef de l'hôpital affecté par la frappe, Natalia Sosyura, a décrit l’attaque : « J'étais au premier étage de l’hôpital, qui a deux étages. J'ai entendu une forte explosion à l'extérieur. Nous nous sommes précipités dans le couloir. Heureusement, nous n'avions pas beaucoup de patients à ce moment-là, il était environ 10h30 du matin. Nous nous sommes allongés par terre. », Le Dr Sosyura a fourni les noms de quatre civils qui ont été tués, et a ajouté que l'hôpital avait soigné 10 autres blessés, dont six membres du personnel médical. Une ambulance et trois voitures de civils ont été endommagées, a-t-elle dit. Human Rights Watch a pu examiner deux photographies des voitures endommagées., Human Rights Watch a également mené un entretien avec Tetyana Tyurina, directrice du département de l'information et de la communication de l'administration régionale de Donetsk. Elle a confirmé que l’attaque avait tué quatre civils et blessé dix autres personnes, dont six membres du personnel médical., Les quatre civils tués lors de l'attaque, deux hommes et deux femmes, étaient Maksim Sidorenko, 34 ans ; Antonina Sidorenko, 65 ans ; Sergueï Sivukhine, 56 ans ; et Olga Shramko, 50 ans., L’une des photographies examinées par Human Rights Watch a permis d’identifier l’arme utilisée. On y voit l’ogive et l'antenne de l'altimètre radar d'une bombe à sous-munitions 9N123 larguée par un missile balistique Tochka de la série 9M79. De telles bombes à sous-munitions contiennent 50 sous-munitions à fragmentation 9N24. Selon le fabricant russe, chaque sous-munition est composée d’explosifs pesant 1,45 kg, et est conçue pour exploser en dispersant environ 316 fragments de taille uniforme., La Russie et l'Ukraine stockent le missile balistique Tochka, qui est équipé d'une ogive d'arme à sous-munitions., Les forces gouvernementales ukrainiennes et les groupes armés soutenus par la Russie ont utilisé des armes à sous-munitions dans l'est de l'Ukraine entre juillet 2014 et février 2015, selon les enquêtes menées par Human Rights Watch, ainsi que par la mission de surveillance de l'Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe (OSCE), parmi d'autres organisations., Human Rights Watch a aussi documenté l'utilisation du même type d'armes à sous-munitions lors d'une attaque menée par les forces russes et syriennes à Sarmin, dans la province d'Idlib en Syrie, en janvier 2020., Communiqué complet en anglais : en ligne ici.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-frappe-d-une-arme-sous-munitions-russe-contre-un-h-pital
Russian military commits indiscriminate attacks during the invasion of Ukraine,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"• Amnesty International research verifies violations in international humanitarian law, • Russian attacks could constitute war crimes, • Russian claims to use precision guided weapons are patently false, The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals, Amnesty International said today, after documenting three incidents that it believes to have killed at least six civilians and injured at least 12 more. Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law (the laws of war) and can constitute war crimes., “The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas. Some of these attacks may be war crimes. The Russian government, which falsely claims to use only precision-guided weapons, should take responsibility for these acts,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.*

Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General"", “The Russian troops should immediately stop carrying out indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war. The continuation of the use of ballistic missiles and other inaccurate explosive weapons causing civilian deaths and injuries is inexcusable.”, Indiscriminate attacks, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed digital evidence—including photos, videos and satellite imagery— of three such attacks carried out in the early hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. The attacks occurred in Vuhledar, Kharkiv and Uman., Amnesty International’s verification of the use of indiscriminate attacks by the Russian forces in their military operations in Ukraine, provides irrefutable evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law., The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is scheduled to meet later today to discuss the situation and Russia will most likely veto any resolution put forward by other member states. Therefore, Amnesty International is calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly., “If the Security Council is paralyzed through veto, it is up to the entire membership to step up,” said Agnès Callamard., “We call on the UN General Assembly to meet in an emergency session and adopt a resolution denouncing Russia unlawful attack and calling for an end to all violations of humanitarian law and human rights. The lives, safety and well-being of millions of civilians is at stake.”, *“The Russian troops should immediately stop carrying out indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war.

The attacks occurred in Vuhledar, Kharkiv and Uman.*, n the deadliest strike documented by Amnesty International, at approximately 10.30 am local time, a ballistic missile struck near a hospital building in Vuhledar, in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, killing four civilians and wounding ten more. According to a local source who spoke to Amnesty International researchers, two women and two men were killed, and six healthcare workers were among the injured. Analyzing photos of the weapon scrap linked to the incident, Amnesty International’s weapons investigator determined that a 9M79 Tochka ballistic missile was used in the attack. These weapons are extremely inaccurate, regularly missing their targets by half a kilometre or more and should never be used in populated areas., Another of the attacks was carried out at approximately 8 am local time, in the Kharkiv region, northeastern Ukraine. The likely target was the nearby Chuhuiv Air Base, but instead Russian weapon struck a residential block, causing extensive fire damage and apparently killing at least one male civilian and injuring at least two civilian women. A single large crater in the ground between apartment buildings indicates the weapon was most likely a single large missile or rocket., In another attack occurring at 7 am on the 24 February in Uman, Cherkasy region, a civilian man appears to have been killed by a strike that also damaged a nearby restaurant., UN General Assembly must hold an emergency meeting, If the Security Council is paralyzed through veto, it is up to the entire membership to step up

Ukraine’s Regional Displacement Crisis,News and Press Release,CSIS,Protection and Human Rights,25 Feb 2022,"As many as 1.5 million people were already internally displaced within Ukraine before this week, forced from their homes during the 2014 invasion and the ensuing prolonged conflict in eastern Ukraine. The February 24 attacks are already adding to those figures, with the UN refugee agency estimating that 100,000 people have already left their homes within Ukraine. U.S. officials estimate that as many as 5 million people could be forced from home, and the European Union is preparing to host up to 1 million refugees. Those with the means to do so have piled belongings and relatives into cars and buses, largely heading to the western reaches of Ukraine or international borders. Those without means remain in harm's way. Traffic jams have been reported across the country, with long lines of vehicles inching along from Kyiv to Zhytomyr and onto Lviv and ultimately the Polish border. Since the attacks are coming primarily from three sides and targeting critical water infrastructure and educational facilities, vulnerable Ukrainian civilians could be forced to seek refuge outside of Ukraine in historic numbers., For now, Ukraine's neighbors are keeping borders open and preparing to receive refugees. In Poland, nearly 5,000 U.S. troops from the 82nd Airborne Division have set up three new processing centers to add to the existing five. Polish officials have also set up a system to transport injured people to at least 120 hospitals across the country, ultimately preparing for the arrival of up to 1 million refugees in the coming days and weeks. The Polish border remains open, as do Ukraine's borders with fellow EU members Slovakia and Romania. Even Hungary, long known for its hostile stance toward migrants and refugees, has signaled a willingness to provide humanitarian relief and refuge to Ukrainians. Moldova, a non-EU member state, has also vowed to keep its borders open to Ukrainians and provide them assistance upon arrival., The number of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) will undoubtedly rise, potentially into the millions. Many will hope to return home soon; however, prolonged displacement is more common globally than quick return. And while no one knows how or when the conflict in Ukraine will end, very few think it will end quickly. For IDPs, this means searching for food, shelter, and other assistance while considering more permanent relocation to Lviv or wherever they can find safety. For refugees outside of Ukraine, their stay becomes more complicated the longer it lasts. The initial welcome mat laid out by Ukraine's neighbors should be applauded; the European Union and the United States should also ensure through bilateral and multilateral assistance (and resettlement to the United States and elsewhere when possible) that the burden of sheltering refugees does not fall entirely on the countries and communities that host them. They should also work with local authorities to make sure borders remain open to vulnerable Ukrainians. But as their time away from home lengthens, Ukrainian refugees will increasingly seek more durable solutions, including access to education for children, labor markets for adults, and mobility for families within a European Union that has been reticent to allow for such access in the past. Despite the longer-term challenges to come, every effort needs to be made to keep the welcome mats in place for vulnerable Ukrainians as long as they need them., Erol Yayboke is director of the Project on Fragility and Mobility and senior fellow with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., Commentary is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

War in Europe: Responding to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine,Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Feb 2022,"Russia’s assault on Ukraine threatens to become the largest European conflict in decades. A vigorous but judicious Western and global response is critical to limit the damage., In a chilling act of aggression, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military assault on Ukraine in the early hours of 24 February. That Western leaders had warned of this possibility for weeks did little to cushion the shock. President Putin announced what he characterised as a “special military operation” to demilitarise and “denazify” Ukraine, and made a barely coded threat of nuclear strikes upon any outside power that might come to its aid. Residents of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and cities throughout the country woke to explosions as Russian bombs and missiles fell on military facilities and infrastructure. The bombardment follows a months-long build-up of as many as 200,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s borders, to the north, west and south. Ground forces that then entered Ukraine indicate that Russia has embarked upon not only an air campaign aimed at toppling Ukraine’s government but a full-scale invasion. The human toll could be catastrophic., Russia’s belligerence deals a staggering blow to the norm against conquest, which – though sometimes honoured in the breach – has underpinned global affairs since World War II. The rest of the world, and not just the Western powers who thus far have been most vocal, now needs to do what it can to limit the damage. While the available steps may seem small given the scale of what President Putin is doing, and cannot turn back the clock or by themselves reverse Russia’s aggression, a demonstration of unity and imposition of costs by outside powers represent the best hope of bringing the region, and the world, back toward a more stable order:, The first task for Western powers and their partners – one that is well under way – is to take the steps they had warned Moscow’s military escalation would provoke. That means rolling out the full sanctions packages they have promised, including against financial institutions, Russian officials, and business leaders, while avoiding steps that unnecessarily harm average Russian citizens, such as visa bans. NATO and its members should also continue to build up forces on the alliance’s eastern flank. They should also keep supporting Ukraine with weapons and other assistance. At the same time, though diplomacy holds little promise in the days ahead, they should keep the door open no matter how bad things get., Non-Western powers should make their voices heard, following the example of Kenya’s permanent representative to the UN, whose powerful intervention before the Security Council on 21 February called Russia out for its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. They should make clear the reputational costs of Moscow’s war of aggression. Russia’s friends, especially China – which for the moment appears, regrettably, to have cast its lot with Putin’s plan – should take stock of what this disruptive act will cost them politically and economically. To the extent they can pressure Russia to reverse course, they should do so., The UN and others should take urgent steps to help Ukraine prepare for the war’s probable humanitarian fallout. Large-scale displacement and emergency medical needs are likely. Russia itself will surely be required to host large numbers of refugees, for which it does not seem to have prepared. Humanitarian agencies should, with donor support, prepare for the worst. More for reputational purposes than because their outcry is likely to be effective, other international bodies should do what they can to demonstrate their opprobrium. The UN General Assembly or Human Rights Council should establish a fact-finding mechanism to collect evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses in the present fighting and any occupation that may follow., In reality, though, how horrific things get mostly depends on decisions taken in the Kremlin. Moscow faces not only the sanctions and NATO troop build-ups that Western powers will now undertake, but also prospectively fierce Ukrainian resistance that it seems to have discounted, potentially immense costs to its global repute and the need to convince its public that this war on a neighbouring country in which many Russian citizens have relatives and friends is truly crucial to national security. Seemingly isolated, angry and set on his dangerous path, President Putin may be beyond reaching. Pivoting to the pursuit of a negotiated settlement could still lead to real reductions of forces in Europe and would do much more for Russian security than war in Ukraine. For now, though, that appears a distant hope. Those who oppose Moscow’s aggression need to raise the costs to Russia and prepare for what could be a long and difficult struggle., A Slow, then Rapid Escalation, Russia’s bombardment marks a dramatic escalation in a war it has waged against Ukraine since 2014. Back then, protests supporting closer links to the European Union led to the ouster of a pro-Moscow president. Russia, which saw a Western hand in both the unrest and Kyiv’s new government, annexed the Crimean peninsula and sent weapons and personnel to support separatists in the eastern Donbas region. Two ceasefire deals signed in 2014 and 2015 – the Minsk accords – brought an end to the worst of the fighting and left separatists in control of about a third of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where they proclaimed the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR). The Minsk deals laid out a roadmap for peace and reintegration of the separatist-controlled regions under an undefined “special status”. Moscow saw the deals as a way to force Kyiv to absorb its proxies into a confederation, in which separatist-controlled entities would exercise a veto over any major decision. Kyiv had no inclination to move in this direction, and faulted Moscow for failing to withdraw weapons and forces, as the Minsk deals also stipulated., Moscow’s preparations for this latest phase of the war stretch back to at least the spring of 2021. Increasingly frustrated with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who came to power in 2019 having campaigned on promises of peace but refused to implement the Minsk agreements on Russia’s terms, Moscow deployed near Ukraine’s border what looked like the beginnings of an invasion force. It subsequently pulled back many troops though it left infrastructure in place. A second build-up began in the autumn of 2021, this time with greater numbers of soldiers and with deployments on new fronts, including Belarus in the north and Crimea in the south., The deployments prompted a frenzy of diplomacy aimed at averting war. Western states embarked on a two-pronged diplomatic campaign – making clear, first, that any new aggression in Ukraine would be met with harsh economic sanctions and a build-up of NATO forces near Russia’s borders and, secondly, that if Russian forces pulled back, Western governments were ready to negotiate new limits on activities, exercises and deployments in Europe. Moscow responded with its own demands, while claiming that Westerners were “hysterically” exaggerating its build-up. It wanted NATO and the U.S. to sign binding treaties pledging not to expand the alliance further, especially not to any more former Soviet countries; remove all military forces to countries that were already NATO members when the Soviet Union collapsed; and eschew intermediate-range missile and U.S. nuclear weapon deployments in Europe. While NATO refused to close its door to new members, Western leaders communicated to Moscow that they had no plans to allow Ukraine or Georgia to join; could mutually limit intermediate-range missile deployments, exercises and activities; and were ready to embark upon a long-deferred broader discussion about the European security architecture. They declassified and shared intelligence regarding the build-up and Moscow’s plans, which appeared to include a large-scale invasion and occupation of much of Ukraine., Weeks of negotiations and Russian troop movements continued side by side, until things escalated in mid-February. The line of contact between separatist- and government-held territory in Donbas, which had been mostly quiet throughout the build-up, saw a sharp increase in shelling. Russian and separatist-controlled media, which heretofore had focused on denouncing Western hysteria and played down the risks of war, portrayed the fighting as the start of a Ukrainian campaign to reconquer the separatist-held territories, amid an attempted genocide of the Russian-speaking population. Ukraine, for its part, insisted that it did not start the shooting, and the Ukrainian army accused separatist combatants of shelling their own territory for propaganda purposes. Russia’s genocide claims relied on doctored and out-of-context images that were easily debunked. On 17 February, the heads of the DNR and LNR announced the evacuation of their civilian populations to Rostov, in Russia, seemingly to the surprise of Rostov’s governor, who indicated he had no preparations in place. By 22 February, some 90,000 refugees had arrived, according to Moscow, despite continuing gaps in availability of housing and food. The refugees are overwhelmingly women, children and the elderly. The separatists announced the mobilisation of the entire male population aged eighteen to 55 and prohibited the men from leaving., At the same time, Russian sabre-rattling grew louder. Exercises in the Black Sea sharply curtailed freedom of movement and navigation. Moscow also held nuclear and conventional strategic deterrence forces drills, including launches of ballistic and cruise missiles on 19 February. While likely scheduled long in advance, these contributed to a sense that Russia was preparing for war. Elsewhere near the Ukrainian border, Russian forces moved ever closer, in sharp contrast to promises by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to start withdrawing troops at the end of exercises. Indeed, joint Russia-Belarus military exercises, which were the pretext for tens of thousands of Russian troops to gather in Belarus on Ukraine’s northern flank – some 200km from Kyiv – were extended beyond their scheduled end date of 20 February, with the Belarusian Ministry of Defence citing rising tensions in Donbas. There and elsewhere, Russian troop and weapon formations grew smaller, more widely dispersed and better hidden. Satellite images showed a new pontoon bridge in southern Belarus across the Pripyat, a major river that runs parallel to the Belarus-Ukraine border, positioned to cut the route from staging positions to the Ukrainian capital by 70km., A flicker of hope on 20 February was soon dashed. Putin and French President Macron spoke twice by telephone, and pledged to continue talks, including to facilitate a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden, who agreed to meet, subject to the condition that there be no further escalation by Russia. The next day, on 21 February, Moscow televised a visibly staged Putin-led meeting of the Russian National Security Council, convened to discuss the possible recognition of the two breakaway republics, and then broadcast Putin’s speech announcing that recognition. The speech portrayed NATO as a hostile enemy bent on weakening and constraining Russia. It was marked by anti-Ukraine vitriol and rejection of Ukrainian nationhood, reaching back into history to cast blame on Vladimir Lenin for having recognised Ukraine as a Soviet republic during the post-revolutionary period. The recognition of the DNR and LNR rendered the Minsk agreements moot. It created a pretext for Moscow to send in troops, ostensibly as peacekeepers to defend the LNR and DNR, which in Moscow’s view were now empowered to consent to their presence. It also underscored Putin’s dismissal of Ukraine’s legitimacy as a nation-state., As more Russian troops entered separatist-held areas, Ukraine, on 23 February, declared a state of emergency, called up reservists and passed a law allowing citizens to carry firearms and use them in self-defence. That evening, President Zelenskyy reported that his efforts to reach Putin had been in vain. Speaking Russian on his Telegram channel, he addressed the Russian people in a heartfelt plea to prevent war. Referring to Moscow’s propaganda, Zelenskyy went on to ask how he, the grandson of a man who served out World War II in the Soviet infantry and died in independent Ukraine, could be a Nazi (Zelenskyy is also Jewish). Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by saying Kremlin officials were not sure what the two presidents might discuss, though they were not opposed to talks if those could “cut the Gordian knot” of eastern Ukraine. As Russia’s bombardment started, Kyiv officially broke diplomatic ties with Moscow., The First Day of Full-scale War, While much remains unclear, Russia appears to have begun its assault with long-range strikes targeting military and other infrastructure throughout Ukraine, including near Kyiv and other major cities across the country such as the Black Sea port of Odessa, as well as eastern industrial hubs Kharkiv, Dnipro and Mariupol. Western Ukraine was not spared, with bombs landing in the Lviv region and near Lutsk. The initial bombing may have aimed to destroy Ukraine’s air defence capability, such as it was. It may also have intended to menace Ukrainians and demonstrate Russia’s massive military superiority. Already reports suggest the bombing has killed and wounded dozens of civilians., Russian ground forces, including columns of heavy armour and artillery, then advanced from Crimea in the south and Belarus in the north, even as helicopters delivered more personnel to locations elsewhere. Numerous reports of fighting, particularly in the south, were followed by news that Russian forces had taken parts of Ukraine, including Kherson in the south, Sumy in the north east, and the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Hostomel airport near Kyiv changed hands at least twice. Fighting also raged in Donbas. A variety of sources presented visual evidence of casualties on both sides and prisoners of war taken by Ukraine. How long Ukrainian forces will be able to resist is simply unclear., If Russia’s goal is a demilitarised, compliant Ukraine, as Putin’s statements and speeches indicate, it is hard to see how it can achieve this end without some element of military occupation. The deployments of Russian National Guard troops alongside offensive units to Ukraine’s borders since the start of 2022 suggest that Moscow has been preparing to occupy at least parts of Ukraine. Over time, occupation will almost surely face resistance and be enormously expensive, which may lead Moscow to try to install a surrogate government. But creating a governing authority capable of controlling a hostile population will also be costly and difficult, although Moscow may either expect – likely mistakenly – that most Ukrainians will go along or believe that the brutal methods it is prepared to deploy will cow them. It is also not clear how seriously Moscow meant its demand, late on February 24, that Ukraine surrender, and commit to both neutrality and demilitarisation. But Kyiv, which thus far is defiant, is highly unlikely to comply., If Russia may not count on rapid Ukrainian capitulation, Putin’s refusal to talk to Zelenskyy on the evening of 23 February may indicate a Russian desire to punish Ukraine before accepting any surrender, which would mean continued bombardments. As Russian troops move in, both the expected resistance to them and their response to it will inevitably put civilians in jeopardy. So, of course, do the bombardments., Moreover, rumours and U.S. intelligence assessments of Russian plans for incarceration and even murder of serving Ukrainian officials and others raise concerns about potential violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in a Ukraine under Russian control. People with ties to Western organisations will likely face increased danger. So, too, will those affiliated with groups, movements and identities demonised by Moscow, such as LGBTQ+ individuals., Beyond that, if Russia does occupy most or all of Ukraine, Ukrainians can look to some degree to what happened in the DNR and LNR for a glimpse of their future. It is likely that a Russian-occupied Ukraine would face sanctions, meaning that its economy would deteriorate. Russia’s goal is a subdued, not prosperous, Ukraine and support from Russia – whose own economy will be groaning under new sanctions – is likely to be meagre. Mass migration to parts of Ukraine not controlled by Russia, and perhaps to neighbouring states, is likely if it remains feasible. So is migration to Russia itself. Unlike in the LNR and DNR, active opposition, and perhaps even armed resistance, is certainly on the cards, though its shape and scope is hard to predict., Moscow’s Logic, As Crisis Group has previously noted, President Putin has chosen a path marked by risk and uncertainty for Russia. The question is not who will win the war. Ukraine is overmatched by the Russian military. But as the U.S. learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, toppling a government and creating something viable in its place are two very different things. Installing a surrogate regime capable of controlling a hostile population absent Russian military backing will be difficult, even if that government extends the in terrorem tactics that Moscow appears ready to deploy to stamp out opposition to its designs. Outright occupation would be enormously expensive. The extent to which the Russian economy will be able to bear the crippling sanctions the West envisages is unknown. Meantime, Putin’s aggressive campaign has breathed new life into NATO and provoked precisely the kind of troop build-up on its borders that he has been trying to discourage. While many non-Western countries until now have avoided strong condemnation of Russia’s belligerence, invading a sovereign country on such a flimsy pretext may do lasting damage to Putin’s international standing beyond the West., Why, then, such a dangerous move? The story told in President Putin’s speech reflects a worldview in which the eastward expansion of Western institutions is a zero-sum game that intentionally limits, weakens and aims to coerce Russia politically, militarily and economically. As Putin said, even if Ukraine is not on track to join NATO, Moscow sees its growing ties to the alliance as a danger, likely to lead to the deployment of NATO forces and infrastructure in Ukraine, all with the aim of menacing Russia. Moscow does not trust NATO verbal promises that Ukraine will not join and that no infrastructure will be deployed in the country. It sees NATO expansion to date, for which it mostly blames the U.S., as a substantial breach of faith. Historians debate the degree of assurance offered to the Soviet Union that the alliance would not grow, but it is clear that no formal guarantees were granted to Moscow. This historical experience helps explain the Russian demand for “legally binding” agreements this time around., Still, other factors are likely at play in President Putin’s decision to opt for war. One might be that Moscow judges military force as one of its more successful tools in recent years. In Syria, Russia’s intervention turned the course of the war, propping up the Bashar al-Assad regime and placing Russia squarely in a critical role. Moscow may see its 2008 intervention in Georgia as having helped prevent that country from aligning more closely with NATO and the EU. It may believe that only the use of force will convince Ukraine and Ukrainians that they have no choice but alignment with Russia — particularly as Western states will not ride to their rescue. As stated earlier, it may either underestimate the hostility Moscow’s policies since 2014 inspire in Ukraine outside separatist-held areas or be confident in its ability to overcome resistance with blood-curdling brutality., The tendency toward coercion may have been strengthened during the last two years as an already narrow advisory circle around Putin shrunk further due to COVID-19 precautions. As one observer argues, this circle likely has come to exclude those who are more moderate and focused on economic development in favour of those who take a harder line and are prone to the zero-sum views described above. Those people, and it seems Putin himself, see a West that is simultaneously losing ground geopolitically and acting aggressively toward Russia, creating both opportunity and imperative for Moscow to press its advantage. By this calculus, Ukraine, with such close historical ties to Russia, would be a logical place for the Kremlin to draw a line. This group, moreover, is unlikely to be deterred by sanctions, taking the view that the West is determined to deploy these in an effort to strangle Russia’s economy whatever it does, and irrelevant to themselves personally, as many are already designated., The war is almost certainly long in the planning. The build-up near Ukraine, beginning with the smaller version in the spring of 2021, gave Moscow the options it has now acted upon. Moscow’s moves of recent weeks show signs of having been carefully orchestrated. The 21 February National Security Council meeting not only looked wooden, despite Putin’s assurances that it was not, but appeared to have been taped well in advance, based on the watches visible on participants’ wrists. Open-source intelligence journalists questioned whether the evacuation from the breakaway republics was performative after spotting in the video’s metadata that both separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk recorded the calls for evacuation on the morning of 16 February, two days before they were aired. Long-planned does not necessarily mean inevitable. But Moscow’s unwillingness to budge from its initial maximalist negotiating positions and its continued escalation, all the while meeting Western leaders and in some instances even promising to withdraw troops, suggest that there was not much hope that it would accept a negotiated settlement short of total capitulation., Critics of Western policy look at fateful decisions with respect to NATO’s post-Cold War enlargement and suggest that this crisis is partly of the alliance’s own making. But whatever that argument’s merits, the complete reversion to the pre-1997 status quo that Russia demanded was never realistic over the past few months, and it is out of the question now. So too was its insistence that NATO formally pledge to cease expansion. First, while the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act prohibits the permanent stationing of substantial NATO forces on the territories of new members, many of those new members see the presence on their soil of smaller, rotational forces as critical for security, not least because they believe them crucial to dispel any thought Moscow might have of aggressive action – hardly an academic consideration given the course of events in Ukraine. Secondly, although they made clear that they are not looking to admit Ukraine any time soon, NATO members are not as a matter of principle prepared to rescind the open-ended promise that they made in 2008. Thirdly, Western governments were quite reasonably worried about the precedent they might set by appearing to cave in to Russian gunboat diplomacy and the possibility that domestic political opponents might try to tar them as weak., Against this backdrop, the U.S. and its NATO partners took the best course available to them, making clear that they would support but not militarily defend Ukraine; coming together behind a significant set of costs to impose in the event of further aggression; exposing Russian plans and intentions so as to rob it of legitimising arguments before an international audience; and creating a serious diplomatic option to discuss the issues of greatest concern to Moscow. This approach was never guaranteed to succeed. But the alternatives – either putting military confrontation among nuclear powers on the table or doing nothing, thus encouraging the impression of cost-free aggression – would have been worse., Responding to Russia’s Aggression, After months of crisis diplomacy have failed to avert what could well be Europe’s biggest war in a generation, attention now needs to turn to doing whatever possible to limit the damage. All meaningful responsibility lies with Moscow, which ideally would return to talks with both Kyiv and Western powers and indeed could still benefit from negotiations over the European security architecture. But with the Kremlin seemingly bent on a more destructive path, others must do what they can to maximise the costs for Russia, to both deter future aggression and, though this appears to be a tall order for now, motivate some rectification of the situation in Ukraine., The toughest decisions in the coming period likely rest with President Zelenskyy. Severely outgunned, he will need to decide how to wage the war, and what cost his government and the Ukrainian people more broadly are prepared to sustain in defending their homeland. Polling, at least, showed nearly 60 per cent of Ukrainians willing to resist as of mid-February; but with bombs falling and families threatened it is difficult to know whether that sentiment will harden or fade. Kyiv will need to make its calculations without any illusion that NATO member states will come to their aid beyond providing some arms. Even before Putin appeared to threaten to use nuclear weapons in his 24 February speech, Western powers had, understandably, made clear that their military intervention is not on the cards., For Western powers, the challenges will be of a different nature. Most have already reacted with outrage to what they described as an unjustifiable attack on Europe’s stability and the international order. U.S. President Biden warned of a “catastrophic loss of life” and EU’s chief executive Ursula von der Leyen dubbed Russia’s advance “barbaric”. While reiterating that NATO troops would not enter the fight, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg harshly condemned the Russian action: ""Peace on our continent has been shattered,” he said. “This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion. Russia is using force to try to rewrite history”. Western states also reportedly prepared a UN Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s action, although Moscow is expected to veto when it comes to a vote. The question is what they can do beyond using strong rhetoric that is at once meaningful and mindful of the need to avoid a potentially cataclysmic escalation., The main focus will be on putting in place and rigorously enforcing sanctions that Western leaders have been threatening for weeks, which will be critical if the bloc’s threats are to be seen as a credible deterrent in the future. As of 23 February, the U.S., EU and others including the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia had already imposed limited sanctions in response to Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s two separatist regions. The measures hit Russian banks and individuals and took steps toward cutting Russia out of world financial markets. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s decision to put on ice approval for Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline to pump gas to Germany was particularly stark because of Berlin’s longtime support for the project and may have helped catalyse the European response. In response to the 24 February attacks, President Biden announced further measures, including sanctions on four Russia’s major state banks and the imposition of export controls to deprive Russia of technological goods that would, in his words, cut off over half of Russia’s high-tech imports. The EU is expected to follow suit. South Korea has also now said it would join in the sanctions regime., As Western powers take these steps, they should be clear about what Moscow can do – namely, reverse its aggression in Ukraine – to get sanctions lifted. This is unlikely to have much impact on a Kremlin leadership that is expecting a heavy economic blow. But it would signal to the Russian people that their political leaders have the power to mitigate the shocks they are about to suffer. Popular sentiment in Moscow suggests a less enthusiastic mood about this military adventure than that which greeted (for example) Putin’s 2014 move against Crimea. Though it is a difficult line to walk, the U.S. and other Western powers should do what they can to stay on the right side of the Russian public by avoiding gratuitously punitive measures, such as a blanket visa ban, that would work at cross-purposes with longer-term goals., NATO members will also have to recalibrate their force posture in Europe, to reassure allies near Russia first and foremost. They will almost certainly raise the tempo of military exercises. The NATO-Russia Founding Act and its commitments will surely join the wealth of other agreements lately sent to the dustbin. Putin’s threat of extreme consequences notwithstanding, Western powers should continue to support the Ukrainian state with weapons and supplies while that remains feasible. At the same time, as tempers run high on both sides of the East-West line, and more NATO forces arrive close to Russia’s frontiers, it will be more important than ever that command centres on both sides keep lines open for deconfliction and de-escalation of tensions that could build around higher-than-normal levels of activity., The West should not be the only bloc that is sending messages to Moscow. The more that non-aligned countries can communicate to Moscow the reputational costs its aggression will incur, the better. They could echo themes in Kenya’s intervention at the 21 February UN Security Council meeting: spelling out, in other words, the carnage that would follow if the rest of the world decides to abrogate borders in the ostensible service of uniting like peoples. China, if it chose to, could play a useful role. Though at first muted in backing Russia’s moves, Beijing made statements on 24 February that were more supportive of Moscow and avoided calling Russia’s attack on Ukraine an invasion. Whatever China’s geostrategic calculations to date, it should weigh seriously the risks of throwing its lot in with Putin. Russia’s war is a frontal assault on the principle of sovereignty, which China has tended to treat as inviolable. The risks, uncertainty and economic shock waves the crisis will unleash create headaches for everyone, including Beijing., Preparing to tackle the humanitarian fallout must be another priority. If war continues – particularly if followed by occupation – tens or hundreds of thousands of people, potentially even more, could be displaced, seeking safety and security. Access to necessary medical care for civilians will be at a premium. Ukraine, which thus far appears not to have prepared sufficiently for such eventualities, will need to do what it can, as fast as it can, in cooperation with international organisations and NGOs. Neighbouring countries, which have begun to take steps to get ready, will need to do more. All planning should build on the experience humanitarian organisations have gained in Donbas over the past eight years. Local organisations, many of which will be uprooted by the invasion, should be given a chance to participate early on in the humanitarian response. Russia itself will have to cope with refugee flows, and be prepared to take on most if not all humanitarian responsibilities in areas it controls. International bodies that monitor the commission of wartime atrocities should also signal that they will be watching the situation as it evolves. For example, the UN General Assembly or Human Rights Council could mandate a fact-finding mission or similar body to collect any evidence of breaches of international law or human rights abuses committed as the hostilities unfold or in any subsequent occupation., For now, diplomacy and the counter-measures that the West has prepared are unlikely to change the mood in Moscow, and things could well get worse before they get better. War in Ukraine and a military build-up in Eastern Europe all but guarantee new crises, each potentially that much more volatile. While Ukraine clearly holds special significance in Moscow, and to Putin himself, it cannot entirely be assumed that Russia will stop there. As Western states run out of economic punishments to dole out, the pressure to respond militarily will increase. The growing risk means that continued talks about European security and arms control, nuclear and conventional, are necessary, even if, for now, they sadly appear far from reach. Unless and until things indeed escalate to unprecedented levels, the U.S. and the EU will have to resume dialogue with Russia sooner or later, both to ensure that everyone understands fully the consequences of the path they are on and to identify ways to avoid further disaster., As tanks roll over European borders for the first time in decades, it is tempting to look somewhere for hope. Today, sadly, that is in short supply. Right now, it is up to those countries that want to avoid a future made safe for aggressors to demonstrate unity and gird themselves to meet the challenges that lie ahead with prudence and resolve.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-europe-responding-russia-s-invasion-ukraine

24 FEBRUARY 2022, Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ statement on Ukraine, in New York today:, We are seeing Russian military operations inside the sovereign territory of Ukraine on a scale that Europe has not seen in decades., Day after day, I have been clear that such unilateral measures conflict directly with the United Nations Charter. The Charter is clear: “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”, The use of force by one country against another is the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold. This applies to the present military offensive. It is wrong. It is against the Charter. It is unacceptable. But it is not irreversible. I repeat my appeal from last night to President [Vladimir] Putin: stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia., We know the toll of war. With deaths rising, we are seeing images of fear, anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine. People — everyday innocent people — always pay the highest price. That is why the United Nations is scaling up our humanitarian operations in and around Ukraine., Today, I am announcing that we will immediately allocate $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to meet urgent needs. We and our humanitarian partners are committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need., United Nations staff are working on both sides of the contact line, always guided by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, humanity and independence. We are providing life-saving humanitarian relief to people in need, regardless of who or where they are.

GENERAL ASSEMBLYPLENARY
SEVENTY-SIXTH SESSION, 58TH & 59TH MEETINGS (AM & PM), Speakers Deplore Russian Federation’s Military Deployment into Donetsk, Luhansk, The General Assembly discussed recent developments in eastern Ukraine today, with the top United Nations official declaring that the Russian Federation has punctured the inviolability of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by its formal acknowledgement of the independence of the latter’s territories of Donetsk and Luhansk., Secretary-General António Guterres said that the Minsk agreements — a set of international accords that aim to end the war in Ukraine’s Donbas region — have been “surviving in an intensive care unit thanks to a number of life-supporting devices” until the recognition by the Russian Federation of the “so-called independence” of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, in violation of that State’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He urged a return to dialogue and negotiation in pursuit of a peaceful resolution of the dispute, pledging that the United Nations will continue its humanitarian and human rights work to help all those residing within Ukraine’s borders, “independent of whoever might control the territory where people are living”., Abdulla Shahid (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, recalled the words of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, reminding delegates: “The United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell”. The Organization’s mandate stipulates that disputes between Member States must be settled by peaceful means and in accordance with international law, he emphasized., Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, issued a stark warning: “Russia will not stop at Ukraine.” He went on to point out that President Vladimir Putin has “outright denied Ukraine’s right to exist”, even as he recognized the independence of its Donetsk and Luhansk territories. Evoking the long shadow cast by the Second World War, he warned that the current moment represents the largest security crisis since that time. As Russian tanks roll into eastern Ukraine, “there is no more important task today than to not repeat the mistakes of the past”, he stressed., He went on to state that President Putin wishes to prove that the United Nations is indecisive and unable to defend its core principles. The global community should respond with “concrete actions to stop the Russian machine of war without stepping into a bloody conflict with many thousands of casualties”, he said, emphasizing that time remains for diplomacy to prevail. However, “Ukraine will not hesitate to exercise its right to self-defence” in countering armed attacks by the Russian Federation, he reaffirmed., The Russian Federation’s delegate said that since the “failed Maidan coup” of 2014, Ukraine has conducted a “hate-filled policy against its own citizens”. Despite Russian efforts for negotiations in Security Council meetings and other international arenas, Ukraine has avoided dialogue with the Donbas region and ignored the interests of broad swathes of the population, he said, adding that it has also sabotaged calls by Member States for an inclusive dialogue., He went on to state that while the people of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk have declared their independence, Ukraine has no plans for dialogue on the matter, and instead carries out bloody military adventures while waging war on the Russian language as part of a deliberate State policy of “linguistic inquisition”. After eight years of economic, transport and food embargoes on the Donbas, the Russian Federation has decided that the region’s people can consider themselves independent, he declared, adding that his country, through its armed forces, will seek to ensure that the ceasefire there will be monitored., Syria’s representative, referring to the subject’s inclusion on the Assembly’s agenda, noted that the Charter of the United Nations decrees that the Assembly must not make any recommendation on a matter while it is under consideration by the Security Council. He went on to state that the Ukraine crisis has been manufactured by Western States, masterminded by the United States with the aim of undercutting the Russian Federation., China’s delegate said that, while Beijing’s position on sovereignty and territorial integrity remains constant, the situation in Ukraine “is tangled in a historical web”. As a result, all parties should engage in dialogue and seek solutions through peaceful means, he added., Numerous speakers insisted that the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter be upheld, decrying the Russian Federation’s aggressive stance and proposing the concrete steps — including sanctions — needed to encourage diplomacy and deter further aggression., Tariq Ahmad, the United Kingdom’s Minister for South Asia, North Africa, the United Nations and the Commonwealth at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, highlighted the steps that his country’s Government has taken to stop President Putin’s expansionist ambitions. The sanctions already enacted against the Russian Federation are “just the start”, he emphasized, adding that more measures have been prepared and are “ready to go”., Tobias Lindner, Germany’s Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office, recognized the existential threat — as well as the threat to the rules-based international order — posed by the words of the President of a United Nations Member State calling into question the statehood of a fellow Member State. He said that since 2014, Germany and France have been working towards implementation of the Minsk agreements and remain willing to continue that effort for European peace and security., The representative of the United States expressed her consternation that President Putin has asked the world to turn back a century and re-enter “an age of empires”. Emphasizing that the world will not be going back to an era of empires, colonies, or even the Soviet Union, she declared: “This is Putin’s war of choice.” The fruits of his decision will be seen in the actions taken by the United States and its allies to deter further aggression., Canada’s delegate quoted from Article 2 of the United Nations Charter: “The Organization is based on the principles of the sovereign equality of all its members.” In other words, he said, “there is no back of the bus at the United Nations” and no nation is more, or less, entitled to its sovereignty than any other. He went on to criticize Moscow’s use of the word “peacekeeping” to define the role of its troops in eastern Ukraine., Lithuania’s representative echoed that sentiment on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, saying the Russian Federation’s designation of “peacekeepers” to describe its forces in Donetsk and Luhansk is a perversion of the concept. He also condemned Moscow’s accelerated issuance of Russian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Crimea and their forced conscription into the Russian Armed Forces. That points towards a deliberate policy of accelerating systemic demographic change, he noted., Georgia’s delegate said the current military aggression against Ukraine mirrors his own country’s experience. “We are seeing the very same playbook in action in Ukraine,” he warned, recalling that Russian forces occupied the regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali in 2008. Moscow then recognized them as sovereign entities, leading to their annexation. What the Russian Federation is exhibiting is a pattern of behaviour that undermines the entire international rules-based order, he pointed out, emphasizing that the international community does not recognize the Russian-occupied regions of Georgia and nor will it accept Moscow’s recognition of Ukraine’s territories., Turkey’s representative struck a similar tone, noting that the Russian Federation’s acts of aggression struck close to home. “We do not need, nor do we want, a new war in our region,” he emphasized. As a neighbour to both States, Turkey is more than ready to help them return to the negotiating table without delay and is willing to host any technical or high-level meetings that may be needed, he said., Also speaking were representatives of Japan, Costa Rica, Mexico, France, Albania, Saudi Arabia (for the Gulf Cooperation Council), Liechtenstein, Poland, Croatia, Netherlands, Switzerland, New Zealand, Italy, Czech Republic, Australia, Republic of Moldova, Chile, Romania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Paraguay, Palau, San Marino, Guatemala, Uruguay, Peru, Hungary, Liberia, Ecuador, Slovakia, Austria, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Belgium, Colombia, Kenya, Slovenia, Singapore, Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg, Spain, Lebanon, Federated States of Micronesia, Greece, Libya, South Africa, Jordan, Marshall Islands, Egypt, Portugal, Azerbaijan, Argentina, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Samoa and Thailand., Also speaking was the Head of the European Union Delegation., The General Assembly will continue its debate on Monday 28 February., Opening Remarks, ABDULLA SHAHID (Maldives), President of the General Assembly, noted that “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war” are among the first very words of the Charter of the United Nations, the main motivation for creating the Organization, the founders of which had lived through the devastation of two world wars by 1945. The United Nations, he added, holds as its mandate that disputes or situations in which peace may be broken shall be settled by peaceful means and in conformity with justice and the principles of international law, through political solutions, diminishing human suffering and the massive economic costs of conflicts and their aftermath by preventing conflicts in the first place. Calling upon Member States to “deploy the tools that we have to resolve disputes”, he emphasized diplomacy, good offices and mediation to “give peace all the chance it deserves”. Urging the parties to intensify negotiations and de-escalate the current trajectory through dialogue, he further quoted Dag Hammarskjöld, the former Secretary-General, who said 68 years ago that the United Nations “was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell”., ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said one thing is clear in the present situation: the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the “so-called independence” of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions — and the follow-up — are violations of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Further, it is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly more than 50 years ago. That Declaration — cited repeatedly by the International Court of Justice as international law — affirms that “the territorial integrity and political independence of the State are inviolable”. Pointing out that the Minsk agreements were “surviving in an intensive care unit thanks to a number of life-support devices”, he said those devices have been disconnected., He went on to express concern about preserving the integrity of peacekeeping, pointing out that United Nations peace operations require the host country’s consent. Against that backdrop, he called for a ceasefire and a return to dialogue and negotiation to save the people in Ukraine and beyond from the scourge of war. He urged all parties to make full use of Article 33 of the Charter and its diverse instruments for the pacific settlement of disputes. The United Nations system continues to support the people of Ukraine through human rights and humanitarian efforts, he said, adding that such operations are “independent of whoever might control the territory where people are living”. He emphasized: “Our humanitarian agencies are committed to staying and delivering to support the people in Ukraine.” All sides should allow safe and unimpeded access, including in non-Government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, he stressed. All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, he added, while committing to support all efforts to resolve the crisis without further bloodshed. “We cannot and will not relent in the search for a peaceful solution”, he said., Statements, DMYTRO KULEBA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, emphasized the need for swift, concrete and resolute actions by the United Nations and the international community to match the threat posed by the Russian Federation’s aggression. The international community is at a critical juncture, he said. “There is no more important task today than to not repeat the mistakes of the past.” He stressed the need to avert a catastrophe in Europe “that no nation will be able to sit out”. Describing the current moment as “the largest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War”, he underlined that it was unliterally created by the Russian Federation. That country’s accusations against Ukraine are absurd, as Ukraine has never planned and does not plan any military offensive in the Donbas region, he added, noting that President Vladimir Putin has “outright denied Ukraine’s right to exist”. He warned against the new threat of “revanchist rule rising over Europe” as the Russian President recognized the independence of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and ordered the deployment of Russian Federation armed forces in those areas., Describing those actions as an attack on the United Nations and the core principles of international law, he said Moscow has also unilaterally withdrawn from the Minsk agreements. Its tanks are rolling into eastern Ukraine. “It is clear that President Putin will not stop by himself”, he asserted, cautioning that “this is a grim scenario that will throw us back to the darkest times of the twentieth century”. He continued: “Russia will not stop at Ukraine,” warning that if a permanent member of the Security Council succeeds in breaking all the rules, others will be inspired by its actions. President Putin is trying to prove that the United Nations is weak, indecisive and unable to defend its core principles. Welcoming yesterday’s statement by the Secretary-General, he said “every hour of inaction now is a threat to the lives of Ukrainians”. Kyiv expects a proportionate response by the international community, including “concrete actions to stop the Russian machine of war without stepping into a bloody conflict with many thousands of causalities”, he said, underlining that there is still an opportunity for diplomacy, even as the Russian Federation continues its escalations and provocations., Under the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Vienna document, the troop build-up falls under “unusual military activities” that require explanation, he stated. In addition, Moscow has filled the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov with at least 46 vessels and its activities amount to a near blockade of Ukrainian seaports, he noted. The Russian Federation’s propaganda machine is in full swing, he added, rejecting allegations of Ukrainian military operations in Donbas. He said that a “secret prison” in Donetsk remains inaccessible and functions as a “literal concentration camp in Europe in the twenty-first century”. Hundreds of people have passed through the prison, with many subjected to forced labour and others to extrajudicial killings, he added. The President of Ukraine has handed to the Secretary-General a list of more than 100 Ukrainians from Donbas and Crimea who have been unlawfully detained, with some transferred to the Russian Federation. He called upon the Secretary-General to use his good offices to facilitate their immediate release., Since 2014, the General Assembly has already adopted 11 resolutions reaffirming its commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity, he recalled. In 1994, Ukraine denuclearized, giving up the world’s third largest arsenal. It has no plans to regain them and expects the world to ensure its security with resolute actions, he said. Some years ago, Ukraine proposed the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission on its territory, but the Security Council failed to take the necessary decisions in that regard, he recalled. Ukraine proposes sanctions as well as keeping diplomatic channels open to deter the Russian Federation, he said. The international community should “put out the fire at the centre of Europe”, he added, underscoring that whereas Ukrainians want peace and to resolve issues through diplomacy, they stand ready to protect their land. “Ukraine will not hesitate to exercise its right to self-defence under Article 51” of the Charter of the United Nations in response to the armed attacks of the Russian Federation, he emphasized. This is the last chance to do what Moscow does not expect the United Nations and its Member States to do, which is to act in order to stop aggression, he added., TARIQ AHMAD, Minister for South Asia, North Africa, the United Nations and the Commonwealth at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom, expressing unwavering support for Ukraine, said the Russian Federation has chosen the path of confrontation over the path of dialogue. At every step, Moscow has rebuffed offers of diplomacy and discarded its commitments, he said, emphasizing that the United Nations must respond and call on the Russian Federation to uphold the United Nations founding principles. Peace must prevail, he stressed, adding that it is essential to meet the Russian Federation’s actions with a collective response. Recalling the United Kingdom’s deep, unprecedented sanctions against the Russian Federation, he said “this is just the start”, adding that a further package of measures is “ready to go”. Recalling the Russian Federation’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, he said the General Assembly had spoken out in support of the territorial integrity of all nations. Today, the Russian Federation’s actions are a challenge to global peace and security, as well as the international order. “We must stop President Putin’s expansionist ambitions,” he said, emphasizing that the international community — which stands with the people of Ukraine — must tell the Russian Federation to stop., TOBIAS LINDNER Minister of State of the Federal Foreign Office of Germany, said the President of a United Nations Member State has called into question the statehood of a fellow Member State, asking what that action means for a State’s right to exist and for the multilateral rules-based international order. The Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the so-called independence of Donetsk and Luhansk violates the core principles of the United Nations Charter, he emphasized, echoing the Secretary-General to the effect that those principles “are not an à la carte menu”. The Russian Federation’s irresponsible and provocative action comes at the time of a massive build-up on Ukraine’s borders and a disturbing flow of disinformation and false flag operations, he said, noting that the attack on Ukraine’s territorial integrity comes eight years after Moscow’s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula. Commending Ukraine’s continued restraint in the face of aggression, he said that since 2014, France and Germany have been working towards implementation of the Minsk agreements and remain willing to chart a way forward to stability and security in Europe. Calling for an immediate ceasefire in Donbas, he condemned the shelling of civilian infrastructure. He urged the Russian Federation to deescalate now, withdraw its forces from Ukraine, refrain from any action fuelling the risk of full-fledged military conflict, and repeal its decision to recognize the independence of the territories in question., OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union Delegation, strongly condemned Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of the non-Government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine and the ensuing decision to send Russian troops into these areas. Noting that the Russian Federation is clearly violating the Minsk agreements, he said the European Union is responding with additional restrictive measures, including on all economic relations with the non-Government-controlled areas, as well as designations against individuals and entities responsible for undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity. He called upon the Russian Federation to constructively engage in the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group., Strongly condemning the recent increase of ceasefire violations as well as orders for mobilization issued by the de facto authorities in the non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine, he expressed deep concern about the Russian Federation’s continued actions to obstruct the presence of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in those areas. Calling upon Moscow to stop issuing Russian passports in large numbers to Ukrainian citizens in Luhansk and Donetsk, he further condemned the continuing deterioration of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law in those areas. Noting that 2.9 million Ukrainians are still in need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the conflict, he called for unhindered and sustained access for humanitarian actors., Turning to Crimea, he called upon all States to remain steadfast in their non-recognition of the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. Welcoming Ukraine’s efforts to continue to seek justice through international legal instruments and courts — including the European Court of Human Rights, in arbitration courts and the International Court of Justice, among others — he pointed out that the ongoing militarization of the Crimean peninsula has a negative impact on the security situation in the Black Sea region and beyond. Residents face systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as the rights to freedom of expression, religion or belief, association, and to peaceful assembly, he said. The European Union reaffirms its commitment to further support Ukraine’s resilience, including in countering cyber and hybrid threats and in tackling disinformation, he pledged., RYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), speaking on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, called on the Russian Federation to reverse its illegal actions, as they undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence and constitute a severe breach of international law and agreements, including the United Nations Charter, Helsinki Final Act, Paris Charter and Budapest Memorandum. Russian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine would be nothing other than an invasion of a sovereign State, he said, adding that calling them peacekeepers is a perversion of the concept of peacekeeping. Non-adherence to international law and its fundamental principles undermines the rules-based international order and effective multilateralism, he stressed, adding that the Nordic and Baltic countries stand in full solidarity with Ukraine., Recalling that the conflict instigated by the Russian Federation has resulted in around 14,000 deaths, 1.5 million people displaced, countless damages and suffering of those living on both sides of the contact line, he raised several concerns. Among them are continued arbitrary detentions, along with Moscow’s efforts of de facto integration and systemic demographic change, including the accelerated issuance of Russian passports on a massive scale to Ukrainian citizens and its forced conscription to the Russian Armed Forces. He urged Moscow to withdraw its forces and materiel from within Ukraine — including the Crimean Peninsula, non-Government-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts and border areas — to immediately stop fuelling the conflict, assume its responsibility as a party to the conflict, uphold its commitments, abide by international law and return to discussions within the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. He also called for the United Nations to continue efforts to restore respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that if today’s agenda item is to reflect reality, it should be titled “the territories lost as a result of Ukraine’s hate-filled policy against its own citizens”. Kyiv has waged such a policy since the “failed Maidan coup” in 2014 and, as soon as the current regime came into power with its Western backers, it has committed systematic violations of human rights. Negotiation efforts by the Russian Federation in numerous Security Council meetings and other international fora have been in vain, as for eight years, Kyiv has bombed its own citizens, shirked direct dialogue with the Donbas region and displayed unwillingness to consider the interests of broad sections of the population. He emphasized that, in any other crisis, Member States call for an inclusive dialogue between parties to conflict; without this, internal conflict cannot be resolved, and Ukraine has sabotaged such dialogue. He went on to express regret that the Secretary-General has made certain statements regarding the situation in eastern Ukraine, which were not in line with his status or mandate under the Charter of the United Nations., Questioning what good offices the Secretary-General could provide, he said the people of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk have declared their independence. The Maidan authorities had no plans for dialogue, and instead carried out two heinous, bloody military adventures that flouted the Minsk agreements. Further, Ukraine has waged war on the Russian language as part of State policy conducting, among other actions, a “linguistic inquisition”. For eight years, the people of the Donbas region have been subject to economic, transport and food embargos, the elderly and children were forced to hide from shelling and tens of thousands of refugees have fled into the Russian Federation. Now convinced that the situation is hopeless, the Russian Federation decided that the people of the Donbas region can consider themselves independent. He stressed that his country could not remain indifferent to the fate of these 4 million and warned that the ceasefire will be monitored by Russian armed forces. For its part, the international community must ensure that Kyiv does not conduct a new military adventure, for which all of Ukraine might pay dearly., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan) noted that his country has consistently supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the independence of certain regions in eastern Ukraine seriously undermines those very principles, in violation of international law. Strongly condemning these actions, he said Japan has announced sanctions, including the suspension of entry visa issuance and an asset freeze on the individuals concerned. Stressing that tensions should be de-escalated by the withdrawal of Russian troops, he expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Japan has made its own diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution, he said, expressing support for efforts by all countries to find a serious diplomatic solution to the crisis. “Unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion are unacceptable, regardless of where they occur,” he stressed., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) noted that, on 21 February, President Vladimir Putin declared his recognition of independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. He then ordered military forces, under the guise of peacekeeping, to enter these regions — actions which the Secretary-General warned are a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. In an emergency meeting the same day, all but one member of the Security Council called for diplomacy and dialogue, which can only take place if the Russian Federation abandons its aggression. Instead, it has responded with disinformation, cyberattacks and a “false flag pretext” for its build-up of nearly 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s border. The Russian Federation is the aggressor. “History tells us that looking the other way is the more costly path”, she said., Just this week, leaders in Moscow claimed that Ukraine is not a real country and questioned its right to exist, she continued. On 21 February, President Putin asked the world to travel back in time more than 100 years to “an age of empires”, asserting that the Russian Federation can recolonize its neighbours. In fact, the world will not return to an age of empires and colonies — or to the Soviet Union. The world has moved on and must now ensure, as the representative of Kenya reminded the Security Council, that “the embers of dead empires” do not ignite new forms of oppression and violence. Ordinary Russians should ask how many of their lives President Putin is willing to sacrifice to fulfil his ambitions, which could also create a new refugee crisis, with as many as 5 million people displaced. Recalling that Ukraine is a leading supplier of wheat, she said Moscow’s actions could increase hunger in places such as Yemen and Libya. Together with partners and allies, the United States President has taken decisive action to make the cost of Mr. Putin’s actions crystal clear. “This is Putin’s war of choice”, she stressed. If he chooses to escalate further, the Russian Federation will bear full responsibility for what is to come. “Former empires cannot lay claim to sovereign nations”, she said, urging the international community to show Moscow that it is isolated and alone in its aggressive actions., KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia), associating himself with the European Union, said the international community will never accept the Russian Federation’s “recognition” of Ukraine’s territories — as is the case with the Russian-occupied regions of Georgia. Today, another wave of the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine is well under way, aimed at redrawing sovereign borders. The security repercussions will go far beyond Ukraine, he said, recalling that current aggressions are repeating the same pattern of Moscow’s illegal actions against Georgia. That situation began with inciting and backing up puppet regimes in the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions, leading to a full-scale military aggression in 2008, their illegal occupation and to the Russian Federation’s recognition of the occupied territories as sovereign entities, creating a launch pad for their factual annexation. A “creeping annexation” continues today, he warned, adding that: “We are seeing the very same playbook in action in Ukraine.” This pattern of behaviour brazenly undermines the entire international rules-based order, poses grave threats to regional and global peace and security and is inconsistent with the way responsible States should act in the twenty-first century. Silence and acquiescence to land-grabbing today is tantamount to a crime. Instead, the international community must be united in defending the global rules-based system, the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe. He called on the Russian Federation to reverse its illegal “recognition”, immediately withdraw its military forces from Ukraine and its borders and abide by international law, as well as to do the same in the occupied Georgian regions., FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU (Turkey), recalling that the international community supports Ukraine, said this new act of aggression by the Russian Federation is unacceptable. Rejecting Moscow’s illegal actions, he said: “We do not need, nor do we want, a new war in our region.” Calling on the Russian Federation to reverse its actions, he urged parties to launch negotiations without delay, adding that as a neighbour to both, Turkey remains ready to facilitate this process and host technical and/or high-level meetings. Welcoming President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s proposal for a meeting among the “P5” — five permanent Security Council members (China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, United States) — along with Turkey, Germany and Ukraine, he said the global community now faces a threat to international peace and security. “Make no mistake,” he warned. “We all need a rules-based international order.”, RODRIGO A. CARAZO (Costa Rica) said collective security — to be legitimate — must respect international law, and compliance with the Charter is mandatory, even for the largest nations. Indeed, the “P5” States have “more obligations to international law” than others. Noting that the Budapest Memorandum saw nuclear-weapon States committing to respect Ukraine’s borders, he said the current actions violate the global non-proliferation regime. A State is only as strong as its word, he said, adding that all diplomatic avenues must be exhausted to avoid the potentially devastating humanitarian consequences of an armed conflict. Expressing regret that human rights defenders, minorities, journalists and others have been forced to flee, he said there is no freedom or plurality when there is censorship. Also, emerging threats stemming from new technologies must be addressed, including around the use of artificial intelligence and cyberattacks. Peace will not be sustainable unless it is inclusive, he said, emphasizing that the United Nations must be a place where dialogue prevails and where no one feels the need to pick weapons up in the first place., JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico), echoing calls on parties to respect existing agreements and principles, expressed hope that the Russian Federation’s recent statement to the Security Council — that it would not invade Ukraine — will be respected. The unanimously adopted Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) outlines the path to resolve the situation in Ukraine, in addition to other tools and mechanisms the United Nations possesses. Recalling Mexico’s recent proposal related to conflict resolution, he underlined the importance of de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue. Reiterating an appeal for the parties to ensure safe access for humanitarian actors to reach those in need, he said the current situation puts to the United Nations to a test. “It is time for us to fulfil our mandate,” he affirmed., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s unilateral recognition of the separatist regions of Ukraine and the deployment of its army as a violation of the latter’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and of the fundamental principles of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the basis for the continent’s stability. Expressing concern over the aspersions cast upon the very existence of the Ukrainian State by the highest Government officials of the Russian Federation, he called upon that State to review its decision and withdraw its troops to the internationally recognized borders. He emphasized that France will take action against Russian banks and against those who trade with the separatist entities, explaining that this new stage presents a real threat to European security. Condemning the use of heavy weaponry and the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas as a strategy of destabilization, he called for unified international reaction and ongoing mobilization within the General Assembly., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), associating himself with the European Union, cited the Russian Federation’s seizure of Crimea and its occupation of two other Ukrainian territories, stating: “No other member of the Security Council has committed such blatant violations of commitments and treaties it has signed since the Second World War.” The decision to recognize non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine as independent entities makes a mockery of the rules that govern relations between sovereign States and puts to an end the Minsk agreements, he emphasized, pointing out that the Russian Federation committed to respect those accords just days ago in the Security Council. The international community must stand by the Charter or yield to international bullying and the rule according to which “what is yours can be mine”, he said, stressing that the recent actions “should ring the alarm bell to every United Nations Member State”. The Russian Federation must immediately de-escalate and prepare the ground for the peaceful settlement of the dispute through diplomacy., MOHAMMED ABDULAZIZ H. ALATEEK (Saudi Arabia), speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, expressed support for international efforts to promote de-escalation, stability and political discussion in seeking a solution to the crisis. The Gulf Cooperation Council supports international law and the United Nations Charter, he said, particularly those provisions concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes; the non-use of force or threat thereof; and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. He urged all concerned parties to demonstrate calm and seek a solution to the conflict through peaceful means to ensure that civilians are not forced to “pay the price of military escalation”., CHRISTIAN WENAWESER (Liechtenstein) emphasized that today’s discussion concerns the international order itself — founded on the prohibition by the Charter of the United Nations of the threat or use of force against a State by another, and that such discussion is “of direct relevance to everyone in this room”. Condemning the Russian Federation’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as the subsequent ordering of its armed forces into the sovereign territory of Ukraine, he said Liechtenstein supports the inviolability of the latter’s frontiers and its right to determine its own relationships with other States and membership in international organizations. He called upon the Russian Federation to reverse its decisions. Pointing out that Ukraine’s diversity — including a significant population of Russian speakers — is a strength, he stressed that seeking to use such diversity as a pretext for secession and annexation by force violates both the human rights of those who live there and parts of the Minsk agreements concerning local self-government., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said it has been eight years since the Russian Federation invaded, occupied and annexed Crimea in a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He recalled that in 1945, the Soviet Union was present at the drafting and adoption of the Organization’s foundational document, pointing out that the Russian Federation is a member of the Group of Friends of the Charter of the United Nations. Drawing out a copy of the foundational treaty, he read part of Article 2 aloud, noting that “the Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members”. There are no second-class States and “there is no back of the bus at the United Nations”, he said, emphasizing that no nation is less sovereign than any other. When the Russian Federation is told to de-escalate, it is not being asked to do a favour, it is being asked to do what it signed up to do, he continued, noting that in recent years, that country has continued to destabilize the security of Ukraine and the region. Despite its lies and propaganda, “Russia must accept responsibility for the loss of human life, the destruction of the country and the chaos it has created”, he stressed. Highlighting Moscow’s decision to move troops into Ukraine in what it terms peacekeeping, he said “anyone else who understands the meaning of language would call it war-making”. Canada and others are united in the implementation of sanctions, he said, adding that more severe measures will follow. “Russia with all its acolytes can contort and spin all they like”, but the pain and suffering caused are its responsibility. It is never too late to stop and turn to diplomacy, he said. “Ukraine is not a mistake”, he said, stressing: “Ukraine is a sovereign nation.” He added that this is not about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union, but the existence, and the right to existence, of a Member State of the United Nations., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said the Russian Federation is “openly questioning the right to statehood of a fellow Member State” and its recent actions have further compounded the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation in non-Government-controlled territories of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Emphasizing that the international community is at the very brink of a major security crisis whose scale might be of unprecedented proportions, he called upon Member States to strongly condemn all acts of aggression and the continuing policies of fait accompli pursued by the Russian Federation. “Having learned from our history, Poland stands with those who choose freedom over bondage, the rules of international law over brutal force, and peace over conflict,” he said, underscoring that its Government believes in the right of every State to pursue its own foreign policy, including the freedom to choose alliances and partnerships. As the current Chairman-in-Office of OSCE, Poland has proposed to launch a new initiative called the Renewed European Security Dialogue, he added., IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), associating himself with the European Union, rejected the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the self-proclaimed “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk as a clear violation of international law. Reiterating his country’s consistent and principled position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, he expressed Croatia’s continued concern about militarization of the Crimean Peninsula and further attempts to restrict freedom of navigation through the Kerch Strait, including to and from the Sea of Azov. Croatia is also concerned about the evolving crisis in and around Ukraine, particularly the Russian Federation’s large-scale military build-up around Ukraine’s borders, including in Belarus and the occupied Crimea, he said. The current deteriorating political and security situation threatens not only Ukraine’s stability and integrity, but also peace and security in Europe and the world, he emphasized, reiterating his delegation’s full support for the efforts of the Normandy format, the Trilateral Contact Group and OSCE, as well as other diplomatic initiatives and missions. He also voiced deep concern about reports of serious violations as well as the continuous deterioration of human rights and the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), associating herself with the European Union, said her delegation has already responded — in close coordination with partners — to the Russian Federation’s actions, and any further escalation will be met with a similarly firm response. Calling on Moscow to revoke its illegal decisions, withdraw troops and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic solution, she recalled that the current situation echoes the Russian Federation’s violation of international law in Ukraine in 2014. Residents of the peninsula face systematic restrictions of fundamental freedoms, she said, urgently calling on the Russian Federation to respect human rights in the area and to allow full access for human rights monitors. Turning to other concerns, she pointed to the ongoing criminal investigation involving Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 - shot down over eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014 — and called on all countries, including the Russian Federation, to fully cooperate, in line with Security Council resolution 2166 (2014)., PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL (Switzerland) called on the Russian Federation to respect its international obligations, reverse its actions, withdraw its troops and contribute to de-escalation. Reiterating Switzerland’s support for Ukraine, he said OSCE and its Special Monitoring Mission must be able to fulfil their mandates. Calling for a diplomatic and political resolution of the conflict, he noted that, for eight years, civilians affected by the violence have seen their legitimate hopes for a more secure and peaceful future dashed. “It is high time for this to change,” he said, stressing that “violence breeds violence”. It is never a solution. Conflicts must be resolved through diplomatic means, with the path of dialogue always remaining open., ZHANG JUN (China) said his delegation’s position remains unchanged with regard to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. The situation Ukraine, however, is tangled in a historical web. In the current context, all parties should exercise restraint, implement the principles of engaging in dialogue and seek responsible solutions through peaceful means, he said, welcoming all efforts aimed at facilitating a diplomatic solution., CAROLYN JANE WEATHERALL SCHWALGER (New Zealand) said Moscow’s recognition of the self-proclaimed “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk has no basis in international law. She expressed concern that this recognition and the deployment of Russian troops into those areas is a calculated act to create a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. Echoing the Secretary-General’s concern about the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping, she emphasized that “when troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, they are not peacekeepers at all”. Expressing deep concern about the increase in ceasefire violations and civilian casualties in the Donbas conflict zones, as well as human rights violations in Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea, she encouraged the Russian Federation to return to the Normandy format. Its attempts to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity represent one of the most significant risks to international peace and international security in decades, she stressed, adding that the impact of a conflict will not be confined to Europe., STEFANO STEFANILE (Italy), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the violations of Ukraine’s democratic sovereignty and territorial integrity. Noting that the European Union has already responded with restrictive measures, including on economic relations and trade with non-Government-controlled areas, as well as through asset freezes on some banks, sovereign debt and individuals involved in undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty, he reaffirmed Italy’s non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. He called on the Russian Federation to de-escalate tensions, withdraw military forces and return to dialogue through the United States-Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-Russia Council and OSCE. After eight years of conflict, the status of the civilian Ukrainian population is more urgent than ever, he said, pressing the international community to provide unhindered assistance and preserve the economic stability of the country, for which Italy is providing €110 million in aid and grants., JAKUB KULHÁNEK (Czech Republic), associating himself with the European Union, said he is “gravely worried” about the Russian Federation’s aggressive actions and threats towards Ukraine, including its unprecedented and large-scale military build-up near the border. Since its illegal occupation and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the Russian Federation has continued to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine. He strongly condemned Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “people’s republics”, followed by the entry of Russian troops into Ukraine’s territory. These steps, together with statements by the highest officials, raise “a reasonable concern that the Russian Federation is actively planning an armed aggression against Ukraine”. De-escalation, negotiations and dialogue, rather than massive military build-ups, are the only acceptable approach. Continuous and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in non-Government-controlled areas of Donbas and in illegally annexed Crimea are of gravest concern, he said, calling for an independent, impartial and effective investigation into all credible reports on the use of arbitrary detentions, enforced abductions and politically motivated prosecutions. In that context, he expressed deep concern about the health of Crimean political prisoners Halyna Dovhopola, Dzhemil Gafarov, Server Gaziev, Zekirja Muratov, Amet Suleymanov and Enver Omerov., MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia) condemned the Russian Federation’s recognition of the separatist entities in the Donbas as a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Affirming that channels remain open for the Russian Federation to return to diplomatic dialogue, he called upon that country to uphold the core principles of the Charter. Noting that Australia’s Prime Minister spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart yesterday, he said the Government has announced sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations to exert acute costs and stands ready to take additional steps in concert with close partners if that State continues its present course., GHEORGHE LEUCĂ (Republic of Moldova) said his country does not recognize the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. He condemned that country’s so-called “recognition of independence” of the separatist entities of Donetsk and Luhansk as a serious breach of international law which calls into question all prospects of a negotiated political solution. Reiterating his delegation’s support for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, he called on Moscow to reverse its unilateral recognition, de-escalate and return to the path of diplomacy. In a region fraught with insecurity and instability, “where norms of behaviour are falling like dominoes”, the international community cannot allow historical grievances, revisionist policies and undisguised use of force to become the new normal, he warned., MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile) said his country’s foreign policy is based on the principles enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter: refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State; settling international disputes through peaceful means; and fulfilling obligations in good faith. He called for continuing efforts towards dialogue and understanding to implement the Minsk agreements, signed seven years ago, while also spotlighting OSCE’s work on the ground to ensure the population’s peace and security. He went on to underscore that, whatever security concerns might be present, “nothing can justify” a breach of Article 2, and such issues must be dealt with through dialogue and consultation among the stakeholders., ION JINGA (Romania), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s recognition of the so-called independence of Donetsk and Luhansk — which are integral parts of Ukraine — as well as Moscow’s illegal decision to send troops into those areas. He called upon the international community to provide a firm, unequivocal reaction to those events, and upon the Russian Federation to abide by international law, immediately reverse its actions, de-escalate and engage constructively in dialogue. As a permanent member of the Security Council, the Russian Federation has a distinct responsibility to promote international peace and security, he emphasized, while pointing out that its actions have deliberately threatened the same in violation of resolution 2202 (2015). Stressing that full implementation of the Minsk agreements is the only way forward, he expressed concern over the build-up of troops along the Ukrainian border, as well as in Belarus, the Black and Azov Seas and the illegally occupied Crimean Peninsula. He went on to reaffirm his delegation’s commitment to Ukraine’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations., LACHEZARA STOEVA (Bulgaria), associating herself with the European Union, strongly condemned Moscow’s decision to recognize the “independence” of the Donetsk and Luhansk “republics” and to send Russian troops into those regions. Emphasizing that those actions “represent an illegal and dangerous attempt to redraw the post-cold war boundaries in Europe”, he called upon the Russian Federation to reverse the decision and its military build-up in and around Ukraine. She expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, calling for full, free and unhindered access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission and other international mechanisms. She went on to reaffirm her country’s non-recognition of the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. Expressing deep concern about the ongoing human right violations and abuses in Crimea, she called for the immediate release of all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens. Also concerned about Moscow’s ongoing militarization of the peninsula, she predicted it would have a severe negative impact on the security situation in the wilder Black Sea region. She called upon the Russian Federation to refrain from any action that impedes the freedom of passage and navigation in contravention of international law., DRAGANA ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro), associating herself with the European Union, expressed grave concern about Moscow’s military build-up on Ukraine’s borders, including in illegally annexed Crimea, Belarus and on the Black Sea. The reported recent indiscriminate shelling of civilian infrastructure and ceasefire violations along the line of contact are alarming, she said. Calling upon the Russian Federation to reverse the military build-up and withdraw its forces from Ukraine, she emphasized: “The current rhetoric of threats must stop, and a solution must be sought through diplomatic channels.” She also pointed out that nearly 2.9 million people in Ukraine are in need of assistance. She warned that alarming developments in and around Ukraine are endangering the European security architecture and posing a clear and present threat to peace and security in the region and beyond. Montenegro upholds the European security order by respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country, acknowledging the inherent right of each to freely choose its own security arrangements, and refraining from the threat or use of force, she affirmed., BASSAM SABBAGH (Syria) described the inclusion of the current item on the Assembly’s agenda as a unilateral measure that is irresponsible and politicized. It reflects the desire of certain Western Governments to apply pressure on the Russian Federation at the expense of regional security, he said. The continued consideration of the item is in violation of Article 12 of the United Nations Charter, as the General Assembly must not make any recommendation on a matter under consideration by the Security Council, he added. The lack of political will on Ukraine’s part, as well as interference by Western nations and NATO under the pretext of concern, has prevented implementation of the Minsk agreements, he noted, emphasizing that the repeated proposals of the Russian Federation deserve serious consideration. Unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States and others will only complicate the situation, he cautioned. On Crimea, he said that his delegation’s position is based on the referendum of March 2014, in which more than 82 per cent of voters expressed their will to remain part of the Russian Federation. The hostile campaigns targeting that country prove that the Ukraine crisis was created by Western States and led by the United States to undermine the Russian Federation, he asserted, applauding the high level of Moscow’s self-restraint in the face of such provocation., JULIO CÉSAR ARRIOLA RAMÍREZ (Paraguay) said Ukraine and the Russian Federation are kindred countries and expressed hope that they can resolve the current situation. Indeed, the Organization’s founding nations agreed to refrain from the use of force to settle disputes, and new mechanisms are now available to prevent conflict, he noted. Describing the situation in Ukraine as a grave concern, he called upon the parties to pursue a peaceful, negotiated solution, emphasizing that there is no other path. The Security Council must play its role and carry out its mandate, using all available tools to do so, he added., ILANA VICTORYA SEID (Palau) said the Charter and subsequent treaties are sacred to her country. As a former colony, Palau believes decolonized States must be bristling at the thought of a large country wielding force, she noted, cautioning that a forcible redrawing of Europe’s borders will mean many lost lives and much destruction. Condemning the Russian Federation’s actions, which are in violation of Charter principles and existing agreements, she said de-escalation, dialogue and the rule of law must guide parties towards peace. Meanwhile, Member States must constantly and consistently reaffirm agreed ideals, she said, adding: “Let us not forget that our work is not done.”, NATASCIA BARTOLINI (San Marino) expressed deep concern about the ongoing crisis, the militarization in and around Ukraine, and the risk of a military conflict in Europe. Emphasizing the importance of negotiations, she called upon all parties to fully respect international law and the Charter. San Marino firmly supports international efforts to promote political solutions to the crisis, including through the Normandy format and of the Trilateral Contact Group, to ensure implementation of the Minsk agreements, she said. Also concerned about the large number of civilians in need of humanitarian assistance, she called on all parties to guarantee safe and unimpeded access to humanitarian actors. Civilians must be protected, she stressed, also pointing out the devastating impact of increased hostilities on peace, justice and stability beyond the region. While expressing concern about Moscow’s decision regarding the status of Donetsk and Luhansk, she called upon all parties to respect the ceasefire and to avoid provocative actions., LUIS ANTONIO LAM PADILLA (Guatemala), emphasizing that all Member States have the responsibility and obligation to speak up for peace, condemned the Russian Federation’s unilateral recognition of the separatist so-called republics in violation of international law and Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Calling for a diplomatic solution reached through dialogue and negotiations, he emphasized that it is crucial to prevent further escalation, particularly for the benefit and protection of the populations involved., CARLOS AMORÍN (Uruguay) warned that the dizzying escalation of tensions following the Russian Federation’s recognition of the “independent” separatist territories of Ukraine can put regional stability at risk, emphasizing that Member States bear responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, rejection of the use of force and the peaceful settlement of disputes. He affirmed that the main framework for reaching peace is respect for resolution 2202 (2015), which promotes implementation of the Minsk agreements. In order to de-escalate, it is indispensable to restore confidence and diplomatic will from all parties, he said, cautioning: “Confrontation is a war in which everybody loses even before it has begun, leaving a bitter aftertaste.”, JOSÉ MANUEL RODRÍGUEZ CUADROS (Peru) expressed concern over developments within Donetsk and Luhansk and on the eastern border between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. It is imperative that all hostilities and ceasefire violations end — in accordance with the Minsk agreements — and that the parties involved make every effort to de-escalate, initiate a process of detente and work towards a negotiated solution. He emphasized the urgent need to “use the means that diplomacy provides”, in this difficult, complex situation, to effect consultations that will lead to a peaceful, sustainable solution that accounts for the legitimate interests of the parties., ZSUZSANNA HORVÁTH (Hungary), associating herself with the European Union, emphasized the importance of full respect for international law, international agreements and the basic principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, the Paris Charter and the Budapest Memorandum. There were — and still are — multiple diplomatic tracks available that had, and still have, the ability to offer peaceful, diplomatic solutions, she said. As a Central European country, Hungary is genuinely interested in East-West dialogue, she said, adding that it has not forgotten the experiences of the cold war. A return to such practices must be avoided, she stressed, while calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, protection of civilians and infrastructure, and diplomacy as a priority to address all issues in a peaceful manner. Recalling Hungary’s bilateral support for Ukraine, she said her country will continue to contribute — in close consultation with Ukrainian authorities — towards strengthening the latter’s resilience., CECILIA FORGBE MC GILL (Liberia) said his delegation’s position remains unchanged since 2014, when it urged the Russian Federation to defuse tensions and respect the rights of Ukraine. Calling on the Russian Federation not to attack Ukraine, he urged Moscow to use diplomacy and dialogue to resolve its stated security concerns and to reverse its military build-up along the borders of Ukraine and in occupied Crimea. Reaffirming Liberia’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and noting that Ukraine currently poses no threat to the Russian Federation, he said: “In this twenty-first century, when our world body — the United Nations — is promoting peace and security, war is certainly not the answer; the path of dialogue and peace is most prudent.” Therefore, adhering to the tenets of democracy is critical and should prevail so that the individual rights of nations are not infringed, he said, emphasizing that Ukraine’s sovereignty must be respected., CRISTIAN ESPINOSA CAÑIZARES (Ecuador) said that today’s meeting should contribute to international peace and security as a higher goal, noting as well that his delegation found value in recent statements by Security Council members with no exception, as well as the statements of those who participated under rules 37 and 39 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure. The greater value is to be found in negotiation between the parties concerned in order to overcome tensions. He called on the States involved, as well as the international community, to avoid narratives that exacerbate tensions. He expressed support for the Secretary-General’s views and expressed trust in the good faith and will of the parties to make their best efforts. If this prevails, greater peace for Europe and the world will be achieved., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating with the European Union, rejected the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a blatant violation of international law. He agreed with the Secretary-General that the United Nations Charter principles are not “à la carte” and cannot be applied selectively. The Russian Federation’s decision is a breach of its obligations under the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, to which it is a party. It is also an unacceptable contradiction to its declared interest in seeking a solution in relevant international fora through dialogue. Slovakia supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbour and the universal validity of the principles of international law. He condemned the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and noted the deterioration of human rights in that area., ALEXANDER MARSCHIK (Austria), associating himself with the European Union, said this debate is about peace and war — the fundamental purpose of the United Nations. As a neutral State, Austria’s security relies on respect for international law, and it cannot accept that borders are moved by force in the twenty-first century. Every United Nations Member State agreed to Charter principles, which “keep us safe”, he said. Calling on Moscow to de-escalate the situation, reverse the military build-up and engage in dialogue, he said “it is not too late to change course”. This crisis, however, is beyond a regional concern; it is a global one. If United Nations principles have any relevance, territorial integrity would be respected. Asking if the situation now gives former colonial possessors the right to reclaim territory, he wondered: “If we were in Ukraine’s shoes, what would we expect from the United Nations?” For its part, Austria would expect a clear condemnation of violations of international law and calls to the Russian Federation to abide by agreed principles, he said., CHO HYUN (Republic of Korea), echoing concerns that the Russian Federation is violating Charter principles and international law, called on Moscow to reverse its actions. Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) must be fully implemented, he continued, adding that all States must settle disputes peacefully and refrain from the threat or use of force against any nation. Where there is political will, there is a political solution, he said, urging parties to work towards peacefully resolving differences. The humanitarian impact of the current crisis is also worrisome, he said, noting that the Republic of Korea will triple its aid assistance to Ukraine in 2022., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said the situation in and around Ukraine has become critical, requiring the United Nations to engage promptly. Noting that the primary objective must be to prevent war, he stressed the urgent need to de-escalate tensions and resort to meaningful dialogue between the parties involved. Pointing out that there is still room to restore confidence and find a negotiated outcome, he drew attention to the pillars of the collective security system: prohibition of the use of force and peaceful dispute resolution, along with the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-intervention and the protection of human rights. A permanent solution to the crisis in Ukraine must consider the legitimate concerns of all parties within the framework of diplomatic talks, and according to parameters established by relevant Security Council resolutions, such as resolution 2202 (2015), and in the spirit of the Minsk agreements, he said, calling for an immediate ceasefire, with a comprehensive disengagement of troops and military equipment on the ground., PHILIPPE KRIDELKA (Belgium), associating himself with the European Union, said what is at stake in the current crisis is the core principle undergirding the United Nations. President Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk and deploy troops flies in face of the international rules-based order and resolution 2202 (2015). Such actions cannot be left without response, he said, calling for sanctions that are proportional and targeted, as well as guarantees for safe, unfettered humanitarian access in the conflict areas. Condemning the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, he added that what is transpiring in Ukraine concerns not just Europe but every Member State., GUILLERMO ROQUE FERNANDEZ DE SOTO VALDERRAMA (Colombia) called on the Russian Federation to strictly adhere to international law, particularly concerning prohibition of the threat or use of force and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ignoring those principles shatters the three pillars on which United Nations actions are based. He urged all parties to immediately reopen dialogue and negotiations towards peaceful coexistence between States, citing resolution 2202 (2015) and the Minsk agreements as indispensable elements. The international community cannot remain unmoved when events have the potential to destabilize the entire international system — causing human suffering and refugee crises, which are incipient and can affect global economic recovery. Noting it will take at least a decade for the world to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, he called on the parties not to act with opportunism from which no nation will emerge unscathed., NJAMBI KINYUNGU (Kenya) underscored the need to uphold the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all States, regardless of size, population, wealth or military might. This is what stands between a peaceful global order and escalating, widening crisis. Opposing the Russian Federation’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent States, she called for de-escalation to avoid military confrontation and for a return to diplomatic negotiation — the results of which must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. She further condemned the trend of powerful States breaching international law with no regard, stressing that any hopes of realizing Our Common Agenda and other ambitious goals depend on multilateralism. Noting that today’s discussion centres on the latest unilateral action of a State sitting on the Security Council, she called on all Member States to defend multilateralism, which must be rescued through collective determination., BOŠTJAN MALOVRH (Slovenia), associating himself with the European Union, called on Moscow to respect the Charter principles, reverse its recent decisions, de-escalate the situation, ensure full transparency over its military activities, withdraw its military forces and engage in dialogue through established diplomatic means. Welcoming all efforts to find a diplomatic solution and to revive the Normandy format, he said constructive engagement and dialogue must be pursued through established international mechanisms. Free movement must be ensured for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, he said, raising concerns about the dire humanitarian conditions in eastern Ukraine and human rights violations in the Crimean Peninsula. Calling on the Russian Federation to uphold its international commitments and provide human rights observers with full access, and he said Slovenia will continue to work to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation. As a demonstration of Slovenia’s political support for Ukraine, he said Prime Minister Janez Janša will be visiting the country on 24 February., BURHAN GAFOOR (Singapore) expressed concern over the escalation of tensions on the border of Ukraine and the Russian Federation and the latter’s decision to recognize two break-away Ukrainian territories. Underscoring that Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must be respected, he said the situation is a test of the international community’s collective commitment to the multilateral system based on the principles contained in the Charter and within international law. As a small country, Singapore is committed to multilateralism, he noted, adding that it has always emphasized that all countries — big or small — must adhere to international law. He called on all parties concerned to pursue dialogue, work towards a peaceful settlement of the dispute and avoid action that would further raise tensions in the region., JIM KELLY (Ireland), expressing full support for the statement delivered by the European Union, reiterated his country’s commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter, including the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and the obligation of all States to refrain from threatening, or using, force against another State. Expressing support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy path, he said the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as independent entities contravenes international law, is a blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and marks a clear and unilateral breach of the Minsk agreements. Ireland urges the Russian Federation to reverse that decision immediately, and to refrain from further escalatory, unilateral actions that serve only to further raise tensions, he said. Recalling that this week the Russian Federation violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity for the second time in 10 years, he stated that Ireland does not recognize its illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, nor any political structure created through the attempted annexation. Ireland calls upon all sides to work urgently towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue, he added., ADAM KUYMIZAKIS (Malta), associating himself with the European Union, reiterated his country’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence within its internationally recognized borders. Condemning the Russian Federation’s decision to formally recognize the “independence” of Donetsk and Luhansk, he declared: “This decision is illegal and unacceptable, is a violation of international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, violates Russia’s own international commitments and further escalates the crisis.” Expressing concern about reported ceasefire violations and shelling reported at the contact line, he noted that the volatile security situation in eastern Ukraine has an immense impact on civilians. Diplomacy and dialogue must prevail, he emphasized, calling for peaceful settlement of the conflict, in line with the Minsk agreements, as endorsed by Council resolution 2202 (2015). He urged all parties to return to the negotiation table and avoid a dangerous escalation in Europe., OLIVIER MAES (Luxembourg), associating himself with the European Union, said recent grim events constitute a test of the multilateral system. He expressed steadfast support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, in line with relevant General Assembly resolutions. He emphatically condemned the Russian Federation’s 21 February decision to recognize Donetsk and Luhansk as “independent” entities, saying it constitutes an egregious violation of international law and accords, including the United Nations Charter and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (known as the Helsinki Final Act), among others. Such actions fly in the face of diplomatic efforts undertaken in the Normandy format to resolve the situation through peaceful means, in line with Council resolution 2202 (2015) to implement the Minsk agreements, he noted. Recalling Article II (4) of the United Nations Charter, he urgently called upon the Russian Federation to comply with international law and to resume discussions through both the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. Concerned that military escalation risks multiplying human rights violations and destabilizing eastern Ukraine, affecting the most vulnerable civilians, he called for an immediate ceasefire., AGUSTÍN SANTOS MARAVER (Spain), associating with the European Union, said his country consistently defends international law, notably as related to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of States. Condemning the recent steps taken by the Russian Federation, which strike at the basic pillars of the international community, he recalled Spain’s commitment to the United Nations Charter and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe/the Helsinki Final Act, which have been signed by the Russian Federation and are aimed at guaranteeing peace and integrity in Europe. Noting that recent events in Donetsk and Luhansk raised tensions, he expressed concern about the violation of the ceasefire by armed groups, leading to many lives lost, and condemned the lack of respect for human rights in both regions. Stating that 3.5 million people in Ukraine require humanitarian assistance due to the conflict, he said the Russian Federation’s recent actions to formally recognize the independence of the non-Government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk constitute a “manifest violation of the Minsk agreements, to which the Russian Federation is signatory”. He called on Moscow to return to diplomacy under the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, adding that OSCE efforts are important to achieve a dialogue-based solution. Turning to Crimea, where the human rights situation is deeply concerning, he pressed the Russian Federation to allow unimpeded access to those monitoring human rights there. Urgent steps must be taken to de-escalate tensions., NIZAR KADDOUH (Lebanon), stating that today’s meeting takes place “as the world is looking into the abyss”, expressed concern about the escalation in Europe and what the Secretary-General described as the biggest peace and security crisis in recent years. “Humanity is still battered by a cruel pandemic and the last thing we need is an additional threat of war,” he emphasized. Pointing out that Lebanon has lived through occupation, wars and interventions, he called on all sides to stop the alarming slide towards conflict and instead choose the path of peace. Recalling the tenets of the United Nations Charter, including the provision calling on all Members States to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, he underlined the need to prioritize diplomacy and a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine. “The world today needs more peace — not a new war,” he stressed., JEEM LIPPWE (Federated States of Micronesia) said that while some Member States may be located far from Ukraine, the current dangers in that country are not remote. Members States — small and large, strong and weak — must respect the Charter. Even though Micronesia is far away from the situation, it remains supportive of Ukraine and condemns acts of aggression by the Russian Federation. Calling on Moscow to cease its actions, he reaffirmed support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, emphasizing that the parties must settle this dispute through diplomatic means., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), associating herself with the European Union, said the current situation requires urgent attention, with the United Nations Charter guiding the way. Violations of international law are “threats for us all”, she said. Calling on parties to abstain from any military action that may lead to bloodshed, she said the priority is to avert further escalation. All channels of communication should remain open. Noting that Greek communities in Ukraine have lived on both sides of the contact line for centuries, she said Greece’s Embassy and consulates have shown a resolve to remain present and engaged in the country. Now is the time for all Governments and people to show responsibility and ensure that, in the twenty-first century, the world will not return to an era of violence., ESSAM M. E. ELGHFFA (Libya) said the Government of National Unity rejects any military action by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Calling on Moscow to de-escalate the situation and withdraw from occupied Crimea, he reaffirmed Libya’s support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. At this critical moment, the United Nations is facing a test, and peaceful dialogue and resorting to diplomatic means remain the only way forward, he said., MATHU JOYINI (South Africa) said if the current situation regarding Ukraine is allowed to further deteriorate, it will have regional and global ramifications. The founding aspiration of the United Nations to live in harmony should guide all conduct between peoples of the international community, with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States — while also mindful that their security interests must be considered. “The door of diplomacy should never be closed”, she stressed, as all have much to gain from a negotiated conclusion, and much to lose from a violent conflict. Welcoming the work of the Normandy format and OSCE, she recalled the Secretary-General’s comment that the price of human suffering to Europe and global security is “too high to contemplate”., MAHMOUD DAIFALLAH HMOUD (Jordan) reiterated the importance that the United Nations and all stakeholders play a positive role in the current situation. Expressing support for international law, he cited sovereignty and territorial integrity of States as the paramount principles for international relations., AMATLAIN ELIZABETH KABUA (Marshall Islands), echoing the condemnation of the Russian Federation for its actions against Ukraine, said that whatever historical legacies of empire building may be claimed or intended, the international community has long since moved on under the Charter of the United Nations to recognize the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, and “we cannot slip backwards into a century ago”. Expressing concern that small nations must have a fair voice in the face of threats and intimidation from larger Powers, as seen in the history of the Marshall Islands, he asked: “if we do not speak up collectively then who will?” It is up to the General Assembly to stand up to the spectre of tyranny, he stated, adding that “the United Nations risks irrelevance if we cannot take clear and meaningful action on this issue.”, The statement by OSAMA MAHMOUD ABDELKHALEK MAHMOUD (Egypt) could not be summarized because of a temporary broadcast interruption., FRANCISCO DUARTE LOPES (Portugal), aligning himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the non-Government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities. He urged the former to reverse such recognition, uphold its commitments, abide by international law and engage constructively in dialogue. He further condemned the continuous deterioration of respect for human rights and humanitarian law in these areas and expressed concern over the suffering of the 3.4 million Ukrainians still in need of humanitarian assistance. Also reiterating Portugal’s condemnation of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol — a blatant breach of international law — he encouraged those present to “bear in mind the potential consequences that the current path of escalation will bring to us all”., YASHAR T. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan), calling for continued international and regional efforts towards de-escalation, stressed that the Charter of the United Nations constitutes the foundational framework of international relations. It is critically important for the stability of the international legal system and is as relevant as ever for settling international disputes by peaceful means. All States are bound by accepted norms and principles of international law, particularly those relating to State sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of internationally recognized borders and non-interference in internal affairs. He went on to emphasize that strict compliance with norms and principles concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States, along with those relating to fulfilling assumed obligations in good faith, are of greatest importance for the maintenance of international and regional peace and stability., FABIÁN ODDONE (Argentina), expressing concern over the crisis in Ukraine, called for substantive progress to be made towards good faith dialogue in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. All countries must continue to adhere to the principles that brought them together as Member States of the United Nations. Urging a redoubling of efforts towards diplomatic rapprochement, he stressed that there is no military solution to this affair. He called on all parties involved to resolve their differences through dialogue, refrain from the use of force and respect human rights, also adding his voice to the Secretary-General’s call for all parties to refrain from actions and attitudes that could cause this dangerous situation to spiral out of control., POLLY IOANNOU (Cyprus), endorsing the statement by the European Union, underscored her country’s consistent commitment to the principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. No legal effects can be created by acts that do not conform with those principles. Reiterating support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, she stressed that any actions that undermine these principles violate international law and the Minsk agreements, instruments which constitute the only way forward to resolve the crisis. She further called on all parties to avoid further escalation and return to efforts to find a peaceful settlement., JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE (Dominican Republic) reiterated his country’s commitment to the United Nations Charter, and to an international order guaranteeing peace, justice and development for all countries. The ongoing crisis poses a severe threat to global peace, he said, adding that the Russian Federation’s unilateral recognition of the independence of the non-Government-controlled areas constituting an integral part of the territory of Ukraine, a Member State of the United Nations, violates three principles of international law, including that which obliges States to refrain from the threat or use of force. Such actions have created conditions for the expansion of attacks in eastern Ukraine, with the potential to affect other countries and wreak chaos on global markets, including the electrical sector and the food supply chain. He called for urgent action to be taken to avoid further conflict and pave the way for diplomatic negotiation, with the help of the Normandy format. No parties must cross the contact line, he warned, calling on those involved to desist from interfering in the affairs of other States., FATUMANAVA-O-UPOLU III PA'OLELEI LUTERU (Samoa) expressed great concern about the Russian Federation’s decision to invade parts of Ukraine, which violates Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Article II of the United Nations Charter, especially amid a global pandemic which is still wreaking havoc. He called for prioritizing diplomacy in efforts to defuse tensions in eastern Ukraine, urging the Russian Federation to respect the United Nations Charter, abide by international law, and to fully honour the Minsk agreements, as adopted by the Security Council in 2015., SURIYA CHINDAWONGSE (Thailand), expressing support for a diplomatic solution, said his delegation agrees with the Secretary-General’s approach, which would see dialogue conducted in accordance with the Minsk agreements and other mechanisms, with a view to de-escalating the situation and finding a solution. Turning to humanitarian concerns, he called on parties to refrain from the use of force and to ensure protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure., For information media.

Ukraine-Russia: CIVIC Calls for Ceasefire and Protection of Civilians,News and Press Release,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"Washington, D.C., February 24, 2022 – Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) is gravely concerned about the protection of civilians as a Russian military offensive is underway in Ukraine., We urge all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate ceasefire and take urgent measures to avoid civilian harm., War is never the solution, and civilians always suffer the brunt of it., All warring parties must adhere to their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. They must make the protection of civilians a priority and adjust their military operations accordingly., The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas must be avoided. As reports of people fleeing the areas of conflict have emerged, all parties must ensure a safe passage out of conflict zones for civilians. Humanitarian access to people in need must also be guaranteed., This offensive will deepen the suffering of Ukrainians and likely lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.

Soaring concern for human rights and human lives as Russia invades Ukraine,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Feb 2022,"Amnesty International calls for unerring respect for international human rights and humanitarian law, following Russia’s multi-pronged attack on Ukraine this morning., “Our worst fears have been realized. After weeks of escalation, a Russian invasion that is likely to lead to the most horrific consequences for human lives and human rights has begun,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard., “As rockets are falling on Ukrainian military bases, and the first reports are coming in of the use of indiscriminate weapons by the Russian army, Amnesty International re-iterates its call on all parties to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Civilian lives, homes and infrastructure must be protected; indiscriminate attacks and the use of prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions must not take place. We also repeat our call to allow and facilitate immediate access for humanitarian agencies to provide assistance to civilians affected by the hostilities., As rockets are falling on Ukrainian military bases, and the first reports are coming in of the use of indiscriminate weapons by the Russian army, Amnesty International re-iterates its call on all parties to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law and international human rights law"" Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, “Amnesty International will be monitoring the situation closely to expose violations of international law by all parties.”, Expanded armed conflict between the two countries erupted in the early morning on 24 February with the Russian army subjecting Ukrainian military and air bases to heavy shelling, rocket artillery, and missile attacks. Meanwhile tank columns invaded Ukraine’s territory along the entire length of the border., Background, Early in the morning of 24 February, Russia launched an invasion on Ukraine, with reports of troops crossing the border to the north and south, explosions in multiple cities including the capital Kyiv. On at least one occasion, in Kharkiv, video footage shows the tail section of a rocket fired from a Smerch heavy multiple rocket launcher left sticking out of the pavement. Deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian property, and indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitute war crimes., Amnesty International has previously warned of the devastating human rights risks of further armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including threats to civilian lives, livelihoods and infrastructure, and potential acute food shortages and mass displacement. The organization has documented the severe human rights toll of the 2014-2015 conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/soaring-concern-human-rights-and-human-lives-russia-invades-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",23 Feb 2022,"On February 24, President Putin declared war against Ukraine, and missile and shelling attacks began against multiple Ukrainian cities., (Kyiv) – Russia’s parliament adopted a resolution on February 16, 2022 requesting President Vladimir Putin to recognize as independent states two areas in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed armed groups., On February 21, President Putin signed two decrees recognizing the two areas’ independence and submitted them to parliament for ratification. Following that, he issued orders to Russia’s armed forces, which have been amassing at the border with Ukraine for months, to carry out “peacekeeping” in the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic”(“DNR”) and “Luhansk People’s Republics” (“LNR”)., On February 22, the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia’s parliament, approved Putin’s request to deploy the armed forces., In public comments on February 22, Putin stated that the boundaries of the territories whose independence Russia has recognized extend to substantial areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that are under Ukrainian government control., Fighting has escalated in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donbas amid Russia’s unprecedented military build-up along its border with Ukraine. Since mid-February, the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has been reporting significant daily increases in violations of a 2014 ceasefire agreement in conflict-affected areas along the line of contact., Irrespective of any self-proclaimed label, under international law, including the Geneva Conventions, Russian troops in Ukraine are an occupying force. The situation in eastern Ukraine, if Russian troops formally enter the territory, would fall within the meaning of occupation in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, as discussed below. Neither sovereignty claims by local “authorities” in the self-proclaimed “LNR” or “DNR”, nor their recognition as independent by the Russian government, affects the applicability of the international law of occupation., The armed conflict between government forces and Russia-backed armed groups has taken a heavy toll on civilians in eastern Ukraine. The conflict, ongoing for almost eight years, has killed over 16,000 people, including both combatants and civilians, and has displaced close to 1.5 million. The fighting has also led to widespread damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals, and schools on both sides of the 427-kilometer line of contact, which separates areas held by Ukrainian government forces from those under the control of the armed groups from “DNR” and “LNR”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-ukraine-international-law-occupation-armed-conflict-and-human-rights-questions

It must be immediately halted.”, “States that fail to take all reasonable measures to settle their international disputes by peaceful means fall short of complying with their obligation to protect the right to life,” Bachelet stressed., Reports have emerged of military strikes near major cities with significant populations, including Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Odesa, Mariupol and the capital, Kyiv., “The protection of the civilian population must be a priority. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas should – at all costs – be avoided,” Bachelet said., The High Commissioner called for full respect for international humanitarian law, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their first additional protocol of 1977, as well as international human rights law. In the conduct of hostilities, the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions must be fully respected, in particular by taking all required measures to protect the civilian population and civilian objects from the effects of the hostilities., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission remains in the country and will continue to closely monitor and report on the situation., “An information war is also under way and it is particularly crucial at this time that we continue to closely monitor and attempt to verify reports of human rights violations, including civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects, including critical infrastructure, and other impact on human rights on the ground,” Bachelet said., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

WFP Executive Director Statement on impact of conflict in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,24 Feb 2022,"ROME – We are deeply concerned about the evolving conflict in Ukraine and its potential impact on access to food for civilians in affected areas and on our operations globally. Our thoughts are with all those who have been caught up in this crisis and we echo the UN Secretary General’s call for an immediate ceasefire., The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) team is on the ground, and we are ready to step up as needed provided that access is granted, and resources are available. We appeal to all parties to ensure that affected communities have continued access to any humanitarian support they may require and that the safety of humanitarian staff on the ground is guaranteed., Conflict is a main driver of hunger and food insecurity in the world. We now have 283 million people marching towards starvation with 45 million knocking on famine’s door. The world cannot afford to let another conflict drive the numbers of hungry people even higher., The Black Sea basin is one of the world’s most important areas for grain and agricultural production, and the food security impact of the conflict will likely be felt beyond Ukraine’s border, especially on the poorest of the poor. Interruption to the flow of grain out of the Black Sea region will increase prices and add further fuel to food inflation at a time when its affordability is a concern across the globe following the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic., WFP operated in eastern Ukraine from 2014 to 2018, reaching more than one million people through cash, food vouchers or locally purchased food rations, while operating in both government- and non-government-controlled areas. We remain committed to support all affected populations in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries as required., The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change., Contact, George Fominyen, WFP/ Rome,

Statement from ICRC President Peter Maurer on the conflict in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Feb 2022,"This new phase of the fighting in Ukraine has sent an ominous chill down my spine. The intensification and spread of the conflict risk a scale of death and destruction that are frightening to contemplate, given the immense military capacities involved., We already see the immediate consequences for civilians, with the latest intensification triggering new displacement. Residents in Donbas and elsewhere have already endured eight years of conflict. Now I fear increased suffering, with the potential of massive casualty numbers and extensive destruction of civilian objects like water and electricity plants, as well as mass displacement, trauma, family separation, and missing persons., It is ICRC's long experience that miscalculations, a lack of understanding and faulty assumptions to assess potential civilian impacts of major combat operations can have terrible effects., We ask those involved in that fighting to take into account that:, Parties to the conflict in Ukraine must adhere to international humanitarian law, including the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and its First Additional Protocol from 1977, as well as ensure the protection of the civilian population and detainees. They must refrain from attacks that violate the rules of the conduct of hostilities or prohibitions on means and methods of warfare. The use of weapons with wide area effects should be avoided in populated areas., Attacks must not be directed against civilian objects. Essential infrastructure must be spared, including water, gas and electrical systems that, for instance, provide civilian homes, schools and medical facilities with vital water and electricity supplies. Attacks carried out with new technologies and cyber means must also respect international humanitarian law., Space for neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action must be protected so that aid actors like the Ukrainian Red Cross, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the wider Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement can maintain access to civilians.
The ICRC's priority is to assist those in need. This week we delivered 3,000 litres of potable water to Dokuchaevsk hospital and sent 7,000 litres to Donetsk municipality. Recent work also includes visits to places of detention to help improve hygiene and nutrition. The security situation permitting, our teams now in Ukraine will continue their work to repair vital infrastructure, support health facilities with medicines and equipment, and support families with food and hygiene items. We will also continue our bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties to the conflict to protect those affected by the fighting., We call for all states to do everything in their power and influence to avoid escalating a conflict whose cost and consequences for civilian populations outpaces the capacity to protect and assist them., The ICRC has seen many conflicts start and escalate in recent years, but too few of them end, and in each one it is the civilian populations that bear the consequences., Note to editors:, A video statement by President Peter Maurer will be available shortly on our newsroom and global digital channels., Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

There have been some movements of people from non-government-controlled areas into the Russian Federation.

This protracted crisis has disrupted the daily lives of children and families living on both sides of the line of contact between government and nongovernment-controlled areas, leaving them in continuous need of humanitarian assistance.

Our thoughts are with all those in affected regions. Violence is never the solution., We urge all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities and to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law., We must not underestimate the human suffering of renewed conflict in Ukraine – it will result in increased civilian casualties, massive displacement and soaring humanitarian needs. This conflict escalation will lead to a devastating impact on already damaged civil infrastructure, further restricting peoples’ movements and disrupt essential public services such as water, power, transport, markets and banking., Before any of the most recent developments, some 2.9 million were already in need of humanitarian assistance. Each day is a struggle for millions. Water, gas, and electricity supplies are limited. The combination of cold, Covid-19, limitations on movement, and chronic uncertainty make meeting basic needs a challenge. After eight years of conflict, the humanitarian needs are already significant., This context becomes yet more complex as people look to flee to safety. It is currently winter in Ukraine, with temperatures plummeting well below zero in some parts of the country. This adds additional challenges to survival should millions be forced to flee their homes without provisions or shelter., CARE is particularly worried about the situation for women and girls in this conflict. They are particularly at risk when it comes to gender-based violence, exploitation, discrimination, and poor access to vital health services.

Refugees International Warns of Displacement and Suffering in Russia’s War with Ukraine,News and Press Release,RI,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"Please see below statement from Refugees International President Eric P. Schwartz:, ""In going to war against Ukraine, Russia is creating a crisis that risks displacement and suffering on a scale that could surpass any seen in Europe in decades. Millions of people are in danger. As efforts to deter Russia fail, governments of the world must be prepared to provide assistance and protection for people who are forced to flee, as well as those who may become civilian victims of military action., The European Union, United States, and like-minded countries must work through the United Nations and in close coordination with local civil society to deliver life-saving aid to those who need it. All parties must allow unimpeded access to humanitarians delivering this aid., The EU and its Member States, the United States, and other donor countries should provide financial support to fund humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine, including for internally displaced people. There are already 2.9 million people in need of humanitarian aid in Ukraine, of whom 1.6 million live in non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), and more than 1.4 million are internally displaced. The UN estimates that 54 percent of people in need of assistance are women, 30 percent are elderly, 13 percent are children, and 13 percent have disabilities. An effective response will need to meet the specific needs of these populations now and in the long-term., Countries neighboring Ukraine must also increase their capacity to welcome people crossing borders to seek safety. They must ensure access to territory, adequate reception conditions, and a fair asylum process. Other EU Member States and NATO allies should show solidarity by providing support to Ukraine's neighbors and agreeing to relocate asylum seekers or resettle refugees., Urgent action is needed to prevent an already dire humanitarian situation from becoming far worse."", *For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Refugees International's VP for Strategic Outreach Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org. *",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/refugees-international-warns-displacement-and-suffering-russia-s-war-ukraine
"OSCE SMM Spot Report 7/2022: Members of the armed formations threatened an SMM patrol and seized UAV equipment near Rodakove, Luhansk region [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,OSCE,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,23 Feb 2022,"On the morning of 23 February, an SMM patrol was conducting a pre-announced SMM mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight to monitor the security situation north of Rodakove (non-government-controlled, 22km west of Luhansk), about 10km south of the contact line, when it was approached by two armed members of the armed formations. They showed signs of agitation and requested that the SMM change the location. The patrol members also saw a third individual, wearing a uniform with a Russian Federation flag patch on his shoulder. The Mission moved approximately 600m to the south., At the second location, as the SMM was preparing to launch the UAV, patrol members saw a green Lada approaching at speed with two armed members of the armed formations who were shouting at the patrol and threatening to destroy the UAV. The Mission aborted the flight and again relocated, this time to the southern edge of Rodakove., At the third location, soon after the UAV's launch, the Mission again saw the same green car approaching, this time with three armed members of the armed formations. The SMM observed the members of the armed formations exiting the car and shouting at the SMM. One of them loaded his rifle. Another forcibly took the UAV's control panel from the SMM and attempted, unsuccessfully, to land the UAV. Having failed, he returned the control panel to the SMM and requested that the UAV be landed. However, despite every effort, the SMM was unable to regain control of the UAV, which was lost as a result. The members of the armed formations then ordered the SMM to hand over the UAV's memory card. The Mission explained that the card was in the UAV, after which the members of the armed formations again took the control panel and inspected it in search of the memory card. While thus occupied, they become more agitated and aggressive. The SMM did not attempt to reclaim the panel and immediately left the area., The OSCE Permanent Council Decision No. 1117 specifies that the SMM shall have safe and secure access throughout Ukraine. Unrestricted and unconditional access to all areas is essential to ensure effective monitoring and reporting of the security situation, as well as other mandated tasks. The mandate also tasks the Mission to report on any restrictions of its freedom of movement or other impediments to fulfilment of its mandate., Contacts, Iryna Korobko, National Media Officer, OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, 26 Turhenievska Street, 01054 Kyiv, Ukraine, Office: +380 44 392 09 84, Mobile: +380 67 235 38 16, iryna.korobko@osce.org, smm-press@osce.org, Natalia Labenskyj, Deputy Chief and OIC, Press and Public Information Unit OSCE SMM to Ukraine, OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, 26 Turhenievska Street, 01054 Kyiv, Ukraine, Phone: +380 50 301 5887, Natalia.Labenskyj@osce.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/osce-smm-spot-report-72022-members-armed-formations-threatened-smm-patrol-and-seized

Statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine M. Russell on children in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"NEW YORK, 24 February 2022 – “UNICEF is deeply concerned that intensifying hostilities in Ukraine pose an immediate threat to the lives and wellbeing of the country’s 7.5 million children. Heavy weapons fire along the line of contact has already damaged critical water infrastructure and education facilities in recent days. Unless the fighting subsides, tens of thousands of families could be forcibly displaced, dramatically escalating humanitarian needs., “UNICEF is working across eastern Ukraine to scale up life-saving programmes for children. This includes trucking safe water to conflict-affected areas; prepositioning health, hygiene and emergency education supplies as close as possible to communities near the line of contact; and working with municipalities to ensure there is immediate help for children and families in need. UNICEF-supported mobile teams are also providing psychosocial care to children traumatized by the chronic insecurity., “The past eight years of conflict have inflicted profound and lasting damage to children on both sides of the line of contact. The children of Ukraine need peace, desperately, now., “UNICEF echoes the appeal of the Secretary-General for an immediate cease-fire and calls on all parties to respect their international obligations to protect children from harm, and to ensure that humanitarian actors can safely and quickly reach children in need. UNICEF also calls on all parties to refrain from attacking essential infrastructure on which children depend - including water and sanitation systems, health facilities and schools.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-unicef-executive-director-catherine-m-russell-children-ukraine-enru
Escalation of hostilities across Ukraine putting 7.5 million children at risk,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,24 Feb 2022,"KYIV, 24 January – All the children in Ukraine – at least 7.5 million under 18-year-olds - are in grave danger of physical harm, severe emotional distress, and displacement, following an escalation in hostilities overnight, says Save the Children., Explosions have been heard in the capital Kyiv and other major cities such as Kharkiv, forcing children and families into basements and bomb shelters. Parents are reporting trying to calm terrified children. Thousands of others are fleeing the capital, mostly by car.Temperatures in the capital are dropping below freezing, and displaced children may face long nights and days exposed to brutal conditions., In Eastern Ukraine, more than 400,000 children live in the areas at high risk of the direct impacts of the presence of soldiers and artillery, including being injured or killed by guns, landmines and explosive weapons, or being displaced from their homes. At least 100,000 of these children and their families are already known to have left their homes since Monday, and are currently sheltering with friends, relatives and strangers, often in cramped conditions., Save the Children is urgently calling on all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, to reduce the risk to children’s lives and wellbeing. While hostilities are ongoing, all actors must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law, including by ensuring that civilians and civilian objects, especially schools and hospitals, are protected from attack. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas risks severe harm to civilians, especially children, and should be avoided at all costs., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “Ukraine’s children are caught in the crossfire of this adult war. It should never have come to this., “Our most immediate concern is the risk to their health and wellbeing – in conflict, everything is on the table – death, injury, sexual violence, protection risks. Children are terrified. They are hearing explosions, they are being asked to flee with just the clothes on their backs. The risk to their mental health and potential for long-term trauma cannot be under estimated., “We are also gravely concerned about displacement and the subsequent soaring humanitarian needs. Any family forced from their home needs help with shelter, food, clean water – the absolute basics. We are also at the end of winter, with temperatures regularly below zero. Many children living in this conflict zone already don’t have enough food to eat or clothes to keep them warm. The thought that many of these children may be forced to find inadequate shelters in the instance of mass displacement - where they’ll be exposed to the freezing rain, wind and snow – is incredibly distressing.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses., ENDS, For further enquiries please contact:, Sam Halyk – Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org / +44(0)7423 519077, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/escalation-hostilities-across-ukraine-putting-75-million-children-risk

SECURITY COUNCIL
8974TH MEETING (NIGHT), Russian Federation Announces ‘Special Military Operation’ in Ukraine as Security Council Meets in Eleventh-Hour Effort to Avoid Full-Scale Conflict, ‘Give Peace a Chance’, Secretary-General Stresses as Political Affairs Chief Calls for Dialogue ‘Even at this Late Hour’, The Russian Federation must call off its “special military operation” and perceived declaration of war against Ukraine, members of the Security Council demanded tonight in a heated emergency meeting, condemning contraventions of international law and the United Nations Charter, and raising alarm about the dangers of an explosive regional conflict fomenting a global humanitarian crisis not seen since the Second World War., Delegates gathering at the eleventh hour to exhort Moscow to pull back its troops from Ukraine’s Donbas region found their calls moot after Russian President Vladimir Putin, nearly an hour into the meeting, announced in a televised speech the start of an operation to “demilitarize” its neighbour., In opening remarks, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, citing rumours of an imminent offensive, said he initially had not believed anything serious would happen. He admitted he had been wrong. “If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,” he urged. “Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”, Offering context, Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said Ukraine’s authorities had declared a nationwide state of emergency amid disturbing reports of heavy shelling across the contact line and repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure. With Moscow also reportedly shutting airspace to civilian aircraft near the border, Ukraine’s authorities were also citing a new large-scale cyberattack against State and financial institutions., As President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine called for continued diplomacy, and President Putin saying he was ready for dialogue, she encouraged pursuit of those efforts, even at this late hour. “The people of Ukraine want peace,” she emphasized. “I am certain the people of Russia want peace. We must do everything in our power to ensure that peace prevails.”, In the ensuing debate, representatives from the two countries offered conflicting views of the events unfolding., Ukraine’s delegate, who had called for the emergency meeting, addressed the representative of the Russian Federation to say that most of his prepared remarks had been rendered useless by 10 p.m. New York time, as “forty-eight minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine”. Requesting that the Secretary-General distribute legal United Nations memorandums from December 1991 — including a decision by the Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization — he asked his counterpart if he would state on record that Russian troops are not shelling Ukrainian cities., “You have a smartphone, you can call [Sergey] Lavrov,” he said, referring to the Russian Foreign Minister. Absent that information, the Russian Federation must relinquish its presidency of the Security Council to a Member State respectful of the Charter. He had requested an emergency meeting to consider all necessary draft decisions to stop the conflict. “You declared the war,” he said. “It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war.”, In turn, the Russian Federation’s delegate expressed regret that calls to stop provocations against the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics had gone unheeded, with Ukraine harbouring a delusion that it could achieve a military solution in Donbas with help from Western sponsors. He said the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) recorded almost 2,000 violations of the ceasefire regime, including nearly 1,500 explosions, with refugees flowing into the Russian Federation., “The tragedy of Ukraine” started after the “illegitimate coup” in 2014, he explained, when the new Government brought guns and planes upon the Russian-speaking citizens in the country’s eastern region, rather than engaging in dialogue with them. Women, children and the elderly have hidden from Ukrainian shelling for eight years. The root of the crisis lies in Kyiv’s provocations against Donbas, which prompted the leaders of the two republics to turn to Moscow for military support, in accordance with bilateral cooperation agreements. He described this as a logical step, as well as a consequence, of Kyiv’s actions., A number of delegates condemned reports of an active invasion unfolding even as the Council met to dissuade the Russian Federation from military action, with the United States representative stressing that it had “literally violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on live television before the world”. Moscow is closing airspace and moving forces into combat positions — a perilous moment. The United States is here tonight for one reason, she said: to ask the Russian Federation to return to its borders and send its troops and planes back to their barracks and hangars., Citing “denial of service” attacks on Ukrainian banks attributed to Moscow, and soldiers already deployed to Ukraine’s occupied region, she pointed to the Russian Federation as the aggressor, bringing its people, the Ukrainian people and the world into a conflict that will produce untold human suffering. She said the United States will table a resolution on 24 February, pledging that “the world will hold Russia accountable”., Indeed, “every development unfolding in the last 48 hours confirms to us — and to the whole world — that Russian worries have nothing to do with its security”, Albania’s delegate said. The issue is not a confrontation between the Russian Federation and the West, rather one between the Russian Federation “and international law and the United Nations Charter”. Calling the crisis “a dark hour” for the entire international community, he urged Moscow to reverse its illegal decisions and withdraw its military. Equating diplomacy with hope, he said: “it dies last”., Other delegates agreed that there is still opportunity for a diplomatic solution to emerge., The United Kingdom’s representative said that the Council is “here tonight to call on Russia to avert war”, as a full-scale conflict in a country of 44 million will drive casualties on both sides and devastating humanitarian consequences. While the world is calling for peace, “Russia is not listening”, she said. She raised the potential for the United Kingdom to ratchet up the already significant sanctions package targeting Russian oligarchs, banks and politicians supporting President Putin. “There is still time for restraint, de-escalation and reason — but that time is now.”, In similar stride, Kenya’s delegate called for calm and protection of civilians, joining calls for a diplomatic solution that envisions a viable security architecture for Europe, while remaining sensitive to the needs of other parties. He urged delegates to recall the ruins of war experienced by all those sitting around the Council table., Also speaking were representatives of France, Ireland, India, United Arab Emirates, Norway, China, Brazil, Ghana, Gabon, Mexico and Germany., The meeting began at 9:32 p.m. and ended at 11 p.m., Briefings, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, reaffirmed what he had said earlier today in the General Assembly, citing a number of events and rumours of an offensive against Ukraine being imminent. Stating he had not believed anything serious would happen, he admitted he had been wrong — and would like to not again be wrong. “If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,” he urged. “Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that earlier in the day, the so-called authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk “peoples republics” requested military assistance from the Russian Federation. As well, Ukrainian authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency and announced other related defence and security measures, including the mobilization of reservists. She cited disturbing reports of heavy shelling across the contact line and civilian and military casualties, as well as repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure. With media reporting an ongoing large-scale military build-up and military columns moving towards Ukraine, she noted the Russian Federation has also reportedly shut airspace to civilian aircraft near the border with Ukraine. While the United Nations could not verify that information, if confirmed, it would greatly aggravate an already extremely dangerous situation. Ukraine’s authorities were also reporting a new large-scale cyberattack targeting several State and financial institutions., Noting that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine earlier this evening called for continued diplomacy, and Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin also spoke about his continued readiness to engage in dialogue, she encouraged those efforts, even at this late hour. Affirming that United Nations staff are on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, she called on all parties to ensure the safety and security of those colleagues, and to respect international humanitarian law. While events in the coming hours and days cannot be predicted, she cited the unacceptably high cost — in human suffering and destruction — of an escalation. “The people of Ukraine want peace,” she emphasized. “I am certain the people of Russia want peace. We must do everything in our power to ensure that peace prevails.”, Statements, FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the Russian Federation “has been saying one thing and doing its contrary”, noting that “every development unfolding in the last 48 hours confirms to us — and to the whole world — that Russian worries have nothing to do with its security”. Its anxieties are not linked to the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and this issue is not a confrontation between the Russian Federation and the West. “This is a confrontation between Russia and international law and the United Nations Charter,” he said, tenets it has chosen to ignore. “This is a dark hour, not only for Ukraine but for the entire international community,” he stressed. Calling on the Russian Federation to stop and reverse its illegal decisions, and to withdraw its military engagement, he equated diplomacy with hope. “It dies last,” he said. “But for it to work, it must be seized, not ignored.” If Moscow advances its plans, it will bear not only the consequences of the war but also the historical blame and shame of invading a neighbouring country. However, its responsibility — as a large country and permanent member of the Security Council — calls for it to help preserve peace and security, “not to torpedo it”., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said her country, along with its allies and partners, will continue to respond to the actions of the Russian Federation with clarity and conviction. Warning that a full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation into Ukraine is imminent, she said Moscow is currently closing airspace, moving troops into Donbas and forces into combat positions. This is a perilous moment, she affirmed, and the United States is here for one reason: to ask the Russian Federation to stop, return to its borders, send its troops and planes back to their barracks and hangars, and instead send its diplomats to the negotiating table. Last week, the United States informed the Council what it expected to see unfold. It said that Moscow would fabricate a pretext for an attack — and in fact, there have been numerous false flag events staged along the lines of contact in Donbas. The United States said that Moscow would theatrically convene emergency meetings at the highest level of Government. This was seen on 21 February, with a State televised meeting held by President Putin, an orchestrated moment when Moscow decided to recognize as “independent states” sovereign territory of Ukraine that has been controlled by Russian proxies since 2014., “They literally violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on live television before the world,” she warned. Nobody could have predicted just how dangerous and inciting President Putin’s speech would be, as he argued that that the world should be taken back to a time of “empires and colonies”. The United States also had said that communications would be shut down. Last week, it attributed “denial of service attacks” on Ukrainian banks to Moscow, while just this morning, there was similar activity on government websites. There have been reports of destructive malware placed on computers and executed on some. After that, the United States warned that soldiers and bombs would arrive in Ukraine. And already, soldiers have been deployed to Ukraine’s occupied region. Not all parties are culpable. As such, calling on both sides to de-escalate is merely giving Moscow “a pass”, as it is the aggressor. The Russian Federation has brought its people, the Ukrainian people and the world to the brink of a conflict that will produce untold human suffering. Ukrainians are counting on the United Nations. She urged the Council not to let them down., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), noting that those gathered are “here tonight to call on Russia to avert war”, said that a full-scale conflict in a country of 44 million will bring immense suffering, casualties on both sides and devastating humanitarian consequences. She emphasized that, while the world is calling for peace, “Russia is not listening”. For its part, the United Kingdom will not compromise its commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor its support for peace, prosperity and democratic freedom for the people of Ukraine. The Russian Federation’s actions are an assault on the Charter of the United Nations, and the United Kingdom has announced a significant sanctions package targeting some of the Russian oligarchs, banks and politicians supporting President Putin. London will ratchet up these economic consequences should the Russian Federation continue its aggression. She went on to stress that “there is still time for restraint, de-escalation and reason — but that time is now”., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) warned that the Russian Federation is about to “provoke chaos in Ukraine and strike an unjustifiable blow to peace and security in the heart of Europe”. For several months, President Putin has patiently prepared the means for a major offensive against Ukraine. He has amassed soldiers and weapons at a level not seen since the Second World War. He incited violence through lies and disinformation. He even denied the legitimacy of the Ukrainian State, and attacked that country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, by recognizing the independence of portions of Ukraine’s territory. On the contrary, Ukraine has demonstrated admirable restraint and did not give in to violence despite Russian provocation. The leaders of Europe and the United States showed their unity and redoubled their efforts to propose a diplomatic outcome. President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and many partners played their part, expressing their readiness to work with the Russian Federation to build a renewed security architecture for Europe. Moscow should follow the path of diplomacy, draw back its decision to recognize the separatist entities in eastern Ukraine and withdraw its soldiers. If Moscow chooses war, it will have to assume all responsibilities and pay the price, he warned., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said that as Council members gathered around the table, “we are staring into the abyss of a major conflict in Europe, a conflict that would have global implications”. She affirmed that the Council must stand up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every Member State of the United Nations. Stressing that the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize as independent entities the non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions “does not change those borders one iota”, she urged Moscow to reverse that decision immediately, as well as any further escalatory, unilateral actions which can only serve to deepen the crisis. Noting that the path for diplomacy is “perilously narrow”, she said a resort to military conquest — for one State to impose its will unilaterally against another — has absolutely no place in the twenty-first century. “There is still a choice to turn from the path of war to the path of diplomacy and peace,” she affirmed., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) expressed regret that international efforts to defuse tensions between Ukraine and the Russian Federation were not heeded. The situation is in danger of spiralling into a major crisis, he warned, voicing deep concern about the developments, which may well undermine peace and security in the region if not handled carefully. Calling for immediate de-escalation, he called on all parties to exert greater efforts to bridge divergent interests, underlining that the legitimate security interests of all parties should be fully considered. He reiterated that more than 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, are located in different parts of Ukraine, including around its border areas, noting that his country is facilitating the return of all Indian nationals, including students, as required., MOHAMED ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) affirmed the importance of engaging in dialogue at all levels to support opportunities for peace that are based in international law. Clarifying that the Minsk agreements constitute a basis for peace, he stressed the importance of adhering to international law and the Charter of the United Nations, particularly through settling disputes by peaceful means. Noting that there were obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance even before the recent tensions, he said that any further escalation could worsen the humanitarian situation for a larger number of civilians. He called for a ceasefire and urged all parties not to obstruct access to aid or to civilians in conflict areas., MONA JUUL (Norway) warned that the world is facing the dire prospects of a major war in Europe. Strongly condemning Moscow’s decision to send troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, she called on the Russian Federation to reverse these decisions and to “immediately, completely and unconditionally” withdraw all military forces from the territory of Ukraine and the vicinity of its internationally recognized borders. Calling upon all parties to strictly respect the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, and to facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need in Ukraine, she urged the Russian Federation — as a party to the Minsk agreements and to the conflict — to fulfil its commitments, to abide by international law and to return to the path of diplomacy. “The Charter applies to all nations — including Russia,” she stressed., ZHANG JUN (China), noting that the situation in Ukraine is at a “critical juncture”, called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions. The door to a peaceful solution “is not fully shut, nor should it be”, he said, noting that China has pointed out the complex historical context of this issue on many occasions, and its position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States has been consistent. He expressed hope that all parties will remain cool-headed and rational, resolve issues properly through negotiations and address each other’s legitimate security concerns, in line with the Charter principles. For its part, China will continue to promote peace talks “in its own ways”, he said, welcoming any efforts towards a diplomatic solution., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) expressed concern about reports of troop movements into certain areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “The time is not for belligerent rhetoric nor military threats, but to engage truly in a diplomatic process,” he said. He called for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of all military forces, as an effective measure to prevent and remove threats to peace. Parties must abide by the Minsk agreements, above all its call for a comprehensive ceasefire, and grant access to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Monitoring Mission. Calling for rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, he noted that negotiations must be mindful of United Nations Charter principles, while taking into account the security concerns of all parts to the conflict, to create adequate conditions for an inclusive political dialogue. Brazil does not underestimate the complexity of the current situation, he said, but it insists on dialogue vital to achieving a lasting settlement to this conflict., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), describing the unfolding developments as “troubling”, said the situation is a matter of concern not just for Ukraine and its neighbours but for all. Insecurity for one country is insecurity for all. Expressing regret over the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize non-Government-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine and send its troops there, he cited statements attributed to President Putin that Moscow is always open to diplomacy. Such claims must be backed by action of de-escalation on the ground. He also expressed concern over the hybrid warfare launched by the Russian Federation, with cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. He urged Moscow to reconsider its intention to move troops to eastern Ukraine, stressing that its troops do not meet the criteria for peacekeepers and underscoring Ghana’s recognition of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), expressed concern over the serious risks of the conflict enveloping the entire Donbas region, leading to significant loss of life and a refugee crisis. Calling for calm and protection of civilians and civilian objects from violations, he said there was still reason to believe in prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis — which will require a vision for a viable security architecture for Europe, protecting Ukraine and other States while remaining sensitive to the needs of other parties. The Council can prevent a catastrophe, he stated, as when considering recent wars pursued by choice in violation of the Charter, the security of all parties was undermined. The leaders who designed today’s multilateral system were humbled by the wars of a previous century, he said, urging all Member States to recall the ruins of war experienced by all those sitting around the Council table., XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said the Council is meeting this evening 48 hours after its latest meeting on the subject because the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine has been attacked. Men, women and children are caught in “murderous violence” in eastern Ukraine, leading to a mass exodus that imperils their safety. The spectre of a war hangs over an entire region and as such, Gabon fears an imminent invasion of Ukraine. All Charter provisions must be respected, he said, stressing that Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk sidelines the importance of the Minsk agreements. Gabon remains attached to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State, he added., ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) expressed regret that, despite widespread calls from the international community, tensions around Ukraine have increased and Council members are obliged to meet once again. She expressed support for the Secretary-General’s statements and called on parties to avail themselves of his good offices. Recalling that the Russian Federation made an emphatic declaration several days earlier that it would not invade Ukraine, she pointed out that commencing a special mission runs counter to this statement. Invasion would be an act of aggression, she stressed, stating that Mexico will not waver in its call for détente, diplomacy and dialogue as a diplomatic solution is the only means for backing away from the precipice of a war in Europe., VASSILY NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said he will not repeat what he said in the General Assembly earlier today but expressed regret that calls to stop provocations against the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics were not heeded. Ukraine, actively armed by a host of States, is still harbouring a delusion that it can achieve a military solution in Donbas with help from Western sponsors. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the significant intensification of shelling and acts of diversion on the territory of the two republics. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission recorded almost 2,000 violations of the ceasefire regime, including nearly 1,500 explosions. Donetsk and Luhansk residents remain sheltering in basements and refugees continue to flow into the Russian Federation. The nature of provocations by Ukraine’s armed forces has not changed. Western colleagues are repeating “a Ukrainian fairy tale” that people in Donbas are shelling themselves. In today’s General Assembly debate, Western colleagues did not find one word of compassion or condolences for the suffering of the people in Donbas, as if these 4 million people do not simply exist., He explained that “the tragedy of Ukraine” started after the illegitimate coup in 2014, when the new Government, instead of engaging in dialogue with the Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine, brought guns and planes upon them. The Russian leadership decided to recognize the republics to ensure peace and security. For Western countries, the people in Donbas are only pawns in a geopolitical game aimed at weakening the Russian Federation. “For us, these are women, children, the elderly who have been hiding from Ukrainian shelling and provocations for eight years,” he said. The root of the current crisis lies in the actions of Ukraine itself, which sabotaged its obligations under the Minsk Package of Measures. Last week, there was hope that Kyiv would rethink and carry out what it agreed to in 2015. But Ukraine was not ready for dialogue with the two republics or for steps to grant Donbas the special status provided for by the Minsk agreements. Instead, Ukrainian provocations against Donbas intensified, and the leaders of the two republics turned to Moscow with a request for military support, in accordance with bilateral cooperation agreements concluded simultaneously with their recognition. He described this as a logical step — as well as a consequence of actions taken by Ukraine’s regime. During the current meeting, President Putin announced a special military operation in Donbas. Details are yet to come, but the aim is to free people in that area from genocide conducted by Ukraine., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said most of his prepared statement had been rendered useless by 10 p.m. New York time. Citing obligations under Article IV of the Charter of the United Nations and noting that the Russian Federation is no longer able to carry them out, he said the Russian ambassador had declared war on his country three minutes earlier. He requested that the Secretary-General distribute legal United Nations memorandums from December 1991, particularly 19 December, including a decision by the Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization. “It would be a miracle if the Secretariat is able to produce such decisions,” he said. “Forty-eight minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine,” he charged, asking if the representative could state on record that Russian troops do not shell Ukrainian cities. “You have a smartphone, you can call [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov,” he said. “We can pause.” Absent that information, he stated the Russian Federation must relinquish the responsibility of the presidency of the Security Council to a Member State respectful of the Charter. He requested an emergency meeting to consider all necessary draft decisions to stop the war. “You declared the war, it is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,” he asserted., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said the Security Council is meeting at the very moment the President of the Russian Federation is announcing a military operation on Ukraine. Two days ago, the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the so-called “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk was harshly rejected in this Council. Moscow has not listened and, it turns out, it was not prepared to listen. It has continued its massive military build-up and now its military is moving into Ukraine’s territory. By its actions, Moscow is violating the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, she said, condemning the violation of Donetsk and Luhansk in the strongest possible terms. Calling on Moscow to terminate its military action and withdraw its troops, she said its aggression will come at an unprecedented price politically, economy and morally. Germany was ready for another meeting in the Normandy format with its partners and allies. Now is the time to speak up and defend the Charter of the United Nations against unilateral aggression, she stressed., Ms. THOMAS GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor for a second time, pointed out that her country predicted the Russian Federation’s false-flag attacks, misinformation and emergency meetings relating to Ukraine. “But one piece had not come to pass”, she said, spotlighting that — while the Council was meeting tonight — “it appears that President Putin ordered that last step […] at the exact time we were gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war”. Underscoring the gravity of this emergency and calling for Council action, she said that the United States will table a resolution on 24 February. She went on to stress that the United States and its allies will respond in a united, decisive manner and that “the world will hold Russia accountable”., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), taking the floor a second time, said that “as we sat in this chamber urging Russia to step back, President Putin announced special military operations” on Ukraine’s territory, an unprovoked and unjustified action. It is a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations. The United Kingdom and its partners have been clear that there will be consequences for Moscow’s actions. She expressed full support for the United States’ call for a Security Council resolution, noting that the Council must do all it can to stop the war and uphold the United Nations Charter., Mr. HOXHA (Albania), taking the floor a second time, said his country had feared the current crisis, citing explosions now reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, as “the masks are down and the tanks are in”. Stating that the Russian Federation has decided to deny the existence of a country, he affirmed that Albania stands for peace, international law and anything else that mandates the aggressor will be responsible for its actions., Mr. DE RIVIÈRE (France) expressed regret that when the Council is trying to prevent the worst of what could happen, members learned that President Putin announced the launch of special military operation in Donbas. The Russian Federation has chosen war, which France condemns in the strongest possible terms. The fact that such action was taken when the Council was meeting to prevent it shows Moscow’s disdain for the international order. France will join the initiative to table a resolution condemning the war launched by the Russian Federation, he said, calling on all to support the text. The Russian Federation should respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians, especially women and children and humanitarian personnel, he stressed., Ms. BYRNE NASON (Ireland), taking the floor a second time, said that the members of the Council now see that the path forward has been closed by the announcement of military aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. This is something that Ireland roundly condemns. She said Ireland “stands with the people of Ukraine tonight and with every man, woman and child, who has seen this news, as we did, as we sat here in this chamber, and whose lives are at risk”. It is now time for the Council to stand up, assume its responsibility and speak up in the strongest possible terms against this act of aggression., Mr. KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), taking the floor a second time, urged the Russian Federation’s representative to relinquish his duties as Chair and call the Russian President and Minister for Foreign Affairs to stop the aggression. He also welcomed the decision by some Council members to meet as soon as possible to address this situation, adding that: “there is no purgatory for war criminals — they go straight to hell”., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor again, clarified that his country is not being aggressive against the people of Ukraine, but rather, “the junta in power in Kyiv”., For information media.

Ensuite, il a ordonné aux forces armées russes massées depuis plusieurs mois à la frontière avec l’Ukraine de « maintenir la paix » dans les républiques populaires autoproclamées de Donetsk (DNR) et de Louhansk (LNR)., Le 22 février, le Conseil de la Fédération de Russie — la chambre haute du parlement russe — a approuvé la demande de Vladimir Poutine de déployer des forces armées sur ces territoires. Le même jour, le président Poutine a déclaré publiquement que les frontières des territoires reconnus comme indépendants par la Russie s’étendent sur une surface importante des régions de Donetsk et de Louhansk, qui sont sous le contrôle du gouvernement ukrainien., Les combats se sont intensifiés dans la région du Donbass, dans l’est de l’Ukraine, la Russie ayant procédé à un renforcement militaire sans précédent à la frontière avec ce pays. Depuis la mi-février, la Mission spéciale d’observation de l’Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe (OSCE) en Ukraine fait état d’une augmentation quotidienne spectaculaire des violations de l’accord de cessez-le-feu de 2014 dans les zones touchées par le conflit le long de la ligne de contact., Quel que soit le statut autoproclamé de ces régions, en vertu du droit international, notamment des Conventions de Genève, les troupes russes présentes en Ukraine constituent une force d’occupation.

Le conflit, qui dure depuis près de huit ans, a causé la mort de plus de 16 000 personnes, combattants et civils, ainsi que le déplacement de près de 1,5 million de personnes. Les combats ont également entraîné des dégâts et la destruction à grande échelle d’infrastructures civiles telles que des habitations, des hôpitaux et des écoles, des deux côtés des 427 kilomètres de la ligne de contact qui sépare les régions contrôlées par les forces gouvernementales ukrainiennes de celles sous le contrôle de groupes armés issus des républiques autoproclamées de Donetsk et de Louhansk.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/la-russie-lukraine-et-le-droit-international-questions-et-r-ponses

Already over eight years at least 3,106 civilians, including more than 150 children, have been killed, and an estimated 7,000 have been injured., Any new mass movement of children will put them in grave danger of hunger, cold and illness. With Eastern Ukraine one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world, children on the move will be at risk of losing limbs from landmines and explosive devices. Almost 70% of civilian casualties since the July 2020 ceasefire have been caused by landmines and explosive devices., Save the Children is urgently calling on all parties to the conflict in Ukraine to agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, as the only way to protect children and their families from further violence and other violations of their rights., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children's Eastern Europe Director, said:, “We are standing at the precipice of a truly catastrophic war, and every effort must be made to pull us back. Children are terrified – they wonder if their homes will be shelled, their friends hurt, their security and sense of normalcy lost. And parents are terrified – they are going to sleep at night and wondering whether they’ll be hauling their children on buses and trains tomorrow, looking for safety., “This is an appalling situation. But more fighting isn’t inevitable. Leaders must step up, in the interests of the region’s most vulnerable, it’s children., “Save the Children joins children and parents across Ukraine to call on all actors to cease hostilities and find a peaceful solution. It is still possible to de-escalate this crisis. The international community should increase and support diplomatic efforts as though their own lives depended on it. The lives of children in Ukraine hang in the balance. Only diplomacy and dialogue will lead to an outcome that protects children’s lives and rights.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses., For further enquiries please contact:, Sam Halyk – Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org / +44(0)7423 519077, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-don-t-give-diplomacy-because-more-violence-will-destroy-generation-children
"Secretary-General Says Russian Federation’s Recognition of ‘Independent’ Donetsk, Luhansk Violate Ukraine’s Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",23 Feb 2022,"SG/SM/21153, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the General Assembly in New York today:, We meet in the face of the most serious global peace and security crisis in recent years — and certainly in my time as Secretary-General. Our world is facing a moment of peril. I truly hoped it would not come., The latest developments regarding Ukraine are a cause of grave concern. They include reports of increased ceasefire violations across the contact line and the real risk of further escalation on the ground. My thoughts are with all those who have already suffered so much death, destruction and displacement., The history of this conflict is complex, with at least two permanently opposing narratives. I know that their authors will never agree on what happened in the past. But in the present situation one thing is clear: the decision of the Russian Federation to recognize the so-called “independence” of Donetsk and Luhansk regions — and the follow-up — are violations of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations., And here in this hallowed Hall, I must emphasize that this action is also inconsistent with a landmark resolution adopted by the General Assembly more than half a century ago. I refer to the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. This so-called “Friendly Relations Declaration” was adopted during the General Assembly session marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations., The Friendly Relations Declaration — which has been cited repeatedly by the International Court of Justice as representing international law — sets out several vital principles that are highly relevant to today’s session. In particular, I would note the principle of sovereign equality of States, and the affirmation that “the territorial integrity and political independence of the State are inviolable”. Other resolutions of the General Assembly are also fully behind the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders., The Minsk agreements — approved by the Security Council and that I strongly supported from the beginning — were surviving in an intensive care unit thanks to a number of life-support devices. But now those devices have been disconnected. We must also be concerned about preserving the integrity of peacekeeping. The United Nations has a long and recognized experience deploying peacekeeping operations — which only take place with the consent of the host country., It is time for restraint, reason and de-escalation. There is no place for actions and statements that would take this dangerous situation over the abyss. It is time to establish a ceasefire and return to the path of dialogue and negotiations to save the people in Ukraine and beyond from the scourge of war. I urge all parties to make full use of Article 33 of the Charter and its diverse instruments of pacific settlement of disputes. The United Nations system is continuing to support the people in Ukraine through our human rights and humanitarian work., Our Human Rights Monitoring Mission has seven offices throughout the country — on both sides of the contact line — documenting civilian casualties, monitoring freedom of movement and reporting on allegations of human rights violations. Our humanitarian operations are independent of whoever might control the territory where people are living., Even before this latest escalation, 2 million people in Ukraine needed humanitarian assistance. Since the start of 2022 alone, we and our partners have delivered 140 metric tons of life-saving aid across the contact line. Here again, our actions are based entirely on humanitarian principles endorsed by the General Assembly., United Nations humanitarian assistance is guided by four humanitarian principles: humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. And these principles are central to establishing and maintaining access to affected people, including those in the context of an armed conflict. The General Assembly has repeatedly underscored the importance of promoting and respecting these principles within the framework of humanitarian assistance. Our humanitarian agencies are committing to staying and delivering to support the people in Ukraine and are ready to adjust and reprioritize their operations as necessary., As we sadly know all too well, in conflict, civilians, including women and children, always suffer first and suffer most. If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years. I urge all sides to allow safe and unimpeded access by humanitarian agencies, including in non-government controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law., I am fully committed to support all efforts to resolve this crisis without further bloodshed. My good offices remain available. We cannot and will not relent in the search for a peaceful solution., For information media.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Feb 2022,"Protection of Civilians: The number of security incidents continued to decrease since December (from 554 incidents in November; to 387 in December; and 300 in January, according to INSO). Nonetheless, due to ongoing tensions in the geopolitical scenario, the situation remains volatile., In December-January 2022, the impact of hostilities on civilian infrastructure included damages to the power supply unit in Olenivka (Donetsk NGCA) and a power line in Travneve (Donetsk GCA). At least 11 houses were damaged or destroyed, including multi-story buildings in NGCA, and a house destroyed in Donetsk GCA., Since December, OHCHR recorded 10 civilian casualties, including 6 due to mines/ERW. Overall, in 2021 a total of 110 casualties were recorded by OHCHR – a 26% decrease compared to 2020. Of them 53% were related to landmines and ERW, 40% to active hostilities and 7% to other causes., Freedom of movement: On 29 December, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine lifted COVID-related restrictions for crossings of EECPs. Since then, self-isolation, installation of Vdoma App or observation in selected facilities are no longer mandatory for people crossing EECPs to enter GCA. On the other hand, COVID-related restrictions are still applied for crossings on the NGCA side. Additionally, installation of the Vdoma app is still required for those crossing through International Border Crossing Points (IBCPs). In January, some people were not informed that the Vdoma app still needs to be downloaded by people crossing through IBCPs, and additional awareness-raising is required., The State Border Guard Service registered 55,010 crossings through EECPs in December, a 20% increase compared to November. According to the protection monitoring conducted by R2P and UNHCR, the number of crossings through the IBCPsslightly decreased in January, most likely due to winter conditions. No NGCA residents were reportedly fined, which is a positive outcome from the implementation of the law lifting such penalty for IBCP crossings by residents of NGCA., Mine Action: On 1 January 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1020 has come into force, providing a framework for two mine victims’ social protection mechanisms envisaged in the Mine Action Law: one-time compensation and annual healthcare assistance. Both types of assistance are provided only to people who acquired a disability as a result of the mine incident. Detailed analysis is available here., Access to social benefits: Upon adoption of the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1367 of 23 December 2021, people residing in NGCA can access social services in GCA without registering as IDPs. Access to social services is granted regardless of the duration of staying in GCA.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Feb 2022,"Protection of Civilians: The number of security incidents continued to decrease since December (from 554 incidents in November; to 387 in December; and 300 in January, according to INSO). Nonetheless, due to ongoing tensions in the geopolitical scenario, the situation remains volatile., In December-January 2022, the impact of hostilities on civilian infrastructure included damages to the power supply unit in Olenivka (Donetsk NGCA) and a power line in Travneve (Donetsk GCA). At least 11 houses were damaged or destroyed, including multi-story buildings in NGCA, and a house destroyed in Donetsk GCA., Since December, OHCHR recorded 10 civilian casualties, including 6 due to mines/ERW. Overall, in 2021 a total of 110 casualties were recorded by OHCHR – a 26% decrease compared to 2020. Of them 53% were related to landmines and ERW, 40% to active hostilities and 7% to other causes., Freedom of movement: On 29 December, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine lifted COVID-related restrictions for crossings of EECPs. Since then, self-isolation, installation of Vdoma App or observation in selected facilities are no longer mandatory for people crossing EECPs to enter GCA. On the other hand, COVID-related restrictions are still applied for crossings on the NGCA side. Additionally, installation of the Vdoma app is still required for those crossing through International Border Crossing Points (IBCPs). In January, some people were not informed that the Vdoma app still needs to be downloaded by people crossing through IBCPs, and additional awareness-raising is required., The State Border Guard Service registered 55,010 crossings through EECPs in December, a 20% increase compared to November. According to the protection monitoring conducted by R2P and UNHCR, the number of crossings through the IBCPsslightly decreased in January, most likely due to winter conditions. No NGCA residents were reportedly fined, which is a positive outcome from the implementation of the law lifting such penalty for IBCP crossings by residents of NGCA., Mine Action: On 1 January 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1020 has come into force, providing a framework for two mine victims’ social protection mechanisms envisaged in the Mine Action Law: one-time compensation and annual healthcare assistance. Both types of assistance are provided only to people who acquired a disability as a result of the mine incident. Detailed analysis is available here., Access to social benefits: Upon adoption of the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1367 of 23 December 2021, people residing in NGCA can access social services in GCA without registering as IDPs. Access to social services is granted regardless of the duration of staying in GCA. This is an important development towards delinking access to regular state services and benefits from the IDP certificate, as conflict-affected persons should not register as IDPs to obtain state services/benefits not linked to internal displacement., Access to utilities: Older people living near the contact line, especially in isolated settlements, are particularly vulnerable in winter. HelpAge reports that only a half of their beneficiaries have accommodations fully suitable for living both in summer and winter weather. The high cost of utilities makes older people choose between buying food or medicine and paying for utilities., Due to the lack of Window of Silence for repair works, 4 households in Krasnohorivka remained without electricity supply and heating for 8 days; more than 35,000 residents of Kurdiumivka, Pivnichne, Ozarianivka, Zalizne, and part of Toretsk had limited water supply for over three weeks due to waterpipe damage outside GCA; people experienced electricity cuts for over a week in Travneve and Hladosove and a week from December 10 to January 17 in Katerynivka, Luhanska oblast; 140 households in Luhanske remained without electricity since January 31.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-protection-cluster-factsheet-december-2021-january-2022

The decisions of far-away politicians make it impossible for grandmothers to see their children and grandchildren on the other side. With increased military and political tensions, thousands of families will be separated indefinitely., ”There is too little attention to this looming humanitarian catastrophe. Communities are exhausted from the conflict and need humanitarian assistance and peaceful solutions instead of arms. We call on our international partners to support the humanitarian response in Ukraine, nine per cent funded so far, to address existing needs and prepare for emergency response., ”The freezing pensioners I met near the frontline told me they are struggling to survive in their isolated, war-ravaged villages. Tens of thousands have endured almost daily shelling and life with limited or no access to water, electricity and essential services for years. They are terrified about the prospects of a return to full-scale war and feel forgotten amid the high-level political games playing around them., ”While my organisation and our humanitarian partners are ready to respond to increased needs, the international community must ensure that no efforts are spared to find diplomatic solutions to the current situation. Otherwise, we will see more human rights violations, increased suffering, massive forced displacement, and a further worsening of already dire humanitarian needs.”, Facts and figures:, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-millions-people-would-suffer-renewed-conflict

IRC calls for an urgent diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine to avert a potential humanitarian crisis,News and Press Release,IRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",22 Feb 2022,"New York, NY, February 22, 2022 — In the wake of the latest UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) urges all parties involved to de-escalate and avoid a humanitarian emergency., Ukraine is undergoing its eighth year of conflict with Russia; any significant escalation in fighting would result in soaring humanitarian needs and could lead to one of the largest displacement crises in recent years. Previous rounds of fighting in Ukraine have devastated civil infrastructure, disrupted essential public services, driven food shortages, and led to grave human suffering and displacement. There are almost 3 million people in need of humanitarian aid inside the country, many of whom live in eastern Ukraine where outbreaks of violence are already being reported. It is vital that all sides meaningfully participate in diplomatic efforts to avert conflict and the suffering it will produce., Meanwhile, EU Member States must support Ukraine as well as neighbouring countries to scale up their capacity to support displaced people. Neighbouring countries need to be prepared to deliver adequate reception conditions and ensure full access to asylum procedures. In the longer term, EU member states must finally agree on a system of responsibility-sharing for asylum seekers so they can respond to displacement situations or humanitarian emergencies humanely and effectively., The IRC is on the ground in neighbouring Poland — home to a large Ukrainian population — assessing the situation and the humanitarian needs that could arise if people start to flee into the country. We will be ready to support the needs of affected populations if needed., Lani Fortier, Senior Director of Delivery on Emergencies, International Rescue Committee, said,, “Humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine must be avoided at all costs. If war breaks out, the consequences for the Ukrainian people - and for Europe - cannot be overstated., “Should conflict escalate further, thousands are at risk of being displaced internally and into neighboring countries. IRC is extremely concerned about a potential displacement crisis with far reaching consequences for the EU., ""The last thing the world needs is a conflagration of this conflict and an ensuing humanitarian crisis. The number one priority for the West should be to use every diplomatic tool at its disposal to de-escalate and arrive at a political solution. The EU must support Ukraine, Poland and other neighbouring countries by scaling up capacity for the reception of displaced people., ""A crisis at Europe’s borders only makes the longstanding call for sustainable, humane and responsible policies for managing migration and asylum at EU level that much more urgent. A joint European effort is vital in this regard - both to avoid repeating past mistakes and to spare human suffering in the present.”, The IRC has been responding to humanitarian crises in Europe since 2015, where we launched an emergency response to the peak in migration in Greece and relaunched operations in Serbia. Our teams provided water, health and sanitation, and psychosocial support to refugees and migrants. Since then, the IRC has also provided support to refugees and migrants in Germany from 2016, Italy from 2017, and Bosnia-Herzegovina from 2020.

The Russian Parliament today authorized action outside the country by the military. It doesn’t seem like anything that anybody says or any diplomatic efforts are going to avoid any escalation and future invasions in Ukraine. You have appealed before. So have a lot of other people. What else can be done to really stop this new bloodshed in Europe?, SG: As I said, this is high time for de-escalation. This is high time to return to dialogue and negotiation. I think the present crisis will be in the end terribly detrimental both to Ukraine and to the Russian Federation., Q: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. The Russian President stated that actions that Kyiv is conducting against Donetsk and Luhansk are literally genocide. Do you share this assessment? And a second question please – some former Ukrainian officials were mentioning the possibility of a UN peacekeeping mission deploying to the area. What do you make of that? Thank you., SG: Genocide is a crime that is clearly defined and whose application must be done in line with international law. I do not think it is the case., Yes, it is true. There was a moment in which Ukraine has asked for a UN peacekeeping force in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. At the time, the Russian Federation accepted the idea of a peacekeeping force, but limited to the protection of OSCE monitors, and there was no agreement in the Security Council trying to make the two positions coincide and for that reason it was never possible to approve in the Security Council a peacekeeping mission., Thank you very much.

Women’s Refugee Commission warns of loss of life and human suffering due to Russian aggression in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WRC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Feb 2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday signed decrees recognizing the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics from Ukraine and directed the Russian Defense Ministry to deploy troops in those regions. The decree came following a marked increase of Russian military along the Russian-Ukrainian border., During a late-night emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday, several members, including Ghana, Ireland, Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the United States, condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine., In a statement attributed to the UN Secretary-General, it said he “considers the decision of the Russian Federation to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.”, In light of these developments, Stephanie Johanssen, associate director for advocacy and UN representative for the Women’s Refugee Commission, issued the following statement:, “The actions by Russia represent a violation of international law, including the prohibition of aggression and shelling of infrastructure. The Women’s Refugee Commission calls on Russia to immediately cease all hostilities, abide by international humanitarian law and human rights law, and ensure the protection of civilians. The escalation of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine risks severe loss of life and increase of human suffering, a conflict that has already left roughly 3 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection., “We also call on the international community to do everything in its power to deescalate the situation and return to peacebuilding efforts, including by ensuring the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women peacebuilders and women human rights defenders. We also urge the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance that is sensitive to the age, gender, and disability of affected populations. It must ensure women, girls, children, and persons with disabilities are not left behind.”, A February 11 report from the UN’s emergency aid coordination body – OCHA – shows that of the millions of people in Ukraine currently in need, 54 percent are women and girls. It also shows that 13 percent are children and 13 percent are persons with disabilities., “An escalation of conflict will also increase the forced displacement of Ukrainians. In this respect, we remind countries of their obligations to respect and implement international refugee law, including the right to seek asylum,” said Johanssen. “Responses to displacement must not be marked by political fearmongering, as we’ve recently seen in response to the crisis in Belarus, but by compassion and solidarity and swift mobilization of comprehensive support, including by providing safe passage. People fleeing for safety must never be used as a political bargaining tool or distract from states’ human rights obligations.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/women-s-refugee-commission-warns-loss-life-and-human-suffering-due-russian-aggression
"Conflict in Ukraine Must Be Averted ‘at All Costs’, Political Affairs Chief Tells Security Council as Delegates Reject Moscow’s Recognition of Donetsk, Luhansk",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,21 Feb 2022,"Kyiv Demands Russian Federation Return to Negotiations, While United States, United Kingdom, Germany Pledge Robust Response, In an emergency meeting late tonight, the United Nations political affairs chief declared that the Russian Federation's decree to recognize the independence of certain areas of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions constitutes a violation of the latter's territorial integrity and sovereignty., ""We very much regret this decision, which risks having regional and global repercussions,"" said Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, who also sounded an alarm over the Russian Federation's decision to deploy its troops into eastern Ukraine, reportedly on a ""peacekeeping mission""., She said the coming hours and days will be critical, warning that the risk of major conflict is ""real"" and must be prevented at all costs. Negotiation is the only way to address differences over regional security and the settlement of conflict in eastern Ukraine, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2202 (2015)., The Russian Federation's delegate said President Vladimir Putin's decree followed declarations of independence by Donetsk and Luhansk in 2014. Recognition only occurred now, despite high support for doing so in the regions since the beginning. Moscow had hoped for peace and welcomed the election of a new President of Ukraine who had promised to establish peace in Donbas --- but instead resorted to bellicose rhetoric, shelling and a flat refusal to speak with the representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk, despite that being included in the Minsk accords., He clarified that the Russian Federation is not a party to the Minsk agreements, which have been sabotaged by Ukraine ""with the backing of our Western colleagues"". To be sure, Moscow remains open to a diplomatic solution. He condemned the negative role played by the Western alliance led by the United States, which has whipped up alarm over an impending invasion while sending weapons to Ukraine., In turn, the United States representative rejected Moscow's claim that Ukraine is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, stressing that her country has no intention of supplying them to Kyiv, which does not want them. While Putin may want the world to travel back to a time of empires, it is not 1919. Today, Putin has ""torn the Minsk agreements to shreds""; tomorrow, the United States will take further measures to hold the Russian Federation accountable, she declared., Ukraine's delegate said his delegation called for tonight's meeting to draw attention to the Kremlin's illegal decision to recognize the occupied parts of his country's Donetsk and Luhansk regions as so-called ""people's republics""., Today, ""the entire membership of the United Nations is under attack"" by the Russian Federation, he said, a country that occupied parts of Georgia and Ukraine in 2008 and 2014 respectively. ""The internationally recognized borders of Ukraine have been and will remain unchangeable, regardless of any statements by the Russian Federation,"" he assured., Yet, Moscow now seeks to legalize the presence of its troops that have occupied areas of the Donbas region since 2014. A country that has fuelled war for eight years is not able to maintain peace, despite its claims, he said, demanding that the Russian Federation cancel the latest decision, return to the negotiating table and effect an immediate, complete withdrawal of its occupying forces., Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, France, India, Brazil, United Kingdom, Mexico, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Ghana, Gabon, Norway, China and Germany., The meeting began at 9:07 p.m. and ended at 10:29 p.m., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the Secretary-General was clear that he considers the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize the independence of certain areas of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions to be a violation of that country's territorial integrity and sovereignty and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. ""We very much regret this decision, which risks having regional and global repercussions,"" she said, expressing regret over the order to deploy Russian troops into eastern Ukraine, reportedly on a peacekeeping mission. Those developments followed the decision to order a mass evacuation of civilian residents of Donetsk and Luhansk into the Russian Federation, she noted., Expressing concern over the escalating shelling across the contact line, which reportedly led to casualties, she noted that the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has recorded 3,231 ceasefire violations in the Donbas area from 18 to 20 February: 1,073 ceasefire violations, including 926 explosions in Luhansk; and 2,158 ceasefire violations, including 1,100 explosions, in Donetsk. She reminded all involved of their responsibilities under international humanitarian and human rights law., Expressing extreme concern about the possible implications of the latest developments for the existing negotiation frameworks, she said that given the current risks and uncertainty, it is even more important to pursue dialogue. ""Negotiation is the only way to address the existing differences among the key actors regarding regional security issues, and the settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2202 (2015),"" she said, calling upon all relevant actors to focus their efforts on an immediate cessation of hostilities. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected, and actions and statements that may worsen the situation must be avoided., In recent weeks, key actors have been engaged in intense diplomacy to avert a new eruption of conflict in the heart of Europe, she said, adding that the Secretary-General fully supports those efforts and has deplored even the possibility that a new conflict could break out. She went on to express the full commitment of the United Nations to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, noting that the next hours and days will be critical. ""The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs."", Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that looking the other way in the face of the Russian Federation's hostility is not possible, as its action defies the Charter of the United Nations and international law. President Vladimir Putin made a series of outrageous and false claims about Ukraine, aimed at creating a pretext for war. Rejecting his claim that Ukraine is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, she said the United States has no intention of supplying such weapons and Kyiv does not want them. President Putin wants the world to travel back to a time of empires, but it is not 1919; it is 2022. The consequences of the Russian Federation's actions will be dire, she said, emphasizing: ""President Putin is testing our international system and seeing just how far he can push us all; we must act together in response to this crisis."" Today, President Putin has ""torn the Minsk agreements to shreds""; tomorrow, the United States will take further measures to hold the Russian Federation accountable. The United States and its partners will ensure that there will be a severe and swift response. In this moment, no one can stand on the side-lines. An attack on Ukraine is an attack on the United Nations Charter, she said, adding that the diplomatic table is the only place to preserve peace., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) condemned the Russian Federation's recognition of non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine as independent entities, noting that such action ends the Minsk agreements and has no international legal validity. Calling on the Council and Member States to reject the same, he said the world has witnessed how the Russian Federation has continuously worked to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and determine its geopolitical orientation. Noting that this action is a repeat of events in Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014 --- namely, ""aggression by fabrication of phantom republics"" --- he stressed that every Member State should be alarmed and should not accept that the ""made in Russia"" model of destabilization be exported to Europe and beyond., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) condemned the Russian Federation's recognition of the separatist eastern regions of Ukraine, which represent not just attack on the territorial integrity and sovereignty of that State, but a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and resolution 2202 (2015) which called on all parties to fully implement the ""Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements."" He noted that on 17 February, the Russian Federation's representative addressed the Council and acknowledged there was no alternative to the Minsk agreements -- but today, the reality is quite different. The Russian Federation has chosen a path of confrontation despite recent efforts to deescalate, notably by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Calling on Moscow to ""match its words with its deeds"", he expressed concern over the additional steps taken on the border of Ukraine. Welcoming the restraint shown by Kyiv, he urged the Russian Federation to refrain from any further destabilization of the situation, reaffirming concern over President Vladimir Putin's deployment of an army on the premise of peacekeeping., T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) noted that the escalation of tensions along the border of Ukraine with the Russian Federation is a matter of deep concern. He called for restraint on all sides, stressing that the immediate priority is the de-escalation of tensions, taking into account the legitimate security interests of all countries. Welcoming the intense efforts under way, including through the Trilateral Contact Group and under the Normandy format, he said ""we cannot afford to have a military escalation"" and called for greater efforts to find common ground to facilitate the implementation of the Minsk agreements, including key security and political aspects. ""Constructive diplomacy is [the] need of the hour,"" he stressed. Emphasizing the importance of civilian safety and security, he said more than 20,000 Indian students and nationals live and study in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas, and he underscored India's priority to maintain their well-being., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) called for immediate de-escalation and steadfast commitment to political and diplomatic efforts leading to a peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Recalling the core principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations --- the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of Member States, restraint in the use or in the threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of disputes --- he called again on all parties to maintain dialogue ""in a spirit of openness, understanding, flexibility and a sense of urgency"". A first ""inescapable objective"" is an immediate ceasefire, he said, with comprehensive disengagement of troops and military equipment on the ground, which would be an important step in building trust, strengthening diplomacy and seeking a sustainable solution to the crisis., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said actions taken by the Russian Federation will have severe and far-reaching consequences, first to human life. She expressed concern that women and children in Ukraine will suffer most. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is protected and guaranteed by the United Nations Charter. Moscow's decisions violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and make a mockery of the commitments Russian Federation has made in the Budapest Memorandum and Minsk agreements, endorsed by resolution 2202 (2015). Its actions demonstrate contempt for international law. The United Kingdom therefore will announce new sanctions against the Russian Federation in response to its breach of international law and attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity., ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) pointed out that the Council, through resolution 2202 (2015), supported a range of measures as the only way to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine. Stressing that this resolution must be respected, she urged parties to immediately end the unacceptable shelling and other ceasefire violations that have occurred over preceding days. She also recalled the Russian Federation's categorical statement that it would not invade Ukraine --- made recently in the Council chamber --- and expressed hope that the Russian Federation would comply fully with that statement., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said current events pose great danger to the people of Ukraine, to peace and security in Europe, and international norms and principles that all sitting at the Council table must defend. This moment should have been averted by diplomacy and dialogue. Reaffirming Ireland's unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, she said Ukraine has the same right to choose its own foreign policy and defend its territory as every State --- commitments that are binding on all Member States. Citing the Russian Federation delegate's statement one week ago that there is no alternative to the ""milestone document"" of the Minsk agreements, she noted that four days later, President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into the separatist regions, the second time in 10 years that the Russian Federation has violated international law in that domain. The Russian Federation has therein abandoned the Minsk accords and cast into doubt all diplomatic efforts. Commending the restraint shown by Ukraine, she stressed that the Russian Federation's unilateral actions only escalate tensions and frustrate the pursuit of diplomacy. Urging the Russian Federation to withdraw the recognition of the regions, she commended those engaging in dialogue and called on them to redouble their efforts. ""We owe nothing less to the people of Ukraine,"" she said, a country that has endured eight years of bitter conflict with 14,000 lives lost. The Council cannot yield to a grim new chapter., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said her delegation's position was expressed in its statement on 17 February. Stressing the importance of de-escalating tensions, she called for good faith efforts to mitigate the risks and chart a diplomatic path consistent with international law. The Minsk agreements form a good basis from which to build, she said., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), expressing grave concern over the Russian Federation's announcement to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as independent states, stressed that the possibility of serious security concerns in these regions does not justify such recognition. Recalling that Kenya, and almost every African country, was ""birthed by the ending of empire"", he pointed out that Kenya chose to follow the rules of the Organization of African Unity and the Charter of the United Nations ""not because our borders satisfied us, but because we wanted something greater forged in peace"". Condemning the trend of powerful States breaching international law with little regard, he called on all Member States to rally behind the Secretary-General in defence of multilateralism., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) expressed regret over the Russian Federation's decisions to recognize the regions of eastern Ukraine, send in troops and abandon the Minsk agreements. His delegation remains convinced in the integrity of States as the foundation of a stable world. Noting that the United Nations has set out the pathway for all its Member States, regardless of differences in political ideology, he expressed support for the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, opposing any actions that violate its sovereignty. Ghana does not recognize any entity not recognized under the United Nations Charter. Recalling that the international community has pulled back from many dangerous scenarios when logic and reason have prevailed, he said that ""while the sound of war may be loud, the voice of peace runs deeper."" The true test of greatness is restraint in the use of power - and on this occasion, the international community must reaffirm the common purpose of the Charter. Reiterating concern about civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk, he said ""we may be at the precipice, but we have not fallen over. The path of diplomacy remains."", LILLY STELLA NGYEMA NDONG (Gabon) said the call for sovereignty over the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have sent signals of imminent action. The Russian Federation's decision to recognize the sovereignty of these self-declared republics is ""heavy with consequence"" for Ukraine's territorial integrity, and undermines implementation of the Minsk agreements, constituting an attack on international relations. She called on all parties to de-escalate, use restraint and settle disputes peacefully through dialogue and diplomacy., MONA JUUL (Norway) strongly condemned Moscow's recognition of the self-proclaimed ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states as a clear violation of the Minsk agreements. It also runs counter to the work of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group towards a negotiated peace. The Russian Federation's actions constitute ""a clear violation of international law,"" she stressed, demonstrating that Moscow has ""chosen unilateral action and military threats rather than diplomacy and dialogue"". She urged the Russian Federation to return to the path of diplomacy, and to de-escalate by withdrawing its military forces from within Ukraine and from the vicinity of its borders. ""We are facing the prospects of a war that would not only threaten Europe's security architecture but would also lead to unparalleled suffering for the civilian population,"" she stressed. She called on the Russian Federation to fully adhere to international humanitarian law, and on all parties to both protect civilians and to facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access., ZHANG JUN (China) called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and avoid any action that may fuel tensions. Noting that the current situation in Ukraine is the result of ""many complex factors"" and that China ""always makes its own position according to the merits of the matter itself"", he said that all countries should solve international disputes by peaceful means in line with the Charter of the United Nations., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the Council had heard a number of emotional statements and categorical assessments of President Putin's decree. However, it must now focus on how to avoid war and force Ukraine to stop the shelling and provocations against Donetsk and Luhansk. That decree followed declarations of independence by the regions in 2014, and only occurred now --- despite high support for doing so in the regions and the Russian Federation. The Government had asked Kyiv to listen to the aspirations of people in Donbas to teach their children their mother tongue, and who had fought against rather than alongside fascists in the Second World War. Moscow had hoped for peace and welcomed the election of a new President of Ukraine who had promised to establish peace in Donbas --- but who instead resorted to bellicose rhetoric and shelling, a flat refusal to speak with the representatives of Donetsk and Luhansk. He reminded the Council that in all other conflicts, be it Libya or Yemen, all Member States insist on direct communication between the parties to conflict, but that Ukraine is exempted. The Russian Federation is not a party to the Minsk agreements, he affirmed, which have been sabotaged by Ukraine ""with the backing of our Western colleagues"". While the Russian Federation remains open to a diplomatic solution, he condemned the negative role played by those colleagues, led by the United States, which had whipped up alarm over an impending invasion while sending weapons to Ukraine. He stressed that refugees from the regions have fled to the Russian Federation and not Ukraine, with 68,000 people seeking shelter there. Calling on Western colleagues to think twice and hold back the militaristic plans of Kyiv, he noted that most statements in the Council had not mentioned the nearly 4 million residents of Donbas., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) underscored that ""today, the entire United Nations membership is under attack"" by the country that occupied parts of Georgia and Ukraine in 2008 and 2014, respectively. The Russian Federation now seeks to legalize the presence of its troops that have occupied areas of the Donbas region since 2014, and he stressed that a country that has fuelled war for eight years is unable to maintain peace, despite its claims. Stressing Ukraine's consistent desire for peace, he said that his country will now know its friends and partners --- on the side of the United Nations Charter --- from those who will ""continue to deter Russia by words only"". He demanded that the Russian Federation cancel its decision of recognition, return to the negotiating table and effect an immediate, complete withdrawal of its occupying forces. Also pointing out that Moscow copy-pasted, ""word for word"", today's decree relating to Ukraine from the one relating to Georgia in 2008, he observed that ""the copying machine in the Kremlin works very well"" and questioned which Member State might be next., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) called the Russian President's decision to recognize the separatist, self-declared ""people's republics"" in eastern Ukraine a blatant breach of resolution 2202 (2015) and the United Nations Charter --- and yet another ""flagrant and deliberate"" violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity, following the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the instigation and fuelling of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Recalling that the Russian Federation has repeatedly insisted it was no party to the conflict, he said that ""today, it unmasks itself and shows that it always has been"". Germany will take firm and adequate measures in response to Moscow's breach of international law that will have serious economic, political and geostrategic consequences. She urged Moscow to immediately revoke today's decisions and recommit to the Minsk agreements, in line with what the Normandy Four political advisers last agreed upon. Further, the Russian Federation must ensure that its forces will not cross the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, immediately withdraw its troops from regions bordering Ukraine in the Russian Federation and Belarus, and recommit to the rules-based security architecture in Europe. ""We are counting 14,000 dead in eastern Ukraine over the last eight years,"" she said, ""3,400 of them civilians."" She called on Moscow to return to the path of diplomacy.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-must-be-averted-all-costs-political-affairs-chief-tells-security

Older people in Ukraine want peace,News and Press Release,HelpAge,"Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Feb 2022,"As the conflict in Ukraine escalates, with a Russian invasion looking increasingly likely, HelpAge continues to help older people in the east of the country. Victoria Panchenko, Area Manager for HelpAge International in Ukraine, talks about what we are doing in the face of the escalating conflict, and what measures we are taking to keep volunteers and staff safe., More than four million people have been directly affected by the conflict in Ukraine which broke out in the east of the country in 2014. A disproportionate number of them are older people., HelpAge International has been working in Ukraine since the conflict began, providing support to older people in the east of the country. There are 17 HelpAge staff in Ukraine, most of whom are in the east. Almost all the locations where HelpAge operates are within the five-kilometre demarcation line in Ukrainian government-controlled territory. Some communities are located on the very line of contact., Our work is supported by 33 project assistants from the communities and 230 volunteers who provide ongoing support to the 4,800 older people living in the area., Our volunteers make home visits at least twice a month and are in constant contact by phone. They provide hygiene kits, including protective equipment against COVID-19, to the older people that they support as well as canes, walkers, crutches, and diapers, depending on the individual’s personal needs. They also supply them with information brochures on how to protect themselves from COVID-19., When an exchange of fire took place on the line of contact on 17 February – something that has not happened for a long time - several civilians were wounded. The blast blew out the windows in the house of one of our volunteers., All of this happened against a backdrop of increasing news and information about the concentration of weapons on the borders and the threat of a full-scale Russian invasion. The conflict in the east has been going on for eight years, and there was already hope for a peaceful settlement, when the escalation began again., We had to interrupt the visits of HelpAge’s volunteers for several days so that they would not be harmed. But our staff and volunteers remain constantly in touch with older people, talking to them on the phone and trying to support and reassure them., Fortunately, we managed a distribution of most of our aid supplies before the shelling and have a stockpile set aside in case the conflict escalates. We have already determined how many people we can reach in the event of war and are looking for additional funding., Everyone hopes for a diplomatic solution to the conflict. But we have informed all of our volunteers and staff what to do in case of an emergency, where to go and what to pack., The authorities do not provide instructions for older people on what to do in case war breaks out. Maybe this is right, so as not to frighten already frightened people. Older people are tired and scared. Each aggravation of the conflict has a bad effect on their health, both physical and mental., Talking to older people, we see that each has their own problems and complaints, hopes and aspirations. But all want one thing – peace, and to see their children and grandchildren from whom they have been separated for so long.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/older-people-ukraine-want-peace

The package was based on materials from 4 pilot countries (Afghanistan, Colombia, Syria and Ukraine).

UNDP conducts training on risk assessment for crises in communities in eastern Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",18 Feb 2022,"The training aims to unite the efforts of local authorities and rescue services to create an interagency coordination mechanism for risk assessment, Sviatohirsk, Ukraine, 18 February 2022 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine, in partnership with ACTED and IMPACT, has conducted training sessions for representatives of local governments, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SES), rapid response services and academics., The training focused on risk assessment and developing coordinated actions to effectively address the consequences of potential threats arising in conflict-affected communities in eastern Ukraine. The sessions were held on 16-18 February, and were financed by the European Union., Training session participants mastered the skills of conducting a qualitative assessment of community vulnerability, natural and man-made threats, and analysed the resources available in communities to overcome the consequences of possible crises., Federica Dispenza, the head of the Community Security and Social Cohesion Component of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, underlines that today, crises are not created by one specific risk, rather by the interaction of multiple hazards. For this reason, the key to a successful crisis response is for all actors in charge of responding to emergency situations to join efforts to assess and mitigate such risks., “In times of uncertainty, it is very important not to lose sight of how threats and vulnerabilities of a different nature can strengthen each other: from damage to houses, roads, and administrative buildings caused by hostilities, to economic deprivation that follows an escalation of the conflict, to natural disasters such as forest fires, for example,” Dispenza said., “By joining our forces to gain a shared understanding of the risks we face and how we can mitigate them, we can do so much more together to help the people who need our help most.”, She added that “UNDP is ready to join hands with all our partners to ensure that in the event of a crisis we can collectively respond faster and most effectively.”, Based on the learning outcomes, an interagency coordination mechanism for risk assessment should be set up. The mechanism will help all actors respond more effectively to crisis situations and prevent threats to conflict-affected communities in eastern Ukraine., Yana Zhovnirenko, ACTED project manager noted that the training sessions would help more effectively coordinate joint actions on risk management, disaster mitigation and plan in order to avoid possible risks and respond to the consequences accordingly., “This work is extremely relevant and necessary,” Zhovnirenko said. “For instance, in recent years the risk of natural disasters has increased significantly. Fires and floods in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have revealed that local authorities do not always have the appropriate level of training and resources to deal with the consequences of these disasters. Today, as tensions at the borders increase, so does the workload of local governments, rescue services and response services.”, “We believe that our joint efforts to establish an interagency coordination mechanism for risk assessment will not be in vain and will contribute to strengthening security in eastern Ukraine, as well as serve as a solid foundation for creating a national methodology for risk assessment,” she added., The training was organized under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme., Background, The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland., Media enquiries: communications.ukraine@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-conducts-training-risk-assessment-crises-communities-eastern-ukraine-enuk

The ICRC calls on sides to spare critical civilian infrastructure in eastern Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Feb 2022,"Hostilities disrupt water services to more than one million people in eastern Ukraine, Civilian infrastructure providing essential services protected under international law, Repairs to damaged infrastructure urgently needed but will take time, Geneva/Kyiv (ICRC) – The recent intensification of the fighting in eastern Ukraine has again put certain key essential services at risk of coming to a full stop., In the last two days, at least two major pumping stations – the 1st Lift Pumping Station and Karlivska Filtration Station, both in the Donetsk region and serving more than 1 million people on either side of the line of contact with potable water, including hospitals and other crucial services, were rendered inoperable by the hostilities., ""We are very concerned about the developments in eastern Ukraine over the past few days. Civilian infrastructure providing essential services, and civilian personnel who operate, maintain and repair that infrastructure are protected under International Humanitarian Law,"" says Florence Gillette, the ICRC's head of delegation in Ukraine., ""We remind all sides that, in the conduct of military operations, constant care must be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians, and civilian objects. The ICRC calls on all the sides to spare infrastructure that is essential for the survival of the population and to respect principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution."", Over the past eight years, the hostilities in eastern Ukraine have regularly left towns, villages and rural communities on either side of the line of contact without essential water, gas or power for days or weeks on end., ''Without urgent action to protect essential services in areas where the hostilities are taking place, large scale humanitarian implications are expected.'', Repairs to the damaged infrastructure are urgently needed but will certainly take time. Therefore, to ensure that clean water is available to those who need it the most, the ICRC will be working closely with the water utility company and support its efforts to restore the water supply, and if not possible support any emergency interim solutions, including the distribution of water by water tankers for the affected communities., Active hostilities along the Line of Contact forced the ICRC to temporarily suspend activities at the refreshment stations they run on both sides at the Stanytsia Luhanska Crossing Point, where people can warm up while queuing to cross. We also had to suspend several trips organized by our teams to deliver aid in localities on both sides of the line of contact., ""Communities in eastern Ukraine bear the brunt of eight long years of conflict and we really hope that they won't have to endure more suffering,"" Ms. Gillette said., ""When it comes to ICRC, we reiterate that we are here to stay, bearing in mind that the security of our staff remains our first priority. Amid the troubled times Ukraine and its people are going through, ICRC will continue to work, hand in hand with affected communities to respond to the big needs."", The ICRC works closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and our Movement partners. The ICRC's Ukraine operation is the organization's tenth largest operation worldwide, with a budget of 73,5 million CHF for 2022., Note to Editors:, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war.

Statement from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine,News and Press Release,OSCE,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,18 Feb 2022,"KYIV, 18 February - In recent days, the OSCE Special Monitoring to Ukraine (SMM) has observed a dramatic increase in kinetic activity along the contact line in eastern Ukraine, equal to the numbers of ceasefire violations reported before the July 2020 agreement on the Measures to strengthen the ceasefire took effect., Cognizant of its role as the impartial monitor of the international community on the ground, the SMM is committed to supporting the sides in implementing their commitments to the ceasefire, and other measures foreseen by the Minsk agreements.

Ukraine: Shelling Residential Areas Puts Civilians at Risk [EN/RU],News and Press Release,HRW,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",18 Feb 2022,"Attacks Intensify Against Government-Controlled Areas in East, The shelling of a school, a kindergarten, and residential areas along the line of contact in eastern Ukraine on February 17, 2022, apparently by Russia-backed armed groups, injured civilians and damaged civilian infrastructure, Human Rights Watch said today. The attacks, which injured at least four civilians, severely damaged or destroyed several homes., Attacks that indiscriminately strike civilian objects violate international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and if committed willfully amount to war crimes., “The recent shelling of schools and homes in Donbas shows just how exposed civilians are to attack,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Indiscriminate attacks on civilians, who have suffered a heavy toll over the past eight years, need to stop.”, Fighting has escalated in Ukraine’s eastern region of Donbas amid Russia’s recent, unprecedented military build-up along its border with Ukraine. The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) reported a significant increase in ceasefire violations in conflict-affected areas along the line of contact on February 17., At around 9:04 a.m. on February 17, a munition hit a wall of Fairy Tale kindergarten in government-controlled Stanytsia Luhanska and landed in the recreation room. A second shell hit the playground outside., Two staff members told Human Rights Watch that at least 20 children, from ages 2 to 5, were in the building at the time. Natalia Yudina, 43, a teaching assistant, said that the youngest group had just finished breakfast in another room. “We don’t have a bomb shelter, so the children and staff all gathered in the entrance hall, where there are no windows,” she said. “After breakfast, some children were going to the recreation room, and others were about to go for a walk. It is an absolute miracle that no children were harmed.”, A maintenance worker, Olexander Slesoryv, 34, said: “I was outside sweeping the yard when I heard the whistling. I yelled to the [assistant teacher], who was also outside and stood next to me: ‘Run!’ The [shell] hit the wall and exploded no more than two meters from us. I ran inside and crouched in the corner. I was in a daze. After the first blast, I lost my hearing completely and did not even hear the second explosion outside.”, Three staff, including Slysoryv, Yudina, and a 55-year-old teacher, were taken to a hospital. All three were diagnosed with concussions and various degrees of hearing loss., Russia-backed armed groups in the Luhansk region and the Ukrainian government blamed each other for the attack. Several military experts, including the open source media group Bellingcat, said that the spray pattern from the impact crater from the shell in the yard was consistent with the attack coming from the south, the direction of Russia-backed armed groups’ positions., Another attack on February 17 hit a school building in Vrubivka, Popasna district of Luhanska region, which is also under government control. A staff member of a Ukrainian humanitarian group told Human Rights Watch that the attack took place between 10 and 11 a.m., when children from Grades 1 through 4 were in class. The shell hit the schoolyard. The principal told a Ukrainian media outlet that the children were immediately evacuated to the basement., Hostilities in eastern Ukraine have damaged or destroyed hundreds of schools since the war began in 2014. Attacks that fail to distinguish civilian objects, such as schools that are not being used for military purposes, and military objectives are indiscriminate and are prohibited under the laws of war. Those responsible for deliberate or reckless attacks on civilian objects can be prosecuted for war crimes., Another shelling attack on February 17 hit a home in Stanytsia Luhanska’s Kondrashovka settlement. Two neighboring homes were also damaged in the attack. Svetlana, 58, the owner of the house, said that the attack was at around 8:30 p.m. She said that her husband, daughter, and a 7-year-old grandson were at home., “We first heard an explosion very close to the house and my daughter reacted fast. She grabbed [the grandson] and they ran to the basement. My husband and I [have been ill] and not so quick, so we only had time to get to the bathroom when the shell hit. The [military] officials told us later that it was a 122 mm shell.” Svetlana said that the shell struck their living room, and completely destroyed the roof of the house., Other locations in government-held areas hit by escalated shelling along the line of contact on February 17 included Marinka, 30 kilometers from nongovernment-controlled Donetsk. A shell fragment injured Valentina Gordeyeva, 65, who was waiting for a bus during the morning near her house in Marinka, based on reports from the humanitarian group Proliska and Vostok SOS, a Ukrainian nongovernmental group., Gordeyeva was taken to a hospital in Kurakhove, where a chief doctor confirmed to media that she had a shrapnel injury to her left arm and a surface wound to her stomach. A Vostok SOS activist, who visited Gordeva in the hospital, told Human Rights Watch that she was expected to be hospitalized for at least three weeks., Several Marinka residents said that they heard loud explosions in the morning coming from the direction of Donetsk. “We hear it [the shelling] regularly,” said Olexandra, a local resident. “But this time, it was lot more intense and a lot louder. I counted at least 20 explosions … I just thought, I hope they get the children into a shelter.”, Alina Kosse, the head of youth arts center in Marinka, said that the shelling in Marinka began at 9 a.m. and continued until 2:30 p.m.: “At first it was the artillery, then the snipers. We have not had instances of shell fragments hitting residential areas in a while, at least since 2017.”, Kosse said that at around noon, a bullet hit one of the center’s windows. No children were injured. She said that children in one of Marinka’s two schools as well as children from schools in the neighboring town of Krasnohorivka were taken to bomb shelters or school basements during the shelling., The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission reported 128 explosions on February 17, as compared with 24 explosions recorded in the region in the previous reporting period. In Luhansk region, the mission recorded 402 ceasefire violations, including 188 explosions. The mission also reported that a member of a Russia-backed armed group had threatened a Special Monitoring Mission patrol in the Luhansk region, in an area not under government control., The Ukraine government’s Joint Forces Operation in the eastern Donbas region reported 60 incidents of weapons fire along the line of contact on February 17, including 43 artillery attacks. On February 18, the military reported continued multiple ceasefire violations and accused Russia-backed armed groups of firing from residential areas. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic announced in a video statement a mass evacuation of women, children, and older people to the Russian Federation due to a continued escalation in hostilities., The use of explosive weapons in populated areas, often referred to as EWIPA, heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. Explosive weapons with wide-area effects are those that have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. This includes unguided and unobserved large-caliber artillery. Long-term effects of the use of these weapons include damage to civilian buildings and critical infrastructure, interference with services such as health care and education, and displacement of the local population., “Explosive weapons with wide-area effects, when used in populated areas, are among the gravest threats to civilians in contemporary armed conflict,” Williamson said. “Their use should be avoided where civilians live.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-shelling-residential-areas-puts-civilians-risk-enru

Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",18 Feb 2022,"Attacks on kindergartens and schools have been a sad reality for children in eastern Ukraine over the last eight years. More than 750 schools have been damaged since the beginning of the conflict, disrupting access to education for thousands of children on both sides of the contact line., The conflict has taken a severe toll on the psychosocial wellbeing of an entire generation of children growing up in Eastern Ukraine. Furthermore, children in eastern Ukraine live in one of the world's most mine-contaminated stretches of land. Every day, they live, play, and go to and from school in areas littered with landmines, unexploded ordnance, and other deadly explosive remnants of war. Since the onset of the conflict, UNICEF has been on the ground across eastern Ukraine, delivering psychosocial support and mine risk education to over 180,000 children, youth, and caregivers. UNICEF also supports repairs to damaged schools and kindergartens and distributes vital education supplies such as educational kits, furniture sets and sports equipment., UNICEF calls on all parties to respect the Safe School Declaration and protect children and their caregivers from attacks, regardless of the circumstances they might find themselves in. Educational facilities should remain a safe space where children can be protected from threats and crises and a haven where they can learn, play, and grow to their full potential. A child's right to education cannot be safeguarded in conflict settings without education itself being protected., UNICEF will continue to work with conflict-affected communities to provide much-needed humanitarian support and address the urgent needs of the most vulnerable children and families., Media contacts Nina Sorokopud UNICEF Ukraine Tel: +380 50 388 2951 Email: nsorokopud@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/children-eastern-ukraine-must-have-access-safe-education-and-childhood-unicef

"With Events Evolving Rapidly in Ukraine, Political Affairs Chief Calls for Diplomacy, Maximum Restraint, as Security Council Evaluates Minsk Accords",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,17 Feb 2022,"SC/14795, SECURITY COUNCIL
8968TH MEETING (AM), United States, Russian Federation Trade Barbs over Potential for Invasion, While Kyiv Vows to Repel Any Escalation of Violence, Against the backdrop of evolving events in eastern Ukraine — including reported violations of the ceasefire agreement in the last 24 hours — it has become clear that the situation is perilous, and diplomacy must urgently prevail, the top United Nations political official told the Security Council this morning., “Whatever one believes about the prospect of such a confrontation, the reality is that the current situation is extremely dangerous,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, during a meeting in which Council members diverged widely on their expectations for armed clashes in the upcoming days. Noting that the issues underpinning the crisis are both complex and long-standing — and touch on matters relating to the broader European security architecture — she said that, while seemingly intractable, they can and must be resolved through diplomacy., Voicing regret that diplomatic talks in both the Normandy Four format and the Trilateral Contact Group remain deadlocked, she stressed that the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the 2015 Minsk Agreements remains the only Council-endorsed framework for a negotiated, peaceful settlement. She also cited reports of fresh ceasefire violations across the contact line in the past several hours, emphasizing that, if verified, they cannot be allowed to escalate. She called on all sides to exercise maximum restraint. Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its borders must be respected., Briefing the Council via videoconference were two representatives of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), including Mikko Kinnunen, the Special Representative for the Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group. Stressing that the latter’s three members — OSCE, Russian Federation and Ukraine — remain “too far from one another”, he urged them to continue engaging and ultimately implement all elements of the Minsk agreements. While it has become popular to accuse participants of violating those accords, he cautioned that it is neither possible nor appropriate to single out one party, as none have fully implemented the agreements’ provisions. Referring to the alleged shelling in Luhansk today near the contact line, he underlined the importance of swiftly establishing facts and avoiding escalation., Yaşar Halit Çevik, Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, described the gradual degradation of the ceasefire agreement over the past year. Impediments to the Mission’s free movement have also escalated in non‑government-controlled parts of eastern Ukraine. He noted that, since the beginning of 2022, the Mission has recorded, on average, twice as many daily ceasefire violations as it did during the same period in 2021, as well as a rise in civilian casualties as a result of shelling and small arms fire. Meanwhile, crossing points along the contact line have been severely limited, with serious implications for civilian lives., Also briefing was Tetiana Montian, a civil society activist from Ukraine, who said Kyiv has no intention of implementing the Minsk agreements. Emphasizing that people in the eastern Donbass region are not represented in politics and are even criminally prosecuted, she said free thinking in Ukraine is squashed and civilians are deprived of their civic rights. She described Ukraine as a colony of the West — which has “plunged my country into slavery” — adding that the real goal of Western nations is to lure the Russian Federation into a war. “We are not a chessboard […] and we are not pawns in a political game,” she stressed, warning that OSCE has remained blind to the shelling and other violence being wrought by Ukrainian forces., Taking the floor, Council members diverged on several matters, including the utility of such geostrategic groupings as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the likelihood of an imminent aggression by the Russian Federation. However, nearly all speakers agreed that the situation in eastern Ukraine remains highly fraught and that both de-escalation and diplomatic engagement are urgently needed., Sergey Vershinin, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and Council President for February, said in his national capacity that the goal of today’s meeting is to reaffirm support for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. However, seven years after their signing, it is clear that Ukraine — whose leaders describe the accords as having been signed “at the barrel of a gun” — has no plans to implement them. Indeed, Kyiv stubbornly avoids direct negotiations, fails to restore economic links between the two countries and refuses to provide for the special status of certain regions, as mandated by the agreements. He also decried the “ostrich-like” position of Western States, who turn a blind eye to those obvious violations, and urged the Council to avoid speculation about plans for a Russian invasion, which his country has firmly and repeatedly denied., In sharp contrast, Antony Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, described the Russian Federation’s looming aggression in Ukraine as the most immediate threat. Recalling that Moscow has amassed over 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders, he said that, while it claims to be drawing down those forces, on-the-ground intelligence indicates that an attack is imminent and may take place in the coming days. Outlining in stark terms the potential elements of such an invasion, he explained that “by sharing what we know with the world, we hope that we can influence [the Russian Federation] to abandon the path of war and choose a different path while there is still time”., James Cleverly, Minister of State for Europe and North America of the United Kingdom, reaffirmed support for the Minsk agreements and underscored the responsibility of all parties to fully implement them. Emphasizing that the Ukrainian people are once again living under the threat of invasion — with Russian troops, heavy weaponry and military vessels amassed at their borders, from Belarus to the Black Sea — he declared: “Let us say clearly what the world can see: Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine, and now it has readied them for action.” He also voiced deep concern that diplomats representing the Russian Federation in OSCE talks have repeatedly failed to come to the negotiating table., Germany’s representative said that, while many obstacles remain, the reaffirmation of the ceasefire in July 2020 proved that progress is possible “if political will is there”. Commending the work of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, she echoed calls on all parties to ensure that it is able to carry out its mandate without interruption. More than 90 per cent of cases where monitors’ free movement has been disrupted or their equipment destroyed have taken place beyond the contact line in territory not under the control of Ukraine’s Government. Urging Moscow to use its influence to guarantee the Mission’s free and safe access, she turned to the unprecedented build-up of troops along the Russian Federation’s border, stressing: “It is next to impossible to not perceive this as a threat or the preparation for an attack.”, The representative of China, striking a different tone, praised the Russian Federation’s recent diplomatic engagement with the leaders of France, Germany and other nations. Emphasizing that European countries should make independent and strategic decisions, he said the gradual enlargement and expansion of NATO — a relic from the cold war — in eastern Europe must be addressed, as its agenda runs counter to current trends. Indeed, regional security cannot be guaranteed by flexing muscles, he said, pointing out that one NATO nation refuses to relinquish its “cold war mentality” and continues to stir up tensions the Asia-Pacific region., Meanwhile, the representative of Ukraine expressed grave concern about a recent appeal by the Russian State Duma — one of the chambers of that country’s Parliament — to recognize the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as so-called “peoples’ republics”. Noting that such an action would violate the Minsk agreements and deal a blow to the prospects of peace, he added that Ukraine will defend itself in the event of a further escalation. He thanked countries that have expressed their support and solidarity with Ukraine, welcoming attempts at diplomacy while cautioning that progress will remain stalled as long as Moscow makes preconditions. The Russian Federation has a choice — “to embark on the path of de-escalation and diplomatic dialogue, or experience a decisive consolidated response by the international community,” he said., Also speaking were representatives of Norway, Brazil, Ireland, India, Kenya, the United Arab Emirates, Ghana, Mexico, Albania, France and Gabon., The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 1:07 p.m., Briefings, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, recalled her last briefing on the situation in Ukraine as it relates to the implementation of the Minsk agreements, on 11 February 2021. At that time, she drew attention to the fragile security situation that prevailed despite the nominal ceasefire in place. Today, there is widespread speculation and accusations about a potential military conflict. “Whatever one believes about the prospect of such a confrontation, the reality is that the current situation is extremely dangerous.”, Noting that the issues underpinning the current crisis are both complex and long-standing — and touch on matters relating to the broader European security architecture — she said that, while seemingly intractable, they can and must be resolved through diplomacy. Expressing support for such efforts, including the Secretary-General’s good offices, she noted with regret that little meaningful progress has been made in implementing the 2015 Minsk agreements. Talks in both the Normandy Four format and the Trilateral Contact Group remain deadlocked. Noting that the Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements remains the only Council-endorsed framework for a negotiated, peaceful settlement, she noted with concern reports of fresh ceasefire violations across the contact line over the past several hours. “If verified, these must not be allowed to escalate further,” she said, calling all sides to exercise maximum restraint., She commended the work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), emphasizing that its Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine must enjoy safe and secure conditions. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General remains fully engaged with key actors — including the Governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine — and has stressed that there is no alternative to diplomacy. It is incumbent on all Member States to fully respect the principles of the United Nations Charter, to settle disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders must be respected as called for in relevant General Assembly resolutions., Welcoming recent statements prioritizing continued diplomatic engagement and announcing the redeployments of forces, she went on to stress that more must urgently be done to end inflammatory rhetoric and defuse tensions. The United Nations country team in Ukraine remains fully operational and humanitarian colleagues are committed to providing assistance in line with the principles of neutrality, impartiality, humanity and independence. It is therefore imperative that all sides allow safe and unimpeded access by humanitarian actors, and not lose sight of the needs of some 2.9 million people who require support. Early and adequate funding of the $190 million 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan is also needed., She went on to note that, for the war-wary people of Donetsk and Luhansk, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are only compounding suffering. Millions who, prior to the pandemic, could still maintain family and community connectivity have been unable to travel freely across the contact line, while others experienced an abrupt loss of access to basic services and livelihoods. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) continues to monitor the impact of hostilities and record reports of human rights violations, and documented the lowest number of civilian casualties in 2021 since the beginning of the conflict, due in large part to widespread adherence to the ceasefire. That trend must continue, she stressed, declaring: “We simply cannot accept even the possibility of a new conflict in Ukraine.”, MIKKO KINNUNEN, Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group, briefing via videoconference, provided a snapshot of current talks, emphasizing that addressing the Donbass issue hinges on considering the broader context in the region. Currently, participants in the Trilateral Contact Group — OSCE, Russian Federation and Ukraine — are “too far from each other”, and work must continue. At the same time, all elements of the Minsk agreements must be implemented, as it forms the basis of the Contact Group’s work. Noting that it is popular to accuse participants of violating these accords, he cautioned that none of their elements have been fully implemented, and it is neither possible nor appropriate to single out one party for being responsible for this fact. More flexible positions are needed to compromise, he said. One of the Contact Group’s key priorities is the contact line, he said, stressing that no one will benefit from military activities in the area. Referring to the alleged shelling in Luhansk today near the contact line, he underlined the importance of swiftly establishing facts and avoiding escalation., Recalling that, in December 2021, Trilateral Contact Group participants had agreed to the ceasefire, leading to a month-long reduction in violence, he said this must be fully implemented. Indeed, when there is political will, this and other elements are possible, he said, emphasizing that not enough progress has been made. Pointing to the recent Russian Duma decision that called for recognizing the independence of areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, he said all parties must remain committed to respecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Commending the recent work of the Normandy Four, OSCE discussions in Moscow and other efforts, he said such initiatives could trigger progress. Noting that the Trilateral Contact Group has met virtually for two years, he said these virtual discussions are not ideal for productive dialogue, adding that he was working towards holding in-person talks as soon as possible., YAŞAR HALIT ÇEVIK, Chief Monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, outlining recent developments, noted that the gradual degradation of the ceasefire agreement regrettably continued over the past year. Impediments to the Mission’s mandated freedom of movement have also escalated, limiting its capabilities. Mission members have at times been intimidated and monitoring tools are subjected to intense threats daily. In Luhansk, the Mission remains deprived of its operational freedom and independence — placing its sustainability is at risk — while the contact line remains exceedingly difficult to cross, both for monitors and civilians., Underlining the need for restraint and for all parties to abstain from inflammatory public rhetoric, he described the overall security situation along the contact line as volatile. Ceasefire violations have been reported throughout the year, including the increased use of heavy weapons, which both sides have agreed to withdraw. Following a December 2021 meeting at which the sides reconfirmed their determination to uphold the ceasefire regime, such incidents dropped significantly, but tensions remain high. He also cited ceasefire violations in and near several symbolically important locations during the reporting period which put civilians at risk., Since the beginning of 2022, he continued, the Mission has recorded on average twice as many daily ceasefire violations as it did during the same period in 2021. Those actions also led to a rise in civilian casualties as a result of shelling and small arms fire. Other violations — including trench extensions, the presence of heavy weapons in residential areas and the use of unmanned aerial instruments — also continued. Regrettably, discussions in the working group on security issues have stalled over the past year. Noting that COVID-19-related movement restrictions continue to impact the population, he said crossing points have been limited to two and there has been no progress in opening new crossings. Access to health care has been curtailed, young people are losing out on educational opportunities and older persons missed pension payments., Calling for the urgent opening of all crossing points and the lifting of all restrictions on both sides of the conflict line, he emphasized that the parties must press forward with the critical exchange of security guarantees. “The [Mission’s] capacity on the ground exists, but the will to use it needs to be strengthened,” he stressed, calling for the strong and sustainable support from the international community. He also outlined evolving events over the last 24 hours, noting that the Mission recorded some 500 explosions along the contact line in the Luhansk oblast. While tensions now seem to be easing, he urged the sides to strictly adhere to their ceasefire commitments and immediately de‑escalate. Noting that the Mission was able to visit affected parts of the Ukraine Government-controlled areas and continues to monitor the impact on civilians, he said it will report to the international community as soon as possible., TETIANA MONTIAN, a civil society activist from Ukraine, briefing via videoconference, said all briefers who have just spoken must be aware that Kyiv has no intention of implementing the Minsk agreements in their entirety. Instead, Ukraine continues to receive weapons and assistance while the people in Donbass are not represented in politics and are being criminally prosecuted. Pointing to accusations of high treason made against certain individuals, she shared observations stemming from a recent visit to Donbass, where the people’s only fault is that they are against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and joining Europe. She asked if the same people who closed all opposition channels are going to hold conversations with those in Donetsk and Luhansk, also wondering why it would be a problem to provide a special status to the area. Any different thinking in Ukraine is being squashed, and people have no right to form political parties or to speak in their country. Talks with people in Donetsk and Luhansk will “never, ever, ever” happen, she said, adding that Ukraine is a colony of the West, which has “plunged my country into slavery”., The real goal of the West — despite all the peace-loving speeches, including those heard today — is for the Russian Federation to be lured into a war, she said. If this was not the case, the puppet Government in Kyiv would have implemented the Minsk agreements. “The West wants a war with Russia and wants it to take place on the territory of Ukraine,” she stressed. “We are not a chessboard, but the people of Ukraine, and we are not pawns in a political game. You will lead the events to a war.” Indeed, OSCE has been blind to shelling and other violence, destruction and death, she said, recalling her visit along the contact line, where civilians — including women, children and elderly persons — have been and are being killed. Europe is looking duplicitously at the suffering of the 100,000 people living along the contact line, she said, asking the Council to compel the “marionettes in Kyiv” to implement the existing agreements., Statements, SERGEY VERSHININ, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and Council President for February, speaking in his national capacity, said today’s meeting marks seven years since the Council adopted resolution 2202 (2015), unanimously endorsing the Minsk agreements. The main goal of the meeting is to reaffirm that no alternative exists to their implementation. However, seven years on, it remains clear that implementing that package is in no way part of Ukraine’s plans. Noting that such a break is now openly stated by many Ukrainian officials, he added that no pressure is being exerted by Western Governments to implement these agreements. In that vein, he outlined recent political developments, including statements made by several Ukrainian senior officials describing the Minsk agreements as running counter to that country’s national interests and having been signed “at the barrel of a gun”., He said it is impossible for Moscow to be sidestepping its obligations under the Minsk agreements because there is no mention of the Russian Federation in that text. Meanwhile, Kyiv’s obligations are ignored as it continues to stubbornly avoid direct negotiations, fails to restore economic links between the two countries and refuses to provide for the special status of certain regions, as mandated by the agreements. Instead, it places blame on the Russian Federation through futile and baseless allegations. Voicing concern over the “ostrich-like” position of Western colleagues who prefer not to see those obvious violations, he said they instead seek answers in the Normandy Four format, which only provides more space for Ukraine to continue its military adventures. Recounting horrific instances of violence committed by Ukraine against civilians, he urged Council members to refrain from turning the present meeting “into a circus” by continuing to speculate about a so-called Russian invasion of Ukraine, as enough was heard about that during the United States-led meeting on 31 January., ANTONY BLINKEN, Secretary of State of the United States, said the Minsk agreements — signed by both Ukraine and the Russian Federation — remain the main framework for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where today the most immediate threat is Moscow’s looming aggression. “This is a moment of peril” both for the lives and safety of Ukraine’s people and for the rules-based international order, he stressed, adding that it directly affects every nation of the world. The principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter — including that one country cannot dictate another’s choices — are under threat. Recalling that the Russian Federation has amassed over 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders in recent months, he said that, while Moscow claims to be drawing down those forces, on-the-ground intelligence paints a different picture. Indications are that an attack is imminent and may take place in the coming days., Outlining a likely scenario for such an invasion, he said the Russian Federation would first manufacture a pretext for its attack. “We do not know what form it will take,” he said, noting that it could be a false report of a mass grave discovery or even a fake or real chemical weapon attack. Such a pretext would circulate through Russian Federation media outlets, spreading alarm. Next, the Government of the Russian Federation would issue proclamations about its responsibility to respond to such actions. Bombs could then be dropped on Ukraine and Russian tanks and soldiers could advance on various targets., Acknowledging the specificity of those remarks, he declared: “By sharing what we know with the world, we hope that we can influence [the] Russian Federation to abandon the path of war and choose a different path, while there is still time.” The United States will be happy to accept any criticism about such information should the Russian Federation not invade Ukraine, as it remains strongly in favour of diplomacy. However, it stands ready to respond decisively in the case that Moscow does act. Against that backdrop, Washington, D.C., has proposed a meeting with the Russian Federation at the Foreign Minister level next week, aimed at resolving the matter peacefully, as well as fresh meetings of the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE Permanent Council. He added that Moscow can announce today — without any equivocation — that it will not invade Ukraine, and back up that statement by sending its troops back to their barracks and its diplomats to the negotiating table., JAMES CLEVERLY, Minister of State for Europe and North America of the United Kingdom, reaffirming support for the Minsk agreements, in line with resolution 2202 (2015), underscored the responsibility of all parties to fully implement their commitments. In this context, he condemned the action taken by the Russian State Duma to propose that the Russian President recognize the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent. This action would directly undermine the Minsk agreements and must be clearly rejected by the Russian authorities, in line with their commitments. The United Kingdom welcomes all efforts to support the process and avoid escalation, including the role of OSCE and the Normandy format. Recalling the context for the present situation, he said that, since 2014, when the Russian Federation instigated a conflict in Donbas, 14,000 people have died in the conflict., Today, he said, the Ukrainian people are yet again living under threat of invasion with over 100,000 Russian troops, heavy weaponry, and military vessels amassed and exercising on their northern, eastern and southern borders, from Belarus to the Black Sea, adding: “Let us say clearly what the world can see: Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine, and now it has readied them for action.” He emphasized the need for steps to be taken towards a diplomatic resolution, calling on the Russian Federation to show up to diplomatic meetings and commit to meaningful OSCE talks, including via Chapter III of the OSCE Vienna Document, stating: “They did not show up on Wednesday, and do not plan to show up on Friday.” Stressing that the Russian Federation’s actions are “clearly designed to intimidate, threaten and destabilize Ukraine”, he underlined the need for the Russian Federation to give the Minsk agreements the chance to be implemented, free from coercion; for it to engage seriously with diplomacy; and for it to stand down all its troops., MONA JUUL (Norway) expressed deep concern over the Russian Federation’s large-scale military build-up in occupied Crimea, to the north, east and south of Ukraine, and in Belarus and the Black Sea. She described the reports of increased shelling as “most disturbing”, stressing: “They must not be used by Russia as a pretext for any military action”. The Russian Federation falsely seeks to portray the conflict in eastern Ukraine as internal, while, in fact, it has fuelled the conflict by providing financial and military support to the armed formations it backs. Expressing strong concern over the Russian State Duma resolution calling for the recognition of the self-proclaimed “People’s Republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk, she warned against such a step, which would further violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. All parties must uphold the Minsk agreements and engage constructively to resolve the conflict peacefully, she said, encouraging the Russian Federation to engage in the OSCE Chairmanship’s Renewed European Security Dialogue initiative. “Through threatening posture, rhetoric and unrealistic demands, Russia is challenging European security,” she said, stressing: “Every country has the right to freely choose its security alignment. We cannot allow the established security architecture to be replaced by spheres of influence.” Also expressing concern over the increasingly fragile ceasefire in Donbass from July 2020, she called on parties to seek a durable ceasefire and attend to the severe humanitarian situation after eight years of conflict., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said resolution 2202 (2015) has not yet been fully implemented. He urged all parties to fulfil the letter and the spirit of the Minsk agreements and to pursue genuine dialogue to assist diplomatic efforts to overcome the current security challenges in the region. A comprehensive ceasefire — the first provision of the Minsk agreements — remains an essential element in this process. Beyond that, further disengagement of forces and military equipment on the ground is required, allowing unimpeded access of humanitarian relief to people in most desperate need. Trust among relevant parties is crucial to strengthening dialogue and achieving a sustainable solution. In addition, negotiations on parameters to grant special status to certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions must be conducted with a sense of urgency, flexibility and spirit of compromise, while efforts to implement the Minsk agreements must observe full respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Council has the utmost responsibility to avoid and condemn any attempt of a military solution to this crisis, he said, urging parties to take the necessary measures to de-escalate tensions and play a constructive role in reaching a political settlement., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland), stating that Ukraine has the same fundamental right as every other sovereign and independent State to choose its own foreign policy and ensure the security and defence of its territory, added: “That is a right we hold to be self-evident. It is a right that Ireland struggled to obtain.” Noting that the Russia Federation’s military build-up at Ukraine’s border continues to raise tensions, she reiterated her country’s calls for calm and diplomacy, as well as for sustained and credible moves on the ground towards de-escalation, which implies a significant withdrawal of both troops and equipment. Welcoming the efforts of all those engaged in dialogue, including through the Normandy format and Poland, as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, she underscored the importance of the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, and the related conflict‑resolution efforts in the Normandy format and Trilateral Contact Group. Calling on all parties to act constructively within both formats, she expressed deep regret at the decision of the Russian State Duma to submit a call to recognize the non-government-controlled areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as independent entities. “This would be a clear violation of the Minsk agreements,” she stressed. Further, she expressed concern about restrictions imposed on the Special Monitoring Mission’s freedom of movement, and the damage to its equipment, as well as regretted the Russian Federation’s decision to refuse an extension to the mandate of the Border Observation Mission to monitor the border crossings., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India), noting that the Minsk agreements provide a basis for a negotiated settlement, urged all parties to continue to engage through all possible diplomatic channels and work towards their full implementation. Normandy format meetings will further facilitate this goal, he said, welcoming recent talks in Paris and Berlin. Any steps that increase tension may best be avoided by all sides in the larger interest of securing international peace and security. Quiet and constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour. The issue can only be resolved through diplomatic dialogue. Recalling that more than 20,000 Indian students and nationals live and study in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas, he said the well-being of Indian nationals is a priority of his delegation. He also reiterated the call for the peaceful resolution of the situation, with sincere and sustained diplomatic efforts ensuring that concerns of all sides are amicably resolved through constructive dialogue., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), noting that, if the situation is allowed to escalate it would threaten global stability and the Council’s ability to fulfil its mandate, strongly urged all actors to respect the peace, security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Reiterating that the stand-off is “imminently solvable”, he called on major military Powers, particularly those represented in the Security Council, to undertake sustained efforts towards a minimum level of de-confliction and mutual respect. He reiterated the obligations of all parties to fully implement their commitments, in accordance with the Minsk agreements, and welcomed, in this regard, the meeting of the Normandy format advisers held earlier this month, as well as the follow-up meeting slated for March., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) stressed the need for all concerned parties to engage in constructive dialogue in the interest of de‑escalation and the maintenance of regional security and stability. Emphasizing the importance of implementing the Minsk agreements in full and in good faith, in line with resolution 2202 (2015), she urged all stakeholders to avoid steps that would make implementation more difficult. Noting the important role of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, she called for attention to the critical situation of civilians in eastern Ukraine, where United Nations reports mention that there are 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, of whom 55 per cent are women and 16 per cent children. Furthermore, there are obstacles for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to some of those in need, particularly in areas near the contact line in eastern Ukraine, she noted, calling on all parties not to obstruct access to humanitarian aid or the movement of civilians in conflict areas, in accordance with their obligations under international law., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) underscored the need for the Council to reiterate its conviction and support for the processes for the further implementation of the Minsk agreements, seven years after the adoption of resolution 2202 (2015). Unfortunately, he said that, while the Minsk agreements remain largely unimplemented, the conflict festers in parts of the Donbass region, with increasing civilian casualties and deepening vulnerabilities, mostly of elderly persons and women-led households. The implications of the situation for the region and international peace and security have also been dire, he added. He went on to reaffirm support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, took note of security concerns of other Member States in Europe, and urged restraint by all parties. Welcoming diplomatic efforts to address the situation, including recent discussions among leaders of the Normandy Four reaffirming the ceasefire in the eastern region of Ukraine, as well as the OSCE‑facilitated dialogues at different levels, he urged renewed dialogue within the Normandy Four process to resolve differences in the interpretation of the sequencing of the Minsk Package. Further, he urged parties to guarantee unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance in Government and non-government-controlled areas in line with international humanitarian law., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said parties must urgently send a clear signal with a view to advancing along the path of détente, diplomacy and dialogue. Such recent actions as troop withdrawal announcements can generate much needed trust. Commending world leaders who have become involved to find a peaceful exit to this crisis, he said only a diplomatic solution can be considered. Any solutions will mean bringing an end to tensions in eastern Ukraine, with the Minsk agreements providing the guidelines to do so. The conflict has affected the population, with 3 million requiring humanitarian assistance and 1.5 million having been displaced, he said, requesting the guarantee of free movement for civilians on both sides of the contact line and assurances for unobstructed access for aid deliveries. Given the plethora of landmines in the area, he called upon the parties to refrain from deploying them and work towards demining. Existing tensions and their potential consequences make it clear that replacing diplomacy by confrontation would be like diving over a cliff, he said, expressing full support for the Secretary-General’s efforts., ZHANG JUN (China) said the Minsk agreements are universally recognized binding instruments to settle the Ukraine issue, but provisions are not being fully implemented and ceasefire obligations continue to be violated. Dialogue must pave the way to a political solution. As for tensions in the eastern region, all parties must adhere to the overriding goal of a political solution and fully consider each other’s security concerns. China supports efforts to ease tensions, noting the Russian Federation’s recent diplomatic engagement with France, Germany and other leaders. European countries should make independent and strategic decisions, he said, voicing support for the Secretary-General’s views. At the same time, “everything happens for a reason”, he said, noting that the enlargement and expansion of NATO — a cold war creation — must be addressed, as the organization’s agenda runs counter to current trends. Indeed, regional security cannot be guaranteed by flexing muscles. In fact, one country refuses to give up its cold war mentality as it continues to take actions in the Asia-Pacific region that are only brewing tensions. In this vein, he urged countries to learn from history, enhance mutual trust and do more to contribute to world peace and regional stability., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) rejected any attempt to pressure Ukraine to implement the Minsk agreements according to one side’s interpretation. While fully supporting the rights of minorities in Ukraine, he said asking for “executive powers” for Russian minorities in Ukraine means nothing less than taking control of the Kyiv Government and Parliament, pointing to stances by senior Russian figures who articulated publicly that Ukraine should claim “symbolic sovereignty” over territories in Donbass. “We should not accept such policy of fabricating dysfunctional States. Not in Ukraine. Not anywhere,” he said, rejecting Moscow’s call to recognize the independence and sovereignty of parts of Ukraine — a “stereotyped playbook” seen in Georgia in 2008 — as legally invalid if taken. On the Russian military build-up in and around Ukraine and in Belarus, he pointed to a further reinforcement of weapons and troops, noting the latter had increased to 150,000 from 100,000 over three weeks — instead of a much-claimed partial withdrawal. Describing. such a move as a “Damocles Sword” to instigate fear in the population, he said the decision to partially block the Black Sea, Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait under the pretext of holding regular naval exercises only adds to the strangulation effort. He demanded the removal of the occupying troops from the occupied territory and condemned the illegal annexation of Crimea. Any renewed attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would severely affect European security, he said, calling on the Council and the international community not to accept such action. The Russian Federation should engage in a Renewed European Security Dialogue, he said, also supporting the call by Secretary Blinken for talks with Minister Sergey V. Lavrov as soon as possible and renewed NATO Russia Council meetings. “Every mechanism must be used and fully exploited for diplomacy and de-escalation,” he stressed., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said implementing the Minsk agreements cannot be considered separately from activities on Ukraine’s eastern borders. France has worked towards de-escalating the situation and fostering dialogue. The military build-up on a neighbour’s border is threatening and unacceptable, especially as the Russian Federation has already infringed the borders of Ukraine in the past, he said, adding that there will be consequences for any further infringements. Dialogue is essential to address the situation in Donbass, as well as regional security. In terms of implementing the Minsk agreements, he said continued efforts in the Normandy format must advance, which was not possible at the 10 February meeting. The Minsk agreements constitute the suitable framework for pursuing dialogue, he said, expressing concern about the recent Russian State Duma proposal to change the status of eastern Ukraine. Taking note of possible ceasefire violations, he expressed hope that an investigation would proceed soon., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) raised concerns about alarming rhetoric and shows of force that have been exacerbated by recent actions. Commending efforts to de-escalate tensions, he said a confrontation would have disastrous consequences for all. Reiterating the call on parties to show restraint, he asked them to resume dialogue and make better use of existing channels to de-escalate the situation. The Normandy format and Minsk agreements provide a pathway to ensure the cessation of hostilities and open a way for peaceful neighbourly relations. He called on the parties to respect their commitments and resume dialogue. Sovereignty and territorial integrity are essential principles, he said, calling on the Council to reject any confrontation, use the tools of peace at hand and undertake its responsibilities., Mr. VERSHININ (Russian Federation), taking the floor again in his national capacity, said the people of Donbass — many of whom have Russian citizenship — have been subjected to Ukrainian shelling for many years. The proposed initiative mentioned by several speakers to recognize Donbass as an independent state is just that, an initiative. Instead of speculating on the parliamentary procedures of other nations, Council members should instead focus on the implementation of the Minsk agreements. While the representative of the United Kingdom outlined some of the background on the situation in eastern Ukraine, that picture was one-sided and superficial, he said., Meanwhile, he said, the United States delegate claimed to have “usefully” laid out an imagined scenario for an invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Describing that statement as both regrettable and dangerous, he said Moscow has repeatedly and clearly stated its intentions, but those statements have not been heeded. Russian forces remain on Russian territory — with some units having already returned to their home bases — and drills are being conducted in areas deemed necessary. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to violate past agreements through its increased militarization, with lethal weapons provided by the United States, United Kingdom, Poland and other nations. Citing an obvious desire to bog down today’s discussion — which should be about the parties’ legal obligations — he called for an authentic dialogue and urged the United States to carefully consider a new written request for security guarantees, which the Russian Federation sent to Washington, D.C., this morning., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), also taking the floor for a second time, expressed regret that the representative of the Russian Federation continues to use the same rhetoric. In his earlier statement, United States Secretary of State Blinken laid out the facts on the ground, which can be clearly seen by all. To those delegations who called today for increased diplomacy, she replied that the United States will continue to intensify its diplomatic efforts, calling once again on the Russian Federation to engage at the negotiating table., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) recalled that, seven years ago today, the Ukrainian city of Debaltseve sustained a full-fledged offensive by troops from the Russian Federation and their proxies. Heavy artillery and rocket shelling spared neither the Ukrainian military nor civilians. Those attacks occurred despite the existence of a disengagement line, agreed by Ukraine and the Russian Federation under the Minsk Memorandum of 19 September 2014 — the second document in the Minsk agreements package — which clearly defined Debaltseve as a Government-controlled area. Describing that as just one example of how Moscow violated the Minsk agreements almost immediately after signing them, he said that, just this morning, the Stanytsia Luhanska village in Ukraine was shelled with heavy weapons from the occupied territory of Donbass, damaging civilian infrastructure including a kindergarten., Meanwhile, two days ago, the Russian State Duma appealed to President Putin to recognize the occupied parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine as so-called “Donetsk and Luhansk peoples’ republics”, which contravenes commitments undertaken by Moscow under the Minsk agreements. Stressing that such a recognition would be tantamount to a deliberate withdrawal from the Minsk arrangements — as well as a serious blow to the politico-diplomatic settlement that Ukraine and its partners have been working to promote — he said such a move will also have implications for the global rules-based order and security architecture., “[The Russian Federation] has a choice: to embark on the path of de-escalation and diplomatic dialogue, or experience a decisive consolidated response by the international community,” he said. Welcoming statements made today by Council members outlining clear rejections of the Russian Federation’s intentions, he called on Moscow to take a constructive stance and move forward in the framework of existing negotiation formats. Recalling Moscow’s agreement to create security zones in the border areas between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, he said this initiative is even more urgent amid the deployment of 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders, a blockade by the Russian Federation in the Black Sea and widespread misinformation campaigns., While Ukraine remains committed to peaceful resolution by diplomatic means, he reiterated that it would defend itself in the event of an escalation by the Russian Federation. Thanking countries for their support and solidarity, he welcomed efforts in the framework of the Normany Four format, while warning that progress will remain stalled as long as Moscow makes preconditions about direct dialogue. He also laid out a range of issues that could be included in political track negotiations and emphasized Ukraine’s willingness to engage in such talks. “It remains up to [the Russian Federation] to take decisions that would lead to full implementation of […] the Minsk agreements,” he said, urging Moscow to abandon its strategy of threats and adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said, together with France, her country stands committed to advancing the implementation of the Minsk agreements in the Normandy format. While many obstacles remain, the reaffirmation of the ceasefire in July 2020 proved that progress is possible “if political will is there”. Welcoming key legislative steps by Ukraine in recent months, she encouraged the Russian Federation to also engage constructively, and expressed concern over a resolution by the Russian State Duma urging President Vladimir V. Putin to recognize the self-declared “People’s Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk” as independent states — which would run counter to the Minsk agreements and constitute a breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity., Commending the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, she echoed calls on all parties to ensure that it is able to carry out its mandate without interruption. More than 90 per cent of cases where monitors’ freedom of movement has been disrupted or their equipment destroyed have taken place beyond the contact line in territory not under the control of the Ukrainian Government, she said, urging the Russian Federation to use its influence to guarantee free and safe access for the Mission. Turning to military developments, she noted the unprecedented build-up of troops from the Russian Federation along that country’s border with Ukraine, as well as that of Belarus. “It is next to impossible to not perceive this as a threat or the preparation for an attack,” she said, deploring the fact that Moscow has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation and calling for diplomatic progress., Mr. VERSHININ (Russian Federation), once again speaking in his national capacity, recalled that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently called the Minsk agreements “totally without merit”. Turning to statements made today about the validity of the Russian Federation’s membership in the United Nations, he said it is not the first time such baseless claims have come up as part of certain delegations’ self-aggrandizement. In fact, the same speculations could be made about Ukraine’s membership or that of any other country, he said., Ms. MONTIAN, in closing remarks, recalled the many messages she had received after delivering her briefing at the outset of today’s Council meeting. No one fears a Russian Federation invasion, she said, emphasizing that the collective West’s game was to throw the troops of the Kyiv regime into Donetsk and then trigger sanctions., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Feb 2022,"Overview, Conflict has been affecting people’s lives and driving humanitarian needs in eastern Ukraine, particularly in Donbas region, since 2014. One consequence has been the separation of the country into the government-controlled areas (GCAs) and the non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs) with a 427km-long contact line, where most security incidents between government and non-government forces occur (OCHA 13/01/2022). There are five crossing points along the line, but only two are operational. The other three have been closed since March 2020 because of COVID-19 containment measures. Both COVID-19 measures and insecurity result in movement restrictions, limiting access to basic services, livelihood activities, and aid. As at January 2022, about 2.9 million people have humanitarian needs, with 1.6 million people coming from NGCAs. There are over 1.46 million registered IDPs. This number includes those who regularly cross the contact line to be registered as IDPs, which is a requirement to continue receiving pensions (UNHCR 05/03/2021; OCHA 14/01/2022; NRC 12/10/2020)., Recent developments pose a risk of ceasefire failure and conflict re-escalation, which could change the humanitarian situation in the country. From the end of 2021 to early 2022, over 100,000 Russian troops were deployed to the borders of Ukraine, both with eastern Russia and Belarus. There are reports of mutual military preparedness from Ukraine and Russia and the deployment of Russian troops (Bloomberg 17/12/2021; Al Jazeera 25/01/2022)., In case of any form of escalation of political or military tensions, civilian casualties, displacement, acute humanitarian needs, damages to infrastructure and public facilities, and access constraints are likely to increase. The degree of humanitarian impact, resulting additional needs, and the primary areas affected will vary depending on the form and time frame of escalation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-briefing-note-ukraine-current-humanitarian-situation-and-outlook-17-february

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Feb 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, While civilian casualties in Ukraine are at a record low, people continue to fall victim to conflict., Humanitarian community launches a call to support 1.8 million conflict-affected people in 2022., After seven years of conflict in eastern Ukraine, water, sanitation and hygiene needs remain acute., While the “contact line” remains largely closed, residents of areas beyond Government control are forced to enter Government-controlled areas through Russia., While civilian casualties in Ukraine are at a record low, people continue to fall victim to conflict, In July 2020, a package of additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire came into force, bringing marked reductions in the level of hostilities. Unfortunately, this downward trend reversed at the beginning of 2021, number of monthly civilian casualties reaching the pre-ceasefire level in September. Despite the increase, the additional measures to strengthen the ceasefire contributed to a decrease in the overall number of civilian casualties in 2021. According to the preliminary data provided by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) [1], from 1 January to 31 December 2021, 110 civilian casualties (25 killed and 85 injured) were recorded, which is a 26 per cent decrease compared with 2020 (149: 26 killed and 123 injured) and the lowest annual level of civilian casualties for the entire conflict period., According to the OHCHR report, the first six months following the ceasefire (1 August 2020 – 31 January 2021) saw the biggest drop in the level of civilian casualties of the entire conflict period (from 98 civilian casualties during the preceding six months (1 February to 31 July 2020) to 41casualties). However, the following six months (1 February and 31 July 2021) witnessed a 51 per cent increase in civilian casualties compared with the preceding six months: 15 people were killed and 47 injured. In August-September 2021, the highest monthly levels of civilian casualties were recorded (15 in August and 13 in September), with the situation slightly improving by the end of the year., Mines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) and active hostilities remained the main causes of conflict-related casualties in eastern Ukraine, accounting, respectively, for some 53 per cent and 40 per cent of all civilian casualties in 2021., From 1 January to 31 December 2021, active hostilities (shelling, small arms and light weapons fire and explosive devices dropped from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) caused 44 civilian casualties: seven people (six men and one woman) killed and 37 injured (25 men, nine women, two boys and one girl). This is 37 per cent lower compared with the previous year. Some 82 per cent of these casualties were recorded in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA), while 18 per cent were reported in Government-controlled areas (GCA)., Over the same period, 58 civilian casualties were caused by mine-related incidents and handling of explosive remnants of war: 12 people were killed (seven men, one woman, three boys and one girl) and 46 injured (31 men, ten women, four boys and one girl). This is a 24 per cent decrease compared with 2020 when 76 casualties were recorded. One of the people who was killed due to an antipersonnel mine explosion during the reporting period (on 23 February 2021) was an 80-year-old man, whose 43-year-old daughter-in-law and 17-year-old granddaughter had been killed by mortar shelling three years ago, in October 2018. While eastern Ukraine remains one of the most mine-contaminated regions of the world, ranked fourth globally as of 2020, some mine action activities, particularly explosive ordnance risk education, have been scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related movement restrictions., Active hostilities in eastern Ukraine also continue to affect civilian housing and infrastructure, including electricity and water and sanitation facilities, gas supply systems, educational institutions and medical facilities. Such incidents endangered the lives of the civilian population and its access to basic services. For instance, the frontline settlement of Nevelske (Donetska oblast, GCA) came under heavy fire twice in November, which destroyed three and damaged over 20 houses and interrupted the power supply. After the second shelling, over 30 of the remaining 45 residents decided to leave their homes., While the intensity of the conflict has recently quieted following a renewed commitment in December 2021 to strengthen ceasefire measures, the fighting on both sides of the “contact line” continues. People residing in the areas where hostilities are a daily reality live in constant fear, with few opportunities to lead a normal life. Failure to adhere to the strengthened ceasefire or to reach agreement on the conduct of demining activities, will result in the armed conflict continuing to claim lives, causing both emotional and physical pain for thousands of people trapped in humanitarian crisis., To date, the civilian death toll of the conflict from 14 April 2014 to 31 December 2021 is estimated to be at least 3,106 people [2] (1,852 men, 1,072 women, 102 boys, 50 girls, and 30 adults whose sex is unknown), while the number of injured civilians is estimated to exceed 7,000.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ocha-ukraine-situation-report-17-feb-2022-enuk

"Ukraine Cash Working Group - Multipurpose Cash Guidance on Transfer Value, Regular and Rapid Response - February 2022",Manual and Guideline,OCHA,"Food and Nutrition
Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Feb 2022,"Background, Since the onset of the response in 2015, the use of cash programming has been an integral part of humanitarian operations in Ukraine. This is particularly true in communities in Government-Controlled Areas (GCA) where markets remain open and have established supply chains, and where financial service providers, including postal and bank services, are accessible and offer a delivery mechanism that is safe, efficient, and suitable for beneficiaries targeted through this response. The proportion of projects with a cash or voucher component in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Ukraine has shown a steady upward trend over the years – from less than 40% in the 2017 HRP to 50% in the 2021 HRP1., Since the very beginning of humanitarian response in Ukraine, multipurpose cash (MPC) transfers have been one of the most appropriate and timely modalities to addressing the immediate multiple needs of the affected population. Cash-based interventions in general and MPC programmes specifically are fitfor-purpose in the emergency context: they assist people in meeting their multiple basic needs while also contributing to local economic recovery or even growth through an injection of cash into markets that have functioning supply chains and absorption capacity, and that offer goods produced locally., In order to determine an appropriate benchmark amount of humanitarian assistance that should be distributed as MPC, the Cash Working Group (CWG) has been facilitating analysis of the income gap between the actual subsistence level and the average income of populations in conflict-affected areas.
Tracking this income gap has informed the periodic review of the MPC transfer value since 2015., The previous MPC guidance document, which this comes to replace, was approved by CWG members in May 2020 and under which the MPC transfer value recommendation of 1150 UAH/person/month was endorsed. The revisit was initiated by CWG members who raised concerns regarding the potential negative economic impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations and the simultaneous gradual increase observed for the actual subsistence line. By the time of its endorsement in May 2020, the MPC transfer value of UAH 1150 was 30% of the national actual subsistence level and 64% of the income gap for vulnerable conflict-affected populations. Since then, the continued relevance of this amount has been discussed regularly at the CWG meetings., In May 2021, CWG members agreed that the income gap analysis for vulnerable populations should be undertaken in August-September 2021 to determine whether the recommended MPC transfer amount should be amended to reflect changes in the actual subsistence line and, accordingly, in the income gap.
Most of the CWG members agreed to share de-personalized information on beneficiaries’ incomes to inform the revision of the MPC transfer value.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cash-working-group-multipurpose-cash-guidance-transfer-value-regular-and

The aim of the donation is to support the people living near the line of contact in eastern Ukraine and help Ukraine prepare for potential migration., Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets said the eight-year armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis that continues to need international attention and support. “The conflict has affected the lives of nearly five million people and more than three million of them need humanitarian aid – lack of medical assistance and public utilities, such as electricity, water and heating, continues to cause problems. People who have been living under a threat for years also need emotional support. The current complicated security situation makes all these problems worse and this is why we have decided to provide additional humanitarian aid to Ukraine to ease the suffering of people living near the front,” Liimets said., The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is allocating €190,000 for additional assistance to vulnerable households and elderly people near the line of contact. The support is aimed at helping them cope during the winter, for example to obtain firewood, basic necessities, warm blankets or clothes. The deteriorating economic environment may call for individual assistance: food, sanitary items, and medical and psychosocial assistance to residents of frontline villages., The actions worth €60,000 in total are carried out by the Estonian NGOs Mondo and Estonian Refugee Council in cooperation with the local governments, social service workers and partners in Ukraine who have the best insight into the needs of local residents and know which families are in the most urgent need of help. Mondo and the Estonian Refugee Council have long-standing experience in providing humanitarian aid in eastern Ukraine and they have been the partners of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since the 2014 humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, organising the charity campaign For Ukraine., The Estonian Red Cross is providing €30,000 via the Ukrainian Red Cross societies, offering material and psychosocial assistance to the emotionally exhausted residents of the conflict zone. The International Committee of the Red Cross is giving €100,000 through the local Red Cross societies to provide medical assistance near the line of contact where the impact of fighting most palpably felt., Estonia is also providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine to help them prepare for potential migration, answering Ukraine’s call with other European Union states. In February, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Estonian Rescue Board are sending equipment worth €161,700 to the Ukrainian Border Guard. The shipment contains six tents for ten people each with sleeping bags, folding beds, tent heaters, diesel generators and other equipment to offer temporary shelter.

An estimated 2.9 million people are projected to need humanitarian assistance in 2022, with some 55 per cent living in the non-Government controlled area (NGCA).1 1 According to the national Ukrainian legislation, such areas have been defined as the temporarily occupied territories of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts., In Government-controlled area (GCA), the severity of needs is lower, particularly in the communities farther from the “contact line”, leading to a lower number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in GCA. The lower severity is in part due to the support provided by the Government of Ukraine, civil society and development actors. The most severe humanitarian needs in GCA remain in areas close to the “contact line” where active hostilities continue. Older persons, persons with disabilities, female-headed households and children living in isolated villages are particularly vulnerable due to their limited mobility, continued exposure to shelling and landmine contamination and economic challenges., In NGCA, the humanitarian needs remain severe and continue to deteriorate. Residents of NGCA have been most impacted by the limitations on movement across the “contact line” due to disproportional COVID-19 restrictions, mostly imposed in NGCA, increasing the number of people crossing to GCA through the Russian Federation. The resilience of the most vulnerable on both sides of the “contact line” has been worn thin, leading to a greater reliance on humanitarian assistance., In 2022, humanitarian partners aim to assist 1.8 million people, including 144,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in GCA, with a funding requirement of $190 million. The target to assist 1.8 million people across the conflict-affected area is similar to the 2021 target and reflects the level of humanitarian response capacity and State ownership of the response as well as access restrictions and the development of COVID-19. The humanitarian response will span six sectoral areas – education, food security and livelihoods, health, protection, shelter/non-food items and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)., The vast majority of the 1.8 million people targeted for humanitarian assistance live in the two conflict-affected oblasts of Luhanska and Donetska., • 750,000 of the people targeted live in NGCA, accounting for 43 per cent of the overall target., • 981,000 of the people targeted live in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (GCA), accounting for 56 per cent of the overall target. It is important to note that the GCA target (of 981,000) includes 120,000 IDPs living permanently in the two oblasts GCA., • 24,000 of the people targeted are IDPs living permanently in other oblasts across Ukraine, accounting for around 1 per cent of the overall target., Among the most vulnerable are older persons, who represent 32 per cent of the people targeted for assistance in 2022, as well as the children of vulnerable families who make up 14 per cent. Importantly, the response also aims to meet the critical needs of 225,000 persons with disabilities., The 2022 response will continue to focus on saving lives, ensuring access to basic services, and strengthening the protection of those affected by the conflict whose needs have been exacerbated by the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Humanitarian operations will focus on delivering a series of sectoral responses aligned with three overarching Strategic Objectives:, Provide emergency and time-critical assistance and ensure access to basic essential services for 1.8 million people affected by the conflict (including 144,000 IDPs), exacerbated by COVID-19., Respond to the protection needs and strengthen protection of 1.4 million conflict-affected people, including IDPs, with due regard to international norms and standards., Ensure implementation of an international humanitarian exit strategy in GCA from 2021 to 2023.
The 2022 response will be guided by a differentiated approach, taking into consideration the particularities of the operational contexts in GCA and NGCA, particularly in terms of access, level of State ownership of the response, operational capacity and severity of humanitarian needs., • In GCA, the approach of international humanitarian actors will remain humanitarian, including elements of early recovery, but not longer-term recovery. The severity of needs remains critical, particularly in the area close to the “contact line”, where people continue to experience the prevailing volatility of the security context and extensive contamination of mines/ERW, while being isolated from essential services and markets due to the lack of sufficient transportation and communication. In such areas, provision of emergency and time-critical assistance will be prioritized to save lives and to ensure people’s access to basic essential services. Meanwhile, humanitarian actors, where feasible and to the extent possible, will continue to collaborate with and support the Government, local authorities, and civil society to strengthen service delivery and humanitarian response, maintaining the commitment to gradually phase out international humanitarian assistance in GCA by the end of 2023. This goal recognizes the strong capacity that exists, particularly of the regional and local authorities and the past and current development opportunities. It will also build on the progress and achievements accomplished over the previous years through the humanitarian-development and peace nexus (HDPN) approach guiding the way humanitarian organizations operate2 and how they collaborate with Government authorities and development actors to seek longer-term solutions to alleviate the suffering of the conflict-weary people and to contribute to a peaceful future.3 The ongoing national decentralization reform process that is also taking place in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, has provided and will continue to present an opportunity for operationalizing the HDPN approach, particularly looking towards capacity-building efforts for local communities, civil society organizations and local administration. Further efforts will build upon the lessons learned of the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) allocation as a seed funding to pilot HDPN approaches in GCA (that began in late 2020 and continue throughout 2021)., • In NGCA, the fragile and volatile operational context continues to pose challenges to humanitarian operations, particularly in terms of access, operational capacity, and respect for the neutrality, impartiality and independence of humanitarian action. Efforts will be made to increase the reach of humanitarian response to address critical and unmet needs, while enhancing humanitarian advocacy to preserve and improve humanitarian space to allow for the continuation of the provision of essential and life-saving assistance, particularly in the programmatic areas where significant gaps remain. The advocacy and access negotiation efforts will build upon and be guided by the recent achievement of the Joint Operating Principles (JOPs) to ensure timely and principled delivery of aid, while the centrality of protection will be promoted and mainstreamed into other sectoral responses, to the extent possible, to allow for a more conducive operational environment., Taking into consideration the recent third wave of COVID-19 cases, particularly in the two conflict-affected oblasts, vis-à-vis the high rates of vaccine hesitancy, it is recommended that all interventions, regardless of the sectors, will integrate the WHO-endorsed vaccine information and promotion messages, where feasible and to the extent possible, to support the campaigns to boost the vaccine uptake and address vaccine misinformation among the conflict-affected communities., The humanitarian response will require $190 million to enable 119 humanitarian organizations to carry out prioritised humanitarian action in 2022. This is a realistic ask that reflects (i) the different levels of operational capacity that exist on either side of the “contact line”; (ii) the access situation; and (iii) zero duplication with the interventions that are being or will be undertaken by other actors, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Government, development actors and other actors that do not traditionally take part in the HRP., Prioritised activities in the 2022 HRP have been identified with emphasis on quality humanitarian action that (i) saves lives, specifically addresses the urgent needs of the most vulnerable; (ii) targets the areas of the most severe humanitarian needs; and (iii) contributes to Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) priorities, including responding to feedback from affected people. Finally, it is important to note that there are fewer people targeted for assistance in NGCA than GCA despite the higher severity of humanitarian needs there because ongoing access constraints continue to limit operational capacity., If humanitarian access improves, particularly to areas outside the Government’s control, the ability to respond and the related financial requirement will likely increase.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-response-plan-2022-february-2022-enuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Feb 2022,"Summary of Context, After eight years of armed conflict, the resulting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has become protracted and has faded from global headlines. The ceasefire brokered in July 2020 has become increasingly fragile, resulting in the number of civilian casualties returning to pre-ceasefire levels and civilian infrastructure frequently coming under fire. Ukraine remains one of the world’s most landmine- and unexploded ordnance-contaminated countries, putting people’s lives at risk and impeding recovery, and limiting access to livelihoods and basic services. With no political solution to the conflict in sight, humanitarian needs are anticipated to continue with increased severity in 2022, particularly in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA)., Conflict, COVID-19 and movement restrictions are interlinked drivers of humanitarian needs in the conflict-affected areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. Humanitarian needs arising from the armed conflict remain critical on both sides of the “contact line”, the 427-km frontline which divides Donetska and Luhanska oblasts into areas under Government control (GCA) and those outside it (NGCA). The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions on movement, primarily applied in NGCA, and decreasing livelihood opportunities, and has pushed fragile and weakened health systems to a breaking point., With the “contact line” substantially closed since March 2020, the NGCA population struggles to access basic services, social benefits and entitlements, for which they need to cross to GCA. Among the most affected are older persons living in NGCA, particularly women, as the effective closure greatly restricts their access to their pensions in GCA. Thirty percent of people in need of humanitarian assistance are older than 60 years of age. This is the largest percentage of older persons affected by conflict in a single country. The effective closure also widens the rift between divided populations, severing previously interdependent networks of essential services and markets. With Ukraine’s harsh winter season and already three waves of COVID-19 (with additional waves likely following the emergence of the Omicron variant), the operational environment has become increasingly complex, especially in NGCA. Access remains seriously constrained, undermining the provision of principled humanitarian assistance, while the humanitarian crisis continues to be at risk of further politicization., Scope of Analysis, This Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) focuses on the humanitarian needs of people living in the conflict-affected Donetska and Luhanska oblasts and of those people displaced by the conflict to other oblasts across Ukraine. As the geographic location matters significantly in the Ukrainian context, the analysis of humanitarian needs differentiates between GCA and NGCA, as well as urban and rural areas where feasible.
For the 2022 HNO, the analytical methodology has been improved to align with administrative boundaries, where applicable. Humanitarian access and assessments remain severely limited in NGCA, which impacts the depth of analysis., Humanitarian conditions, Please refer to section 1.3 for further information, The consequences of the humanitarian crisis on people are examined along three dimensions, as per the Joint Intersectoral Analysis Framework (JIAF):, • Physical and Mental well-being: this dimension analyses critical information and indicators regarding the physical and mental well-being of the population. It examines the impact of mines/ unexploded ordnance, conflict-related damage to housing and civilian infrastructure, including schools and water infrastructure, and indicators pertaining to water, hygiene and sanitation, COVID-19, and food consumption., • Living Standards: this dimension analyses the affected population’s ability to meet their basic needs. This is measured using indicators of population’s access to essential goods and services, ranging from education, health care, social benefits, pensions, household expenditure shares to housing and heating, as well as social protection and civil documentation including birth certificates., • Coping Mechanisms: this dimension analyses to what extent individuals, households, communities and systems are coping with or facing challenges. In Ukraine, the ability to cope is gauged by such coping strategies as reductions in health care and savings expenditures., People in need / Severity of needs, With conflict, COVID-19 and its related movement restrictions driving humanitarian needs, some 2.9 million people are projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2022, the majority of whom, some 54 per cent, are women and girls. The majority (59 per cent) of the people in need live in NGCA, where needs remain severe and continue to deteriorate. The NGCA population has been most impacted by the limitations on movement across the “contact line” due to restrictions imposed primarily in NGCA. In order to obtain entitlements, reach services or maintain family connections, an increasing number of people have been crossing to GCA through a cumbersome and expensive detour through the Russian Federation., The severity of needs is lower in GCA, particularly in the areas farther away from active conflict and the “contact line”, with lower severity attributable to the support provided by the Government of Ukraine, civil society and development actors. The most severe humanitarian needs in GCA remain in areas close to the “contact line”, where active hostilities continue., Of the 2.9 million people projected to be in need, 1.1 million people live in GCA of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, including over 133,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), and 160,000 IDPs in other oblasts across Ukraine.4 Over 1.6 million people in need live in NGCA., The impact of the conflict on people depends on numerous factors, such as location, exposure to hostilities, socio-economic status, gender and age as well as type of pre-existing vulnerabilities, with the older population, persons with disabilities, female headed households and children among those most in need of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine., Please refer to section 1.2 for an analysis on different population groups, including IDPs, and to section 1.4 for an in-depth analysis per GCA/NGCA.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-needs-overview-2022-february-2022-enuk

The humanitarian convoy consists of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for COVID-19 prevention, hygiene materials, medical equipment and construction materials to support the conflict-affected population in eastern Ukraine., Since 2015, UNHCR has delivered 141 humanitarian convoys. During 2021, 24 humanitarian convoys consisting of 202 trucks delivered various humanitarian items to help meet the high level of humanitarian needs among the civilian population in eastern Ukraine. Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, UNHCR and OCHA have transported more than 2 978 tons of various response items, including hygiene kits, PPE, sanitizers and soap, medical equipment, timber and construction materials, and more from IOM, PAH, PIN, MDM, UNHCR, UNICEF and WHO., OCHA and UNHCR have facilitated humanitarian convoys to the non-government-controlled area (NGCA) since 2018 when the Logistics Sectoral Working Group (LSWG) was established as a successor to the Logistic Cluster. The LSWG aims to fulfill the logistics needs of UN Agencies and NGOs accredited in Ukraine through cargo delivery to NGCA.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-nations-and-mdm-delivered-humanitarian-aid-luhansk-oblast-enuk
Renovated rehabilitation centre for children with disabilities opens in Popasna [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",9 Feb 2022,"The centre will provide comprehensive rehabilitation services for children and youth from conflict-affected eastern Ukraine, Popasna, Ukraine, 9 February 2022 -- Today in Popasna, Luhansk Oblast, the opening ceremony has taken place of the renovated ""Leleka"" rehabilitation centre for children with disabilities. An official delegation of representatives of the United Nations in Ukraine attended in the ceremony., The centre will provide comprehensive rehabilitation services for children and youth with disabilities not only from the city of Popasna, but also from other settlements in the Papasna community, which have been deprived of such opportunities by the protracted armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Specialists will provide physical rehabilitation services, as well as psychological and pedagogical support., The renovation of the building and purchase of technical equipment were a joint initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in partnership with Popasna City Civil-Military Administration and with the financial support of the European Union under the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme., Osnat Lubrani, the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, said that without being able to access the facilities and services found in the community, persons with disabilities would never be fully included in society."", ""UNDP and UNHCR have joined hands to adequately respond to the needs of the most vulnerable population, in particular children and young people with disabilities,"" Lubrani said., ""The opening of this centre is a vivid illustration of how rehabilitation services are becoming more accessible, and that children and young people with disabilities will be able to use them at any time and without undue hindrance."", The centre was built in 1983 and until now had not undergone any renovation. During the armed conflict, the roof and windows were severely damaged and as a result, the building began to deteriorate, making it impossible to provide quality rehabilitation services. Until recently, families raising children with disabilities had to travel 60 kilometres, all the way to the regional centre in Sievierodonetsk to receive such services., Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, stressed that quality services should be equally accessible to all, especially to the most vulnerable groups., ""UNDP will continue helping Ukraine on its way to a more prosperous, inclusive, accessible and peaceful future, leaving no one behind,"" Gercheva said., With its services the already-renovated centre will cover, in addition to the town of Popasna, the other settlements that are now part of the Popasna territorial community: Vrubivka, and the villages of Komyshuvaha, Pryvillia and Troitske. Moreover, the locals from the neighbouring Hirske community from Toshkivka village and the towns of Zolote and Hirske can now also use the services at the centre., ""People with disabilities are often among those who suffer most from the consequences of armed conflict,"" Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, explained. ""They often require targeted support to be able to have their rights protected and access services at the same level as other residents in the community. UNHCR, as a protection agency with a humanitarian mission, is proud to collaborate with UNDP and the local authorities to provide children and youth with disabilities with immediate access to much-needed rehabilitation services, through the rehabilitation of this centre that will remain in the community for a long time."", Mykola Khanatov, the head of the Popasna City Civil-Military Administration, expressed the Administration's readiness to support initiatives to improve the quality of life of vulnerable groups in the community. ""Not only children but also young people will receive services in this centre, and this is very important for us,"" said Khanatov. ""Meeting the needs of community members is what we focus on in our work, and since the community's population has grown since the reform, it is very important for us that all people who need such services have access to them and can use them."", The centre's interior was renovated as part of a grant project implemented by the NGO ""Popasna Local Community Agency for Local Development"" under the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme with financial support of more than US$20,000 (UAH 574 000) from the European Union. In addition, thanks to the partnership with UNHCR, more than $12,000 (UAH 344 400) worth of technical equipment was purchased, and the Popasna Civil-Military Administration allocated more than UAH 180,000 ($6,500) of budgetary funds to cover some of the repairs., Background, The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland., Media enquiries: communications.ukraine@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/renovated-rehabilitation-centre-children-disabilities-opens-popasna-enuk
Ukraine - Building Climate Resilience in Agriculture and Forestry [EN/UK],News and Press Release,World Bank,"Agriculture
Climate Change and Environment",9 Feb 2022,"New World Bank Study Analyzes Climate Change Impact in Ukraine, Calls for Action to Build Resilience in Agriculture, KYIV, February 9, 2022 – A new World Bank report, Ukraine: Building Climate Resilience in Agriculture and Forestry, is the first detailed assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on Ukraine, with a focus on agriculture – a key driver of the economy and jobs., This groundbreaking analysis not only provides detailed climate change projections for Ukraine, but also sheds light on the impact climate change may have on the country’s agricultural output, and thereby, on household income and poverty indicators. Additionally, the report sets out specific recommendations for the Government of Ukraine for policies and agricultural practices that would allow farmers to adapt to forecasted changes in crop yields and the associated economic burdens., “While climate change is a major risk to lives and livelihoods worldwide, countries can take appropriate adaptation measures. As the study indicates, it is not too late for Ukraine to reduce the climate risk to agriculture and forests and enhance opportunities in these sectors,” explained Arup Banerji, World Bank Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe., The study finds that, with a continued rise in emissions, temperatures could increase to over 4°C by the end of the 21st century, accompanied by wetter winters and drier summers, coupled with significant variations across regions in Ukraine. The southern steppe is projected to see a dramatic annual increase in tropical nights and summer days by the end of the century. Rising temperatures in summer could result in heatwaves and increase aridity in the south and east of Ukraine. Even with some climate mitigation measures, the number of ice days and frost nights is projected to decrease in the southern region. This will impact many areas of the economy., By the middle of the century, climate change is projected to contribute to decreased yields of the country’s main crops, including barley, maize, and sunflower. However, winter wheat yields could increase by 20–40 percent in north and northwestern Ukraine by 2050, as compared to 2010., The analysis also forecasts a significant reduction in the area suitable for spruce, beech, pine and oak – key timber species in the country. With climate change, forests are likely to face increasing threats from wildfires and insects., Based on this analysis, as well as global best practices, the report recommends that Ukraine strengthens institutions, policy and planning; increases scientific capacity and research; and promotes a transition to climate-smart agriculture and forestry. The study also highlights the need to develop more comprehensive oblast-level impact assessments, especially for water availability and corresponding costs, to identify specific climate risk considerations for development planning on the local level, so action can be tailored to the sectors facing the highest risk in the country’s oblasts., In addition to the analysis and recommendations, Ukrainian Scientific Institutions now have access to all the climate data generated for the analysis - including climate projections for 7,400 grid points covering all areas of Ukraine for the remainder of the 21st century. This data is housed at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute in Kyiv., The World Bank’s overall portfolio of projects supports improvements in basic public services that directly benefit ordinary people, in areas such as water supply, sanitation, heating, power, energy efficiency, roads, social protection, education and healthcare, as well as private sector development. Since Ukraine joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank’s commitments to the country have totaled more than $14 billion in about 80 projects and programs., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2022/ECA/49, Contacts, In Kyiv:, Dmytro Derkatch

UNHCR helps improve reception and sanitary facilities at Milove border crossing point in eastern Ukraine so people can cross in safety and dignity,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Water Sanitation Hygiene,9 Feb 2022,"8 February 2022, Milove, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine – The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in coordination with Luhansk Oblast Civil Military Administration and with financial support from the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), has refurbished the reception area and sanitary facilities at Milove international border crossing point (IBCP) in eastern Ukraine so people can cross in safety and dignity., A new heated waiting hall and reception area for people using the Milove IBCP was officially opened today by Ms. Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Mr. Serhiy Haidai, Head of Luhansk Regional Civil-Military Administration, Mr. David Sevcik, Technical Advisor of ECHO, Mr. Yuriy Petriv, Head of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine in Luhansk oblast, Mr. Andriy Radchenko, Head of Custom Service in Luhansk oblast, Mr. Oleg Savchenko, Head of Milove village council, Mr. Vitaiy Kononov, Head of Starobelsk district administration, and Mr. Roman Reshetnyak, Head of Starobelsk district council., UNHCR, with funding from ECHO, began works to establish modular reception structures with electrical systems and heaters and WC facilities accessible for persons with disabilities at Milove IBCP in October last year, after seeing a large increase in the number of people using this crossing point., “When most of the regular Exit-Entry Checkpoints (EECPs) alone the line of contact in eastern Ukraine remained partially or completely closed due to the protracted Covid-19 situation, more and more residents of the Non-Government Controlled Areas (NGCAs) of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts started using Milove IBCP to enter Government-Controlled Areas of Ukraine to meet their family members and access civil document and social protections such as pensions. A high percentage of people crossing from NGCAs to GCA are older persons and persons with specific needs or vulnerabilities such as disability”, explained Karolina Lindholm Billing. “The waiting area and facilities at Milove IBCP didn’t have the capacity to receive such a large number of people, and many had to wait for hours without protection from the wind and cold, or access to bathroom facilities.”, The international border crossing point at Milove is the only crossing point in Luhansk region between Ukraine and the Russian Federation., “Covid-19 related restrictions have been a major challenge for civilians seeking to cross the EECPs into GCA, therefore impacting the number of people seeking to cross by passing through the Russian Federation. We observed that crossings at IBCP Milove increased from a daily average of 150 to 780, with peaks of up to 1,600 daily crossings. We are very grateful to our international partners for their timely support. Now we can ensure better services for people at this crossing point.” – said Mr. Serhiy Haidai, the Head of Luhansk Regional State Administration., “I am crossing the border two times per year, as my parents live on different sides of the contact line. Before all this new equipment was installed, I remember big lines on this crossing point, especially for those who travelled to or from non-government-controlled territories. Some people even had to stay overnight, they would bring their blankets and sleep under the canopy. So, really, it is much better now,” – said Ivan Korkishko, who lives in Milove and regularly crosses through Milove ICBP., Boards with information about administrative and social services available in GCA have also been set up at the reception area. UNHCR’s NGO partner Right to Protection (R2P) is present at Milove IBCP every working day to monitor the dignity of crossing conditions and provide information and legal counselling to NGCA residents about procedures for obtaining birth certificates for children born in NGCAs, renewal of identity and civil documents, and access pensions., “I am 91 and my husband is 95. We cross to receive our pensions. We are so grateful that we get help with telephone application and with proper recording of our details. I have no idea what we would do without this help,” – commented Varvara Nikishyna from Luhansk after she was consulted by the R2P staff member, Ruslan Prudius., Since 2015, UNHCR and its NGO partners have provided infrastructural and mobility support, information and legal and social counselling at EECPs to facilitate civilians’ freedom of movement across the line of contact. The works at Milove IBCP is a continuation of this support, enabling people to maintain family links and access basic rights and services in safety and dignity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-helps-improve-reception-and-sanitary-facilities-milove-border-crossing-point
New services for IDPs presented at Diia Summit in Kyiv [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Feb 2022,"Two new services will enable IDPs to apply to prolong or terminate IDP monthly targeted assistance on the Diia portal of government e-services, Kyiv, 8 February 2022– The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine presented two new services for internally displaced persons at the Diia Summit, which took place today in Kyiv. The services were developed with the support of UNDP in Ukraine and the Government of Sweden in the framework of the DIA Support Project., From now on, internally displaced persons can submit electronic applications on the Diia portal to prolong or terminate monthly targeted assistance provided to cover their living expenses, including housing and communal services., It will now be possible to prolong or terminate the assistance by submitting an electronic application – provided there have been no changes in their circumstances that may affect the assigning of assistance. Until now, internally displaced persons had to collect supporting documents every six months in order to prolong the assistance or to notify the government of changes in their circumstances, and terminate it. Now it is enough to notify the government either that there are no changes in the supporting documents, or that there is a need to terminate the payments, sign with an electronic signature, and send the application via the portal., These services will make life easier for thousands of internally displaced persons and save the time they have had to spend on bureaucratic procedures, said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, presenting the services. He also thanked international partners, including UNDP and the Government of Sweden, for supporting the initiatives of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, which are important for Ukrainians., The development of services was preceded by amendments to the regulations by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, which simplified the procedure for submitting applications and assigning assistance to internally displaced persons to cover living expenses. The relevant draft Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers was developed, inter alia, with the support of UNDP consultants in the framework of the DIA Support Project, which is implemented by UNDP with the financial support of the Government of Sweden., Tobias Thyberg, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Sweden to Ukraine, noted that Sweden continues to support Ukraine in the development of public services based on the principles of inclusivity and ensuring equal access for all citizens., “These inclusive solutions bring public services closer to all residents of Ukraine, especially the most vulnerable groups, benefiting millions of Ukrainian women and men,” Ambassador Thyberg said. “Sweden will continue to support Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and UNDP in the development of this important area.”, Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said UNDP was committed to further supporting the development of e-government services in Ukraine, especially those for vulnerable groups. Last year, UNDP contributed to the development of eight new e-services, one of which was designed for internally displaced persons, she added., “We’re supporting the ministry and striving to advance the digitalisation of public services, so that they are convenient and easy to provide and receive. We’re paying special attention to the issue of accessibility, because it’s most important that the services are accessible to all, including the most vulnerable groups, leaving no one behind,” said Ms. Gercheva., The services presented today were a continuation of cooperation with the Ministry of Digital Transformation in the field of digitalisation of public services for internally displaced persons. Earlier, the Ministry of Digital Transformation and UNDP within the DIA Support Project launched an electronic service to apply for a subsidised mortgage programme. Officially registered IDPs were able to apply for the programme through the Diia portal., Background, Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine (DIA Support) Project, launched in 2021, aims to bridge the digital divide between generations and different social groups.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",7 Feb 2022,"Each day is a struggle for survival for hundreds of thousands of people living close to the line of contact in eastern Ukraine. Water, gas, and electricity supplies are limited. The combination of cold, Covid-19 and chronic uncertainty make basic needs a challenge. After eight years of conflict, the humanitarian needs are huge., In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is delivering urgent assistance – food, fuel for heating, medical supplies, and support for housing – to those suffering on both sides of the line of contact., ""The situation in eastern Ukraine is desperately challenging for so many people and families. The International Committee of the Red Cross is committed to working alongside them and helping in every way we can,"" says Florence Gillette, the ICRC's head of delegation in Ukraine., ""Along with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners, we stand ready to step up our humanitarian response should the need arise."", The current subzero temperatures are compounding the situation for many families., ""People are telling us their priority is getting through the winter safe and warm. Winter is harsh here, especially for older people,"" says Daniel Bunnskog, ICRC's deputy head of delegation. ""To help those in need, we provide a range of support, from insulating people's houses to improving their energy efficiency to providing fuel or cash assistance to heat the homes of 35,000 people on either side of the contact line."", Sofia Reznik is an ICRC psychologist. Her concern is the mental toll on people living through a time of heightened uncertainty., ""Considering the atmosphere of tension in and around Ukraine, many older residents have had memories of previous wars resurface. We're hearing a lot of people comparing the situations, with great sadness and a sense of hopelessness.
""Now, as they approach the end of their lives, they are again witnessing an uncertain and unstable world. They live in constant fear for their lives due to the ongoing conflict,"", Ms Reznik says., As it has throughout the conflict, the ICRC is maintaining a confidential and bilateral dialogue with all sides to ensure that civilians and essential infrastructure are protected., ""Our message to all sides is clear: civilians and infrastructure ensuring the delivery of essential services to them must be spared, families must be able to see and support each other, and detainees must be treated humanely, in line with what international humanitarian law demands in all armed conflict,"" says Ms Gillette., In the last 12 months, ICRC assistance activities in support of communities on both sides of the line of contact included:Around 35,000 people received solid fuel or cash assistance to help heat their houses this winter., For more information, please contact:

Ukraine conflict affecting children’s mental health: UNICEF,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",3 Feb 2022,"The grinding conflict in eastern Ukraine is increasingly affecting the mental health of boys and girls, causing nightmares, social isolation and panic attacks, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has reported., Two children – Illia, 15, and Afina, 9 – have shared how although they do not bear any physical scars from the war, now in its eighth year, mortar shells and shrapnel have left them with invisible wounds that are nonetheless painful., “My life has changed a lot,” said Illia. “If it hadn’t been for the war, I wouldn’t have had vision problems, and I would have continued to play hockey and enter university in Donetsk.”, A split-second change, Sadly, the teenager is not alone. UNICEF said practically every child caught up in the fighting between Government forces and mostly pro-Russian separatists is now thought to be in need of psychosocial support., Illia recalled that he was standing in the kitchen when a shell hit his home., “In a split second there was an explosion. All I remember is that my ears were buzzing, and I saw a yellow line of fire, then red, orange and fragments.”, His vision has deteriorated over the years. Nights spent sheltering in a dark basement have only made it worse., Life during wartime, “The most important thing during a war is to make it to safety in time,” Illia said., “When you hear a shot, you run to the basement, hide and wait for the explosion. You need to survive while you run to the basement. And then you need to survive in the basement.”, Illia has long dreamed of moving to a big city, but the war has upended his life and his plans., The hockey team he played on has been disbanded due to the hostilities. The university that he planned to go to is now located on the other side of the checkpoints that form the ‘contact line’, in territory beyond Government control. And the stress has taken its toll on his vision., However, thanks to hospital treatment, Illia has been able to stop his vision from deteriorating further. He now wears glasses to correct his myopia. And while he hopes to play sports again one day, he now enjoys helping around the house and preparing cupcakes and other delicious desserts for his family., Conflict-related stress, Although Afina is only nine, she has developed diabetes as a result of conflict-related stress., Her blood sugar level must be measured up to seven times a day, and her family often struggles to afford life-saving insulin due to financial insecurity., Afina was just two years old when the fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine. Her mother, Daria, remembers her daughter playing near their house when a tank drove along their street. The little girl ran as fast as she could, so that she even lost her shoes., “She got scared and started hiding behind me, crying a lot,” Daria recalled., “Yes, I remember,” Afina added, speaking in a soft voice. “How I ran away from the tank and lost my slippers. And I went running barefoot.”, Families feel the strain, After years of stress caused by shelling, Afina was eventually diagnosed with diabetes. “I started drinking a lot of water,” she recalled. “As if everything was dry inside me.”, The war has also impacted her family’s financial situation, and their lives have been turned upside down, as her mother explained., “We were left without a livelihood,” Daria said. “They stopped paying the wages to my husband, payments to my parents were also delayed, even our cow stopped milking at that time.”, A day-to-day existence, The family now struggle to buy new test strips and needles for Afina, as well as insulin for her daily injections., Daria recalled that her daughter has always dreamed of flying on vacation by plane., “Perhaps someday we will be able to do it. But until the war is over, we live a day-to-day existence,” she said., Protecting Ukraine’s children, Despite recent developments aimed at protecting the rights of children affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine, UNICEF said nearly half a million girls and boys continue to face grave risks to their physical health and psychological well-being., The UN agency and its partners provide mental health and psychosocial support services for children living along the more than 420 kilometre-long contact line that divides government and non-government controlled areas. , Last year, UNICEF support reached over 70,000 children, youth and caregivers. Teachers were trained to offer psychosocial support, meaning they can now provide better care for children in school, as well as better cope themselves with the fear and stress of the conflict. , UNICEF requires $2.2 million this year for its child protection work to provide more than 85,000 children with critical psychosocial support. ",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-affecting-children-s-mental-health-unicef

Finding homes for more than a million displaced Ukrainians,News and Press Release,UN News,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",3 Feb 2022,"Around 1.5 million Ukrainians have been forced from their homes since fighting in the far east of the country began in 2014. The UN and other humanitarian organizations are supporting those who have been displaced, as they try to adjust to their new lives., When the conflict broke out between Government forces and mostly pro-Russian separatists, Yuri Zykov and his family were forced to leave their home in Horlivka, a town in the eastern Donbas region which came under heavy fire, and was badly damaged., They headed to Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine, where Mr. Zykov found that local citizens were welcoming and happy to help. This made it easier for him, and the many others escaping the military conflict, to deal with one of the main challenges: finding a suitable place to live., A permanent move, Opinion polls show that most of those who fled the fighting in the east, are not planning to return home, which presents a huge challenge to the authorities., According to the Deputy Mayor of Vinnytsia, Galina Yakubovich, more than 4,000 families of temporarily displaced persons are registered in the city. “We try to help everyone, but the issue of housing is very difficult, so we are looking for different opportunities,” she explained., Mr. Zykov decided to create ""Common Cause"", an organization for displaced people, aimed at dealing with the housing shortage., The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) helped them to understand their rights, how to interact with the authorities, and ensure that their needs were taken into account in local social programmes., Armed with this knowledge, they negotiated with the Vinnytsia local government to build a new building with 105 apartments, and were allocated a plot of land, and funds for the construction, which began a year ago, and is starting to take shape., Crucially, the cost of the new apartments will be half the market price, putting them within reach of the affected families, many of whom would not otherwise be able to afford them., ‘Window of opportunity’, “In 2014, when we first got here, we were confused, and miserable”, says Mr. Zykov. “Now we have a window of opportunity. We received a warm welcome, and we are grateful to the city and all of the organizations and people who have helped us”., The project in Vinnytsia is a first for Ukraine: a unique collaboration between the internally displaced people, the local community and city government authorities, and its success has made it possible to help others. Common Cause now plans to launch similar projects in 18 other regions of Ukraine., In order to raise awareness of what had been achieved, UNHCR gathered representatives from cities around the country in Vinnytsia for the “Cities of Solidarity” forum, in October 2021., “We know that displacement is a life-changing experience. In the early stages of displacement, people need assistance from their host communities and governments.” says Meghan Froener, UNHCR Head of External Relations. “This Forum represents an important symbol of solidarity between authorities and communities”., UNHCR in Ukraine, The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has been helping provide services in Ukraine for 27 years., In particular, it offers assistance and advice to the Government of Ukraine, monitors the fulfilment of the State's international obligations regarding the protection of refugees, and provides assistance to the most vulnerable refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/finding-homes-more-million-displaced-ukrainians
Assessment report on digital access to state administrative and social services for the conflict affected population (January 2022),Assessment,DRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Feb 2022,"The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine has been further compounded by the COVID-19 crisis, creating heavy socioeconomic pressure on people affected by the continuing eight-year-long conflict. The disproportionately older populations living in isolated settlements in GCA along the contact line are one of the most vulnerable groups that cannot access the State social protection apparatus. Access constraints experienced by the residents of NGCA are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 induced restrictions on crossing the contact line. The monthly crossings number dropped by 95 per cent compared to the pre-COVID-19 period1 . For NGCA residents, this made access to pensions, social payments, and other essential services even more difficult., Facilitating access to state administrative, social and judicial services for NGCA and GCA contact line residents has been the major focus of humanitarian legal aid providers since the beginning of the conflict. Lengthy bureaucratic procedures, system’s arbitrariness, errors of human judgment, and physical isolation between people and service providers have been the major reasonsfor the prolonged presence of substantial humanitarian legal aid services in the conflict regions., In the past, government agencies, were often responsible for the generation of legal disputes on the mass-scale. The waves of the arbitrary suspensions of pensions and the series of restrictive executive orders are reminiscent of the early post-conflict period where legal aid providers struggled to content legal disputes generated by government actions., The situation dramatically reversed in the past few years when policymakers started to take notice of the peculiar needs and vulnerabilities faced by the conflict-affected people. This, coupled with increased state interventions on decentralization of services, has created a new beginning with the prospects of conflict-affected people directly accessing state services without the interventions of third-party intermediaries, i.e., legal aid providers. These developments look increasingly promising., The outbreak of the COVID pandemic has caused insurmountable obstacles for many conflict-affected people, particularly the NGCA residents, towards accessing state services. However, the tragic disruption has created strong impetus both among the people and the government to look for digitalization as a solution to the access problems.
Obviously, digitalization cannot be a solution to the access problem for everyone in society, particularly in locations with poor internet access and a high concentration of the older population. However, its appeal comes from the prospect of autonomously resolving a mass volume of access issues, creating an opportunity for government and humanitarian actors to prioritize resource allocation for those who are digitally disenfranchised., To improve the situation with access to social protection, justice, and other state services for all citizens (incl. NGCA residents), the Ukrainian government introduced a vast variety of public electronic services and registers, such as the Eservices of the Ministry of Social Policy, the web portal of the Pension Fund, the online House of Justice, etc. The majority of these state services are integrated into the so-called new brand of e-governance Diia, and made accessible to the people through a mobile app and a web portal. Launched in 2020, the Diia app allows Ukrainian citizens to use digital documents (such as ID-card, driver's license, IDP certificate, student ID, COVID-certificate, and others) on their smartphones for identification and sharing purposes. The Diia portal provides access to over 50 governmental services., Through this portal, Ukrainian citizens, inclusive of IDPs and NGCA residents, can register a place of residence, apply for a pension, generate a COVID certificate, apply for a housing loan for IDPs, obtain a certificate of birth, sign documents, submit a single taxpayer declaration, apply for unemployment benefits, register a real estate ownership, attain extracts from the registers, apply for utility subsidy, get in an electronic queue for visiting administrative bodies and many more, all of it online. By 2024, the government plans to make all kinds of state-person interactions available through Diia., Such an impressive and rapid change, however, has not generated an immediate positive response among the conflictaffected vulnerable populations. Instead, it created a potential gap in services for the technologically disadvantaged people. As NGCA residents have little access to information and latest news from GCA, only younger and more affluent population strata have a cut-off level of awareness on the subject through social media and other internet resources., Populations living near the line of contact, consisting mostly of elderly and ageing individuals, have little-to-no knowledge about the availability or relevance of the online services. The majority do not possess neither electronic devices nor necessary technical skills. The insufficient internet coverage of the buffer zone locations also contributes to the access constraints. On top of that, registration in the Diia app requires having a valid bank ID or an electronic ID passport, while accessing Diia portal is only possible through either bank ID, Diia.Signature (generated upon registering in the Diia app), or QES (e-signature issued by a bank on removable storage media upon submission of a number of necessary documents). Most of the Diia app functions are available for users who have their IDs in the new electronic format, as opposed to the old paper-based ID. According to the Ministry for TOT information, 0.8 million NGCA residents possess such electronic ID. The Ministry for Digital Transformation is currently expanding the functionality of the Diia app for citizens with IDs in the paper form2 ., As a result, a necessity emerged to fill in the hiatus between online services made available by the state and the preparedness of conflict-affected population to use and benefit from these services. To assess the current situation,
DRC conducted a survey focusing on the availability of state electronic services to the vulnerable conflict-affected population. The findings of the survey are expected, inter alia, to become the basis for building an efficient response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/assessment-report-digital-access-state-administrative-and-social-services-conflict

The human suffering of renewed conflict would be limitless. It would result in massive civilian casualties and displacement, and soaring humanitarian needs,"" warned Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, on a visit to Ukraine this week., ""I met countless exhausted and freezing elderly people at the frontline. We cannot have another war in the midst of hundreds of thousands of pensioners,"" he added., Armed conflict in eastern Ukraine is now in its eight year. It continues to take a heavy toll on civilians. Nearly 3 million people rely on humanitarian assistance, and over 850,000 are internally displaced., Active hostilities would dramatically worsen the existing humanitarian situation, where needs are already high from years of violence. It would devastate already damaged civil infrastructure, further restrict peoples' movements, block access to communities in need, and disrupt essential public services such as water, power, transport and banking., It would also trigger massive new displacements, as millions of people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions would be under threat., ""I have not seen my daughter or granddaughter for two long years because the crossing points between our divided Luhansk and Donetsk communities have been nearly sealed off due to conflict and Covid-19. Now we risk our desperate situation getting even worse. We need peace and freedom of movement, not more conflict,"" said Natalya, a Ukrainian grandmother living close to the conflict line., Conflict would reverse improvements made to the humanitarian situation in recent years. The number of people in need decreased from 5 million in 2015 to 3 million projected for 2022., ""Today we should have been talking about gains in the humanitarian situation. But our progress risks being wiped out in an instant, and thousands of families who have just started recovering are at risk of finding themselves at the epicentre of active hostilities,"" said Egeland., Conflict parties must prioritize de-escalation, and refrain from all hostilities, including unconventional acts of aggression. This include spreading misinformation and interference with the provision of essential services. Diplomatic resolution must be premised above all other outcomes while international law must be fully respected by all parties., Facts and figures:, The conflict's civilian death toll has topped 3,000, with over 7,000 people injured since 2014. Over 50,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed., Of the 3 million people in need of aid in 2022, 1.3 million are living in Government-controlled areas and 1.6 million people are living in non-Government-controlled areas., The UN's Humanitarian Response Plan for 2022 calls for $190 million to assist 1.8 million people., Ukraine is ""the oldest"" humanitarian crisis in the world, as about 30% of people in need are elderly., The UN estimates that there are 854,000 internally displaced people in Ukraine., Eastern Ukraine is divided by a 427-kilometre-long front line with 7 crossing points. Since March 2020 movement across this line has been significantly restricted. The number of crossings has decreased by over 90%, from over 1.2 million per month before the Covid-19 pandemic to less than 100,000 per month., Ukraine is one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world. It ranks 5th in the world for civilian casualties as a result of landmines and explosive remnants of war, and in the top three for anti-vehicle landmine accidents. Almost 70 per cent of civilian casualties were caused by landmines and explosive devices since July 2020., NRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014, assisting over 700,000 people with food, shelter, water, sanitation and legal aid., For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/renewed-conflict-ukraine-would-trigger-massive-displacement

OSCE SMM Spot Report 2/2022: Soldiers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces threatened to shoot down SMM mini-unmanned aerial vehicle,News and Press Release,OSCE,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,2 Feb 2022,"At 12:03 on 2 February, while positioned about 2km south-east of Chasiv Yar (government-controlled, 62km north of Donetsk) and conducting a pre-announced mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight, an SMM patrol was approached by a soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who said the patrol could not to fly the UAV at this location. He added that he had not received any information about planned SMM UAV flights. Soon after, a second soldier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces approached the patrol and requested the patrol to land the UAV, adding that any further SMM UAVs launched from the location would be shot down. The Mission landed the UAV and left the area., During the same flight, the mini-UAV experienced GPS signal interference, assessed as caused by probable jamming., The Mission highlights that the OSCE Permanent Council Decision No. 1117 specifies that the SMM shall have safe and secure access throughout Ukraine. Unrestricted and unconditional access to all areas is essential to ensure effective monitoring and reporting of the security situation, as well as other mandated tasks.

The overall security situation in the east remained fragile, with a tense atmosphere created by increasingly hostile rhetoric by the parties to the conflict., The humanitarian situation in the non-government-controlled areas (NGCA) continued to further deteriorate, with particularly negative impact on the ageing health-care facilities. Two waves of COVID-19 pandemic reportedly overwhelmed hospitals and medical workers, while the vaccination rate remained especially low among under 60s. School closures on both sides of the Line of Contact (LoC) meant that thousands of children could not access quality education and experienced considerable learning losses, especially those from low-income families with limited or no access to internet and digital devices. A UNICEF study showed that over half of children in eastern Ukraine experienced child poverty as a result of vulnerabilities which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic., In 2021, UNICEF received USD 10.2 million, out of a USD 14.7 million appeal. Because of the carryover of funding from 2020, the funding gap indicator is zero, however, the HIV/AIDS, health and education programmes remained under-funded.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-4-january-december-2021
Catch-up polio immunization campaign to begin in Ukraine,News and Press Release,GPEI,Health,2 Feb 2022,"cVDPV2 outbreak response continues in the country, A poliomyelitis (polio) vaccination campaign for children aged 6 months to 6 years who missed routine polio doses in the past will begin in Ukraine on 1 February 2022. This catch-up campaign is part of a comprehensive response to stop an outbreak of poliovirus first detected in Ukraine in October 2021. This first stage will last 3 weeks and is expected to reach nearly 140 000 children throughout the country., Years of low immunization coverage in Ukraine have created a large pool of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children who are vulnerable to polio. While routine immunization coverage has gradually increased over the past 6 years, in 2020, only 84% of 1-year-olds received the required 3 scheduled doses of polio vaccines by 12 months of age., The immediate goal of the campaign is to reach the WHO-recommended level of 95% vaccination coverage of eligible children., Background, The polio outbreak in Ukraine was confirmed on 6 October 2021. Poliovirus (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2) was first isolated in a 17-month-old girl in the province of Rivne who developed acute flaccid paralysis. Analysis of all her contacts found that 7 household contacts (siblings) and 8 community contacts in Rivne as well as 4 cousins in the province of Zakarpattya (who had had contact with the girl’s siblings) also tested positive, but did not develop paralytic symptoms., A second case with acute flaccid paralysis (a 2-year-old boy in the region of Zakarpattya) also tested positive for poliovirus, with onset of paralysis in December 2021., The isolated strain of the virus found in both paralytic cases and their contacts is linked to a poliovirus in Pakistan, which was also the cause of several cases in Tajikistan in 2020–2021., Comprehensive plan to stop the spread of poliovirus, Following an initial local vaccination campaign, conducted where the first case was detected, a comprehensive polio outbreak response plan was approved by the Ministry of Health in December 2021., The first stage of the plan will provide inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to children aged 6 months to 6 years who have not received the required number of doses. In the second stage, all children under the age of 6 will be vaccinated with oral polio vaccine (OPV), even if they have received all their scheduled vaccination doses. This is necessary to protect children from infection and to stop the circulation of the virus. Dates for the second stage are pending.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/catch-polio-immunization-campaign-begin-ukraine
The Civilian Impacts of a Possible Russian Invasion of Ukraine,News and Press Release,CSIS,Protection and Human Rights,2 Feb 2022,"As concerns rise over a possible renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine (for CSIS political and military analysis of the situation, please see here and here), so too do concerns over the impact of such an invasion on civilians. The invasion would likely precipitate an acute crisis on top of existing post-2014 humanitarian challenges. Civilians will be negatively impacted no matter the nature of an eventual conflict, though the location, length, and lethality of potential military operations will determine just how bad that impact will be., Q1: What is the current humanitarian picture in Ukraine?, A1: Since the onset of armed violence in eastern Ukraine in 2014, humanitarian efforts have targeted vulnerable populations---particularly the elderly and separated families---on both sides of the contact line, a 250-mile stretch of land between government-controlled areas (GCAs) and non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs). As of February 2021, an estimated 3.4 million people needed humanitarian assistance, 1.67 million of whom were in NGCAs. Despite a public narrative focused on impending conflict, armed violence has in fact been a persistent reality for the last eight years, with commensurate impacts on civilian populations. Even prior to the recent rise in tensions, Ukraine was considered to be among the most underreported crises in the world., The financial scope of the humanitarian response in Ukraine is relatively small, with an annual appeal of $168 million---compared to a $4.4 billion recent appeal for Afghanistan. It targets the over 3 million people in need of assistance because of the violence and disruption of civilian access to basic services, a number that could rise significantly in the event of military conflict. Humanitarian operations have focused primarily on supporting a weak and deteriorated health infrastructure, including the provision of mental health services. Other priorities include basic food assistance and support to water and sanitation infrastructure severely impacted by direct and indirect shelling and a lack of necessary maintenance. Though small, the appeal remains only half funded with an even more serious humanitarian crisis on the horizon., Protection for the civilian population remains a concern due to ongoing acts of violence and a high concentration of armed actors. Ukraine is also considered the third-most-contaminated unexploded ordnance (UXO) and explosive remnants of war (ERW) country in the world, behind only Afghanistan and Syria. The government of Ukraine reports an estimated 2,703 square miles of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to be impacted by the presence of UXO/ERW. Although the absence of a national tracking system for victims and inability to adequately survey limits a precise picture, as of 2019 over 1,000 individuals were known to be killed by land mines or other explosives. The so-called buffer zones on either side of the contact lines are of particular concern, with international mine clearance organizations only permitted to work on the GCA side., Armed violence has in fact been a persistent reality for the last eight years, with commensurate impacts on civilian populations., Before 2014, Ukraine was host to a small number of asylum seekers and others seeking refuge. The simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014 has changed that dramatically. As of July 2021, there were 1.47 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) registered by the Ukrainian Ministry of Social Policy (MOSP). Though experts have raised questions over whether this figure---which differs significantly from the 734,000 IDPs estimated by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre at the end of 2020---includes people who are ""not actually in a situation of displacement,"" the fact remains that internal displacement is both a significant and relatively new reality in Ukraine. Even at the lower IDP figure, Ukraine already ranks in the top 20 countries globally for internal displacement. According to the MOSP data, the largest concentration of IDPs has been in eastern Ukraine, which has been at the center of the protracted conflict: roughly 54 percent of all IDPs in Ukraine are in GCAs of the Donetsk region (35 percent) and Luhansk region (19 percent) alone. Many displaced people from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions have moved from NGCAs to GCAs in those regions, while others moved to central Ukraine, and a smaller number to western regions., Hundreds of thousands of IDPs remain in need of humanitarian assistance, and IDPs living in conflict-affected areas suffer from insecurity in the form of limited access to basic needs, such as housing, water, education, and healthcare (including mental health) services. Those living in NGCAs face additional hurdles in obtaining or renewing official documents, since those issued in NGCAs are no longer recognized by the Ukrainian government. To maintain social benefits such as pensions, Ukrainians must physically register as IDPs in GCAs, an additional barrier for those without the ability and resources to travel across the border., The United Nations' Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan for 2022 also included funding for transitioning the humanitarian component of the response to more sustainable development programming. Current tensions will likely prevent such a shift away from humanitarian programming. Even in the absence of increased violence, the escalation of tensions has already limited freedom of movement and exacerbated existing humanitarian issues. Humanitarian organizations, already struggling to meet civilian needs, are also now focusing on contingency planning. The international presence in Ukraine is somewhat limited, and engagement with local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society partners in preparation for multiple scenarios of a deterioration of the security environment is essential., Q2: How are local civil society actors thinking about a possible invasion?, A2: Civil society organizations have developed contingency plans in case of a renewed invasion of Ukraine, but the current arrangement of Russian forces poses a challenge on how to put those plans into action. Organizations providing assistance to people in need in eastern Ukraine are hesitant to relocate their resources and personnel before knowing whether an invasion will happen and, in that eventuality, whether their fallback locations themselves are safe. Additionally, there is a sense among civil society actors providing humanitarian assistance that responding prematurely to the risk of a Russian invasion would adversely impact conditions for people already living in conflict-affected areas who rely on their support to meet basic needs., If Russia does launch a new offensive, some groups have expressed concern about whether civilians would have sufficient warning to conduct an orderly evacuation. They worry about the availability of emergency shelters and the capacity of the authorities to transport the elderly and persons with limited mobility to safety. These concerns are compounded in rural areas, which could be the first areas to experience conflict in the event of an invasion. Overall, there is a general sense---particularly in areas not already affected by conflict---that members of the public do not know what to do in case of a Russian invasion and are looking for guidance. Battling Russian disinformation campaigns, civil society groups are working to address these concerns and are engaged in frequent information sharing, both informally and through the United Nations' in-country cluster system., There is a general sense---particularly in areas not already affected by conflict---that members of the public do not know what to do in case of a Russian invasion., One thing seems abundantly clear: residents of Ukraine's NGCAs would face disproportionately negative consequences. Humanitarian access to these locations has been a persistent challenge during eight years of conflict; in the event of a new Russian invasion, humanitarian organizations may be expelled or compelled to break off their operations in these areas entirely. This would leave vulnerable people cut off from the United Nations, NGOs, and civil society organizations, completely dependent on support from the self-proclaimed authorities., Finally, of considerable concern to local civil society is the forced displacement of potentially millions more civilians., Q3: In the event of an invasion, what could forced displacement look like in Ukraine?, A3: Were Russia to invade Ukraine---a country of more than 40 million people---forced displacement is almost certain to increase significantly. The scale of the displacement will depend on the location, length, and lethality of the invasion. Ukraine's social services network already struggles to support the hundreds of thousands of IDPs and is not prepared for increased levels., The threat of invasion is particularly problematic for individuals who will need to relocate from NGCAs to GCAs. The 250-mile-long contact line separates approximately 3.5 million people living in the NGCAs of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions from the rest of Ukraine. Today the contact line is harder to cross than many international borders, with only two of seven entry-exit checkpoints (EECPs) open on either side of the contact line, one of which (the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge in the Luhansk region) facilitates 95 percent of people crossing and the other of which (Novotroitske in the Donetsk region) is only open two days per week. The other EECPs and international border crossing points in the NGCAs are not equipped to manage significant influxes of people, much less vulnerable people fleeing conflict. Unless preexisting restrictions are eased, the most immediate concern would be a bottleneck at crossing points, forcing some to attempt dangerous irregular passage to GCAs or other countries and others to seek temporary shelter near contact-line crossings during winter with little humanitarian access for those able to help them. Authorities on both sides of the contact line have repeatedly blocked crossings due to periodic shelling and Covid-19 concerns (real or invented), so such an easing at crossing points seems unlikely in the event of further conflict. This is particularly the case at the Stanytsia Luhanska EECP, through which almost all people currently pass from NGCAs to GCAs, and which is situated mere miles from a Russian air base in Milerovo. New displacements could also trigger spikes in Covid-19 cases, further locking down crossing points and taxing a healthcare system that may be forced to deal with traumatic injuries and other direct consequences of armed conflict., With few other options, some people may seek refuge in neighboring countries. Between 2014 and 2021, 98 percent of the over 1 million Ukrainian refugees fled to Russia, with smaller numbers seeking refuge in Belarus and Georgia. A new Russian invasion will likely cause some people---especially those in NGCAs---to flee again into Russia, though the contours of conflict could lead many people to seek refuge elsewhere., Russian forces are currently amassed to the north, east, and south of Ukraine, including all along its northern border with Belarus. As CSIS colleagues have noted, this means that an invasion could come from any or all of these three cardinal directions. The resulting conflict zones will force people from home, though the numbers and direction of forced displacement will depend on several factors., First, how much resistance Ukrainian forces put up will determine how deadly the conflict is; the deadlier the conflict is militarily, the worse it will be for civilians, many of whom will attempt to flee before being caught in the crossfire. Second (and related), how civilians are treated during the conflict will matter; if evidence of civilian casualties and violations of the Geneva Conventions gets out, many will flee., Third, the route and length of the Russian seizure could determine where people attempt to flee. Were Russia to launch a limited invasion through eastern Ukraine that stops at the Dnepr River, for example, it is likely that civilians in these regions (plausibly including the four most populous regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, and Kharkiv) will use existing migratory pathways through GCAs and into central and western Ukraine. While this scenario is likely to create some refugees who flee Ukraine altogether, it would create an even higher number of IDPs moving west. Without adequate preparation, and given the existing humanitarian needs of IDPs in Ukraine, newly displaced people are likely to run into challenges in securing shelter, food, education, and other basic needs., If Russian troops cross the Dnepr, vulnerable Ukrainians from across the country may seek refuge in neighboring countries. Though the EU and NATO member countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania would be obvious land route destinations (especially since the government of Belarus is so closely aligned with Moscow and several routes from Ukraine to Moldova connect via the latter country's breakaway region of Transnistria), Polish and Hungarian responses to influxes of displaced people in recent years have ranged from unwelcoming to outright hostile., In a country of over 40 million people, it is difficult to predict the number of people who would be forcibly displaced by conflict with Russia. In December 2021, Ukraine's minister of defense, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that an invasion could produce three to five million refugees. Though it's unclear where these figures were derived from, his prediction that ""a major war in Ukraine would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis"" seems entirely plausible., Q4: In addition to the challenges detailed above, what should policymakers focus on with regard to protection of civilians?, A4: Since the start of the conflict in 2014, humanitarian access has been consistently obstructed, and Ukraine remains a highly restricted humanitarian access environment, despite provisions in the Minsk agreements for ""unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to the needy."" In addition to the contact-line-crossing challenges presented above, authorities in NGCAs limit the ability of aid agencies to operate, with many international organizations denied permission to operate at all. These obstacles could become outright barriers in the event of an invasion., Limited international presence has necessitated a prioritization of local organizations in the humanitarian response in NGCAs, with both positive and negative consequences. A more locally led response has benefits for sustainability and increased impact. However, it also entails placing already vulnerable populations at potentially greater risk of violence or arrest by NGCA authorities; in the event of an invasion, it also places them on the front lines of conflict., Ukrainian civil society leaders emphasize that U.S. and European policymakers should keep pressure on Russia and the self-appointed authorities in eastern Ukraine to safeguard humanitarian access. U.S. officials specifically should call on their Ukrainian counterparts to develop more detailed programs for humanitarian access, assistance, and social protection in case of armed aggression., Finally, policymakers should ensure that preparations for a new Russian invasion of Ukraine go beyond the military and diplomatic. As is so often the case, those least responsible for the conflict will undoubtedly bear the brunt of the impact., The authors are grateful to the many NGO and civil society leaders in Ukraine who spoke to us in preparation for this analysis; *their names and organizations are deliberately omitted to protect their safety and ability to continue doing important work across Ukraine. *The authors would also like to thank Kateryna Halstead and Anastasia Strouboulis for their invaluable research assistance., Jacob Kurtzer is director and senior fellow with the Humanitarian Agenda at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

Strengthened protection for stateless people in Ukraine: 737 stateless persons applied to determine their status in 2021,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 Jan 2022,"Across Ukraine, more and more people are becoming “visible” as they receive positive decisions from the Ukrainian state on recognition as stateless., 31 January 2022, Kyiv, Ukraine. – In 2021, Ukraine has made impressive progress in addressing statelessness in the country. The State Migration Service (SMS) of Ukraine successfully rolled out a new stateless determination procedure after the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted the Resolution “On some issues of recognition as a stateless person” in April 2021. Furthermore, in December, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted a new law 1941-IX that will allow stateless persons to apply for naturalization after three years (instead of seven) upon their recognition by the SMS., These changes give much hope to stateless persons in Ukraine. As of 31 December 2021, the SMS had registered 737 applications from people seeking the status of a stateless person. Before the year end, the State Migration Service had issued decisions in 61 cases, in 90% of which the applicants were recognized as stateless persons. From having lived as undocumented people, they received identification documents and could access their rights., One of such persons is Evelina, who has been living in Ukraine for 24 years without a proper identification document., Evelina was born in Dushanbe. Her family moved to Ukraine in 1997, when she was three years old. Evelina grew up and went to study at a school in Odesa. However, when time came to apply for a passport, it turned out that the girl had no legal grounds to obtain a Ukrainian passport. Evelina therefore applied to a consulate of the Republic of Tajikistan, but the consular inspection stated that she was not a citizen of Tajikistan either., “I was in a complicated situation, – recalls Evelina. – Without any identification document, I couldn’t work officially or register a marriage, and even when I gave birth to my daughter, it was difficult to get the birth certificate.”, Thanks to the new statelessness determination procedure, Evelina was able to receive a temporary residence permit, and could start planning for an application for Ukrainian citizenship., “Evelina came for a consultation to our NGO – The 10th of April – a few weeks ago. She had received a confirmation from the State Migration Service of her stateless person status, and now wanted to get married to her partner and confirm him as the father of their child. She is looking forward to becoming a citizen of Ukraine. I am glad that, thanks to the new developments in a legal framework related to stateless persons, people like Evelina will now see a real solution to their situation,” said Oleksiy Yaroshenko, a lawyer at the Statelessness Unit of the UNHCR’s NGO partner, The 10th of April., Anna, 23 years, is another stateless person who became “visible” thanks to the new procedure. Her late mother had difficulties confirming the citizenship of herself and her daughter, after they moved to Ukraine from one of the former USSR republics. However, thanks to the recent legislative developments and establishment of a statelessness determination procedure, Anna was able to obtain the status of a stateless person and received a temporary residence permit in December 2021., “When I got my temporary residence permit, I felt like a real person – I felt visible! – said Anna, proudly showing her new ID. – The first thing I did was to officially register with my employer. After that, I have also registered to receive a medical declaration. Now, I am looking forward to travelling. I still cannot believe that I can even travel abroad! And when the new law comes into force, I can become a citizen of Ukraine!”, UNHCR welcomes these new legislative and procedural developments. Thanks to them, people who were residing in Ukraine without adequate documents can now become lawful residents in Ukraine, where most have lived all their life. They will also be able to obtain a permanent residence permit after two years, and apply to the Ukrainian citizenship three years after obtaining the status of a stateless person. Since the 1990s, UNHCR has worked extensively on identification, prevention and reduction of statelessness in Ukraine, in particular by supporting the Government of Ukraine in developing a normative framework in line with international standards. From June 2017 to June 2021, UNHCR NGO partners have provided legal support to more than 3,000 stateless people and people with undetermined nationality., In Ukraine, UNHCR estimates that around 35,000 persons fall under its mandate on the prevention and reduction of statelessness, and protection of stateless people. A vast majority of these people group belong to vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as Roma, homeless persons, older people holding Soviet passports, and persons released without documents from penitentiaries. UNHCR continues to work with the Ukrainian authorities to improve the availability of data in this area., UNHCR is very grateful to its donors for their support in eradicating statelessness in Ukraine, and in particular for flexible funding which enables us to ensure prompt action in supporting stateless persons in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/strengthened-protection-stateless-people-ukraine-737-stateless-persons-applied
"Situation along Russian Federation-Ukraine Border Can Only Be Resolved through Diplomacy, Political Affairs Chief Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,31 Jan 2022,"SC/14783, SECURITY COUNCIL
8960TH MEETING* (AM), Calling for de-escalation of tensions along the borders between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, the United Nations political affairs chief told the Security Council today that any military intervention by one country in another would be against international law and the Charter of the United Nations, as Moscow denied any intention of launching a war on that neighbouring State., “The Secretary-General has made clear that there can be no alternative to diplomacy and dialogue,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, during a public meeting of the 15-member organ on the recent military build-up along the border with Ukraine., Citing the reported deployment of over 100,000 troops and heavy weaponry by the Russian Federation along the border areas, as well as unspecified numbers of Russian troops and weaponry being sent to Belarus for joint military drills, she noted that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are also reportedly planning additional deployments in the alliance’s Eastern European States, with 8,500 troops on high alert., Urging all actors to refrain from provocative rhetoric and actions and maximize the chance for diplomacy to succeed, she stressed that achieving lasting, mutually acceptable arrangements is the best way to safeguard regional and international peace and security in the interest of all., The international community must intensify its support for the efforts of the Normandy Four (France, Germany, Ukraine and the Russian Federation) and of the Trilateral Contact Group led by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to ensure the implementation of the Minsk agreements, endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015). The United Nations is fully committed to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, she emphasized., Today’s meeting was requested by the United States, whose representative argued that the Russian military build-up along Ukraine’s borders constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The Russian Federation’s delegate strongly opposed holding the meeting, saying that positioning troops within its territory is a domestic matter, not a threat to global stability., The Council then put the matter to a vote, in which 10 Council members supported the holding of the meeting, defeating votes in opposition cast by the Russian Federation and China. Gabon, India and Kenya abstained., In the ensuing discussion, the representative of the United States warned that the Russian Federation’s current actions threaten not only Ukraine but also Europe more broadly. “Our charge is not only to address conflicts after they occur, but to prevent them from happening in the first place,” she said. Moscow also plans to bring additional troops and weapons into Belarus in the coming weeks, close to the border with Ukraine. “This is an escalation and a pattern of aggression that we’ve seen from [the Russian Federation] again and again,” she said, citing past incursions into Crimea, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and other parts of Ukraine., In a rebuttal, the Russian Federation’s delegate said troops have been deployed inside his country on various occasions before without the hysterics currently being witnessed. Rejecting accusations that Moscow intends to attack Ukraine, he said while Western countries claim to be trying to ease tensions, they are instead whipping up panic. Today’s meeting is especially ironic as the United States holds the world record for troop deployments outside its borders and its military adventures have killed hundreds of thousands around the globe., Kenya’s representative said his delegation abstained on the procedural vote, as the impasse between NATO and the Russian Federation is “imminently solvable”, with the diplomatic steps under way already showing promise. Where there are disputes over territorial jurisdiction or security interests, “we strongly support patient diplomacy as the first, second and third option”, he affirmed. The United States, NATO and the Russian Federation have an opportunity to establish a diplomatic framework that will allow them to resolve their differences., France’s delegate said the priority is to achieve a rapid de-escalation of the tense situation, as demonstrated in recent talks by the Normandy Four and in today’s Council meeting. If Moscow refuses to pursue the path of dialogue and respect for international law, the response will be robust and united, carrying severe costs. However, the European Union stands ready to engage if Moscow chooses dialogue and cooperation., China’s representative said that the claim by the United States that this will lead to war is unfounded, given the Russian Federation’s declaration that it has no plans to launch military action. All parties should continue to resolve their differences through dialogue, he said, adding that several Council members agreed that the situation called for “quiet diplomacy, not microphone diplomacy”., Ukraine’s delegate said his country is not going to launch a military offensive neither in Donbas nor in Crimea nor anywhere else. Ukraine sees no alternative to peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict and restoration of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine has inherent sovereign right to choose its own security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, which cannot be questioned by the Russia Federation., The representative of Belarus explained that the upcoming joint military exercises with the Russian Federation will be carried out to verify the responses of their forces, given the commitments of their alliance, to assess their preparedness to eradicate threats and respond to the humanitarian situation, including the ongoing migration crisis. Such planned actions are purely defensive and pose no threat to European countries, or his country’s neighbours., Poland’s delegate, voicing growing alarm over the Russian Federation’s continuous large-scale military build-up on the border with Ukraine, declared: “We cannot keep quiet because what is happening in our neighbourhood constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security, reaching far beyond our region and continent.” As OSCE Chair, Poland is open to facilitating talks on European security, he added., Also speaking today were the representatives of Albania, United Kingdom, India, Ghana, Ireland, Gabon, Brazil, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Norway and Lithuania (also for Estonia and Latvia)., The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 12:10 p.m., Procedural Vote, A procedural vote was requested by the Russian Federation on whether the Security Council will hold an open meeting on the situation in Ukraine, which was called for by the United States., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that the deployment of troops within his country’s territory is a domestic affair, not a threat to international peace and security, rejecting the reasoning of the United States request for today’s meeting. His delegation has refused unfounded accusations repeatedly. Calling for a meeting in an open format represents “megaphone diplomacy”, which will not help bring the Council members together. Such a request has put delegations in an extremely difficult position. Ukraine’s top officials, including the President and the Defence Minister, have stated that they do not see the Russian Federation’s activity as a threat. He urged all Council members not to abuse the Council’s rostrum. The Russian Federation, during its presidency next month, intends to hold an annual Security Council discussion on 17 February to discuss implementation of the Minsk agreements in the pursuit of a settlement to the situation in Ukraine. The United States can fully express its views during that meeting, he said, asking Council members to reject that delegation’s provocative motion., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said her delegation called for this meeting because of what has been witnessed on the borders with Ukraine. The Russian Federation is building up a military presence close to their neighbours. That country has invaded some of the neighbours before. The Russian Federation has occupied their territories. All previous meetings were held in private, and now it is time to convene a public meeting. To the Russian Federation’s delegate, she said, this open meeting will “make you uncomfortable”. The United States honours the Charter of the United Nations to protect peace and security. It is not about rhetoric but about peace and security of a United Nations Member State., By a vote of 10 in favour to 2 against (China, Russian Federation), with 3 abstentions (Gabon, India and Kenya), the Council decided to proceed with the debate., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, noting that the United Nations is closely following ongoing diplomatic discussions between the Russian Federation and the United States, as well as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that while the Secretary-General is not playing an active part in these talks, he unequivocally supports diplomatic efforts at all levels and is greatly concerned about the escalation of tensions and the dangerous military build-up in the heart of Europe., Noting that 100,000 troops with heavy weaponry were deployed along the border with Ukraine, while an additional number of troops were deployed to Belarus, in addition to NATO’s troops being placed on high alert, she said such actions and accusations made during discussions have created uncertainty and apprehension for many who felt they presaged an impending military confrontation. “The Secretary-General has made clear there is no alternative to diplomacy and dialogue,” she said, adding: “There should not be any military intervention in this context. Any such intervention will be against international law and the United Nations Charter.”, The United Nations will contribute to avoid confrontation and create conditions for a diplomatic solution, she continued, welcoming steps in this regard, and urging actors to build on such efforts, engage in good faith and refrain from provocative rhetoric. Reiterating the United Nations support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within internationally recognized borders, she underlined the need for the international community to intensify the efforts of the Normandy Four and the OSCE-led Trilateral Contact Group to ensure the implementation of the Minsk agreements, also in line with Council resolution 2202 (2015)., Welcoming the recent meeting of the Normandy Four in Paris, as well as efforts by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, she said United Nations agencies in Ukraine will continue to deliver their mandate. Safe humanitarian access must be respected to address the 2.9 million people in need, the majority of whom reside in non-government-controlled areas, she said., Recalling that the conflict in Ukraine has claimed 14,000 lives since 2014, and is tragically far from resolved, she said it is “painfully obvious that any new escalation will mean more needless killing and destruction”, adding: “Everyone’s position is this should be inconceivable; the fact that it is not should give us pause.” Any escalation would deal a blow to the architecture to maintain international peace and security, just when we need it most, she said, recalling the Secretary-General’s appeal to de-escalate tension and continue on the diplomatic path., Statements, Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) describing the current situation as urgent and dangerous, said the Russian Federation’s actions strike at the very heart of the Charter of the United Nations. Recalling that the Council was formed in the wake of the Second World War to address the kind of threat that Ukraine now faces, she declared: “Our charge is not only to address conflicts after the occur, but to prevent them from happening in the first place,” she said. The Russian Federation’s current actions threaten not only Ukraine but also Europe more broadly. It also threatens the very international order the Council is charged with protecting, which includes the principle that one country cannot simply redraw another country’s borders by force. Noting that more than 100,000 Russian Federation troops are amassed at the Ukrainian border — the largest mobilization of troops in Europe in decades — she also cited evidence that Moscow plans to bring additional troops and weapons into Belarus in the coming weeks, close to the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation’s military and intelligence services are spreading misinformation and painting Ukraine and Western States as aggressors in order to fabricate a pretext for an attack., “This is an escalation and a pattern of aggression that we’ve seen from [the Russian Federation] again and again,” she said, citing past incursions into Crimea, Georgia, Republic of Moldova and other parts of Ukraine. Warning of the devastating humanitarian impact of a further aggression, she rejected claims that Ukraine is anything less than a sovereign country entitled to determining its own future. Asking what it would mean if former empires had licence to reclaim past territories by force, she said the United States and its partners continue to do everything possible to resolve the current crisis peacefully. “We do not want confrontation, but we will be decisive, swift and united if [the Russian Federation] decides to invade Ukraine,” she stressed. The test of Moscow’s good faith is now whether it will come to, and remain at, the negotiating table in the days and weeks ahead., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) expressed deep concern about the Russian Federation’s recent military build-up near Ukraine, calling on both Moscow and the Council to expressly confirm respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The threat of military attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine is a challenge to the European security order and the entire international security architecture, as well as an affront to the Helsinki Final Act and its Decalogue, upon which OSCE is founded. Events playing out at the Russian-Ukrainian border are from a well-known playbook, he said, recalling events in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine since 2014: the Russian Federation has used military violence as a means of achieving its political and geopolitical goals. However, countries are — and should be — free to choose the organizations they wish to join, whether it be NATO, the European Union, the Collective Security Treaty Organization or Commonwealth of Independent States. “Sovereign countries take decisions by their free will, not under threat of a gun,” he stressed. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue, including steps towards de-escalation and talks to seek solutions. Instrumentalization of ethnic minorities, targeted cyberattacks, political interference for political gain and a growing tendency towards genocide denial and the glorification of war crimes and war criminals are all acts that should be treated as a threat to peace and security, “because they are”., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) recalled the Russian Federation’s statements to the Security Council in 2008 that it was sending peacekeepers into Georgia, when in reality, it was invading an independent, democratic country; and in 2014, denying the presence of its forces in Crimea, when it was actually annexing part of an independent, democratic Ukraine. Today, Moscow denies that its forces pose a threat to Ukraine, but disinformation, cyberattacks and destabilizing plots directed against an independent, democratic country exist. The United Kingdom remains ready to address mutual security concerns and is committed to a constructive dialogue if the Russian Federation is genuine about finding a diplomatic solution. Any Russian invasion or act of aggression against Ukraine would be a gross breach of international law and Moscow’s commitments under the Charter. Conflict would result in bloodshed and destabilize the entire international community, he warned, urging the Russian Federation to declare in the Council that it will stand down its troops, abide by its Charter commitments, has no plans to invade Ukraine, will abstain from the threat or use of force against its neighbour and not further undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial integrity., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), calling on Moscow to de-escalate the situation, respect international law and engage in dialogue through existing mechanisms, said the priority is to achieve a rapid de-escalation of the tense situation, as demonstrated by recent talks in the Normandy format in Paris with Germany, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, as well as today’s Council meeting. Dialogue must be based on principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity alongside European security concerns. If the Russian Federation refuses to pursue the path of dialogue and respect for international law, the response will be robust and united, carrying severe costs. However, the European Union stands ready to engage to develop its relations with the Russian Federation if Moscow chooses dialogue and cooperation., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) welcomed the unconditional observance of the July 2020 ceasefire in Donbas and reaffirmation of the Minsk agreements as the basis of work under the ongoing Normandy format, including commitment of all sides to reduce disagreements on the way forward. Noting the Normandy format will meet in Berlin in two weeks, he urged all parties to continue to engage through all diplomatic channels and keep working towards the full implementation of the Minsk package. “Quiet and constructive diplomacy is the need of the hour”, he said, adding that any steps that increase tension may best be avoided by all sides in the larger interest of securing international peace and security. More than 20,000 Indian students and nationals live and study in different parts of Ukraine, including in its border areas. The well-being of Indian nationals is of utmost priority., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said that the Council’s responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security makes it imperative to encourage the path of dialogue and preventive diplomacy. Noting that while there has been a build-up of Russian Federation troops along its internationally recognized border, he said those troops are presently within its national territory. He also noted a concern of Ukraine and other parties over the intentions of the Russian Federation’s military build-up. Noting with concern the implications the situation has had on Ukraine’s economy and neighbouring markets, he welcomed the call by that country’s President for an easing of the strong narratives on the situation. This must be a time for confidence-building to facilitate a restoration of normalcy for the people of Ukraine., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said her country, along with the European Union, is an unwavering supporter of Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. She called for calm, de-escalation and the pursuit of diplomacy, and for constructive and determined engagement on all dialogue tracks, including the Normandy format and within the OSCE, recalling that the United Nations Charter principles include the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States. “It is the fundamental right of a sovereign and independent State to chart its own path in the world; to choose its own foreign policy and to make arrangements for the security and defence of its territory,” she stressed, citing the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris and the Charter of European Security. Noting that Ireland marked 100 years of independence earlier this month, she said “just as we would not accept another State determining our foreign and security policy, Ukraine similarly has the sovereign right to choose its own policies”. She called for a negotiated, diplomatic solution that reinforces the collective security in Europe. “We have the institutions and the mechanisms within which to pursue this solution,” she assured., ZHANG JUN (China) stated that his country opposes the holding of the open meeting and cannot align with the point of view of the United States in convening it. There have been tensions about the deployment of troops; however, the United States’ claim that this will lead to war are unfounded, given the Russian Federation’s declaration that it has no plans to launch military action, and Ukraine’s own position that it does not need a war. “What is the basis for countries to insist there may be a war?” he asked. All parties should continue to resolve their differences through dialogue, he said, adding that several Council members agreed that the situation called for “quiet diplomacy, not microphone diplomacy”. He expressed regret that the United States did not accept such a constructive proposal, adding that the holding of an open meeting is not conducive to defusing tensions, or facilitating concrete progress on the issue. He called on all parties concerned to stay calm, to not aggravate or “hype up” the crisis, and to resolve their differences on an equal and respectful basis. He went on to reiterate China’s position in favour of implementing the new Minsk agreements, endorsed by the Security Council through resolution 2202 (2015), “a binding document recognized by all parties”. Turning to the expansion of NATO, which “epitomizes group politics” and prolongs a “cold war mentality”, he called on all parties to come up with a balanced approach to the issue through negotiations, while heeding and respecting the legitimate security concerns of the Russian Federation., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that, far from refusing to discuss the situation in Ukraine, his delegation simply does not understand what the Council is attempting to discuss today. The Russian Federation’s troops have been deployed within its own territory on various occasions before without the hysterics currently being witnessed, he said, adding that there is no proof of the very serious accusation that Moscow intends to attack Ukraine. While Western countries claim to be trying to ease tensions, they are instead whipping up panic. “You are almost calling for this … as if you want to make your words become a reality,” he said, noting that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukraine. Today’s actions are yet another attempt to drive a wedge between Moscow and Kyiv, he said, noting that the Ukrainian population is actively being brainwashed and inculcated with anti-Russian thinking and a belief that Ukraine must join forces with Europe at any cost., Citing the Russian Federation’s broad security demands, which are one part of an agreement that could improve the security situation in Europe, he asked the delegation of the United States to show any evidence “other than bogus narratives” that Moscow is planning an attack. He also questioned the figure of 100,000 troops, pointing out that Moscow has never confirmed that number. Recalling that the United States once came before the Council claiming to have evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, he declared: “What happened to that country is well known to one and all,” he said. Indeed, today’s meeting is especially ironic as the United States holds the world record for troop deployments outside its borders and its military adventures have killed hundreds of thousands around the globe. The current crisis in Ukraine is an entirely domestic one, and there is no other option but to adhere to the Minsk package of agreements to resolve it, he stressed, warning against attempts to sabotage those crucial accords., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), describing information about the deployment of Russian Federation troops near Ukraine as “disturbing”, called on all stakeholders to demonstrate restraint and follow the path of dialogue. The international community must activate the channels of preventive diplomacy as enshrined in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations, he said, adding that the current standoff only deepens long-standing divisions in the Council at a time when cohesive action is needed most. “The strength of this Council resides in its unity,” he stressed, echoing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent pleas for all parties to remain calm and refrain from whipping up panic., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to engage constructively in talks aimed at resolving their differences. “There is room to restore confidence and find a lasting diplomatic solution to this crisis,” he said. It is imperative to apply the United Nations Charter principles in a non-selective manner, he said, noting that the prohibition of use of force, the peaceful resolution of disputes and principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and protection of human rights are pillars of the collective security system. He highlighted the need for good faith in addressing the legitimate security concerns of all parties, including those of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, encouraging them to pursue talks on implementation of the Minsk agreements, based on resolution 2202 (2015), and welcoming the resumption of talks within the Normandy format., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) said his delegation abstained on the procedural vote, as the impasse between NATO and the Russian Federation is “imminently solvable”, with the diplomatic steps under way already showing promise. Where there are disputes over territorial jurisdiction or security interests, “we strongly support patient diplomacy as the first, second and third option”, he affirmed. The United States, NATO and the Russian Federation have an opportunity to establish a diplomatic framework that will allow them to resolve their differences. “Compromise is not surrender.” In fact, it was the rejection of compromise that led to the cold war and intervention in Africa, with internal divisions “weaponized at the altar of geopolitical rivalry”, confirming the adage that “when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers”. He called for an urgent, substantive change to the structure and culture of the Security Council, stressing that “we can no longer deny others the power of permanent membership and veto power if today’s permanent five are unable to deliver on the Council’s mandate”. Urging all parties to ensure that negotiations respect Ukraine’s security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said innovative diplomacy could also allow for agreements between today’s major Powers, inspired by the 1975 Helsinki Accords. Such agreements, however, must advance the principle of non-interference in Africa and the rest of the world, he said, urging Ukraine’s leaders to strengthen national unity among all Ukrainians as the surest path to lasting peace., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said basic principles to consider regarding this matter, in line with the Charter, are the prohibition of the threat or use of force, non-intervention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. On the first principle, the escalation of tensions in Eastern Europe represents a potential threat to international peace and security, thus falling under the Council’s purview. Given the prevailing mistrust, all actions that might be considered hostile must be avoided. The Russian Federation’s representative was clear that there is no planned invasion, which is a unilateral statement of non-aggression. Echoing recognition that there is no military solution to this situation, he said various channels for dialogue can ease tensions. On non-intervention, he reiterated the importance of respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. As such, the Council must discharge its mandate and determine the existence of an act of aggression. States have the duty to settle disputes peacefully, he said, adding that diplomatic paths in this situation have not been exhausted. The Council must act as warranted by these circumstances, as it is doing with this meeting., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said the dispute in Europe requires countries in the region to engage in a serious dialogue based on the values of stability, coexistence and peace and through existing mechanisms. Welcoming the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, she emphasized the importance of maintaining security and stability and adhering to the Minsk agreements, which will contribute to reaching a comprehensive, regional understanding that maintains the security and stability of the concerned countries and addresses all their legitimate concerns. Escalation must be avoided, as it could have a negative impact on civilians and exacerbate the fragile humanitarian situation, she said, highlighting their needs. Respect for and adherence to international law is essential to ensure that the situation in Eastern Europe does not deteriorate further, she said, pointing to the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and good neighbourliness as indispensable elements in maintaining international peace and security. Constructive dialogue is critical to resolving differences, with the Council’s role being essential to provide a diplomatic platform that enables States to present and resolve their differences peacefully., MONA JUUL (Norway), Council President for January, speaking in her national capacity, expressed strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including the Crimean Peninsula and its territorial waters. Voicing deep concern over aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine by the Russian Federation, she said the Russian large-scale military build-up near Ukraine’s borders and in occupied Crimea is unprovoked and unjustified. On Moscow’s repeated accusation that NATO is increasing tensions, she underlined that the alliance is defensive and voluntary, and does not seek confrontation. However, it cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which security in Europe rests. Emphasizing that every country has the right to freely choose its security alignment, she called on the Russian Federation to de-escalate, to engage constructively in dialogue through the established international mechanisms and to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor for a second time, said she was disappointed at the statement made by her Russian Federation counterpart, clarifying that her country has no plan to weaken the Russian Federation. Rather, it welcomes a Russian Federation that is a responsible member of the international community. But Moscow’s action along its border with Ukraine is not responsible but provocative. In contrast, the actions and diplomacy of Washington, D.C., are not provocative. The United States commits itself to the path of diplomacy, she said. “Your actions speak for themselves,” she said, urging the Russian Federation to make the right choices., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said he does not understand what threats and provocations the United States delegate are talking about. In her statement, she did not make any reference to the Minsk agreements. This is indicative of a completely different angle from which the United States is looking at the issue., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that he wishes to ensure that his country’s voice is not lost in translation. There is no need for the Russian Federation to interpret the words of Ukrainian leaders in a foreign language. It is a duty for the Council to be fully informed in case of grave threats to international peace and security. What is going on along the border with Ukraine falls under this qualification. A serious talk in the Council is required more than ever to present facts, to listen to each other’s positions and concerns, as well as to outline further actions towards de-escalation. The fact is that about 112,000 Russian troops have been amassed around Ukraine’s borders and in Crimea, and that the Russian troops are also being deployed to Belarus for the planned joint drills. On top of that, on 26 January, the Russian fleet started another military drill in the Black Sea. “This reminds us of the ongoing heavy militarization of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov by Russia,” he said, adding that Moscow poses a serious threat to Ukraine, all littoral States and the wider region. Significant reinforcement of combat capabilities of the Russian occupation forces in Donbas is another worrying trend., On 22 December 2021, the Trilateral Contact Group reached another understanding on resuming the ceasefire regime, he said, noting, however, that shootings, shelling, sniper fire on Ukrainian positions, and systematic use of unmanned ariel attack vehicles against his country’s troops have not stopped. The current impasse within the Contact Group continues and the Normandy format decisions of December 2019 remain unimplemented. Over the past year and a half, the Russian side has made deliberate efforts to obstruct the activities of the Contact Group, and stubbornly denied being a party to the armed conflict that has been raging for eight years in the Donbas region of Ukraine. That country attempted to impose a so-called “direct dialogue” with its puppet occupation administrations, refusing to engage in substantive discussion on political settlement of the conflict. Ukraine is not going to launch a military offensive neither in Donbas nor in Crimea nor anywhere else. Ukraine sees no alternative to peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict and restoration of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. “We are well aware of Russia’s history of ploys and provocations, and we will do everything possible to prevent another Mainila-type provocation by Russia”, he said. Ukraine has inherent sovereign right to choose its own security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, which cannot be questioned by the Russia Federation. That country must remember that Ukraine is ready to defend itself but will keep its diplomatic channels with Moscow open. His country’s President is ready to meet his Russian counterpart. Noting that the Council and the wider United Nations membership have received important information today, he urged the 15-member organ to take an informed decision to employ preventive diplomacy under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and investigate any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute., VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus), stating his country’s position on the unacceptability of resolving any conflict by force, called for efforts to be made to settle the conflict and restore dialogue and mutual understanding, emphasizing that there is “no alternate” to the Minsk agreements as a path to a peaceful settlement of the crisis. Statements by the delegate of the United States represent yet another attempt to “artificially whip up tension, which heightens mistrust and does not help resolve the disagreement”, he said, adding that the expansion of military powers on the western and southern borders of Belarus has not just ceased but is also becoming threatening in nature. Moreover, despite calls by Belarus for cooperation on arms control, more pressure is being exerted upon the country, and its Western partners are not responding to its calls to return to negotiations. Urging Council members to read the Budapest Memorandum, which promises not to exert coercive measures on Belarus, he recalled that States had nonetheless imposed numerous packages on his country. Turning to the joint military exercises planned by his country and the Russian Federation in February, he underlined that these are being carried out to verify the responses of their forces, given the commitments of their alliance, to assess their preparedness to eradicate threats and respond to the humanitarian situation, including the ongoing migration crisis. He went on to note that such planned actions are purely defensive and pose no threat to European countries, or his country’s neighbours. Recalling President Alexander Lukashenko’s statement that war is only possible in two circumstances — in the event of an attack on Belarus or its ally, the Russian Federation — he said his country is continuing to contribute to efforts to resolve the crisis in Ukraine, which it hopes will be settled through dialogue and mutual respect., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) welcomed the holding of today’s meeting, voicing growing alarm over the Russian Federation’s continuous large-scale military build-up on the border with Ukraine. “We cannot keep quiet because what is happening in our neighbourhood constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security, reaching far beyond our region and continent,” he said, adding that the situation follows a pattern of destabilizing actions by the Russian Federation in the region since at least 2008. Stressing Poland’s commitment to the fundamental principles of States’ sovereignty and territorial integrity, the inviolability of frontiers and the non-use or threat of force, he declared: “We know very well from our country’s history that a political order based on spheres of influence brings no positive results.” It is countries’ duty at the United Nations to condemn any threat of the use of force and utilize preventive diplomacy. As Chair of the OSCE, Poland is open to facilitating talks on European security and calls for constructive engagement under that format’s auspices., RYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), also speaking on behalf of Estonia and Latvia, expressed strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and voiced concern over the increased militarization of the Crimean territory occupied for several years by the Russian Federation. Reiterating his full support for the peaceful and sustainable resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, he condemned Moscow’s continued aggressive actions and called on it to immediately stop fuelling the conflict, and to withdraw troops and military materiel from the Ukrainian border. The Russian Federation continues to use the false narrative that it is forced to defend itself, when in fact the opposite is true; Moscow is the aggressor, strengthening its own security at the expense of nations. Reaffirming his country’s commitment to the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations — including the sovereign rights of nations — he stressed that spheres of influence have no place in the twenty-first century, and no country has veto rights over the legitimate sovereign actions of others., For information media.

Ukraine: Health Cluster Bulletin #15 (December 2021 - January 2022),Situation Report,Health Cluster,Health,28 Jan 2022,"Health Cluster – Summary, Health Cluster has stepped-up its emergency preparedness efforts in light of the potential escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Considering recent concerns over the increased tensions near the Ukrainian border, the Health Cluster has been working with its partners to complete scenario planning as part of the operational preparedness and response to the ongoing conflict., The Health Cluster continued to provide support to health partners throughout Ukraine and particularly in the eastern conflict area (ECA). Throughout December and January, the сluster team facilitated three National Coordination Meetings, wrapped up important activities and projects for the preceding year (2021) and set the vision for upcoming year (2022)., The Health Cluster and its partners finalized the Humanitarian Needs analysis (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for 2022. As a result of the extensive analysis and planning processes, in 2022, the Health Cluster aims to reach 1.15 million people in need of health assistance; this will be possible through the implementation of 24 projects with the total requirement of US$35.7 million., The Health Cluster completed its analysis of COVID-19 ‘5W’ for the preceding year (2021), which included detailed mapping of humanitarian supplies reported jointly by WASH, Protection and Health Cluster partners. In summary, over 715 health facilities in 353 settlements have been supported, of which more than half (407 health facilities) were supported by Health Cluster partners., The Health Cluster conducted its annual performance assessment exercise against six core Cluster functions, and the accountability to affected populations. In total, 14 organizations responded to the survey (21% response-rate), including ten international NGOs and two UN agencies., The Health Cluster team conducted a preliminary analysis of gender in health care.

Ukraine: Health Cluster Bulletin #15 (December 2021 - January 2022),Situation Report,WHO,Health,28 Jan 2022,"Health Cluster – Summary, Health Cluster has stepped-up its emergency preparedness efforts in light of the potential escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Considering recent concerns over the increased tensions near the Ukrainian border, the Health Cluster has been working with its partners to complete scenario planning as part of the operational preparedness and response to the ongoing conflict., The Health Cluster continued to provide support to health partners throughout Ukraine and particularly in the eastern conflict area (ECA). Throughout December and January, the сluster team facilitated three National Coordination Meetings, wrapped up important activities and projects for the preceding year (2021) and set the vision for upcoming year (2022)., The Health Cluster and its partners finalized the Humanitarian Needs analysis (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for 2022. As a result of the extensive analysis and planning processes, in 2022, the Health Cluster aims to reach 1.15 million people in need of health assistance; this will be possible through the implementation of 24 projects with the total requirement of US$35.7 million., The Health Cluster completed its analysis of COVID-19 ‘5W’ for the preceding year (2021), which included detailed mapping of humanitarian supplies reported jointly by WASH, Protection and Health Cluster partners. In summary, over 715 health facilities in 353 settlements have been supported, of which more than half (407 health facilities) were supported by Health Cluster partners., The Health Cluster conducted its annual performance assessment exercise against six core Cluster functions, and the accountability to affected populations. In total, 14 organizations responded to the survey (21% response-rate), including ten international NGOs and two UN agencies., The Health Cluster team conducted a preliminary analysis of gender in health care. The analysis was based on the available secondary data and aimed to identify peculiarities of women, girls, men and boys in health status, health care, and health work participation in the oblasts of Donetska and Luhanska in Ukraine.

Further armed conflict in Ukraine would have devastating consequences for the human rights of millions,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jan 2022,"With the threat of Russia using military force looming, Amnesty International warns that another escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine will have devastating consequences for human rights in the region; threatening civilian lives, livelihoods and infrastructure; driving acute food shortages; and potentially causing mass displacement., Economic and social rights have already been negatively impacted. Rising prices for basic foods and goods, including medical supplies, are affecting people’s right to healthcare and to an adequate standard of living in Ukraine. This is particularly felt by the very old, the very young, and those on low incomes. The right to education has also been affected with schools closing intermittently over the past two weeks amid security concerns. In Russia itself, the rouble has dropped in value and prices are rising., “The threat of the use of military force by Russia is already affecting the human rights of millions of people in Ukraine and beyond,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “The consequences of actual military force are likely to be devastating. Ukraine’s recent history is punctuated by conflicts involving Russian troops in Donbas and the illegal annexation of Crimea. These episodes have torn communities and lives apart, as military forces have trampled on the rights of civilians with impunity; it’s time to break that vicious cycle.”, In military conflict, civilians must be protected and anyone who commits abuses must be held to account. Amnesty International will be monitoring the situation closely to expose violations of international humanitarian law (the laws of war) and international human rights law by all parties., In 2014-2015, at the peak of the armed conflict in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, all sides violated international humanitarian law leading to the displacement of over a million people. More than 13,000 people died and the toll is still rising., Russia’s military – a litany of abuse, Based on the lack of respect for international law by Russian troops in other settings in recent years, which has been met with impunity, Amnesty International is extremely concerned about the likelihood of history repeating itself., For example, in Syria in 2015 a series of Russian air strikes on residential areas in Homs, Idlib and Aleppo between September and November killed at least 200 civilians. And in 2020, Amnesty International reported that Russian aircraft were targeting both schools and hospitals in Syria, some of which the UN had specified should be protected from any attacks., In the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, Russia-backed separatist forces violated international humanitarian law by using imprecise explosive weapons in populated civilian areas, as did Ukrainian forces. They also stationed and fired these weapons from homes and civilian infrastructure., “The history of Russia’s military interventions – be it in Ukraine or Syria, or its military campaign at home in Chechnya – is tainted with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. The Russian military repeatedly flouted the laws of war by failing to protect civilians and even attacking them directly. Russian forces have launched indiscriminate attacks, used banned weapons and sometimes apparently deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects – a war crime,” said Agnès Callamard., Amnesty International is also particularly concerned by the prospect of the creation of new militias on Ukrainian territory. Such Russia-backed armed groups in Donbas are notorious for their disregard of the rules of international humanitarian law and lack of accountability, as were the Ukrainian pro-government paramilitaries., Potential refugee crisis, The conflict in eastern Ukraine provoked a full-blown human rights crisis in 2014-2015, the consequences of which continue to be acutely felt to this day. Millions of people were forced to leave their homes, and those who returned or remain in the conflict zone have lived a hand-to-mouth existence, since the region’s economy has been devastated. Hundreds fell victim to extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, torture, abductions, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions committed by separatist, as well as government, forces., According to the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, about 1.45 million people are still internally displaced after fleeing the conflict in Donbas and from occupied Crimea., “It is frightening to imagine what scale the refugee crisis could reach in the event of escalating hostilities in Ukraine. It will be a continent-wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring European countries,” said Agnès Callamard., “Ukraine is currently the destination for those seeking protection when fleeing from Russia, Belarus and Central Asian countries. Should Russia use military force against Ukraine, this will no longer be the case and they will have to seek refuge in other countries.”, Impact on region and beyond, The conflict will further undermine human rights in the region through the likelihood of protracted guerrilla warfare in Ukraine, accompanied by illicit outflows of weapons, an influx of unaccountable private military contractors, and an overall increase in violence and impunity. The economic devastation and its repercussions for the region, including wider Europe that relies on Russian gas passing through Ukrainian territory, may be huge., “A further armed conflict in the very centre of Europe involving a nuclear power and potentially drawing in other countries threatens to disrupt the entire system of geopolitical checks and balances with unpredictable implications on human rights globally,” said Agnès Callamard., “If the West and Russia enter into a more bitter confrontation, this could potentially lead to more active intervention of the parties in regional conflicts throughout the world, weaponization of energy policy, and more countries prepared to use force as part of their foreign policy.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/further-armed-conflict-ukraine-would-have-devastating-consequences-human-rights

"Through computerisation, UNHCR helps increase access to health services along the contact line in eastern Ukraine",News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",26 Jan 2022,"""Last year we saw a fast development of electronic health services in Ukraine. Everything is computerized now, to the point that it became almost impossible to treat patients without a computer. The new electronic system is mandatory for document renewal, obtaining prescriptions, and making appointments to doctors."" shares Doctor Oleh Suprun from Shchastia town while holding a brand-new computer still in its original packaging. ""Now we are fully equipped to provide e-services to the local population."", In December 2021 and January 2022, UNHCR delivered 17 laptops to health centres in villages located in the 0- to 5-km zone along the contact line in eastern Ukraine., Last year, the protection monitoring tool of UNHCR identified that the majority of front-line health care facilities -- first aid points (FAPs) and ambulatories -- had no computers to facilitate access to the e-health care system. The situation was aggravated by the fact that elders represent 60 to 80% of the population living in settlements close to the contact line. They often do not own a computer or lack the necessary IT skills. Similarly, younger low-income households are unable to access e-health care services as they cannot afford a computer nor an internet connection., ""Access to medical services is extremely important for protecting vulnerable people affected by the conflict. UNHCR therefore developed a project aiming to computerize local health care facilities in villages located very close to the contact line"", explains Oleksandra Lytvynenko, Head of the UNHCR field unit in Sievierodonetsk., Oleksandra Lytvynenko further explains that nowadays, many health services cannot be accessed without a computer. For example, doctors cannot record patients' health history, issue digital sick-leave certificates or register vulnerable patients for vaccination. In the same way, patients cannot make appointments with specialists outside their community. Thus, they must spend time and money traveling back and forth., ""When the presence of doctors with different specializations is limited in small settlements, telemedicine can provide a solution for specific needs"", continues Oleksandra Lytvynenko. ""We learned that some ambulatories were equipped with telemedicine systems but had no computer. The new computers will enable more effective work with the system. Moreover, computers will facilitate remote medical consultations in ambulances and FAPs that are not equipped with telemedicine systems."", ""Now that we are fully equipped to provide e-services to the local population, we can double the speed of the overall process. It is much easier and faster to refer to specialized doctors. And our doctors do not need to be distracted from the patient anymore"", says Doctor Oleh Suprun. ""Basically, everyone can do it. Most of our health care employees are older and have some difficulties working with a computer. But they received online training and technical support is always available. One health centre can treat 40 people. In total we cover 25 000 people in our area of responsibility."", Computerization is one way for UNHCR to support people in accessing essential services, like health care in isolated settlements close to the contact line. It enables people to remain in their home without feeling compelled to move in order to access basic services and protection., In 2020, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, UNHCR and partners provided resources to frontline medical facilities. In 20 remote and isolated settlements in Luhansk oblast, medical facilities received medical training, disposable bedsheets, cleaning sets and detergents to better tackle the pandemic., UNHCR is very grateful to its donors for their support in strengthening the capacity of the local health facilities in Luhansk region, and in particular to Estonia, whose funding enabled this project., This article was edited by Sarah Vallee.

There is already a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine...,News and Press Release,HelpAge,Protection and Human Rights,26 Jan 2022,"As conflict in Ukraine becomes more and more likely, and the media coverage and analysis ramp up, the narrative and reporting are missing one of the most important dimensions of any armed combat: the impact this will have on the people of Ukraine., The country and its people are seemingly being cast as a pawn in a global game of chess. Everything is about US and Russia, Europe and Russia, NATO and Russia, while the Ukrainian government does not seem to feature directly in the negotiations, once again airbrushed from proceedings by Russia., The fact that there is already an on-going humanitarian crisis in Ukraine which dates back to the 2014 invasion of Russian-backed forces is constantly missing from the narrative. Further conflict will devastate millions of people who are already struggling to get by., According to a December 2021 snapshot of Ukraine by OCHA, 2.9 million people in the east of the country need humanitarian assistance. The creation of the 420 km ‘contact line’ which split two regions from the rest of Ukraine eight years ago has created ghost towns primarily occupied by the older people who were unable to flee., I visited the stricken areas in 2015 and 2016 and witnessed first-hand how Ukraine’s thriving areas, around Donetsk, once a hub of innovation, IT and creative industries had been ripped apart. Town after town had been destroyed by heavy artillery, the older people being supported by HelpAge International and our partners, living either side of contact line had been left isolated, lost loved ones and cut off with no support., According to the OHCHR, by 2021 more than 13,000 people had been killed since the start of the conflict, while 1.6 million had been forced to leave their homes, and almost half a million older people were living without any source of income., The humanitarian response is woefully under resourced - only securing 56% of the funds it needed in 2021 to deal with the combination of ongoing conflict and COVID-19. Care International UK recently highlighted it as the 2nd most under reported humanitarian crisis last year. This lack of attention and resources makes urgent action even more important. Resilience levels are low, food is in short supply and health facilities are struggling., The Russian government is clearly pushing for conflict. In the last two weeks it has moved the families of its embassy staff out of Ukraine as has the US State Department. The UK have followed. The cyber war has intensified, while military divisions are being deployed to the borders., Of the up to 5.5 million who could be directly affected by an invasion in the East, 38 percent are older people, according to a UN report of May 2021. This will severely test a population already dealing with COVID-19., But with further troop deployments on the northern border in Belarus and in Crimea in the south, the numbers of Ukrainians affected could be up to four time higher if a full-scale invasion occurs on all three borders, according to recent UN reports., The UN, and development agencies need to prioritise Ukraine now. Funds and resources must be delivered as a matter of urgency to support current humanitarian missions in the East and ensure they are prepositioned for additional conflict., We know from experience that effective preparedness limits the impact, but this is particularly challenging when you are dealing with an already underfunded crisis. It is critical that the humanitarian system, working with the Ukrainian government, civil society and the population, increases the support it can offer with immediate effect, if the millions in need and vulnerable are to be protected from the impact of further attacks. If the volcano is steaming, we don’t wait for it to erupt to start moving people., The US, UK and Europe must not bypass the fate of millions of the country’s people. If they are to show true global leadership, the focus of their attention must be the Ukrainian people. As Head of USAID, Samantha Power, states “officials…. must always factor in the human consequence into their deliberations”. Without joined up global leadership and collaboration, thousands will die and millions of lives will be affected., The impact of a conflict in Ukraine will also be felt across the world. As David Miliband of IRC outlined in his recent lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, we are in the age of impunity, with war crimes and attacks on humanitarians increasing without accountability. They are growing because of a lack of global collective leadership and collaboration. NATO, Europe the US and the UK must lay self-interest and posturing aside and act as one to support the Ukrainian government and its people, if they are to stem the tide of impunity., We must not forget that lives are at stake, and communities at risk. Action must be taken now to protect people from further damage and prepare for the impact of what is to come. We must not lose sight of the vulnerable populations and our international commitments to the rights of individuals., By Justin Derbyshire, CEO, HelpAge International",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/there-already-humanitarian-crisis-ukraine

Often a forgotten conflict, the war in eastern Ukraine has continued for 8 years without ceasing; its reality lived daily by the people in the region who face loss of life, trauma from war, and destruction of vital infrastructure needed for basic human needs., Caritas Ukraine, a member of Caritas Internationalis – a confederation of 162 members present in 200 countries and territories in the world – has been on the frontline of this crisis to help, serve and aid all those who are affected by the circumstances of the war, which started in 2014 and has taken more than 14000 lives and forced 1,3 million people to flee their homes. From the very beginning, Caritas was on the ground witnessing love and care for those who were suffering as a result of the conflict. “I remember the first days of the crisis, with the great number of internally displaced people (IDPs) flooding into our city – I knew that we had to help them. With the Caritas community, we developed the tools to do so. And many of the IDPs, once helped, joined our ranks to help others,” says Fr. Andrii Bukhvak, Director Caritas Zaporizhzhia., Over the course of these eight years, with the help of the members of the Caritas confederation and other donors, Caritas Ukraine has worked to bring support to those carrying the burden of the consequences of the conflict, helping them to live in dignity. “Our programs have ranged from immediate food and relief supplies for displaced families to psycho-social support and home-based care in hard-to-reach areas, to water, livelihoods support, and community development. Through the community-based activities, Caritas Ukraine has helped people to organize themselves and begin to normalize social life,” adds Stawnychy. Since the beginning of the crisis in 2014, Caritas Ukraine has helped about 826 500 people., Today, Caritas is concerned about the heightened stress caused by the current situation and the consequences that an escalation of violence would have on the ground in a country of 43 million people. The potential for greater loss of life; destruction of homes, hospitals, and schools; deprivation of basic needs such as water, heating and communication systems, and influx of millions more refugees is significant., Caritas Ukraine is preparing itself to face all eventualities and is developing scenarios to bring support to those in need. “Today, we are continuing our preparations, making use of the experience gained over the last eight years – expanding readiness to different field offices in the whole territory of Ukraine. The key to our humanitarian preparedness is our mission-driven staff of the local centres,” says Andrii Postnikov, Head of Humanitarian Programs Caritas Ukraine., “We have witnessed that amidst destruction, Caritas Ukraine’s practical expression of care, love, and solidarity has the power to restore human dignity and return hope,” adds Postinov. Every gesture of kindness and assistance lets other people know that they are not abandoned. In this difficult time, the people in Ukraine need your solidarity, support, and prayers to know that they are not alone.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/caritas-ukraine-urges-not-forget-suffering-ukrainian-people

With cases and deaths continuing to mount amid low vaccination rates, the health care system is struggling to cope, prompting more strict public health and social measures (PHSM).

The recently reported case of polio in the western part of the country highlights the threat of vaccine preventable diseases. Despite childhood vaccination coverage reportedly being close to WHO targets in 2020, disruptions to immunization programmes due to insecurity and the pandemic place the population in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, especially children, at risk. COVID-19-related restrictions have also impacted TB and HIV programmes, evidenced by lower case-reporting, potentially delaying treatment of unreported infections and risking further disease transmission in regions known to have higher TB and HIV/AIDS death rates than the national average. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, are the leading cause of death in the conflict-affected oblasts. 8 Reduced access to health care and medicines due to hostilities and the pandemic is likely to increase the burden of NCDs.

Diplomatic solution urgently needed to avoid escalation of conflict in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jan 2022,"Urgent action is needed to prevent a dangerous military escalation in Ukraine which could threaten thousands of children’s lives, Save the Children warned today., Children in Eastern Ukraine have grown up in conflict for the past eight years, enduring violence, shelling, and being displaced from their homes. Even before this latest escalation of tensions, 2.9 million people, including over 400,000 children, already required humanitarian assistance., Despite a series of ceasefire agreements signed between September 2015 and July 2020, fighting has continued, preventing thousands of families from returning home and limiting children’s access to education, healthcare and other basic services. In recent weeks, there has been a marked increase in risks to civilian lives as more heavy weapons are moved across the contact lines., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “With almost 100,000 troops massed at the border of Ukraine, we stand at the precipice of a heightened conflict that could affect millions of children. If fighting begins - regardless of who fires the first shot - the conflict could spiral out of control, with devastating consequences for families., “Many children have already witnessed or experienced acts of violence over eight years of conflict. Some children are showing signs of significant distress or have trouble sleeping, and for others, any loud noise or a man with a weapon reminds them of the violence they have experienced or have fled., “Save the Children is gravely concerned for children who might be caught in the middle of this armed conflict, forced from their homes in sub-zero temperatures, and exposed to injury, hunger and cold. Every effort should be made to find a diplomatic solution and avert a catastrophic war. Children must be protected from harm at all times.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, including in the conflict-impacted regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. We are delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. We are distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses. Our specialist teams are also providing children with access to safe, inclusive, quality education and are working with schools and community centres to help children overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence, and increase their resilience and ability to cope with stresses in their daily lives., For more information please reach out to:, media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/diplomatic-solution-urgently-needed-avoid-escalation-conflict-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",20 Jan 2022,"1. Cabinet Adopts Framework for Accrued IDP Pension Debt Provision, Background: There have been two main scenarios under which the government accrued debt for nonpayment of IDP pensions:, i) The missing period from the start of the conflict until it is restored when a person registers as an IDP;, ii) IDP pension is suspended again after the initial restoration. Since 2014, there have been several waves of massive suspensions of hundreds of thousands of pension payments in addition to individual suspensions. The suspension practices were subsequently declared unlawful by the Supreme Court on the grounds of arbitrariness and indirect discrimination of IDPs., In both cases, even after the payments are restored, IDP pensioners can only access payments accrued after the restoration decision. As for the payments for the ‘missing periods’, they are to be computed by the Pension Fund and ‘paid under a special procedure to be established by the Cabinet’, as provided under Cabinet Resolution No. 365. Such restriction was declared1 unlawful by the District Administrative Court of Kyiv for the arbitrary restriction of IDP access to a pension. The Cabinet, however, de-facto ignored the Decision of the Administrative Court and continued to hold the ‘to be paid through a special procedure’ stand with regards to the accrued IDP pensions. In recent times, the development of such a procedure has been included in the Draft Law On the Principles of State Policy of the Transition Period2 and overseen under the National IDP Integration Strategy 2024. The total government debt on account of this is estimated to be 90 billion UAH., Recent Developments: In November 2021, the Cabinet issued Resolution No. 1165 adopting a procedure (framework) for the payment of accrued IDP pension (instalment payments). Below are the crucial accrued pension payment terms:, • Payment Basis: To be paid on a monthly basis [in addition to regular pension payments] only to those applicants who have been included on a special list of accrued IDP pension payment recipients. To receive the payment in the particular year, the person has to be added to the list by 1 January of the year;, • Payment Size: Equals the living wage for persons who have lost their ability to work as of 1 January of the respective year – 1,934 UAH in 2022. This amount is final and includes all the premiums. However, the size of the payment may increase or decrease depending on funding – see below;, • Special Budget Link: Payments will be made from a separate national budget line item, even if granted under a court decision. Size of the arrear payment depends on the budget funding:, if the line is insufficient, the payment is to be proportionately decreased for all the IDPs receiving the arrear pension payment;, If the budget exceeds the spending plan, the payments can be proportionately increased;, An increase/decrease in the instalment payments does not affect the total size of the pension debt and the entitlement. The payments are to be conducted until the entire debt is covered.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/drc-legal-alert-issue-74-november-december-2021-enuk

Recovery and Reconstruction",19 Jan 2022,"In 2021, only two of seven Entry-Exit Checkpoints (EECPs) were open on both sides on the contact line: Novotroitske, in Donetsk Oblast, two days a week and Stanytsia Luhanska, in Luhansk Oblast, seven days a week. The number of crossings in 2021 was at a level considerably below the preCOVID period. In December 2021, the number of crossings at Novotroitske EECP was 3,163, which is only 1,3 per cent of that in December 2019. The same can be deduced from the number of crossings at Stanytsia Luhanska EECP where the number was 55,010 in December 2021, which is 16,7 per cent of that in December 2019. COVID-19 preventative measures are cited by the de facto authorities as their reason to keep the other EECPs closed.
On 29 December, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine eliminated the requirement to install the Vdoma locationaware app and self-isolation for people crossing EECPs to GCA. This also means that isolation in a state-run observation facility is no longer obligatory as it was for people who could not install the Vdoma app. However, restrictions on crossing EECPs on the NGCA side are still being applied.
Infrastructure rehabilitation works began at Novotroitske EECP: a new module to support pedestrian crossings is already operational and another should arrive soon.
Recently, infrastructure improvements at Stanytsia Luhanska EECP were completed, including the installation of new modules and delivery of required equipment, and baggage scanners. In addition, a new administrative service centre will be built at Marinka EECP.
Since November, people who want to cross the contact line have been unable to register at the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) website. Only already existing accounts are able to make submissions. This problematic situation for people crossing the contact line reinforces the urgency of the request R2P sent on 30 December 2021 to the CMU to amend order № 815 by revoking the requirement to obtain a permit to cross the contact line as excessively restrictive and hence unconstitutional.
In December, most respondents at Milove and Hoptivka IBCPs were residents of Donetsk NGCA (48%) compared to the number of residents of Luhansk NGCA (24%). The remaining 28% were residents of Donetsk and Luhansk GCA and other Ukraine oblasts. According to SBGS statistics, the number of crossings at Milove IBCP in 2021 doubled compared to 2020, whilst at Hoptivka IBCP the situation remained the same. Thus, the number of crossings at Milove IBCP was 277,000 in 2020, against 548,964 in 2021. At Hoptivka IBCP, 960,880 crossings were recorded in 2020, against 925,705 in 2021.
Installation of the Vdoma app is no longer required for people crossing through EECPs, however, it still remains a requirement for those crossing through IBCPs. The lack of free COVID-19 tests at both IBCPs makes the process of crossing more complicated. Thus, in December, at Milove IBCP, 39 people were sent for observation. Most were older persons, who could neither install the Vdoma app nor afford COVID-19 tests.
On 21 December, UNHCR successfully finalized rehabilitation works at Milove IBCP to enhance the safety and dignity of crossing and reception conditions. The project was launched thanks to cooperation between UNHCR Ukraine and the Luhansk Region Civil Military Administration. The project will improve the reception conditions at Milove IBCP to enhance the safety and dignity of the people crossing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/crossing-contact-line-december-2021-eecp-survey-snapshot-enuk

Ukraine: Crossing Points - Humanitarian Snapshot: December 2021,Infographic,OCHA,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",14 Jan 2022,"A 20 per cent increase in civilian crossings of the “contact line” was reported through the entry-exit crossing points (EECPs) in December compared with November. A slight increase was also observed at the crossing point “Milove” (Luhanska oblast) and “Hoptivka” (Kharkivska oblast) located on the Russian-Ukrainian border, with many of those crossing likely being residents of non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts transiting the Russian Federation to reach Government-controlled areas (GCA). Recent reports indicated cases, particularly at the “Milove” crossing point, in which Ukrainian ID holders were asked on the Russian Federation (RF) side of the CP to provide additional identity documents as proof of their place of residence in NGCA. This could be connected to the fact that entry to the RF to transit to GCA (and back) is exceptionally permitted for residents of NGCA who have special grounds, e.g., visiting relatives, returning to the place of residence, medical visits, etc., OPERATIONAL UPDATES, On 29 December, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers announced the lifting of mandatory COVID-19-related requirements for entering GCA via the EECPs on the “contact line”. This decision came into force on 30 December. Furthermore, the decision removed the obligation for people to install the mobile phone application “Dii Vdoma” and self-quarantine when entering GCA. This development is a positive step towards removing obstacles hindering freedom of movement. At the same time, several major administrative challenges remain, which include: (i) the requirement to have a permanent residence registration in Luhanska oblast (NGCA) as a prerequisite for re-entering Luhanska oblast (NGCA) via the EECP “Stanytsia Luhanska”, (ii) requisite pre-approval from the entities in control of Donetska oblast (NGCA) to cross the “contact line” that is issued only based on humanitarian grounds, and (iii) the necessity to acquire an e-permit issued by the Security Service of Ukraine for entering GCA., In December, four people crossing from NGCA to GCA via the EECP “Stanytsia Luhanska” were reported to be temporarily stranded in the “grey zone” due to possible technical glitches in the e-permit system. People became stranded as they could not turn back to NGCA due to the lack of residence registration in Luhanska oblast (NGCA).¹ While three of them were allowed to cross to GCA later on the same day, one person had to spend the night in the “grey zone” in the harsh Ukrainian winter conditions., Three UN-organized humanitarian convoys delivered 170 MT of relief items to NGCA. In 2021, there were 22 UN-organized humanitarian convoys to NGCA, with over 2,000 MT of relief items delivered (half of which went to Luhanska oblast, NGCA) compared with 1,311 MT in 2020.² The increase in the amount of assistance delivered is attributed in part to the opening of the EECP “Shchastia” for the transportation of humanitarian cargo directly to Luhanska oblast (NGCA) in March 2021. Previously, humanitarian convoys to Luhanska oblast (NGCA) had to either transit through Donetska oblast (NGCA) via the EECP “Novotroitske” or to be hand-carried over the pedestrian crossing bridge at the EECP “Stanytsia Luhanska”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crossing-points-humanitarian-snapshot-december-2021

Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding",16 Jan 2022,"The Danish Government has decided to allocate EUR 22 million to a comprehensive new support program to Ukraine. The program aims to strengthen Ukraine’s resilience and ability to manage the severe consequences of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine., Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod states:, ""Ukraine is currently threatened by the massive and completely unacceptable Russian military build-up close to the Ukrainian border. I have just visited the contact line and seen with my own eyes how severely this conflict has affected the Ukrainian people. The Danish government will not stand idly by. Our new support package is quite comprehensive, and every bit of it is needed. With this support, we are sending a clear signal of our solidarity with Ukraine. The Ukrainian people must know that they are not alone in their fight for sovereignty and independence."", The new support is presented on the same day that Minister Kofod visits the contact line in eastern Ukraine., The support constitutes a new phase of the Danish Peace and Stabilization Program for Ukraine for the period 2022-25. Of the EUR 22 million, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs contributes EUR 10.75 million and the Danish Ministry of Defense EUR 11.3 million., Minister of Defense Trine Bramsen states:, “We are seeing an aggressive military build-up on the Ukrainian border, confirmed during my recent visit to the country. We must support Ukraine and its right to be a democratic country in its own right. That is why we are now strengthening our Danish contribution to Ukraine’s reforms of its security forces. We are also increasing our contribution to Ukraine’s military training and our assistance in bringing Ukrainian military personnel in line with NATO standards. I will not leave out further contributions.”, The program covers both stabilization, development and defense-oriented assistance. The program for one thing aims to strengthen the security and cohesion of Ukraine's eastern regions. It will also support Ukraine's defense reform and capacity building of the Ukrainian defense. In addition, the program seeks to improve dialogue between people on both sides of the contact line in order to promote conflict resolution and local reconciliation., The program is funded by the Danish Peace and Stabilization Fund, which supports stabilization efforts in vulnerable and conflict-affected areas.

UNICEF welcomes Ukraine’s plan to stop polio outbreak [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,5 Jan 2022,"The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in Ukraine has welcomed the adoption of a national plan which aims to halt recent polio outbreak in the country., Signed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Ukraine on 30 December 2021, the plan signifies the government’s commitment to protecting Ukrainian children from polio and eradicating poliovirus in Ukraine and beyond, in cooperation with all partners., Due to low routine immunization rates, polio returned to Ukraine in 2021. Polio is a debilitating disease that can cause life-long paralysis and even death. With 20 cases already confirmed in the Rivne and Zakarpattia regions, polio now poses a serious threat to every child in Ukraine. Unvaccinated children under the age of six are at the highest risk., “Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere. Vaccination is the only effective way to protect every child and stop the outbreak,” said Murat Sahih, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “Polio vaccines are safe, effective and have already saved hundreds of thousands of children worldwide. I call upon all Ukrainian parents to get their children vaccinated according to the national immunization calendar as soon as possible.”, Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, including UNICEF, are making every effort to end polio worldwide so that no child will ever be crippled by this deadly disease., In Ukraine, UNICEF will be working with the government every step of the way to ensure the effective implementation of the recently adopted polio response plan, especially in the areas of vaccine management and social and behavioral change. The shared goal is to ensure that every child has a life free from polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases., Media contacts, Svitlana Kisilova

The mandate also tasks the Mission to report on any restrictions of its freedom of movement or other impediments to fulfilment of its mandate., Alesia Bolot, National Public Relations Officer, OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, 26 Turhenievska Street, 01054 Kyiv, Ukraine, Mobile: +38 063 022 9600, smm-press@osce.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/osce-smm-spot-report-12022-armed-formations-denied-smm-s-passage-near-stanytsia

USAID and UNICEF Support Delivery of Ultra-Cold Freezers for COVID-19 vaccines to Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Contributions
Health",24 Dec 2021,"The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) with support from USAID delivered 14 ultra-low temperature freezers for storage of Pfizer vaccines to Ukraine., These freezers can simultaneously store up to 3 million doses of vaccines requiring ultra-low temperatures up to -86°C., The national storage facility at the state enterprise UkrMedPostach of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine in Kyiv will receive 10 freezers. The remaining four freezers will be delivered to Kharkiv, Dnipro, Lviv and Odesa for vaccine storage at the regional level for these and neighbouring regions., ""Our aim is to protect the people of Ukraine from COVID-19 to the maximum extent possible. Vaccines remain the only efficient way to prevent the worst outcomes of the virus. We are doing our best to ensure uninterrupted access to vaccines for everyone willing to get vaccinated. The additional freezers will help strengthen our capacity to respond to the pandemic,"" said Minister of Health of Ukraine Viktor Lyashko., ""Today’s announcement of new U.S. Covid assistance to Ukraine demonstrates yet another way that the U.S. continues to stand behind Ukraine in the global fight against this pandemic, in partnership with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF and the WHO. These 14 new ultra cold chain freezers increase national capacity to safely store this lifesaving vaccine, and build on our support through UNICEF to supply more than 3,100 vaccine sites with cooling equipment,” said James Hope, USAID Ukraine Mission Director., “UNICEF continues to support Ukraine in the cold chain upgrade to help increase storage capacity for COVID-19 vaccines. We are grateful to USAID who make this very important progress possible. Support with ultra-cold freezers comes timely since Ukraine expects large amounts of mRNA vaccines at the end of 2021- during 2022. Preserving vaccines at required temperatures ensures they don’t lose their potency thus providing the best protection from COVID-19 for the people of Ukraine. Once again, I would like to urge everyone to get vaccinated as soon as you can - if you still haven’t done so”, said Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine., In September 2021, UNICEF also delivered to Ukraine three ultra-low temperature freezers funded by COVAX., In October 2021, UNICEF started delivering passive cooling equipment and temperature loggers to primary health care facilities to ensure safe and efficient transportation and temporary storage of vaccines and to mobile teams for their usage of vaccines during vaccination sessions., This first batch of the passive cooling equipment was procured with the USAID financial support of $2.8 million., To date, USAID has already committed an estimated $10 million to support Ukraine’s vaccination efforts, and donated approximately 2.2 million COVID-19 vaccines directly to Ukraine through COVAX. USAID funding is also supporting national communication and community engagement efforts to increase demand for vaccination, building the capacity of health providers to counsel on COVID-19 vaccination, and support for logistics and storage of vaccines., Since the beginning of the COVID-19 in Ukraine, the total USAID assistance to respond to and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is over $50 million., Media contacts, Viktoriia Reshetnik
