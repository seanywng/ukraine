IAEA Head Travels to Ukraine to Start Delivery of Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,29 Mar 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, is in Ukraine for talks with senior government officials on the IAEA’s planned delivery of urgent technical assistance to ensure the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities and help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment., The aim of the Director General’s visit is to initiate prompt safety and security support to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. It will include sending IAEA experts to prioritized facilities and the shipment of vital safety and security supplies including monitoring and emergency equipment., “The military conflict is putting Ukraine’s nuclear power plants and other facilities with radioactive material in unprecedented danger. We must take urgent action to make sure that they can continue to operate safely and securely and reduce the risk of a nuclear accident that could have a severe health and environmental impact both in Ukraine and beyond,” Director General Grossi said., During this week’s visit, the Director General will travel to one of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants., The IAEA has drawn up concrete and detailed plans for safety and security assistance to Ukraine’s nuclear sites, which include fifteen nuclear power reactors at four plants as well as the Chornobyl NPP, where radioactive waste management facilities are located following the 1986 accident. The IAEA’s technical assistance will also facilitate conditions for the IAEA to continue carrying out its safeguards activities in Ukraine in line with its non-proliferation mandate., “Ukraine has requested our assistance for safety and security. We will now start delivering it. Ukraine has one of Europe’s largest nuclear power programmes. The IAEA’s presence, where needed to ensure safety and security, is of paramount importance. We are ready to provide the necessary support now,” he said., Since the start of the conflict, Director General Grossi has expressed his grave concern about the deteriorating safety and security situation for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. He has stressed the IAEA’s commitment and readiness to help ensure that the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring safety and security are adhered to. In recent weeks, several of them – including the physical integrity of facilities, the ability of operational staff to work without undue pressure, and the access to off-site power – have been seriously compromised., “There have already been several close calls. We can’t afford to lose any more time. This conflict is already causing unimaginable human suffering and destruction. The IAEA’s expertise and capabilities are needed to prevent it from also leading to a nuclear accident,” he said., The Director General is expected to hold a press conference upon his return to Vienna later this week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-head-travels-ukraine-start-delivery-nuclear-safety-and-security-assistance

"Ukraine: As humanitarian crisis deepens, parties urgently need to agree on concrete measures; misinformation risks lives [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,ICRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",29 Mar 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) – As the international armed conflict in Ukraine enters its fifth week, the level of death, destruction and suffering that continues to be inflicted on civilians is abhorrent and unacceptable., Over the last five weeks, the ICRC has been speaking with Russian and Ukrainian authorities about their obligations under international humanitarian law (IHL) and what practical steps must be taken to limit the suffering of civilians and those who no longer participate in hostilities, including the wounded, sick, and prisoners of war (POWs). To the ICRC's great concern, the parties are yet to meet many of their core obligations under IHL or reach consensus on key issues that only they can concretely deliver on, specifically:, We have made detailed proposals regarding safe passage and evacuations for civilians to ease the massive suffering taking place in Mariupol, but we still lack the concrete agreements needed to move forward. Today, civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely., Time is running out for civilians in Mariupol and in other frontline areas who have now gone for weeks with no humanitarian assistance. The militaries on the ground need to give civilians and humanitarian organisations security guarantees and practical agreements to allow aid in and for those who wish to evacuate safely., In addition, the parties to the conflict must inform the ICRC of the POWs—and other people deprived of their liberty—whom they hold and allow the ICRC to visit them. We expect the parties to fulfil their obligations under the Geneva Conventions without further delay., The parties need to follow through on concrete proposals for the dignified treatment of the dead so they can be identified, families informed, and bodies returned., The belligerents are obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, to limit military operations to exclusively military objectives and to take precautionary measures., In an effort to advance conversations on these issues, reduce the suffering and increase assistance to civilians in need, the ICRC's president travelled first to Kyiv and then Moscow to meet with authorities. His meetings with authorities in Moscow triggered deep anger for some. We want to be clear that these diplomatic meetings with all sides are anchored in international humanitarian law and passionate advocacy for the best interest of civilians trapped in conflict., At the same time, deliberate, targeted attacks using false narratives and disinformation to discredit the ICRC have the potential to cause real harm for ICRC teams, our Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners working on the ground and the people we serve. As needs increase by the hour, our ability to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance is today being jeopardised by a surge of misinformation and disinformation about our work and the role that we play to alleviate suffering in armed conflict., One claim that has no basis in truth is a false allegation about ICRC's role in forced evacuations. The ICRC has not been involved with any forced evacuation or forced transfer of civilians into Russia from Mariupol or any other Ukrainian city. To be absolutely clear, we would never support any operation that would go against people's will., There is another false allegation that has no basis in truth about our work in Russia. To be clear: the ICRC does not want to open an office in southern Russia to ""filter"" Ukrainians, as many reports are alleging. We are not opening a refugee camp or any other type of camp., These are the facts: the ICRC is discussing opening an office in Rostov in southern Russia, where we currently have no office. This is part of a huge regional scale-up to deal with a massive humanitarian crisis and meet the needs of people wherever they are. We already have teams in Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Romania., Lastly, neutral and impartial humanitarian action must be respected, both ours and others'. This is bigger than the ICRC. Neutrality and impartiality are not abstract concepts or lofty principles that have no relation to people's real-life experiences. It is a means to an end, a way of working that allows us to reach, help and in many cases save the lives of civilians, no matter what side of the frontline they are on. Our presence is to assist and protect and should never be interpreted as legitimizing sovereignty or territorial claims, which are the exclusive right and obligation of the political actors., This is the sort of lifesaving and life-changing humanitarian work that we and others must be allowed to do in Ukraine and surrounding countries in response to the massive and growing humanitarian needs caused by this international armed conflict., The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014, supporting people affected by conflict. Since the recent escalation of the crisis, we have brought over 500 tons of medical supplies, food and relief items into the country to respond to skyrocketing humanitarian needs. We will continue to scale up our work and now have teams in 10 locations across the country., A world without neutral and impartial humanitarian action is a bleaker, more dangerous place for victims of conflict, and for us all., We call on the parties to safeguard this action, to urgently meet their obligations under IHL to protect civilians caught in conflict, and to facilitate neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action., For more information, please contact:, Crystal Wells (English), ICRC Geneva

Some 3.9 million refugees have been forced to flee the country, making this the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. An additional 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine’s borders, and at least 13 million are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., The appeal includes players from across the Premier League, Bundesliga and Division 1 Féminine accompanied with music by WFP’s Goodwill Ambassador, the Weeknd. The three players with a refugee background are UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador and FC Bayern Munich sensation, Alphonso Davies, Mahmoud Dahoud (Borussia Dortmund) – the first Syrian refugee to play in the Bundesliga – and Everton FC goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic who was forced to flee his home in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

WFP teams are also setting up operations and hubs in several locations in the neighboring countries to facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance into Ukraine., “We are inspired by the response we’ve seen from football fans all over the world, who are showing their support for people affected by the conflict in Ukraine. Our message to everyone, is to remember that no-one chooses to become a refugee. Refugees - from Ukraine and beyond – are placed in the most heart-breaking of circumstances, forced to flee for their lives.

Between 24 February and 22 March, the OHCHR recorded 2,571 civilian casualties, including 977 people killed, however, these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA). According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU), more than 650 residential buildings have been destroyed across Ukraine thus far, while 64 attacks have taken place on healthcare facilities (source: WHO) and 548 educational facilities have received damaged., On 22 March, two out of five humanitarian corridors were operating, which enabled the relocation of 7,026 persons, while on 23 March, Ukraine’s Vice-Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, announced that nine humanitarian corridors had been agreed upon and would be opening., The situation in eastern and northern Ukraine is particularly concerning. In Mariupol (Donetsk oblast), local authorities estimate that around 80 per cent of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed. Critical health services have been brought to a halt due to the destruction of healthcare infrastructure and injury to health workers, and access to food and drinking water remains critical., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 22 March, over 3.62 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. IOM further estimates that around 6.48 million people have already been internally displaced, many of whom currently have limited access to food, drinking water, social services, and power.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-10-25-march-2022

and expressions of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against people on the move, including refugees,, Strongly condemning any attacks directed against civilians as such and other protected persons and civilian objects, including civilian evacuation convoys, as well as indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, including indiscriminate shelling and the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons, and further expressing concern about the long-term risks posed by damage to civilian infrastructure and unexploded ordnance to the civilian population,,

famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, as well as on energy security,, Recalling the link between armed conflict and violence and conflict-induced food insecurity and the threat of famine, and stressing in this regard that armed conflict, violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and food insecurity can be drivers of forced displacement and that, conversely, forced displacement in countries in armed conflict can have a devastating impact on agricultural production and livelihoods,, Expressing concern about the grave humanitarian consequences of a possible accident resulting from the bombing and shelling of the Ukrainian nuclear infrastructure, reiterating the obligation to ensure the safety and security of all nuclear infrastructure, and expressing concern about the impact of the conflict on the environment,, Recalling the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of distinction and proportionality and the obligation to take all feasible precautions to

humanitarian law, and urging all States and parties to armed conflict to respect human rights, including with regard to those forcibly displaced, and the principle of non-refoulement,, Reiterating the call upon all parties to the armed conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law regarding the protection of civilians and civilian objects, and the environment, and to spare civilian objects, including those critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian population, refraining from attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, and respecting and protecting humanitarian personnel and consignments used for humanitarian relief operations,, Reaffirming the principles

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Mar 2022,"Situation overview, 3 million refugees have fled in 20 days, with over 1.7m into Poland, and more than 1m into Hungary, Moldova,
Slovakia and Romania. These numbers are rising daily., There are reports of much larger numbers of internally displaced people inside Ukraine, mostly heading west or south-west and many in/around Lviv and other ‘safer’ cities in the same area. However, the Western areas of Ukraine are increasingly targeted, too. The UN estimates 6.7m will be displaced. The overwhelming majority of displaced and refugees are women and children., There is serious concern about the humanitarian situation in the east, south-east and Black Sea Coast where conflict is active, areas with no or limited humanitarian access, and the increasing number of encircled cities where food, supplies and services are dwindling. Humanitarian corridors have struggled to be established., The ongoing conflict in Odesa is expected to lead to significant numbers of refugees fleeing through Moldova and Romania. These refugees are likely to be in greater distress and need of humanitarian assistance. We are prepositioning stock in order to respond to their needs., The FAO estimates international food prices may rise between 8 and 22% as a result of the conflict. Between 20-30% of winter cereal, maize and sunflower seed fields in Ukraine will not be planted or remain unharvested during the 2022/23 season. This is expected to contribute to global supply gaps and heighten economic hardship and needs for the vulnerable elsewhere., Between 35% to 45% of refugees in Moldova and Ukraine are estimated to be children. While no official systematic data are available yet, anecdotal evidence, random registration, and direct observation suggest that a very high percentage of refugees are children under 14: some separate/unaccompanied, some left at the border by family members who can’t leave Ukraine, some arriving with their mothers., Romanian and Moldovan civil society have stepped up, but are reaching their limit. Future waves of refugees are anticipated to be increasingly vulnerable, and the humanitarian community will need to step up efforts to strengthen government and local civil society response., Urban response is required in Romania: refugees are moving through reception areas towards urban centres. World Vision is planning for a concentration of refugees in cities and commercial centres and are working with local authorities to identify overflow shelters and gaps in service provision.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-response-situation-report-2-16-march-2022

The next report will be issued on or around 30 March., KEY FIGURES (FLASH APPEAL 2022), 12M people in need (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 6M people targeted (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 890K people reached (Source: OCHA), $1.1B funding required (US$) (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 44% funded (Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • According to Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, since 24 February, Ukraine has suffered nearly US$565 billion in damages and losses, a figure that continues to rise amid ongoing fighting., • The World Food Programme (WFP) says food is one of the top three concerns of affected people, estimating that around 45 per cent of people are worried about getting enough food. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) rapid needs assessment across 19 oblasts indicates that food shortages are projected immediately or in the next three months in more than 40 per cent of cases., • Approximately 90 per cent of Mariupol’s residential buildings (Donetska oblast, east) – around 2,600 homes – have been affected by active fighting, with some 60 per cent suffering various degrees of damage due to direct shelling, while about 40 per cent have been completely destroyed. Local authorities say the rising civilian death toll is fast-approaching 5,000 people., • Despite considerable operational constraints, the second UN-organized convoy since 24 February reached Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast, east) on 28 March, carrying relief items from the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), WFP and the World Health Organization (WHO)., • As of 24 March, WFP has provided cash and food assistance to 770,000 people across Ukraine and plans to reach up to 2.5 million people with humanitarian assistance by the end of April., • UNICEF has dispatched more than 90 trucks carrying nearly 1,050 tons of emergency supplies to support children and families. So far, 63 trucks have arrived in Lviv (Lvivska oblast, west) with critical relief supplies that will address the needs of more than 8 million people, including 2 million children., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. As of 27 March, the civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive stands at 2,975 – including 1,151 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts in the east, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,017 casualties – including 377 killed and 928 injured – compared to 288 civilian casualties in the nonGovernment-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (60 killed and 228 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 1,670 civilian casualties. Additionally, since 24 February, nearly 10.3 million people and counting have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine and neighbouring countries, whose growing needs remain difficult to assess and effectively address amid a highly volatile security situation., The destruction of vital civilian infrastructure continues to rise, leading to the destruction of scores of homes across the country and cutting off access to critical services for millions of people. According to Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, since 24 February, Ukraine has suffered nearly $565 billion in damages and losses, a figure that continues to rise amid ongoing fighting. Ms. Svyrydenko added that infrastructure losses amount to $119 billion, including almost 8,000 km of roads, dozens of railway stations and airports damaged or destroyed, $112 billion in losses to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, and $90.5 billion in losses incurred by the civilian population, including 10 million m2 of housing and approximately 200,000 vehicles., According to the Energy Ministry of Ukraine, more than 918,700 users across some 1,435 settlements in Ukraine remain without electricity, up from 850,000 users in over 1,300 settlements on 24 March. Around 6 million people either have limited or no access to safe water, with active hostilities preventing repair teams from fixing damaged systems and restoring access to water while also hindering the delivery of water in the hardest-hit areas, like Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. UNICEF reports that water trucking services have come to a halt due to relentless shelling in some parts of these eastern oblasts, where local authorities say that the water supply remains critical with little possibility to improve access to safe water as hostilities rage on., As of 28 March, WHO registered 73 confirmed attacks2 on health care that have led to 71 deaths and 37 injuries. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science says that 659 educational institutions have been damaged and another 74 completely destroyed to date. On 28 March, Kyiv City Administration resumed online learning to allow children and adolescents to continue their education., Food security. According to FAO, the immediate food security concerns arising from the ongoing military offensive are related to food access, as available grain stocks in Ukraine were around 114 per cent of estimated annual demand before the recent escalation. On 9 March, the Government of Ukraine purchased the equivalent of one year’s worth of national consumption of grain from farmers and traders to bolster existing Government stocks. Ongoing hostilities have triggered significant disruptions to supply chains and markets across Ukraine, leading to consumption gaps in locations where people cannot access markets over consecutive days, even when food is available. These problems are further compounded by the loss of livelihoods and access to critical income sources, including Government-provided pensions and social safety nets, especially in areas with a heavy presence of the Russian Federation forces, like eastern Ukraine, significantly affecting people’s purchasing power and food security., According to WFP, food is one of the top three concerns of affected people in Ukraine, alongside safety and fuel for transportation. WFP estimates that around 45 per cent of people are worried about getting enough food in Ukraine, adding that one out of five people are thought to be using some food-coping strategies, like reducing the size and number of meals consumed, eating less food and sacrificing meals so that children can have access to sufficient food. FAO’s recent rapid needs assessment across 19 oblasts indicates that food shortages are projected immediately or in the next three months in more than 40 per cent of cases., Eastern Ukraine. Donetska and Luhanska oblasts continue to be the epicentre of the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. On 25 March, food warehouses were reportedly attacked in Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast), according to oblast authorities. While no civilian casualties were reported, important food stocks were allegedly destroyed. That same day, at least three civilians were killed, and nearly 60 others, including at least five children, were reportedly injured in multiple locations in Donetska oblast (both GCA and NGCA). On 26 March, shelling reportedly set fire to two food warehouses as well as three multi-storey residential buildings and several homes in Sievierodonetsk., Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in Mariupol remains one of the greatest response priorities and challenges. Unlike other hard-hit locations, like Kharkiv, Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), Odesa (Odeska oblast, south-west), Dnipro (Dnipropetrovska oblast, centre) and Sumy (Sumska oblast, north), which can still be reached through commercial transport, life-saving humanitarian supplies have failed to reach Mariupol as access and security constraints have prevented aid convoys from entering the encircled city for over a month. In Mariupol, local authorities say the rising civilian death toll is fast-approaching 5,000 people., As civilian casualties mount amid relentless fighting, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to receive information corroborating the existence of mass graves in Mariupol, with one alone estimated to hold around 200 people. In Mariupol, local authorities say around 160,000 people – around 30 per cent of the pre-escalation population of some 540,000 – remain largely without access to basic necessities like adequate food, safe water and electricity. According to local authorities, approximately 90 per cent of Mariupol’s residential buildings – around 2,600 homes – have been affected by active fighting, with some 60 per cent suffering various degrees of damage due to direct shelling, while about 40 per cent have been completely destroyed., Another grave concern in Mariupol is the reported forcible evacuation of residents to the Russian Federation territory. While around 60,000 people have been evacuated to Ukraine, local authorities estimate that 20,000-30,000 residents from Mariupol have been forcibly evacuated to NGCA and the Russian Federation territory, according to the Mayor of Mariupol Vadym Boichenko. Ukrainian authorities have appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to obtain from the Russian Federation a list of residents forcibly evacuated from Mariupol and provide them with an opportunity to return to Ukraine. The forced displacement of residents and the confiscation of their passports and other important documents would constitute a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions. On 25 March, OHCHR announced that they were examining the accusations but had not been able to verify them yet., Northern Ukraine. The humanitarian situation in the city of Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north) continues to rapidly deteriorate. Relentless shelling has left as many as 130,000 people – less than half of the pre-escalation population of around 290,000 – without electricity, heating and gas. Drinking water is running low across the encircled city, prompting local authorities to impose restrictions on the distribution of drinking water to prevent shortages. Those still trapped in the city remain cut off from Kyiv – about 160 km south of Chernihiv – after the bridge crossing the Desna River in the direction of the capital was destroyed on the night of 22-23 March, leaving people unable to safely evacuate and preventing urgently needed relief supplies from entering the city. Access and security constraints prevent local authorities from organizing humanitarian corridors in and out of the city as needs rise and basic supplies dwindle., Western Ukraine. After being spared the worst of the ongoing military offensive over the last month, the worst attacks so far have been witnessed in western Ukraine. On 26 March, air raid sirens rang out in Lviv – a safe haven for more than 200,000 people forcibly displaced within Ukraine – after multiple airstrikes hit the city, prompting local authorities to urge residents to seek shelter. Governor Maksym Kozytsky stated that two rockets struck a fuel depot in the eastern outskirts of Lviv, injuring at least five people, followed shortly by another airstrike that hit a military factory. The attacks came just over a week after airstrikes destroyed an aircraft repair plant in the strategic western city some 60 km from the border with Poland., The same day, in neighbouring Rivnenska oblast (north-west), local authorities reported that a missile strike destroyed an oil depot in Dubno. According to oblast authorities, the flames were quickly extinguished by local firefighting crews, adding that critical chemical and radiation indicators remain within the permissible range and thus, pose no immediate threat to the nearby population. Similarly, in Volynska oblast (north-west), an oil depot was reportedly destroyed near the administrative centre of Lutsk, raising concerns that the scope and scale of the ongoing military offensive may continue to expand further westward., Civilian evacuations. According to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine, between 25 and 27 March, nearly 13,640 people were evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, mainly from Mariupol (4,910 people), affected communities in Kyivska oblast (more than 350) and Luhanska oblast (more than 1,000). In Donetska oblast, nearly 50 buses intended to pick up residents previously evacuated from Mariupol and currently stuck in Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast, southeast) were prevented from entering the city. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported that it evacuated around 12,825 people, including 2,045 children, from affected areas in Ukraine to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that more than 469,680 people, including some 97,345 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine., Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). In recent days, fires have raged in the areas surrounding the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone, scorching more than 10,000 hectares of forests that have increased levels of radioactive air pollution, according to the Ukrainian Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova. Windy and dry conditions could possibly intensify fires near the NPP, potentially leading to large-scale fires that would be difficult for local emergency crews to contain as the presence of the Russian Federation forces limits access. On 27 March, fresh fires broke out in the area surrounding the Chornobyl NPP, prompting Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk to appeal to the UN Security Council to take immediate action to demilitarize the exclusion zone., Moreover, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says there has not been a shift change among technical staff at the Chornobyl NPP since 21 March. The current staff arrived at the plant on 20-21 March to replace co-workers who had been working non-stop since the Russian Federation forces allegedly took over the site on 24 February. After days of relentless shelling at civilian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych (Kyivska oblast) – where the operational personnel of NPP and their families live – the Russian Federation forces reportedly entered the city, putting at further risk the critical rotation of staff who ensure the nuclear and radiation safety at the Chornobyl NPP. Meanwhile, IAEA is still reportedly unable to receive remote data transmission from the NPP monitoring systems.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-28-march-2022

"Mounting civilian deaths, mass destruction and catastrophic humanitarian situation as Russian Federation attacks Ukraine, says UN Human Rights Office [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,28 Mar 2022,"Uzhhorod, 28 March 2022 – There are strong indications that serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross violations of international human rights law have occurred following the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine on 24 February, says a new update issued by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU)., This update includes HRMMU’s findings from the start of the armed attack up to 26 March 2022, and is being published today alongside the 33rd OHCHR periodic report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, which covers the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 January 2022., “We are appalled, day after day, by the ever rising death toll and human suffering in cities, towns and villages across the country. The war must stop and accountability should be ensured,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU., The update documents that armed forces have used explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas – including missiles, heavy artillery, and rockets, as well as airstrikes. These weapons have caused civilian deaths and injuries, destroyed civilian objects and left civilians without access to healthcare, food, gas, water and electricity., “Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” Ms Bogner said. “The extent of destruction of civilian objects and civilian casualties strongly suggests that violations of the principles of distinction, and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks have been taking place.”, Since the start of the Russian armed attack, as at 26 March, HRMMU has recorded at least 1,119 civilian deaths and 1,790 injuries, including 99 children killed and 126 injured. The actual figures are much higher, as the ability to collect and verify information from several locations affected by hostilities is severely hindered. This particularly concerns the city of Mariupol and the town of Volnovakha (both in Donetsk region), where high numbers of civilian casualties have been reported. 2,623 civilian casualties have occurred in Government-controlled areas, while 286 have occurred in territory in Donetsk and Luhansk regions controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’., The update also documents arrests and detentions of 24 public officials by Russian troops and affiliated armed groups of self-proclaimed ‘republics’ in areas under their control, 13 of whom have been subsequently released. HRMMU has also documented the arbitrary arrests and possible enforced disappearances of 21 journalists and civil society activists who have been vocal against the Russian armed attack in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Seven journalists and media workers have been killed, 13 have been caught in hostilities, and at least one journalist is missing whose last known location was in an area of active hostilities. There are also growing concerns about possible reprisals and retaliation against human rights defenders and civil activists who have been vocal against the Russian armed attack, including Crimean Tatars., HRMMU has also received information regarding arrests and detentions of more than 300 individuals by Ukrainian law enforcement officers, including three cases where officers allegedly did not provide information to the individuals’ relatives about their formal arrest, places of detention and fate., The update describes cases of torture and ill-treatment of people believed to be so-called marauders, bootleggers, pro-Russian supporters, and curfew violators in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine. HRMMU has received credible allegations of more than 45 such cases, perpetrated by civilians, police officers and members of the territorial defence.

Secretary-General’s press encounter – on the war in Ukraine (28 March 2022),News and Press Release,UN SG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Mar 2022,"Ladies and gentlemen of the media,, Good morning. It is a great pleasure to be with you again., Today, I am announcing that in the exercise of my good offices, I have asked Martin Griffiths, the Coordinator of our humanitarian work worldwide, immediately to explore with the parties involved the possible agreements and arrangements for a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine., Since the beginning of the Russian invasion one month ago, the war has led to the senseless loss of thousands of lives; the displacement of ten million people, mainly women and children; the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure; and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide., This must stop., The United Nations is doing everything in its power to support people whose lives have been overturned by the war., In the past month, beyond their support to refugee hosting countries, our humanitarian agencies and their partners have reached nearly 900,000 people, mainly in eastern Ukraine, with food, shelter, blankets, medicine, bottled water, and hygiene supplies., There are now more than 1,000 United Nations personnel in the country, working via eight humanitarian hubs in Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Uzhorod, Chernivitzi, Mukachevo, Luhansk and Donetsk., The World Food Programme and partners reached 800,000 people in the past month and are scaling up to reach 1.2 million people by mid-April., The World Health Organisation and partners have reached more than half a million people in the most vulnerable areas with emergency health, trauma and surgery kits., Just today a convoy of trucks brought food, medical and other relief supplies from WFP, WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF to Kharkiv, to be delivered by our national partners to thousands of people in hard-hit areas., Our agencies and partners are procuring vital supplies and setting up pipelines for delivery throughout Ukraine in the coming weeks., But let’s be clear. The solution to this humanitarian tragedy is not humanitarian. It is political., I am therefore appealing for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, to allow for progress in serious political negotiations, [aimed] at reaching a peace agreement based on the principles of the United Nations Charter., A cessation of hostilities will allow essential humanitarian aid to be delivered and enable civilians to move around safely. It will save lives, prevent suffering, and protect civilians., I hope a ceasefire will also help to address the global consequences of this war, which risk compounding the deep hunger crisis in many developing countries that already lack fiscal space to invest in their recovery from the pandemic, and now face soaring food and energy costs., I strongly appeal to the parties to this conflict, and to the international community as a whole, to work with us for peace in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and across the world., Thank you., Spokesman: Edie Lederer, Associated Press., Question: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. Can you expand a bit on what Mr. Griffiths is being asked to do? And is he going to go to the region? Is he going to try and meet with senior leaders, both in Moscow and in Ukraine? And how quickly is he going to basically start this peace effort?, Secretary-General: Well, he will immediately start. He's in Kabul today and he will be coming back, and he already made some contacts. And, of course, I hope that he will be able to go to both Moscow and Kyiv as soon as that becomes possible. It's very important to establish a serious dialogue with both parties in relation to the possibility of this humanitarian ceasefire., Question: [Off mic] And you mentioned the possible appeal to the rest of the world. Are you asking the European Union, other regional organizations...?, Secretary-General: No, I've been in close contact with several countries that have been talking to the parties at the highest level in order to explore the different forms of mediation leading to a political solution. I've been in very close contact with our Turkish friends, with Qatar, with Israel, with India, China but also France, Germany. And it is my belief that all these efforts are essential in order to create the conditions to allow for, finally, this war to come to an end., Question: [Off mic] And are all those countries supporting your... this effort?, Secretary-General: I hope so., Spokesman: Alan Bulkaty, RIA Novosti., Question: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. You mentioned... you're calling for the immediate ceasefire in your intervention. As far as you remember, the draft resolution considered last week by the Security Council contained the provisions about the negotiated ceasefire, but the Security Council failed to adopt it. Do you consider it as a mistake?, And the second question, please: What are your expectations of tomorrow's humanitarian meeting by the Security Council on Ukraine?, Secretary-General: Well, first of all, the Security Council decides whatever the Security Council decides, but that doesn't mean that anyone in the Security Council is against a negotiated ceasefire, as you mentioned. So, I strongly hope that there will be goodwill from all sides in order for this ceasefire to take place., And I believe the briefing tomorrow will be a humanitarian briefing about the humanitarian situation, as far as I know. There will be elements of our humanitarian agencies that will be briefing the Security Council., Spokesman: Sherwin Bryce Pease., Question: Secretary-General, Russian leaders at the highest levels continue to assert their right to use nuclear weapons if and when a scenario is required for such a move. We are also seeing reports of nuclear facilities in Ukraine being targeted by strikes. Are you concerned that we are now on the cusp of either a biological conflict here or a nuclear war?, Secretary-General: Well, I was, this morning, in contact with Director General of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and there will be a number of very important initiatives by IAEA in the next few days in order to guarantee the security of the nuclear facilities inside Ukraine., And I know that there is a very close contact of Rafael Grossi to both the Russian and the Ukrainian authorities on this, and he has my full support in the initiatives that he will take in the next few days., On the other hand, I can't imagine the possibility of having a nuclear, a biological or a chemical war in this scenario. That will be... [Cross talk], Question: [Off mic, inaudible] it's also an unimaginable conflict in the first place, Secretary-General., Secretary-General: That would be something that I believe will be avoided. It must be avoided., Spokesman: Pam Falk., Question: Thank you. It's Pamela Falk from CBS News, Secretary-General. Is there any reason you have to believe that a ceasefire is actually being agreed to by the two sides, by Russia in particular? And is there any way the UN can enforce that if a ceasefire comes into play? Thank you., Secretary-General: Well, as a matter of fact, I've been hearing in different positions taken by both the Ukrainians and the Russian Federation, in the motion that was presented to the Security Council, reference to ceasefire. So, I think this is the moment in which I believe it makes sense for the UN to assume the initiative., And, of course, it depends on the will of the parties, when a ceasefire is established, to define the arrangements necessary to make the ceasefire persist., Spokesman: Thank you very much., Secretary-General: Thank you very much., Question: Mr. Secretary-General, do you have a comment on what President [Joseph] Biden said on President [Vladimir] Putin, that he cannot remain in power?, Secretary-General: I think we need de-escalation, we need military de-escalation and rhetoric de-escalation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-general-s-press-encounter-war-ukraine-28-march-2022

This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 28 March (local time), 143 children had been killed and 216 injured., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 26 March 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 27 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.

Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine (1 August 2021 - 31 January 2022),Analysis,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,28 Mar 2022,"Executive summary, This thirty-third report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the human rights situation in Ukraine covers the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 January 2022. It is based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.1, The reporting period of this report predates the armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine which commenced on 24 February 2022. The serious human rights violations and international humanitarian law violations arising out of that attack will be covered in other OHCHR publications including the thirty-fourth report on the human rights situation in Ukraine., During the reporting period, OHCHR recorded a total of 49 civilian casualties (11 killed and 38 injured), which was 21 per cent lower compared with the previous six months. Thirty-two civilian casualties resulted from armed engagements, with 78 per cent of these recorded in territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘republics’, and 22 per cent in Government-controlled territory. The majority of these occurred from August to November 2021, with significantly less civilian casualties recorded in December 2021 and January 2022., The number ofsecurity incidents that affected civilian objects (both civilian infrastructure and civilian housing) also increased considerably, albeit with a significant fall during the period of December 2021 to January 2022. These incidents endangered civilian lives and also infringed their right to housing., The conflict continued to impact over 3.4 million civilians, including due to COVID-19 related movement restrictions, mostly imposed by armed groups. These restrictions resulted in a 95 per cent reduction in the number of crossings of the contact line in eastern Ukraine, compared with the same period in 2019. Restrictions on freedom of movement severely affected the rights to education, family life, health, work, social security, adequate standard of living, and access to judicial and civil documentation., OHCHR welcomes the Cabinet of Minister’s decision on the adoption of the IDP Integration Strategy until 2024. OHCHR is concerned, however, that the Law “On State Budget of Ukraine for 2022” does not envisage funding for durable housing solutions for the most vulnerable IDPs that live in collective centers., OHCHR welcomes the launch of the e-court system that should increase the accessibility of courts for residents of armed group-controlled territory. OHCHR continues to urge the Government of Ukraine to introduce an administrative procedure for the registration of births and deaths that occur in armed group-controlled territory., OHCHR welcomes the simplification of the procedure for civilians, whose housing in Government-controlled territory was destroyed by hostilities, to claim compensation. OHCHR regrets, however, the exclusion of residents of armed group-controlled territory and IDPs from the procedure, as it covers only residents of Government-controlled territory who have remained in the same settlement where their housing was destroyed. Similarly, OHCHR welcomes the registration of draft laws that introduce compensation for all lost property but regrets that they also exclude residents of armed group-controlled territory., OHCHR welcomes the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers on 25 January 2022 to withdraw the draft “On the principles of State policy of the transition period” from Parliament, and urges authorities to comply with international standards when further elaborating policies or legislation on transitional justice.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-august-2021-31-january-2022
Update on the human rights situation in Ukraine (24 February – 26 March 2022) [EN/UK],Analysis,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,28 Mar 2022,"INTRODUCTION, On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation launched an armed attack on Ukraine, 1 which led to a grave deterioration in the human rights situation across the country. The conduct of hostilities by the Russian armed forces has been characterized by the broad use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, missile, and air strikes. There have also been allegations that Ukrainian armed forces have engaged in shelling of populated areas in territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) was able to verify that, by 26 March 2022, the hostilities had resulted in at least 2,909 civilian casualties, including 1,119 killed, and hundreds of residential houses, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and other civilian objects damaged or destroyed. Actual casualty numbers are much higher. The intensive and wide-scale hostilities have caused mass displacement of the civilian population, with UNHCR reporting that, by 26 March 2022, over 3.8 million persons have fled the country, and an estimated 6.5 million are internally displaced. Due to the ongoing hostilities and large-scale displacement, many human rights defenders (HRDs) have been unable to perform their human rights work, which has had negative implications on the vulnerable groups they support. Furthermore, there are growing concerns about possible reprisals and retaliation against HRDs in areas occupied by Russian armed forces., There are strong indications that serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and gross violations of international human rights law2 have occurred in the course of the conflict, in particular with regard to the principles of distinction and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. The treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) has also raised concerns. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is conducting a detailed legal analysis of human rights and IHL issues stemming from the conflict and will include its findings in its next report on Ukraine., HRMMU has been monitoring the human rights situation in Ukraine since 2014, and is uniquely placed to verify and document the deteriorating human rights situation, and contribute to achieving accountability for all victims. Although the security situation poses difficulties, HRMMU is fully committed to continuing its human rights monitoring and reporting, and remains operational across the country. Given the current levels of misinformation as well as disinformation, a continued independent human rights presence in Ukraine is critical to verify reports of civilian casualties and allegations of human rights violations. In producing this update, all available sources of information have been used in line with OHCHR’s standard methodology. HRMMU has been able to document a variety of human rights violations which highlight the very heavy toll the conflict is having on civilians. Those incidents which were pending corroboration and verification at the time of publication are indicated.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-human-rights-situation-ukraine-24-february-26-march-2022-enuk

Extraordinary JHA Council Meeting 28 March: Ukraine Crisis: The EU and Member States Must Now Work Together to Put Commitments into Practice,News and Press Release,ActionAid,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",27 Mar 2022,"We welcome the EU institutions and Member States’ commitment to receiving and protecting refugees fleeing the crisis in Ukraine. The speed and unanimity with which the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) was adopted shows that when there is political will, the European Union can come together to uphold its values of respect for human rights and protecting those fleeing persecution, war and violence. Now it is time for the EU institutions and Member States to coordinate and facilitate putting these commitments into practice., More than 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine, the overwhelming majority first arriving and seeking support in neighbouring states. One month into the crisis, states such as Poland and Moldova are reaching the limits of their reception capacity. Many of those fleeing found shelter informally in the homes of relatives and friends, but as the number of displaced people continues to increase, the capacity for these informal arrangements and people’s access to them will decrease. All persons fleeing Ukraine, including third country nationals, stateless persons and those who cannot enter the EU visa-free, who wish to seek protection in the EU must be granted access to EU territory and to temporary protection or asylum procedures. Further, Member States must now rapidly increase their capacity to provide sufficient and dignified reception including access to accommodation that is gender sensitive and child appropriate, as well as basic services., In order for individuals fleeing Ukraine to access their rights under the TPD, it is essential that they are able to quickly and safely reach the territories of Member States offering protection. Currently individuals fleeing the crisis are largely travelling by their own means, through informal assistance by private individuals and volunteers, or by ad hoc travel arrangements provided nationally and locally in neighbouring and (other) EU Member States. While this immense civil solidarity is commendable, private resources and volunteerism will not suffice to ensure equal access to travel and to transfer millions of refugees across Europe in a safe and orderly manner. Moreover, the lack of transparency and oversight characterising private travel arrangements bear urgent protection risks, including trafficking and other forms of exploitation and abuse. In particular for people with vulnerabilities., Where requested by the fleeing individual and/ or the state experiencing large numbers of arrivals,7 swift transfers will ensure that those fleeing do not spend prolonged periods in substandard reception conditions in camps, informal settlements or sleeping rough in border areas or European cities. Safe transfers also limit the risks of human trafficking, exploitation and abuse, as well as of re-traumatisation. Learning from the response to increased arrivals in 2015/16, EU institutions and Member States must therefore ensure that transfers happen in a speedy, safe and orderly manner. The undersigned organisations therefore call on EU Member States and the EU institutions to work together, to coordinate, facilitate and fund safe and orderly transfers of individuals fleeing the crisis.

Protection and Human Rights",27 Mar 2022,"We welcome the EU institutions and Member States’ commitment to receiving and protecting refugees fleeing the crisis in Ukraine. The speed and unanimity with which the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) was adopted shows that when there is political will, the European Union can come together to uphold its values of respect for human rights and protecting those fleeing persecution, war and violence. Now it is time for the EU institutions and Member States to coordinate and facilitate putting these commitments into practice., More than 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine, the overwhelming majority first arriving and seeking support in neighbouring states. One month into the crisis, states such as Poland and Moldova are reaching the limits of their reception capacity. Many of those fleeing found shelter informally in the homes of relatives and friends, but as the number of displaced people continues to increase, the capacity for these informal arrangements and people’s access to them will decrease. All persons fleeing Ukraine, including third country nationals, stateless persons and those who cannot enter the EU visa-free, who wish to seek protection in the EU must be granted access to EU territory and to temporary protection or asylum procedures. Further, Member States must now rapidly increase their capacity to provide sufficient and dignified reception including access to accommodation that is gender sensitive and child appropriate, as well as basic services., In order for individuals fleeing Ukraine to access their rights under the TPD, it is essential that they are able to quickly and safely reach the territories of Member States offering protection. Currently individuals fleeing the crisis are largely travelling by their own means, through informal assistance by private individuals and volunteers, or by ad hoc travel arrangements provided nationally and locally in neighbouring and (other) EU Member States. While this immense civil solidarity is commendable, private resources and volunteerism will not suffice to ensure equal access to travel and to transfer millions of refugees across Europe in a safe and orderly manner. Moreover, the lack of transparency and oversight characterising private travel arrangements bear urgent protection risks, including trafficking and other forms of exploitation and abuse. In particular for people with vulnerabilities., Where requested by the fleeing individual and/ or the state experiencing large numbers of arrivals,7 swift transfers will ensure that those fleeing do not spend prolonged periods in substandard reception conditions in camps, informal settlements or sleeping rough in border areas or European cities.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Mar 2022,"KEY HIGHLIGHTS, • Project HOPE delivered 5 Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHKs) into Lviv over the past few days.
The kits will be moved eastward into more conflictimpacted areas., • Project HOPE is working in Moldova, Poland, and Romania to provide health, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), and other essential support to highly vulnerable populations., • Over 3.8 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion in late February. The number displaced by the conflict could reach 10 million according to some estimates., • Trauma, separations, instability, and other stressors are making psychosocial and mental health needs among the most urgent. A rapid scale up of MHPSS services as well as protection programming is required to meeting growing needs., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Throughout the reporting period, the Russian assault on Ukraine continued uninterrupted. All major cities—including Chernihiv, Lutsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol, Rivne, and Zhytomyr--and other strategic locations were impacted., On Saturday, two Russian missiles hit Lviv—the largest city in western Ukraine—which had largely been spared the worst of the conflict to date.ii Because of its relative safety, Lviv has become a hub for the country’s 6.5 internally displaced population (IDPs)iii and a transit point for others aspiring to cross to neighboring countries. For these reasons, the escalation of fighting on Lviv poses particular humanitarian concerns as does its proximity to Poland—a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)., Meanwhile, the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been surrounded by Russian forces for a month, was subjected to “carpet bombing” this weekend . The Russian encirclement has cut off the city from food, electricity, and other essentials, leading to concerns of mass starvation. The head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said on Friday that the agency had received reports of mass graves in the city, including one that was estimated to hold 200 bodies., Meanwhile, Russian forces withdrew from parts of the city of Kherson—along the Black Sea. The loss is notable as Kherson was among the first mid-sized cities it struggled to take over. Ukrainians also made incremental progress in Chernihiv and Kyiv, the country’s capital The general stalling of the Russian invasion as well as some successful offensives by Ukrainians has, some speculate, led Putin to renew military and rhetoric focus on the Donbas region, which has been the focal point of Ukrainian-Russo fighting since 2014., To date, 1,119 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and another 1,790 have been injured as a result of the conflict. OHCHR, which tracks these figures, warns actual numbers are likely much higher., Beyond the direct toll to human life, the ongoing assault has devastated the country’s civilian infrastructure—including hospitals, schools, residential homes. The wideranging implications of deteriorating conditions for food security, health, mental health, and protection, among others. As of March 24, 1.4 million had been cut off to safe access to water and another 4.6 million had limited access or were at risk of it being cut off., Moreover, amongst the chaos, families are getting separated from one another, especially young children. The United Nations United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 4.3 million Ukrainian children have been displaced in the conflict.xii The agency has warned children are at heightened risk of separation from families, trafficking, and other severe protection concerns.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-10-28-march-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",27 Mar 2022,"Geneva, 27 March 2022 - Red Cross volunteers have reached hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine since the conflict began one month ago with life-saving aid, despite the dangers they face and the fact that they are also affected., Maksym Dotsenko, Director General at Ukrainian Red Cross says:, “Many of our staff and volunteers are also experiencing the conflict first-hand. They are worried about their families and their safety, and yet they continue to put on the Red Cross vest to deliver critical aid to neighbors and strangers alike. This is the true spirit of the principle of volunteerism upon which the Red Cross is based.”, That spirit of wanting to help is being reflected among the general population. Since the conflict started, 6,000 new volunteers, among them teachers and medical professionals, have joined the Ukrainian Red Cross., IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain says:, “Volunteers of the Ukrainian Red Cross have been on the ground from day one despite the risks. Many of them have suffered and lost loved ones in this conflict. As the conflict enters its second month, their ongoing support is increasingly critical as needs continue to rise and access remains heavily restricted. We stand by these men and women, offering solidarity and support. We honor their courageous work and commitment to helping others.”, The IFRC network has established logistics pipelines from Poland, Hungary, and Romania to allow for the delivery of life-saving aid into Ukraine, supporting the Ukrainian Red Cross Society in areas most saturated with internally displaced persons. In the past month, the Ukrainian Red Cross teams have reached more than 400,000 people in the country with more than 1,600 tons of essential goods distributed. They have supported the evacuation of over 79,000 people from Energodar, Sumy, Kyiv region, Kharkiv and Kherson region. Also, in addition to providing first aid, they are teaching people sheltering underground how to provide it themselves., An estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine, the majority of whom are women and children, people living with disabilities, older people and minority groups, the UNHCR reports. The IFRC is supporting the work of National Red Cross Societies in neighboring countries responding to the needs of the 3.5 million people who have fled Ukraine with cash grants, shelter, basic aid items, health care, psychosocial support and medical supplies. Among these groups, a special focus is on vulnerable people, including unaccompanied minors, single women with children, older people, and people living with disabilities., For related AV materials: https://www.ifrcnewsroom.org, Media contacts:, In Ukraine: Caroline Haga, +358 50 5980500, caroline.haga@ifrc.org, In Poland: Jenelle Eli, +1 202 603-6803, rrcommsof.poland@ifrc.org, In Budapest: Kathy Mueller, +1 226 376-4013 rrcommsco.budapest@ifrc.org, In Geneva: Anna Tuson, +41 79 895 6924, anna.tuson@ifrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-red-cross-volunteers-provide-life-saving-aid-people-need
300 sheltering civilians killed in Russian airstrike on theatre in Mariupol,News and Press Release,AOAV,Protection and Human Rights,25 Mar 2022,"By Emily Griffith on 25 Mar 2022, On Wednesday 16 March 2022, a Russian airstrike targeted a theatre in Mariupol where about 1,300 civilians, mostly women and children, were sheltering from aerial and ground bombardments across the besieged Ukrainian city. A week later, local officials have announced the first estimated casualty figures from the attack, with at least 300 people killed. The search for survivors and the dead within the rubble of the theatre continues., This strike marks the largest single loss of civilian life recorded by AOAV to date (25 Mar) since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022. At the very least, 47 other civilians have been killed and injured by explosive weapon use in incidents across Mariupol since 24 February 2022. It is the city with the highest civilian casualty rate in Donetsk, even before the theatre strike. It is important to note that the number of people killed and injured in Mariupol is likely to be far higher, as the severity of the violence will have prevented the full reporting of civilian casualties in English-language media, where AOAV gathers it’s data., The situation for Mariupol’s civilians has been dire as Russian and Ukrainian forces battle for control of the Azov port city. Tens of thousands of people are believed to be trapped, unable to travel to humanitarian evacuation corridors due to the ferocity of the fighting. Running water and electricity has been cut off for weeks, and essential supplies of food and medicine are scarce. The Mariupol City Council has said that deaths from starvation are rising., The fatal airstrike on the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre is not the first Russian attack to target civilians, primarily women and children., On 9 March 2022, in an event that made global headlines, a Russian airstrike targeted a maternity hospital in Mariupol. At least three people were killed and 17 injured, though casualty figures are likely to rise as the wounded tragically become the dead. Days after the attack, a pregnant woman and her baby died of injuries the mother sustained in the airstrike., On 11 March, 56 civilians were reportedly killed when a Russian tank fired shells into a care home in Kreminna, Luhansk. Most of those killed were elderly residents., On 17 March, a Russian rocket struck a school in Merefa, Kharkiv, killing 21 people sheltering inside, and injuring 25 more., According to AOAV data (up to 25 March 2022) there have been at least 1,570 casualties from explosive weapon use since the Russian invasion began (24 Feb – 25 Mar), across 111 incidents. At least 1,210 civilian casualties were recorded (817 killed, 393 injured). Among the civilian casualties were at least 57 children, 20 women and 46 men;, The vast majority of civilian casualties, 96% (1,166), have occurred in populated areas., Ground-launched explosive weapons (missile strikes, artillery shelling, and rockets) have caused 48% (582) of civilian casualties. Air-launched explosive weapons (specifically air strikes) have caused 47% (570) of civilian casualties. 4% (53) of civilian casualties have been caused by multiple types of explosive weapons, and >1% (5) of civilian casualties have been caused by naval-launched weapons and landmines., Civilian casualties from explosive weapons have been recorded in Donetsk (429 civilians), Kharkiv (174), Kyiv (179), Chernihiv (135), Luhansk (74), Mykolaiv (64), Sumy (37), Zhytomyr (36), Zaporozhzhia (30), Rivne (29), Odessa (10), Vinnytsia (6), Kherson (3), Dnirpopetrovsk (3), and Cherkasy (1)., The location-types in which civilian casualties have been reported are urban residential areas (345 civilian casualties), entertainment venues (300), Multiple urban spaces (127), hospitals (99), schools (94), villages (94), no location information (36), public buildings (30), commercial premises (33), other (13), armed bases (9), roads (7), town centres (6), transport related infrastructure (6), hotels (3), agricultural land (2), and markets (1)., For regularly updated data on civilian casualties from explosive weapon use in Ukraine, follow this link.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/300-sheltering-civilians-killed-russian-airstrike-theatre-mariupol
Ukraine: Addressing misinformation about ICRC’s activities [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,26 Mar 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) - Over the past days, false information about the ICRC has been circulated that we must address, as it could have a major impact on people affected by the conflict in Ukraine. This misinformation is also putting at risk Red Cross staff and volunteers on the ground and could jeopardize our access to people in need of urgent aid., That's why we must address this misinformation head on., The ICRC does not ever help organize or carry out forced evacuations. This applies everywhere we work. We would not support any operation that would go against people's will and our principles. We have been involved in two evacuations of people in Ukraine – they took place in Sumy on March 15 and 18, when we facilitated the voluntary safe passage of civilians out of the city. On both occasions people willingly took buses leading them to another Ukrainian city, Lubny., We have strengthened our response by deploying additional teams to Ukraine as well as to neighboring countries, including Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Russia, to support our operations and to respond effectively to humanitarian needs where they arise. As part of this regional scale-up, we are also discussing opening an office in Rostov in southern Russia, where we currently have no office., Over the past 10 days and as part of ICRC's diplomatic efforts, ICRC President Peter Maurer travelled to Ukraine and Russia where he met representatives of the two countries to discuss crucial humanitarian matters., Building and maintaining a dialogue with parties to a conflict is essential to get access to all people affected, by obtaining necessary security guarantees for our teams to deliver life-saving aid. This dialogue also serves to remind parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law, including for ICRC humanitarian visits to prisoners of war and other persons protected by the Geneva Conventions, wherever they may be., Our sole objective is to alleviate the suffering of the people affected by the armed conflict. And the suffering right now is simply immense. This is an extreme situation of life and death where populations are facing impossible choices – to stay or to flee; to forgo eating or risk venturing out from basements., We are committed to massively up scaling our response to the devastating humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. You can find the latest information on how we're doing that here., Note to editors:, 1. Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries., 2. The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014 with a team of over 600 staff members. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and our Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners, we are increasing our response to the vast and growing humanitarian needs in Ukraine., For more information, please contact press@icrc.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-addressing-misinformation-about-icrc-s-activities-enru
Update 33 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (26 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,26 Mar 2022,"47/2022
Vienna, Austria, posted at 19:40, The International Atomic Energy Agency is closely monitoring the situation in a Ukrainian city where many people live who work at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) after the country’s nuclear regulator today informed the IAEA it had been seized by Russian forces, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General said he remained concerned about the ability of staff at the Chornobyl NPP to regularly rotate and return to their homes in the nearby city of Slavutych to rest. There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now, the regulator said., Slavutych is located outside the Exclusion Zone that was set up around the Chornobyl NPP after the 1986 accident. Russian forces took control of the NPP on 24 February. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s regulatory authority said that Russian shelling of checkpoints in Slavutych prevented technical staff of the Chornobyl NPP from travelling to and from the site., In an update this morning, the regulator said Slavutych was surrounded. A few hours later, it cited Chornobyl NPP management as confirming media reports that the city had been seized., The regulator said the last staff rotation was on 20-21 March, when a new shift of technical personnel arrived from Slavutych to replace colleagues who had worked at the Chornobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located. There was “no information when or whether” a new change of work shift would take place, it said., Director General Grossi has repeatedly expressed deep concern about the difficult situation for staff operating Ukrainian nuclear sites held by the Russian military, also including the Zaporizhzhya NPP. He has stressed that the ability of NPP staff to carry out their important tasks without undue pressure is one of the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety that he outlined earlier this month., In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the regulator said shelling was for a second day preventing measures to dispose of an unexploded rocket near a nuclear research facility. The previously damaged facility has been used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Its nuclear material is subcritical and the radioactive inventory is low. Personnel at the facility were maintaining the operability of the nuclear installation’s equipment and radiation was within “standard limits”. However, it was not possible to restore off-site power to the facility due to the shelling, the regulator added., At the Zaporizhzhya NPP, the regulator said repairs to the transformer of reactor unit 6 had been completed after it was damaged on 4 March, when Russian forces took control of this site, and the unit would be kept in reserve., Out of the country’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, the regulator said eight were continuing to operate, including two at Zaporizhzhya, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, it added., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-33-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-26-march-2022

"Ukraine Emergency: Key Informant Interviews - March 11, 2022",Assessment,ETC,Logistics and Telecommunications,22 Mar 2022,"INTRODUCTION, On March 9-11, 2022, the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) continued conducting Key Informant Interviews (KII) in order to better understand key information and communication needs among the affected populations in Ukraine., The interviewed KIs were in Lyman, Donetsk province in east Ukraine and Kharkiv, the second-largest city in north-east Ukraine. Some KIs decided to stay in Ukraine for the time being. In contrast, others are fleeing or fled Ukraine. One KI, a mother with three small children made the difficult decision to flee her home and leave elderly family members behind. She was on her way to cross the Ukraine-Romania border at the time of her interview.
Below is a summary of their interviews., KEY INFORMATION NEEDS, Where to purchase power banks?, • Portable power banks are in high demand. In many cases, people spend several days in bomb shelters with no access to power outlets. In order to charge their phones and other devices, people have to risk their lives and return to their homes or other above-ground structures approximately once every two days. With portable power banks, such risks can be mitigated, allowing people to stay in bomb shelters for longer periods of time. Power banks are also very useful for IDPs and refugees who spend a lot of time on the road / in transit and need to charge their devices, especially in order to access Google Maps, contact people / organizations at their planned destination, and keep in touch with loved ones., Where to withdraw cash from debit accounts?, • Salaries and pensions in Ukraine get deposited to debit accounts and people are struggling with withdrawing money from their accounts. Those grocery shops that continue to sell food do not accept debit cards, only cash. ATMs have limits for cash withdrawal at around USD 30. People often have to wait in line for up to 5-6 hours to get to the ATM just to find out it ran out of cash. Cash back is offered at few large stores in bigger cities. As a temporary solution, people use mobile banks to facilitate person-to-person transactions. People transfer the required amount to the other person to pay for goods or services. If mobile banks stop working, people may have to resort to bartering goods and services without the use of money., How to locate available bomb shelters?, • This is especially important for people who live in high-rise apartment buildings without open access to basements.
Where to purchase medical supplies?, • People are reporting empty shelves at pharmacies, including first aid kits, pain killers or life sustaining medication (i.e. for diabetes)., Where to purchase infant formula?, • People are reporting inability to find infant formula on the market. Mothers do not know how to feed their infants.
What are the specific rules and processes for asylum seeking?, • While people seems to have plenty of general information on the process of asylum seeking, sometimes they need legal advice on specifc matters., How to find shelter after crossing the Ukrainian border?, • KIs as well as many Ukrainians are currently actively looking in Telegram chats for reliable information on shelter in Poland, Czech Republic, Romania and Moldova., INFRASTRUCTURE, • Internet Connectivity o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby, but restored quickly, • Mobile Network coverage o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby
o The main Mobile Network Operators ( MNOs) – Kyivstar, Vodafone Ukraine and Lifecell, alongside national fixed network operator Ukrtelecom agreed to provide Ukrainians with communications even if there are no funds on their accounts. The operators also implemented a “national roaming” initiative: if one operator has no coverage, the user can manually (or sometimes automatically) connect to any other available mobile network operator and use it without any additional fees., • Electricity
o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby, but restored quickly o Is frequently targeted by Russian army to disrupt supply of electricity, ▪ Problem: if humanitarian corridor opens up for evacuation / supplies, how can the populations disconnected as a result of heavy fighting be informed (for example, in Mariupol)?, ACCESS TO INFORMATION NATIONAL LEVEL:, • In order to streamline information, Ukrainian media agreed to unite into a single channel to provide the population with 24/7 aligned updates (TV, radio, YouTube) on the following topics:
o Conflict with Russia
o Political activity
o Evacuation routes
o Official briefings from all government branches, including Ukrainian President’s briefings several times a day, MUNICIPAL LEVEL:, • Municipalities have hotlines on evacuation. However, people tend to rely more on word of mouth for planning their evacuation routes., • Municipalities have Telegram channels designed to share information on:
o Conflict with Russia o Political activity
o Humanitarian activity (access to water, food, shelter)
o Evacuation routes
o Curfew
o Calls for volunteers to join efforts to restore damaged infrastructure, • Mayors use single unified channel to provide municipal updates on the following topics:
o Conflict with Russia
o Political activity
o Humanitarian activity (access to water, food, shelter)
o Evacuation routes, GRASSROOTS LEVEL:, • Citizens self-organize and coordinate emergency response via social media apps: Telegram and Instagram

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 25 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,26 Mar 2022,"Date: 26 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 25 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,858 civilian casualties in the country: 1,104 killed and 1,754 injured. This included:, a total of 1,104 killed (221 men, 167 women, 15 girls, and 30 boys, as well as 51 children and 620 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,754 injured (194 men, 148 women, 30 girls, and 24 boys, as well as 70 children and 1,288 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,262 casualties (354 killed and 908 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 976 casualties (295 killed and 681 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 286 casualties (59 killed and 227 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,596 casualties (750 killed and 846 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 26 March, 136 children had been killed and 199 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 25 March, 323 civilians had been killed in the region, including 15 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-25-march-2022-enruuk

It covers the period from 12 p.m. (EET) 23 March to 12:00 p.m. (EET) 25 March. The next report will be published on or around 28 March., KEY FIGURES (FLASH APPEAL 2022), 12M people in need (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 6M people targeted (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), $1.1B funding required (US$) (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 41% funded (Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • Despite many operational challenges, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have reached around 890,000 people across Ukraine with multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance since 24 February. Assistance has mostly been provided in the east, with over 431,000 people reached in Kharkivska oblast., • In Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north) and Kharkiv (Kharviska oblast, east), the World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners have delivered nearly 1,270 tons of food to more than 521,000 affected people., • The World Health Organization (WHO) is sending around 36 tons of medical supplies to Lviv (Lvivska oblast, west), with an additional 108 tons in the pipeline, while the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) delivered 13 tons of urgently needed reproductive health supplies, medicines and equipment to service providers in four oblasts., • UN agencies and humanitarian partners are scaling up cash support. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has launched a large-scale cash programme for internally displaced persons (IDPs) that aims to reach around 360,000 people, while the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has rolled out cash-based assistance in several oblasts, planning to reach some 40,000 people in Zakarpatska oblast (west) alone., • The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster estimates that around 1.4 million people lack access to water in Ukraine, while access remains limited for another 4.6 million people. In Donetska oblast (east), the water situation remains critical, as the current supply from water reservoirs received by schedule is only projected to last till the beginning of April in the cities of Donetsk and Makiivka, and less than three weeks in neighbouring Horlivka., • According to WHO, as of 25 March, the number of verified incidents of attacks on health-care facilities in Ukraine has risen to 72 – nearly 89 per cent of incidents recorded by WHO between 24 February and 25 March globally – resulting in 71 deaths and 37 injuries. WHO says almost 1,000 health facilities are close to areas experiencing active fighting or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. Just over a month since the start of the military offensive, civilian casualties, destruction of critical infrastructure and wide-scale forced displacement continue unabated, driving a significant increase in humanitarian needs. As of 24 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 2,788 civilian casualties, including 1,081 killed, figures that are likely much higher and will continue to rise as hostilities rage on. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (east), Government-controlled areas (GCA) continue to witness the greatest number of civilian casualties, with OHCHR reporting 957 casualties in GCA – including 285 killed and 672 injured – compared to 283 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (59 killed and 224 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 1,548 civilian casualties., Humanitarian needs. The key humanitarian needs remain access to adequate food, safe water, life-saving medicines and health services, as well as durable shelter solutions for IDPs and the growing number of people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed. The WASH Cluster estimates that around 1.4 million people lack access to water in Ukraine, while access remains limited for another 4.6 million people. In Donetska oblast, the water situation remains critical, as the current supply from water reservoirs received by schedule is only projected to last till the beginning of April in Donetsk and Makiivka, and less than three weeks in neighbouring Horlivka.
According to Mercy Corps, some of the hardest-hit areas in Ukraine only have enough food to last a few days, while others are becoming increasingly dependent on aid, the delivery of which remains unpredictable due to persistent access and security constraints. Mercy Corps estimates that at least 70 per cent of the population of Kharkiv and Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east) – home to nearly 1.8 million people prior to the recent escalation – are now completely reliant on aid to meet their most basic needs., Displacement and associated vulnerabilities. Since 24 February, around 10.2 million people have been forcibly displaced – roughly a quarter of the Ukrainian population – with the number of people moving across international borders surpassing 3.7 million. According to IOM, more than 30 per cent of displaced households include at least one person suffering from a chronic illness, while nearly 20 per cent include someone living with some form of disability., The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says around 4.3 million children – more than half of all children in Ukraine – have been forcibly displaced by ongoing fighting, generating significant risks to children’s safety and well-being. More than 60 per cent of IDPs surveyed by IOM report a child between 5 and 18 years of age in their household, while nearly 30 per cent report a child under the age of 5. Among the most vulnerable are the approximately 100,000 children in Ukraine residing in institutional care – half of whom with disabilities. Some of these institutions are attempting to move children and adolescents to safety either within Ukraine or across borders., Unaccompanied and separated children face heightened risks of violence, abuse and exploitation. These risks are multiplied when children are displaced across international borders, increasing the possibility of children and adolescents falling victim to exploitation and trafficking. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says that all unaccompanied or separated children must receive integrated social services to satisfy their multi-sectoral needs and ensure their protection, including health care, psychosocial support, nutrition, education, housing and legal aid, without discrimination., Health situation and risks. According to WHO, as of 25 March, the number of verified incidents of attacks on health-care facilities in Ukraine has risen to 72 – nearly 89 per cent of incidents recorded by WHO between 24 February and 25 March globally – resulting in 71 deaths and 37 injuries, which account for almost 89 and 93 per cent of total deaths and injuries, respectively, arising from attacks on health care worldwide in just over a month. The destruction of critical health infrastructure and the disruption of medical supply chains pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of millions of people. Even where health facilities are functional, the danger of moving in areas experiencing ongoing fighting often pushes people to take the risk of foregoing medical care, leading to greater suffering and preventable deaths. WHO says close to 1,000 health facilities are close to areas experiencing active fighting or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces, significantly limiting access to life-saving medicines and health services., As trauma-related injuries rise, what little resources and health staff capacity remain – many health workers themselves have been displaced or are unable to work – continue to be redirected toward caring for the wounded. Numerous hospitals have been repurposed to treat trauma victims, while approximately half of Ukraine’s pharmacies are reportedly closed amid active hostilities. Consequently, the already-stretched health system has even less capacity to ensure the continuation of essential services and primary health care, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), the treatment of chronic illnesses and COVID-19., COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization campaigns have almost come to a halt across the country. Before 24 February, at least 50,000 people on average were being vaccinated against COVID-19 each day. Between 24 February and 15 March, however, only 175,000 people were vaccinated against the virus – around 40,790 fewer people on average being vaccinated daily. Between 23 February and 23 March, WHO reports that the seven-day average number of antigenrapid and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 tests fell by a staggering 88 and 96 per percent, respectively, suggesting considerable underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Over the same period, the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients decreased significantly as many were repurposed, with the largest decreases witnessed in Luhanska (east, 80 per cent), Volynska (north-west, 69 per cent) and Chernihivska (north, 56 per cent) oblasts., Humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. Ongoing hostilities in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts are generating significant humanitarian needs. Critical infrastructure and housing have been hard hit in both oblasts. In Luhanska oblast, on 23 March, more than 25 residential buildings, including at least 13 multi-storey apartment buildings, were reportedly damaged or destroyed in Kreminna, Lysychansk, Pervomaisk, Novodruzhesk, Sievierodonetsk and Voievodivka (GCA). As of 24 March, more than 95,300 users across 20 settlements are reportedly without electricity in Luhanksa oblast (GCA), while some 41,000 users remain without access to gas supplies in nearly 30 settlements. In the city of Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast), municipal authorities say more than 1,140 buildings have been destroyed since the military offensive began. Of these, nearly 1,000 – around 87 per cent – are residential buildings, raising serious concerns about the shelter and protection situation in the worst-affected areas. On 24 March, a missile strike hit a shopping mall’s parking lot in the city, reportedly leaving at least six dead and another 15 injured, according to oblast authorities., Meanwhile, in Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), a humanitarian convoy sent by the Government of Ukraine carrying lifesaving aid failed to reach people in need on 24 March, remaining blocked outside the encircled city for three days. More than 2,340 people were evacuated through agreed-upon evacuation corridors on 24 March. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says a detailed agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation forces is urgently needed to properly evacuate civilians from Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands remain trapped without food, water, medicines, electricity or heating, with reports of people dying from starvation being of particular concern. While the civilian death toll in Mariupol cannot be assessed amid active hostilities, the city council reports that at least 300 people were reportedly killed following the bombing of the city’s drama theatre on 16 March., Humanitarian situation in southern Ukraine. In Khersonska oblast, the number of people without access to water and electricity continues to grow, reaching approximately 51,250 on 23 March – an increase of more than 5,000 users in just 24 hours. Similarly, growing numbers of people are being cut off from natural gas supplies – commonly used for cooking and heating – with around 5,700 left without gas as of 23 March., Evacuation of civilians. According to the Government of Ukraine, on 24 March, more than 3,340 people were evacuated through agreed-upon corridors. Over the last 29 days, Ukrainian Railways reports that it has evacuated around 3 million people from the most affected areas of the country toward the west, while some 430,000 have been transported abroad. On the other hand, the Russian Federation reports that around 420,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine towards Russia since the escalation of hostilities, including 18,510 during the past 24 hours. This includes people who have reportedly been evacuated and those who have crossed the border seeking refuge on their own.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-25-march-2022
Update 32 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (25 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,25 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that there had been no rotation of technical staff at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) since 21 March and it did not know when it might next take place, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine's regulatory authority told the IAEA yesterday that Russian shelling of checkpoints in the nearby city of Slavutych, where many Chornobyl NPP staff live, prevented them from travelling to and from the plant. The current staff shift arrived at the NPP on 20-21 March to replace personnel who had been there since Russian forces took control of the site on 24 February. Slavutych is located outside the Exclusion Zone that was established around the NPP after the 1986 accident., Director General Grossi has in recent weeks expressed deep concern about the difficult situation facing staff operating Ukrainian nuclear facilities where the Russian military is present. He has stressed that their ability to carry out their important tasks without undue pressure is one of the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety that he outlined earlier this month., Separately today, after being contacted by the IAEA, the State Agency for the Management of the Exclusion Zone provided additional detailed technical information about the Central Analytical Laboratory in Chornobyl town, which it earlier this week said had been ""looted by marauders""., It told the IAEA that it could not confirm the safety and security of the laboratory's calibration sources nor the condition of environmental samples stored there. It also had no information about the status of the server for the Exclusion Zone's radiation monitoring system, also located in the laboratory. Based on the additional information provided, the IAEA continues to assess that the incident does not pose a significant radiological risk., The regulator did not provide any new information about wildfires in the vicinity of the Chornobyl NPP site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located., In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the regulator confirmed reports of an unexploded rocket of the multiple launch rocket system 9K58 Smerch ""detected in the immediate vicinity"" of a nuclear research facility that has previously been damaged by shelling. The regulator said ""constant shelling"" of the area meant that no measures had yet been taken to dispose of the rocket. The IAEA will continue to monitor the situation. The facility is used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Its nuclear material is subcritical and the radioactive inventory is low., Out of the country's 15 operational reactors at four sites, the regulator said eight were continuing to operate, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are in shut down for regular maintenance, it added., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-32-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-25-march-2022

This included:, a total of 1,081 killed (219 men, 165 women, 15 girls, and 30 boys, as well as 48 children and 604 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,707 injured (189 men, 146 women, 28 girls, and 23 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,252 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,240 casualties (344 killed and 896 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 957 casualties (285 killed and 672 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 283 casualties (59 killed and 224 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,548 casualties (737 killed and 811 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 25 March, 135 children had been killed and 184 injured.

Protection and Human Rights",25 Mar 2022,"As the Kremlin’s forces approach Kyiv, many inhabitants have fled, and those who remain face an uncertain future. While essential supplies are available and public services continue, civilians are dealing with numerous threats to their safety, livelihoods, and health. The situation could rapidly deteriorate if Russian forces use similar tactics against Kyiv as they have against cities like Grozny, Aleppo, and now Mariupol. Aid actors must immediately prepare for the possibility of a Russian advance into the capital., This situation report detailing the state of aid in Kyiv is COAR Global's first public report on the Ukraine crisis. It examines the state of things on the ground and aid strategies for Kyiv and Ukraine more broadly. Actors must take into account the nature of the belligerents: Ukraine’s authorities and military are striving to meet their citizens’ needs, while Russia is instrumentalizing aid even as its forces target Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. Aid organizations should be understandably leery of the appearance that humanitarian aid and military support are commingled or directed to the same target populations, practices which raise thorny questions concerning principles of neutrality. Instead, they should emphasize the need to fill gaps in and strengthen existing aid structures and modalities by supporting and collaborating with Ukrainian authorities and civil society rather than competing with them.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/situation-report-kyiv-crosshairs

Ukraine war: WFP poised to support next phase of relief effort,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,25 Mar 2022,"Assessment on border with Slovakia shows how the World Food Programme and other agencies can provide support inside the country, says Jean-Martin Bauer, The day I visit Uzhhorod with a World Food Programme (WFP) assessment team, we are told that 11 trains, each carrying 2,000 passengers, are due from Kharkiv and Kyiv. We are on the border with Slovakia in the west of Ukraine., One month into the conflict, there are an estimated 500,000 displaced people in the Zakarpatska region – around three hours from the main conflict zones., Across the country, almost 6.5 million people have been internally displaced and 3.5 million have left the country. Assessing the needs of a vast, moving population amid a volatile security situation is challenging., The food supply chain is broken. WFP believes 45 percent of Ukrainians are currently worried about finding enough to eat – we have mobilized food supplies to assist 3 million people inside the country for one month. So far WFP has reached 716,000 – over the next four weeks that should increase to 2.4 million people., Urgent funds are needed to enable WFP to extend its support to places such as Uzhhorod, and to continue serving countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Ethiopia which are being squeezed as the war shoots up the prices rises for food and fuel – Ukraine and Russia are major wheat exporter., At the start of the year, global inflation had already pushed the price WFP paid for food up by US$42 million a month. The conflict has since driven up food and fuel prices, compounding global supply chain challenges, and adding another US$29 million to WFP’s monthly costs. Today, we are being forced to pay an estimated US$71 million more a month for our operations than in 2019 – a 44 per cent rise., To scale up in Ukraine, WFP is calling for US$590 million – so far we've received only US$112 million., Displaced people arriving in Uzhhorod receive a bright purple box with freshly made sandwiches, as well as flyers explaining how to apply for Government assistance. The city has set up a soup kitchen, which makes 10,000 sandwiches every day. A sense of determination and camaraderie here is palpable., Volunteers of all ages, wearing blue plastic gloves, slather generous helpings of butter on white bread, topped off with slices of cheese and ham., People – mostly women and children – who stay longer in Uzhhorod and who require help, receive vouchers for two hot meals at the soup kitchen. The effort is run seamlessly by hundreds of volunteers and the local government. However, food is running out., WFP ready to support, “We had a budget for 1 million people, not 1.5 million,” said Petro Dobromilskyy, Director of Social Services for Zakarpatska region. “We’re doing what we can but can’t keep this up much longer.”, Groups of vans bringing food and other essential items are also expected to peter out. UN agencies, including WFP, are working with partners, including Government and local and international NGOs, to start providing cash transfers, so people who need help can buy the foods they want, boosting the town’s beleaguered economy., Getting an emergency food programme going involves dealing with many uncertainties: these include supermarkets shifting to new suppliers because of the war and fuel shortages. It’s possible WFP might need to shift from cash assistance to food, and back again. But there is one important factor: assisting an ongoing, well-structured local effort is so much easier than setting up a programme from scratch. It’s also a path to scale assistance to other areas., Encouragingly, Government capacity is intact. This means the best solution to deliver food assistance is to plug right into the robust systems that are in place, so we don’t duplicate, and so the Government can resume when it’s ready. We also plan to work closely with grassroots organizations so that no one is left behind, and has access., This approach is similar to what WFP country offices from Haiti to Bangladesh have been doing for years – delivering food assistance through national systems. With the obvious difference that Ukraine is an active, rapid-response setting. This means that unlike other cases, where we’ve delivered through national safety nets, WFP in Ukraine will likely need to be highly flexible because of the many uncertainties involved. And this is where our global experience as a provider of all types of food assistance – including cash transfers, supermarket vouchers, in-kind food and supporting bakeries – makes us ready to get the job done in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-wfp-poised-support-next-phase-relief-effort

6.5 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. People in Need continues to equip collective centres in the west of the country,News and Press Release,PIN,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",25 Mar 2022,"Ten million Ukrainians have fled their homes due to the Russian invasion. 3.6 million people have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries, according to the UNHCR. An additional 6.5 million people remain displaced within Ukraine. People in Need has delivered hundreds of sets of bedding and cooking equipment to collective centres in western Ukraine. We continue to deliver water, food, and hygiene items to tens of thousands of people in eastern Ukraine., According to a recent survey by the IOM, 1.9 million internally displaced people (IDP), within Ukraine, are from Kyiv—this is nearly 30% of the total IDP population. A further 2.3 million people, nearly 36% of the IDP population, are from the east of the country. Almost 40% of IDPs, altogether 2.5 million people, fled to western Ukraine., Svitlana and Liuda fled from Kharkiv to Truskavets in western Ukraine. Svitlana describes the long road to safety: ""We drove for five difficult days. People were providing us with accommodation on the way. All were supportive. Near Ternopil and in Uman, we spent the night. We stopped in kindergartens and schools. We were provided with medicines, some food, including for children, clothes. And when we came here - we felt at home,"", Dasha fled from Kharkiv to Lviv. ""We arrived here escaping the shelling on the 5th of March. I realised that I was with my child, a grandmother and a dog in this basement. Then I checked the weather forecast, and I saw that frosts were approaching. In the basement, we would either get sick, and this would not be good, or we simply would be overwhelmed. It was not safe to remain there,"" says Dasha. ""A man helped us get to the subway. There was a metro station not far from us. It takes 15 minutes to walk to get there. We walked through the snow and under fire,"" she describes how her family hid in the metro station. And how they finally fled to Lviv by train., With the influx of hundreds of thousands of displaced people in western Ukraine, it is almost impossible to find accommodation. Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for the Eastern Partnership and the Balkans, notes that ""For tens of thousands of people the only solution is to find a place to sleep in a collective centre, typically old sanatoriums, schools or old colleges.” Some people stay at the collective centres for just 2 or 3 days before continuing on to neighbouring countries. However, many stay, and are waiting to go home when the security situation allows it.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/65-million-people-are-displaced-inside-ukraine-people-need-continues-equip-collective

Logistics and Telecommunications",25 Mar 2022,"The EU continues to deliver emergency assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries with millions of essential items such as medicines, shelter and food., A new large-scale delivery takes place this week. It includes a convoy of 21 new ambulances, 11 fire engines, 16 rescue vehicles and 23 lorries transporting 49 tonnes of health and emergency equipment. The assistance convoy is offered by France via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and will arrive at the EU Civil Protection Centre in Romania, from where it will be sent to Ukraine., In addition to France, all EU countries, as well as Norway and Turkey, have offered emergency assistance to Ukraine through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, making it the largest ever operation under this mechanism., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “Every day we witness extraordinary solidarity of the European countries in supporting Ukraine. Today, another major delivery with ambulances, fire engines, and further emergency equipment is on the way from France to our logistics hub in Romania. The EU is working 24/7 to coordinate such emergency aid deliveries from all across Europe to Ukraine and its neighbouring countries under the strain of refugee inflow.”, The most vulnerable among the millions of people fleeing the war in Ukraine are chronically ill patients who desperately need specialised medical care. The EU is also coordinating medical evacuation operations via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to transfer the patients to hospitals where they can receive appropriate care for their conditions.

"A month since the start of the war, almost a quarter of Ukraine’s population are displaced",News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",25 Mar 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR’s Representative to Ukraine – to whom quoted text may be attributed – speaking from Lviv to today’s press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., Over the past month, everything has changed for Ukraine. Just two weeks before the war, I spent the week in eastern Ukraine with the Country Director of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), inaugurating and visiting community centres in Avdiika and Popasna for disabled children and older people. These centres are now likely to be rubble, like so many other private homes and social structures that humanitarian and development partners have helped to establish and repair over the past eight years, working with local authorities and communities in eastern Ukraine., The past month has reversed these developments and set us back further than where we were eight years ago. Today, we are confronted with the realities of a massive humanitarian crisis that is growing by the second., The seriousness of the situation cannot be overstated., Overnight, lives have been shattered and families torn apart. In one month, over 10 million people have been forced to run for their lives, leaving their homes and belongings. Over 6.5 million are displaced inside Ukraine and 3.7 million people have been forced to flee the country. These numbers are rising daily. Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., Today, millions in Ukraine live in constant fear. Indiscriminate shelling and heavy bombardments are forcing people to shelter in bunkers for hours day and night., It is the same for colleagues at UNHCR in Ukraine, who now work out of newly established offices in Dnipro and Vinnytsia, Uzhgorod, Chernivtsi and Lviv, as well as in Donetsk and Luhansk non-government controlled areas. Many national staff have themselves become internally displaced; for several, this is the second or third time since 2014. Despite this, they have not stopped working. Watching their dedication to helping other displaced people has been inspiring., In-country, we now have 154 colleagues, several on emergency deployments, and continue growing to strengthen our capacity to deliver. Everyone is working around the clock. Local communities, volunteers, municipalities and the authorities have been leading the humanitarian response. From the very first minute of this war, what we have seen in terms of the local effort has been truly remarkable, and our goal is to reinforce and complement national and local capacity, which is increasingly necessary as the humanitarian crisis grows., In Ukraine, the UN Refugee Agency operates within the inter-agency humanitarian response, under the leadership of the UN Crisis Coordinator. We focus our efforts on the areas of protection, shelter and cash and in-kind assistance, in order to provide immediate relief to those fleeing the war. We help displaced people to find stability and settle down in a safer location while the situation remains fluid and the future unpredictable., UNHCR teams and our local NGO partners have been deployed at border points, in transit and reception centres. We have also reached out to areas directly affected by the bombardment to provide immediate protection advice and core relief items., More than 1,000 households in locations affected by the fighting have received emergency shelter kits so that they can make running repairs to their damaged homes and protect themselves from the elements. Reception centres in central and western Ukraine have received items such as mattresses, blankets and kitchen sets, enabling them to expand their capacity to accommodate IDPs. At least 85,000 people will be able to find temporary accommodation thanks to this support. This week alone, UNHCR has delivered 20,000 packages of non-food items to affected individuals and reception centres. This is, of course, not enough to address all needs but we are seeking every opportunity to reach people in need with our assistance. Along with the local authorities in IDP-hosting locations, we are identifying buildings to refurbish and repurpose as reception and collective centres since the needs for shelter are huge. This is not only about providing immediate shelter; it is evident that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of IDPs will need housing support in the medium to longer term., In Vinnytsia last week, I met a mother with a 20-year-old daughter with disabilities staying in one of the reception centres that UNHCR has supported. Their apartment on the outskirts of Kyiv had been hit. It was clear to me that they would not be able to move out of this centre anytime soon. They -- like other vulnerable families I spoke with in the same reception centre -- will need accommodation in a collective centre or social housing for months or years., Our teams are working to deliver our protection, shelter and assistance programmes not only in the west of the country but also -- as far as we can -- in central and eastern Ukraine to ensure access to accommodation and vital services. We have started to roll out our multipurpose cash programme in Lviv and Zakharpatia oblasts, and we have enrolled thousands to date. Further enrolments in six additional oblasts in central and eastern Ukraine will come in days. Overall, we are aiming to reach at least 360,000 displaced people to help them afford basic needs., At the same time, we continue striving to reach hard-hit areas like Mariupol and Kharkiv with lifesaving assistance as part of the inter-agency humanitarian convoys. UNHCR joined the first convoy that went into Sumy last week under the humanitarian notification system., Yet it is clear is that individuals, families and communities will need protection, shelter, assistance and access to basic services like health, education and social protection for years, if not decades. The effects of this war are devastating and far-reaching., The most effective form of humanitarian relief would be a halt to this war. In the meantime, we must continue to do everything we can to support all those affected., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/month-start-war-almost-quarter-ukraine-s-population-are-displaced
Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine on the situation in Ukraine Delivered by Ms. Matilda Bogner - Head of Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine on the situation in Ukraine (25 March 2022),News and Press Release,OHCHR,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",25 Mar 2022,"Day after day, the death toll and human suffering in cities, towns and villages across Ukraine is increasing. The facts as we have been reporting speak for themselves: since Russian armed forces launched their attacks on 24 February, at least 1,035 civilians have been killed and at least 1,650 injured. I say “at least” because we do not yet have the full picture of locations that have seen intense fighting, in particular Mariupol and Volnovakha., Military forces have used explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas – including missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets as well as airstrikes. Private houses, multi-storey residential buildings, administrative buildings, medical and education facilities, water stations, electricity systems have been destroyed on a massive scale, with disastrous effects on civilians and their human rights, including their rights to health, food, water, education and housing., The extent of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian objects strongly suggests that the principles of distinction, of proportionality, the rule on feasible precautions and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks have been violated. To give you two examples: on 3 March, 47 civilians were killed when two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv were destroyed, and all indications are that these were the result of Russian airstrikes., On 9 March, Mariupol Hospital No.3 was destroyed and most likely this also was the result of a Russian airstrike. Seventeen civilians, among them children and pregnant women, were injured. One injured woman was helped to deliver by Caesarean section soon after the attack, but neither she nor her baby survived. The doctors operated on them by candlelight., We are also looking into allegations of indiscriminate shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces in Donetsk and in other territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’., These attacks cause immeasurable human suffering and may amount to war crimes, and they must stop., Since 24 February, we have received allegations of Russian forces shooting at and killing civilians in cars during evacuations, without taking feasible precautions or giving effective advance warning. We are also following up on other allegations that Russian forces have killed civilians, including during peaceful assemblies. We have also received two allegations of killing in Government controlled territory of civilians due to their alleged affiliation with Russian forces or support of pro-Russian views., We have documented 22 cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of local officials in regions under the control of Russian forces, 13 of whom have been subsequently released. We have also documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 15 journalists and civil society activists who vocally opposed the invasion in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. We are currently trying to verify reports that five of the journalists and three of the activists were subsequently released. The whereabouts of the other individuals remain unknown., We are also concerned by videos depicting prisoners of war being interrogated after their capture by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Prisoners of war must be treated humanely, not subjected to acts of violence and protected against insults and public curiosity., Since the invasion by the Russian Federation, people believed to be thieves, bootleggers, pro-Russian supporters or curfew violators have been beaten in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine. We have received credible allegations of more than 40 such cases of ill-treatment by police officers, volunteer defence force members and others., This past month has highlighted the absolutely crucial role of journalists in getting the news out in such difficult and dangerous circumstances. But as we have seen, as hostilities intensify, journalists and media workers are facing increasing dangers in their work. So far, 7 journalists and media workers have been killed in Ukraine since 24 February, and 12 have come under armed attack, with six of them injured. At least one journalist is missing, his last known location was in an area of active hostilities., We are deeply concerned about the plight of people who were already in vulnerable situations before the military attack. People with disabilities have struggled to get to bomb shelters or other safe areas. They are also left without access to essential medicines due to the high level of insecurity., Long-term care facilities for people with disabilities, and older people in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions face an appalling humanitarian situation. Amid the fighting and the lack of food, water, heating, electricity, and medication, residents of such facilities are all the more vulnerable as they depend on others for their care and support., You have been hearing from colleagues about the ongoing humanitarian work by the UN in Ukraine. We call on all parties to ensure safe corridors for the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas and to allow the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population across the country., And just to end, as the Secretary General stated on 22 March, the war is going nowhere – fast – and the Ukrainian people are enduring a living hell. It is time to stop the fighting now., Thank you, ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-monitoring-mission-ukraine-situation-ukraine-delivered-ms-matilda-bogner
Violence Against or Obstruction of Health Care in Ukraine (25 March 2022),Analysis,Insecurity Insight,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",25 Mar 2022,"Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February, Insecurity Insight has documented 83 incidents of violence against health care, including 51 against health facilities and the deaths of 12 health workers. According to reporting on 17 March by Kyiv Independent, Russian troops have reportedly destroyed seven hospitals and damaged 104 since the start of the Russian invasion. Six medical workers were killed in the shelling. As of 25 March, the WHO has verified 72 attacks on health care between 24 February and 25 March. This report analyses 83 reported incidents for which we have details to provide analysis. According to our monitoring, all but one incident was perpetrated by Russian forces. Only one month into the war, Russian forces have consistently failed to distinguish between military and civilian targets, including hospitals. Taken together, these attacks represent a flagrant disregard for the protected status of health care in conflict., Reported incidents during the first month of the conflict reflect the ongoing military efforts to seize Kharkiv and Kyiv, as well as the efforts to advance westward from the Russian-controlled territories of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic in Donetsk and Luhansk oblast. Incidents in Kyiv oblast, primarily in the outskirts of Kyiv city, and in Kharkiv account for over a third of attacks recorded throughout the country., Explosive weapons have been consistently used against civilian populations throughout the conflict, including against hospitals and health workers. We have documented 52 cases of explosive weapons use against health, including 32 artillery strikes, six missile attacks, five rocket attacks, four airstrikes and two instances of banned cluster munition use. At least one of these strikes appeared to be deliberate. Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister of Russia, has confirmed that the 09 March airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol which killed four civilians and injured a further 17, was intentional and accused the hospital of sheltering Ukrainian military forces, a claim that has been refuted by health workers and journalists at the hospital., Airstrikes and missiles damaged eight health facilities in the first two weeks of the conflict, including two children’s hospitals and a maternity hospital, while artillery use against health facilities has remained constant. There have been 32 documented incidents on medical targets with artillery, representing 28% of total incidents. These artillery strikes have killed at least four health workers., Nearly a quarter of documented incidents have occurred in Donetsk and Luhansk where Russian forces have made slow territorial gains. Civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, are increasingly caught in the crossfire and medical neutrality is ignored. On 14 March, Russian soldiers forcibly detained approximately 400 civilians in the Mariupol Regional Intensive Care Hospital and occupied the facility. This is the first documented instance of Russian forces forcibly entering a civilian healthcare facility. Intense, near-continuous shelling has left the population with limited access to food, medication, and aid. According to the Deputy Mayor of Mariupol, over 90% of the civilian infrastructure of the city has been destroyed. The lack of water and electricity is likely to also affect the functioning of the hospitals in Mariupol. Given the continued lack of electricity and communication blackout in Mariupol, the attacks we have documented on health care via open-sources is likely a significant undercount.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/violence-against-or-obstruction-health-care-ukraine-25-march-2022

Protection and Human Rights",25 Mar 2022,"The situation in Mariupol, besieged for the 26th day, remains disastrous as active attacks continue. According to President Zelenskyy, some 100,000 people are stranded in inhuman conditions. The decrease in the number of people can be explained by spontaneous evacuations, civilian losses and also possibly mass forced deportations to Russia. An interagency humanitarian convoy failed to enter the city., Concern is growing over the situation in Chernihiv, still hosting some 130,000 people (out of 285,000 pre-war population) as the entry routes were cut off. The city has no electricity, water and heating, infrastructure is destroyed. The Ukrainian authorities are relentlessly trying to establish humanitarian corridors and apparently 190,000 people have been successfully evacuated, however, much more is needed., UN OCHA has launched an information product on Humanitarian Supplies and Pipeline. At least 855,000 people have benefited from humanitarian support, including under DG ECHO funding, and many more relief items will be distributed soon., The European Commission is also coordinating the delivery of assistance via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine, from all 27 Member States and two Participating States.

Ukraine: FAO Note on the impact of the war on food security in Ukraine (25 March 2022),Analysis,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",25 Mar 2022,"Situation overview, FAO is deeply concerned about the food security situation in Ukraine.
The war that began on 24 February 2022 has caused extensive damage and loss of life in key population centres, spread across rural areas, and sparked massive displacement. As of 23 March, more than 3.6 million people1 had been forced to abandon their homes and flee across borders to safety. Millions more are internally displaced. The violence has escalated rapidly, and it remains extremely difficult to predict the evolution of the conflict and its effect on lives, livelihoods, food security and nutrition., It is clear that the war has resulted in a massive, and deteriorating, food security challenge. It has already significantly disrupted livelihoods during the agricultural growing season, through physical access constraints and damage to homes, productive assets, agricultural land, roads and other civilian infrastructure., It is uncertain whether Ukraine will be able to harvest existing crops, plant new ones or sustain livestock production as the conflict evolves.
The conflict has led to port closures, the suspension of oilseed crushing operations and the introduction of export licensing restrictions and bans for some crops and food products. Key cities are being encircled and continue to experience heavy bombardment, leaving people isolated and facing severe shortages of food, water and energy supplies. As insecurity persists and both local and national supply chains are disrupted, people are likely to fall deeper into emergency levels of hunger and malnutrition., Major concerns include:, • disruption to winter harvesting and spring planting;, • agricultural labour availability, impacted by displacement;, • access to and availability of agricultural inputs, particularly fuel;, • disruption of logistics and food supply chains;, • abandonment of and reduced access to agricultural land;, • damage to crops due to military activity, especially during vegetative stages in spring; and, • destruction of food system assets and infrastructure., These concerns apply across agricultural activities by smallholders and agribusinesses., Both are critical to Ukraine’s food security",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fao-note-impact-war-food-security-ukraine-25-march-2022
Resilience Under Fire: Saving Lives in War-Torn Ukraine Amidst Diminishing Resources,News and Press Release,IOM,Health,25 Mar 2022,"Kyiv/Lviv, 25 March 2022 – “Do you know where I can get L-thyroxin?” This is one of the most frequently asked questions people in Ukraine's war-affected capital Kyiv are asking friends and neighbors. A similar situation can be observed in other cities., On Facebook, posts of people looking for thyroid drugs are common, including in the regions not yet affected by the war. In the first week of Russian military invasion, people spent up to five hours queueing near a handful of pharmacies still operating in Kyiv. Nobody left the queue to shelter even when air raid sirens went off. On the third week, it took about an hour to enter a pharmacy. Now, there are almost no queues, mostly because the supplies have run out, and it is unclear when new batches of medicine will arrive. Stores that might still have the much-needed drugs have remained closed since 24 February, with fading hope of them opening their doors soon., Due to the lack of public transport, restricted movement and active hostilities, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns about increasingly challenging access to medicine and care for noncommunicable diseases, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease, epilepsy and cancer., Continuous shelling of medical infrastructure poses an enormous burden on medical workers in the most affected areas. In the first three weeks of the war, over 40 facilities were attacked, resulting in 34 injuries and 12 deaths., A recent survey by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) indicates that there are 6.48 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine. About one third of the displaced households had members with chronic illnesses, and almost 20 per cent included persons with disabilities. Medicine and health services were identified as the second most pressing needs. Despite these challenges, since the start of hostilities until mid-March more than 4,300 children were born in Ukraine and 80,000 more women are about to give birth in Ukraine over the next three months., The western city of Lviv hosts over 250,000 IDPs with the capacities of medical institutions visibly stretched. The city has witnessed several missile attacks since the start of the war but still remains at the heart of humanitarian efforts to help those fleeing the war into neighboring countries or those who decided to stay in this region., In Lviv, IOM’s partner clinic, the Andrii Sheptytsky hospital, volunteered to provide medical care, both urgent and planned, for everyone, including newly displaced persons. The hospital’s staff established a regular presence at the Lviv railway station – a major hub that welcomes IDPs. Several psychologists provide consultations directly at the shelters for displaced persons, helping them to overcome acute distress after fleeing from the war zones. Since the war started, the hospital extended capacities of its palliative care unit, accommodating those who need permanent care., “Due to shortages of specific medicines in eastern Ukraine, many patients with noncommunicable diseases are fleeing to the west, where they can receive treatment and care. It is important for us to anticipate the scale of further displacement and increase our capacities,” explains Andrii Login, the head of the charity fund at the hospital. “Many health workers are still here, they did not move to the EU, so we need to make everything possible to keep this staff and improve medical infrastructure at regional and local levels. Otherwise, the system will get overloaded.”, The medical director of the hospital, Roksolana Velgush, warns that mass displacement can result in a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, as people are staying in overcrowded shelters with poor ventilation. Several outbreaks of respiratory infections, including COVID-19, have already been reported in the shelters for IDPs in Lviv, while 35,396 new cases of COVID-19 and 556 new deaths were registered in the country between 10 and 16 March. As COVID-19 designated units are getting reoriented towards treating the wounded and those in critical condition, capacities are scarce to isolate patients with COVID-19. As a positive signal, Roksolana flags that vaccination against COVID-19 continues, although at a much slower pace., The health impacts of the war are the focus of IOM’s work. IOM has been present in Ukraine for over 25 years, advocating for migrant-inclusive health practices and policies, facilitating migration health assessments together with partner clinics, refurbishing medical institutions affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine that erupted in 2014 and providing them with medical and personal protective equipment to help counter the spread of COVID-19., In response to the current crisis, IOM aims to deploy mobile health teams composed of physicians and nurses to support access to life-saving primary health care. The Organization will also support local primary health-care centres through the procurement of personal protective equipment to reduce the spread of communicable diseases, including COVID-19., By Varvara Zhluktenko and Iryna Tymchyshyn, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/resilience-under-fire-saving-lives-war-torn-ukraine-amidst-diminishing-resources

Ukraine and Russia: Amnesty International’s key recommendations for EU leaders,Analysis,Amnesty,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Mar 2022,"This document outlines Amnesty International’s main concerns and recommendations in view of the 24-25 March European Council discussion on the crisis in Ukraine., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter and an act of aggression that is a crime under international law. One month since the invasion, Amnesty International has documented an escalating pattern of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, with catastrophic consequences for the Ukrainian people and the entire civilian population. There are now over 6.5 million internally displaced persons and over 3.5 million refugees, the majority of whom are women and children., Meanwhile, as the war rages on in Ukraine, the Russian authorities have unleashed an unprecedented, nationwide crackdown on independent journalism, anti-war protests and dissenting voices in an attempt to stifle any criticism of its actions at home. This clampdown has decimated Russia’s already beleaguered civil society, following nearly a decade of legislative restrictions designed to quell dissenting voices and shrink civic space. Following Russia’s exit from the Council of Europe, and its declared intention to denounce the European Convention on Human Rights, some of the last safeguards against human rights abuses will be off limits to those who need them most in Russia., Recommendations to European Union leaders ahead of EU Council meeting – Ukraine and Russia",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-and-russia-amnesty-international-s-key-recommendations-eu-leaders
Conflict in Ukraine: Key Evidence on Risks of Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants,Analysis,UNODC,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"Targeted by Traffickers - Ukrainian Refugees at High Risk of Exploitation, Vienna, 24 March 2022, One month into the war in Ukraine, millions of people, mainly women and children, continue to flee their homes. As long as the conflict continues, the risk of them being targeted by criminal networks grows., The United Nations Office on Drugs on Crime (UNODC), the leading entity within the UN system to address the criminal elements of human trafficking, is supporting countries that are affected by the refugee crisis to identify potential victims and develop short and long-term strategies to prevent this crime., Latest figures from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) indicate that around ninety percent of the over 3.6 million refugees from Ukraine are women and children., “Evidence from conflicts shows that criminals profit from the chaos and desperation of war. Crisis increases vulnerabilities as well as opportunities to exploit people in need, especially internally displaced people and refugees,” says UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly., UNODC is working closely with other UN and international entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and law enforcement authorities to coordinate responses to the current risks., “People who have fled conflict, especially women and children, are particularly at risk of human trafficking and exploitation,” says Ms. Waly., “The longer a conflict lasts, the more vulnerable they can become as they struggle to start a new life. We need to take urgent and determined action to protect people and prevent them from falling victim to traffickers.”, UNODC research has demonstrated how people fleeing conflict are vulnerable to becoming victims of trafficking., A few years after the war in Syria started, UNODC data noted a rapid increase in the number of identified victims of trafficking from Syria in the Middle East, Turkey and in European countries., In 2018, the Global Report highlighted how Afghans and Rohingya people from Myanmar, fleeing conflict and persecution, were targeted by traffickers., “People escaping conflict are in a very dangerous and precarious situation,” says Ilias Chatzis, Chief of the UNODC Section on Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling., “They can be more easily deceived by phoney travel arrangements and fake job offers that lead them into exploitative situations. Traffickers are known to use such methods, as well as violence, to trick and coerce their victims.”, Global data on detected cases of human trafficking, collected by UNODC since 2006, continue to show that women are the main target of traffickers and are primarily subjected to sexual exploitation., At the same time, figures consistently show an increase in the number of children identified as trafficked. Boys and girls currently account for around a third of all identified trafficking victims, a proportion that has tripled in the past 15 years., “When we consider which group of people are the prime targets for traffickers, the danger is obvious, especially since most of the women leaving Ukraine are travelling without other adult family members, and some children are even travelling alone,” says Mr. Chatzis., According to UNODC’s anti-trafficking experts, countries receiving refugees need to be aware of the risks of exploitation and ensure access for refugees to essential services, including education and childcare, as well as opportunities for employment., “The swift actions taken by many European countries to allow refugees to safely cross borders and receive humanitarian visas offers temporary protection and has significantly reduced the need for those fleeing to resort to migrant smugglers,” says Ilias Chatzis., “But the risk of trafficking will not go away in the short term. We are seeing massive numbers of refugees. If they are not properly supported, the risk of exploitation will increase,” he adds., UNODC crime prevention experts are assisting NGOs, border control and law enforcement officials in countries affected by the refugee crisis to strengthen anti-trafficking efforts that include the early detection and prevention of related criminal activity and the identification and protection of victims., The trafficking of Ukrainian victims is already a well-established, illegal industry with criminal networks operating between Ukraine and countries in Europe and Central Asia., Victims are exploited in Ukraine, and Ukrainians are trafficked internationally. The UNODC Global Database shows that in 2018 Ukrainian victims were identified as trafficked to 29 countries. Over half were identified in the Russian Federation and a quarter in Poland., The UNODC research paper “Conflict in Ukraine: Key Evidence on Risks of Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants” can be found here., For further information, please contact:, Ilias Chatzis, Chief, Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Section, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Tel +43 699 145 95735, ilias.chatzis[at]un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-key-evidence-risks-trafficking-persons-and-smuggling-migrants
General Assembly Adopts Text Recognizing Scale of Humanitarian Woes Arising from Russian Federation’s Ukraine Offensive as Unseen in Many Decades,News and Press Release,UN GA,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"GA/12411, GENERAL ASSEMBLYPLENARY
ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 9TH MEETING (AM), Delegates Decline to Take Action on South Africa’s Draft, While Deploring Lack of ‘Unanimous Consensus’ in Vote Resuming its emergency special session today, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing that the Russian Federation’s military offensive inside Ukraine — and its humanitarian consequences — are on a scale that the international community has not seen in Europe in many decades., The Assembly adopted draft resolution “L.2” by a recorded vote of 140 in favour to 5 against (Eritrea, Russian Federation, Syria, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Belarus), with 38 abstentions — a clear signal of the international community’s demand that Moscow immediately halt its hostilities against Ukraine so that the corollary humanitarian impact can be addressed., By the text, the Assembly demanded full protection for civilians, including humanitarian personnel, journalists and persons in vulnerable situations, women and children among them. It further demanded full respect for — and protection of — all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their equipment and means of transportation, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities., Moreover, the Assembly demanded full respect for and protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and infrastructure critical to the delivery of essential services in armed conflict. It also demanded that all parties protect civilians fleeing armed conflict and violence, including foreign nationals, notably students, without discrimination. The Assembly further demanded voluntary, safe and unhindered passage, as well as safe, unhindered humanitarian access for humanitarian personnel, their means of transportation, supplies and equipment, to those in need within Ukraine and neighbouring countries., By other terms, the Assembly welcomed and urged continued efforts by the Secretary-General, Member States, the United Nations system and the international community to deliver humanitarian assistance as well as protection for refugees. It also urged the immediate peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine through political dialogue, negotiations, mediation and other peaceful means, in accordance with international law., The Assembly declined to put a competing text to the vote. Tabled by South Africa’s delegation, draft resolution “L.3” contained no mention of the Russian Federation, instead referring to the humanitarian situation as “emanating out of” the conflict., The two texts continued to generate sharp debate, as they did during the session on Wednesday (see Press Release GA/12410). South Africa’s representative said the adoption of a resolution on the humanitarian crisis should be the priority, while expressing her suspicion that political divisions will ensure that geopolitical objectives are paramount., Delegates taking the floor both before and after the vote decried the humanitarian disaster resulting from the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine., Canada’s delegate declared: “This is not a natural disaster,” emphasizing “a humanitarian crisis of this type is not a spontaneous event. It is the direct result of a deliberate decision by one country, the Russian Federation, to invade another, Ukraine.” He went on to note that the aggressor nation has directed its military forces against cities, leaving residents no choice but to flee., Austria’s representative took issue with calls by some delegations for an even-handed and unbiased approach using “neutral” language. Pointing out that his country knows about neutrality, he emphasized that it does not mean violations of international law should be viewed through such a lens. How can such balance possibly be found in the midst of civilians suffering from “acts that constitute war crimes”, he asked., Several delegates highlighted emerging problems as the humanitarian crisis continues to spiral., Egypt’s representative, shining a spotlight on the incipient food insecurity resulting from the conflict, said the prices of food and energy have risen, and asked for that to be addressed in order to ensure that food-importing nations can continue to do so., Côte d’Ivoire’s representative, meanwhile, underscored the need for the protection of civilians trying to escape the conflict, advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all, including those of African descent., Several delegates expressed concern that the General Assembly could not reach a unanimous consensus on the resolution., Brazil’s representative expressing regret that the 193-member Assembly could not speak with one voice. He also lamented that the adopted resolution did not take into account the humanitarian impact of economic sanctions., China’s representative expressed his preference for the draft that was not adopted, given its focus on humanitarian issues, noting that the adopted text exceeded its purview. He emphasized the need to give precedence to urging all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to reach a ceasefire agreement as soon as possible., The Russian Federation’s representative said his delegation voted against the “pseudo-humanitarian resolution” tabled by Western States and Ukraine. He said the adopted resolution will create no legal obligations, emphasizing that that political considerations won the day., Also speaking were representatives of San Marino, Cambodia, Pakistan, Myanmar, Ukraine, India, Tunisia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Rwanda, Malaysia, Algeria, Iraq, Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Eritrea, Thailand, Jordan, Iran, Lebanon, Lesotho, France (for the European Union), Denmark (for the Nordic-Baltic States) and Israel., The Permanent Observer for the Holy See also delivered a statement, as did the Permanent Observer for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta., Statements, DAMIANO BELEFFI (San Marino), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine and expressed deep concern over the subsequent humanitarian crisis. Noting that his country co-sponsored the draft resolution, he said that the conflict has already resulted in more than 2,000 civilian casualties, including women and children. According to Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs data, the number of internally displaced persons combined with those who have fled to other countries amounts to more than 10 million people, nearly a quarter of the population of Ukraine. He also expressed concern over incidents that occurred near nuclear power facilities, which could result in catastrophic consequences for the people and the environment. With the ongoing hostilities, many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, they are unable to meet even their most basic needs, he noted, stressing the importance of protecting humanitarian corridors for refugees and of protecting humanitarian actors and the most vulnerable people. His country has welcomed almost 300 refugees from Ukraine and is working to facilitate the integration and inclusion of these refugees in the territory. The Government has also created a subsidy for families hosting Ukrainian refugees and activated a fundraising programme to assist refugees., SOVANN KE (Cambodia) expressed his grave concern about the intensifying gravity of the situation in Ukraine as well as the worsening humanitarian conditions resulting from the military hostilities there. “During this dire situation, all parties must ensure unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian people, especially to those in need,” he said, calling on the parties to respect international law. He recalled that, on 3 March, the Foreign Ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) called for a ceasefire in Ukraine and the continuation of political dialogue. As a friend to both countries, Cambodia encourages the Russian Federation and Ukraine to resolve the conflict through diplomacy, dialogue and other peaceful means, in order to achieve long-lasting peace between the two countries., KACOU HOUADJA LÉON ADOM (Côte d’Ivoire) emphasized that the values to which the international community has freely subscribed must be respected. Expressing concern over the escalation of violence that has occasioned massive destruction and a terrible number of causalities, he condemned violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, calling for the security and safety of civilians as well as respect for the principles of distinction and proportionality. Civilians must be protected as they flee the violence, he said, also stressing the need to ensure access to humanitarian assistance and for fair treatment of all impacted by the crisis, including Africans and people of African descent., ZHANG JUN (China) emphasized his country’s consistent position that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations must be upheld, that the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and that all efforts towards peaceful resolution of the crisis must be supported. The most pressing task is to urge the parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid further civilian casualties and reach a ceasefire agreement as soon as possible, he said. Stressing the need to strictly observe the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality when addressing the humanitarian issue in Ukraine, he said the politicization of humanitarian issues must be prevented. Whereas China agrees in purpose with “L.2”, some of that draft’s contents go beyond the humanitarian scope, he noted. “L.3”, on the other hand, focuses on humanitarian issues and emphasizes the need for hostilities to cease. Under the current circumstances, the latter text is more conducive to promoting unity among Member States and opening the door to a political solution, he affirmed., MUNIR AKRAM (Pakistan) recalled the Islamabad Declaration issued at the forty-eighth session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and stressed the need for humanitarian corridors to ensure the safe movement of civilians from active conflict zones as well as the provision of humanitarian supplies. Appreciating the endeavours for a resolution to provide adequate and expeditious humanitarian assistance to those gravely affected by the conflict, he expressed hope that States can adopt an agreed outcome, which can facilitate the promotion of humanitarian assistance to civilians, emphasizing that such an outcome should not be impeded by political considerations. An immediate cessation of hostilities is imperative to prevent human suffering and provide humanitarian assistance, he said., KYAW MOE TUN (Myanmar) emphasized that all unnecessary human suffering must end completely and immediately, while welcoming continuing international efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance and protection for refugees, as well as the Secretary-General’s appointment of a United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine. He went on to point out that the people of Myanmar are experiencing similar man-made tragedies and humanitarian crisis resulting from atrocities perpetrated by the military, as well as its crimes against humanity and indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks against its own people. According to the United Nations, almost 900,000 people remain displaced and 6.2 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the military’s indiscriminate attacks across the country to date, he noted. At the same time, Myanmar’s people are encountering food insecurity, he noted. While calling for humanitarian access and assistance for people in and around Ukraine, he also urged the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar’s people in a transparent and inclusive manner and help end the military’s atrocities and the military dictatorship., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said “this is part of a horrific trend: in just 25 days, the UN has verified 52 attacks against health-care in Ukraine”, emphasizing that there is no justification for attacks and nothing “special” about Russia’s military operation. It is directed at whole cities, he said, pointing out that more than 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes. The socioeconomic impacts of the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine are devastating, he added, noting that they are felt outside the region, including in the least developed countries, and by vulnerable populations, around the world. Pointing to rising energy prices, disruption of supply chains and the impact on food security, he declared: “This is not a natural disaster. A humanitarian crisis of this type is not a spontaneous event. It is the direct result of a deliberate decision by one country, the Russian Federation, to invade another, Ukraine.”, ALEXANDER MARSCHIK (Austria), associating himself with the European Union, said there have been reports of attacks on civilian infrastructure using explosive weapons and cluster munitions. “We hear about acts that constitute war crimes that must be condemned in the strongest terms by all of us,” he emphasized. While humanitarian conditions seem outside the scope of the imaginable, they are too familiar to many in parts of the Middle East and Africa, he noted. However, the Security Council has been able to act in those regions, but not so in Ukraine, where it has failed to act as the guardian of peace under the Charter of the United Nations, he said. Noting the glaring omissions in the second draft resolution submitted, he said the country of concern was not consulted, while expressing puzzlement that colleagues called for more neutral language in draft resolution L.2. The text is about the suffering of people under armed attack and enduring war crimes, he pointed out, demanding: “How can that require balance?” Austria knows about neutrality, he affirmed, stressing that it does not mean neutrality of values or taking no position when faced with violations of international law., PAUL BERESFORD-HILL, Permanent Observer for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, said that around 5,000 of the Order’s staff are currently in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, serving hot food, providing first aid and emotional support as well as securing short- and long-term accommodations for those in need. Spotlighting the heightened risk of sexual violence and human trafficking faced by refugees and displaced persons, he emphasized the need to provide adequate training to those giving advice and assistance to such individuals so that vulnerable women and children do not fall victim. The international community should help protect all refugees, internally displaced persons and those in need both inside and outside Ukraine, he said., The representative of South Africa, speaking in explanation of position, said it is vital that the General Assembly adopt a resolution on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine as the immediate priority. Unfortunately, political divisions suggest that perhaps the humanitarian response is secondary to geopolitical objectives, she noted, emphasizing that, while the context should not be ignored, the world’s focus must not be diverted. The global community should work to end the war by calling for a cessation of hostilities. Noting that Africa has experienced its fair share of proxy wars and their destructive outcomes, she said “we empathize with the people of Ukraine caught up in a conflict not of their making”. Pretoria has explained to Kyiv the rationale for introducing its own draft resolution and will abstain from the vote on draft resolution L.2, she said, adding that her delegation has tabled draft resolution L.3, which it believes is more conducive to a humanitarian response., Action, The Assembly then adopted the draft resolution “Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.2) by a recorded vote of 140 in favour to 5 against (Eritrea, Russian Federation, Syria, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Belarus), with 38 abstentions., The representative of Ukraine, speaking after the vote on the draft “L.2”, described “L.3” as a “twin brother” of the defunct Russian text submitted in the Security Council that received just one vote. That draft was not a product of consultations with Ukraine, he emphasized, cautioning that if the General Assembly takes action thereon, it will mean further undermining its own authority, if not losing what remains of it. Doing so would be akin to offering a nameless, generic placebo to a dying child instead of administering the proper medication — bitter, but offering a real chance of survival, he said, asking whether those present would “leave a dying child with no chance whatsoever just because the pill is easier to swallow”. Voting on “L.3” will simply put a coat of fresh paint over the mouldy, rotten structure of the Assembly, he said, while stressing, however, that it would not be paint, but “the blood of Ukrainian women, children and defenders”. He then proposed, pursuant to Rule 91 of the Assembly’s rules of procedure, that the organ not take action on “L.3”., A Secretariat official then explained that a vote in favour of that proposal would be a vote to take action on “L.3”, while a vote against would be a vote to not do so., The representative of Australia said many in the chamber would benefit from a repeated explanation regarding the meaning of a vote in favour or against the current proposal., The representative of the Russian Federation said the Secretariat official already explained the procedure, adding that no one can interrupt a vote once declared by the President of the General Assembly., The Assembly then rejected the proposal to take action on “L.3” by a recorded vote of 50 in favour to 67 against, with 36 abstentions., JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE (Dominican Republic), Vice-President of the General Assembly, then ruled that, since the proposal to take action on “L.3” was not adopted, the Assembly will not take action on that draft., The representative of India, speaking in explanation of position, said his delegation abstained from the vote because what is needed is a cessation of hostilities and urgent humanitarian assistance. The draft did not fully reflect those challenges, he emphasized., The representative of Tunisia said his delegation voted in favour of the draft due to the extreme importance of all parties responding to the imperatives of international humanitarian law. The right to life and to access humanitarian assistance must both be respected, he stressed., The representative of Lao People’s Democratic Republic said his delegation abstained from the vote on “L.2” because it believes draft resolutions with humanitarian objectives should be adopted by consensus. They should contain well-balanced and non-politicized language that will help to ease tensions and create suitable conditions for all humanitarian operations on the ground, he added, emphasizing the urgent need for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict., The representative of Rwanda said his delegation voted in favour of “L.2”, emphasizing the need to inject substantive support in pressing for three main objectives: protection of civilians, humanitarian support, and dialogue. He warned against making civilians shields against gunfire, saying that amounts to a violation of humanitarian laws and a war crime., The representative of Malaysia, noting that his delegation voted in favour of “L.2”, strongly urged all concerned to take immediate steps to de-escalate and return to dialogue and negotiations so as to prevent further loss of life and devastation. He called for unhindered humanitarian access within and around Ukraine and respect for and protection of civilian life and infrastructure, urging all parties to comply fully with their obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law., The representative of the Russian Federation recalled that, on 24 March 1999, the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies began their military aggression against the Republic of Yugoslavia. They carried out more than 35,000 bombing runs and more than 2,000 Serbs died as a result — including women, children and older people — he said, adding that thousands of civilian objects and infrastructure were destroyed. That would later be “cynically called collateral damage”, he said, spotlighting that conflict as a tragic contribution to European history by “so-called defensive forces”. He went on to say there is no point in going into the details of why the Russian Federation voted against the “pseudo-humanitarian resolution” put forth by Western States and Ukraine, emphasizing that political considerations won over. The resolution’s ultra vires adoption is destructive, null and void, and creates no legal consequences, he stressed, voicing hope that Western States will remember “this lesson in the manipulation of humanitarian principles”., The representative of Algeria, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating crisis in Ukraine and the humanitarian situation, called upon the Security Council to carry out its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the United Nations Charter., The representative of Brazil said his delegation voted in favour of the resolution due to the urgent need to send a strong message on the humanitarian situation. Emphasizing that the General Assembly cannot be a bystander as the world witnesses the transformation of once-peaceful cities into war zones, he expressed regret at its inability to speak with one voice. He went on to stress that the text fails to address the pressing concern of the humanitarian consequences of indiscriminate economic sanctions that will affect all countries, particularly developing nations., The representative of Egypt said his delegation voted in favour of “L.2” due to its belief in the principles of international humanitarian law and the need to protect civilians in armed conflict. Emphasizing that the parties must not politicize humanitarian action or resolutions, he also rejected economic sanctions outside the multilateral system due to their effects on civilians and the world economy, which are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., The representative of Iraq, emphasizing that his country’s people “know full well” what it is like to be in dire need of humanitarian aid in times of crisis and war, recalled that the United Nations provided Iraq with the humanitarian support necessary to overcome the repercussions of numerous crises. He said that his delegation voted in favour of “L.2” from a sense of responsibility towards the Ukrainian people, adding that Iraq would also have voted in favour of “L.3”, if given the chance., The representative of Sierra Leone pointed to his delegation’s explanation after the vote on resolution ES-11/2, on 2 March, saying it was rooted in Sierra Leone’s belief in the sanctity of the United Nations Charter and its emphasis on the need for consistency and good faith in the Charter’s application, while not absolving the actions or inactions of the United Nations in addressing peace and security questions in Africa. Similarly, Sierra Leone recognizes that humanitarian resolutions are meant to enable the delivery of humanitarian assistance, in accordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality, he added. Sierra Leone accords appropriate consideration to the principle of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of States, and the need for humanitarian assistance to be provided with the consent of the affected State, he added., The representative of Indonesia said he voted in favour of the resolution due to the need for action to address the dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine. However, he expressed regret that the Assembly was unable to speak in a strong and united voice, adding that consensus has become a “luxury” in the General Assembly. It is regrettable that the world has to see how it is over such an important issue., The representative of Eritrea said he voted against “L.2” and regrets that the humanitarian issue has been politicized, adding that the text could have been adopted by consensus had it focused only on humanitarian priorities. He went on to express appreciation for the South African delegation’s initiative, saying that he was prepared to support draft resolution “L.3”., The representative of Thailand said his delegation voted in support of the resolution because of the overriding importance of protecting civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations. He urged all parties to comply fully with international humanitarian law and international human rights law, to protect civilians and civilian objects and to ensure unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance, without discrimination or politicization. In that regard, he commended Ukraine’s neighbours and other States that have quickly mobilized humanitarian assistance to those in need, while noting that his country has provided food, medical and other essential supplies to the affected civilians through the Ukraine Red Cross Society., The representative of Jordan said his delegation voted in favour of “L.2” due to its respect for international humanitarian law and for the Charter. However, he emphasized the need to look closely into alleged violations of international humanitarian law, pointing out that international liability is not predetermined, but rather a result of documented violations of the laws of armed conflict., The representative of Iran said his delegation abstained, explaining that the text contains certain elements that exceed the scope of the humanitarian situation on the ground. It also lacks realistic mechanisms for dealing with the humanitarian aspects of the conflict, he added, urging all parties to cooperate in advancing the humanitarian response. Iran regrets that Member States were not given a chance to vote on the text “L.3”, he said, noting that his delegation would have voted in favour., The representative of Lebanon said her delegation voted in favour of “L.2” but would rather have seen a consensus adoption. She went on to question whether it is more important to “score successes in voting” than to provide real help on the ground, and whether today’s resolution makes civilians in Ukraine safer and brings the country closer to peace. Emphasizing that the United Nations is failing in its duty to stop the scourge of war, failing Ukraine’s civilians and failing a world standing on the precipice of a food crisis, she called upon the international community to alleviate the worsening humanitarian plight of civilians and pursue international cooperation to resolve global problems., The representative of Lesotho said his delegation’s vote in favour of “L.2” was motivated by its desire for humanitarian action, which was its focus, rather than the causes of the conflict or any other factors that may lead to further suffering for Ukraine’s people., Statements, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, described the resolution as balanced and faithfully reflecting the situation on the ground. It calls upon the Russian Federation to end its aggression without delay, he said, adding that the text is the result of a broad consultation with Ukraine and Member States of all regions. Co-sponsored by 80 delegations, it was adopted by an overwhelming majority, he noted, emphasizing that the people of Ukraine and the world need the resolution., MARTIN BILLE HERMANN (Denmark), speaking on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries, explained why his delegation has voted against action on South Africa’s draft resolution, saying the text mentions Ukraine, but not the Russian Federation. “Yet, Russia, and Russia alone, bears the responsibility for the humanitarian catastrophe we are discussing today,” he said, emphasizing that only the Russian Federation can end the humanitarian crisis and should bear the responsibility. It is particularly regrettable that the resolution was drafted without Ukraine’s engagement and was in competition with an earlier humanitarian text submitted by a cross-regional group of countries together with Ukraine, he added., The representative of Israel said her country voted in favour of “L.2” due to the need to provide unhindered humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians in need. Noting the normative, historical and ethical obligations relating to such humanitarian efforts, she said Israel has provided more than 100 tons of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine in the form of medical supplies, emergency-water-supply kits and winter gear., GABRIELE CACCIA, Permanent Observer for the Holy See, recalled that Pope Francis spoke yesterday about the conflict’s many victims and emphasized that there is no victory in war. The Holy See calls for an immediate ceasefire and for a real focus on negotiations towards the immediate peaceful resolution of the conflict, he said., For information media.

Protection and Human Rights",25 Mar 2022,"Attacks on healthcare facilities, transport, and personnel—more than 60 in just four weeks—are limiting access to life saving services and supplies in Ukraine, Mothers are expected to give birth to 80,000 babies in the next three months without access to adequate healthcare., IRC experience shows that when people are trapped and health and sanitation facilities are targeted, diseases like cholera spread and preventable deaths skyrocket., New York, NY, March 25, 2022 — Civilians in Ukraine are facing a catastrophic health crisis following 64 attacks on health infrastructure in just the first month of the conflict. Lack of access to safe water and critical healthcare, and the potential for a surge in vaccine-preventable diseases like COVID-19 and polio may significantly exacerbate the ongoing humanitarian crisis., Mesfin Teklu Tessema, Senior Director of Health at the International Rescue Committee said:, “In Ukraine, the impact on healthcare in just the first month of the conflict has been colossal and, as we have seen in other ongoing conflicts, is likely to worsen with the most vulnerable paying the steepest price. In long-running conflicts, access to basic health services is often limited and may even become non-existent. As a result, people with chronic conditions, emerging conditions or who are injured by the conflict itself will not be able to reach the medical care they need. Our experience in places like Syria demonstrates that protracted conflict and systemic attacks on health infrastructure can cause healthcare professionals to leave the country, resulting in further strains on the system and lack of access to care for those that need it most., “The impacts of the conflict in Ukraine on maternal and infant health are already pronounced. More than 4,300 babies have been born in Ukraine since the conflict began and 80,000 births are expected in the next three months. As Ukraine’s health system continues to collapse, the risk to new mothers and babies will grow., “Just a week before the conflict escalated, Ukraine recorded its highest ever number of COVID-19 cases. With less than 40% of the population vaccinated against COVID-19, people becoming displaced in crowded reception centers and bunkers are at risk. Ukraine was also experiencing a polio outbreak and the escalation of conflict disrupted a vaccination campaign in the impacted region. In some areas most affected by the conflict, including Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv, polio vaccination rates are below 50%., “Ukraine also struggles with high-rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). The conflict has weakened people’s ability to manage their condition, limited access to lifesaving drugs, and forced the closure of clinics that people rely on for care, sparking fears of spread. The IRC is worried about these and other infectious diseases spreading as the conflict persists and water, sanitation and hygiene systems continue to become damaged.”, Attacks on healthcare facilities constitute a grave breach of international humanitarian law and the IRC calls on all parties to uphold their legal obligations. The IRC additionally calls for the protection of healthcare access in Ukraine by ensuring the safety of providers and the free flow of medical supplies and equipment. Global leaders must prioritize support to the most vulnerable, including women, children and the elderly., The IRC is working with partners in Ukraine to provide evacuation services to people trapped by the conflict and deliver essential items to those forced to flee, including blankets, sleeping bags, warm clothes, and cash assistance. In Poland, the IRC is working with partners to provide critical information through an existing hotline, offering legal counseling and psychological support to people dealing with trauma. The IRC is also working to help people displaced by the conflict access essential services through social workers, interpreters and cultural assistants., MEDIA CONTACTS, Madiha Raza

Ukraine: At least one in ten refugees needs psychological support,News and Press Release,Malteser,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items",25 Mar 2022,"Cologne/Lviv. In the city of Lviv, Malteser International has further expanded psychological support for refugees. Around 200,000 people are currently staying in the western Ukrainian city near the border with Poland. ""The streets are full of people. They hope that they will not be forced to leave Ukraine. But even as refugees in their own country, the psychological burden is great. They have lost their homes, left their families behind, and face an uncertain future. More than 10 percent of them need psychological support,"" says Pavlo Titko, head of Malteser in Ukraine., Twelve psychologists are currently working for Malteser Ukraine. ""One woman told our team that one father had been shot in front of his children and wife. These are the worst images that have been described to us. When we look at them, we see empty gazes. Many have no appetite, do not sleep, are restless. Only a few ask for psychological support because there is still a strong stigma about this topic. That is why it is important to approach mothers directly. The first thing we must do is to stabilise mothers so that their children get a sense of security. When mothers feel better, their children also feel better,"" says Stepan Pasichnyk, psychologist for Malteser in Lviv., In four facilities, Ukrainian Malteser offer psychosocial support services for the people. In two facilities they provide a special offer for children with autism. They are under a lot of stress because they have been torn out of their usual routine. The children can process their experiences in drawing classes and creative workshops. Mobile teams provide additional support for the people at the station., ""It is now important for the children to learn a new form of everyday life. We celebrated the birthday of one of our children in care a few days ago and our psychologist brought balloons. We must not forget the needs of these children and we must take special care of them,"" says Titko., Germany: Interim Balance of Humanitarian Aid, Since the beginning of the war a month ago, Malteser Germany has delivered around 2,500 tonnes of relief supplies to Ukraine or its neighbouring countries. More than 70 transports arrived in Ukraine. Medical supplies, tents, camp beds, blankets, food, and field kitchens were among them. Vehicles (one emergency ambulance, one patient transport ambulance, one armoured personnel carrier, one panel van) have been sent to the Malteser centres in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv. Some of them have been sent to the interior of the country., In Lviv (Ukraine), Katowice (Poland) and Fürstenfeldbruck (Germany), Malteser International has established large logistics and material centres. In coordination with the relief organization, private, communal as well as corporate initiatives also supply required goods to the different logistic hubs. Around 1,000 Malteser volunteers are currently on duty every day in Germany. Among other things, they set up shelters at short notice, look after refugees in arrival centres and shelters, provide corona rapid tests and primary medical care and help to pick up and sort donations. Full-time and voluntary staff take care of refugees in more than 60 accommodation facilities of the federal states and municipalities., Malteser International is the worldwide relief organisation of the Sovereign Order of Malta for humanitarian aid.

"News comment: Without international solidarity, Ukraine’s displacement crisis could turn into catastrophe",News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"Statement by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, Since 24 February, millions have been living through the horror of war in Ukraine. In a month, many civilians have lost their lives, with thousands more injured. Families have been torn apart. Without an immediate end to the fighting, this unspeakable suffering and mass human displacement will only get worse., Almost a quarter of Ukraine’s population – more than 10 million people – have been forced from their homes. Some 3.7 million refugees have been forced to flee the country, making this the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. An additional 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine’s borders, and at least 13 million are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., Behind the figures lies unimaginable suffering that only grows as humanitarian needs increase. Intense fighting continues to trigger large-scale displacement while simultaneously exacerbating the plight of the internally displaced or those who cannot flee the worst-affected areas., Homes, schools, hospitals, essential services and other civilian infrastructure have been laid to waste, reducing some people to drinking rainwater and snowmelt, cutting off supplies of food and medicines. Inside Ukraine, establishing safe corridors and satisfactory security guarantees for the evacuation of civilians continues to be an urgent issue. And the delivery of lifesaving aid remains dangerous and challenging., UNHCR has been in Ukraine for 30 years and we will not leave. When and where able, along side and in coordination with other UN organizations, the ICRC and NGOs, we continue to support the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities by providing emergency shelter, cash assistance, core relief items – from blankets and hygiene kits to folding beds and sleeping bags – and other critical services for those who have fled. We are contributing to humanitarian convoys destined for people in hard-to-reach areas, and we will keep doing so., Outside Ukraine, we have reinforced all our teams and scaled up our humanitarian response to bolster governments of countries receiving refugees from Ukraine in providing critical humanitarian and protection assistance and supporting authorities to increase their capacity to host new arrivals. The warm welcome and well-organized reception of Ukrainian refugees has been exceptional and deserves recognition and gratitude., UNHCR, however, has flagged protection risks to groups among those fleeing Ukraine that are of huge concern to us. It is critical that measures are put in place to quickly identify, mitigate and respond to risks of gender-based violence, exploitation, abuse and trafficking of women and girls. We also recognize unaccompanied and separated children, and refugees who are LGBTIQ+, older or living with disabilities have particular needs and could be vulnerable to greater protection risks. Thousands of third country nationals fled the war alongside Ukrainian nationals, including some in need of international protection or at risk of statelessness. Many have reached safety or returned to their home countries, however, there are persistent reports of unequal or discriminatory treatment., Even a single case of racism or discrimination preventing anyone from fleeing violence or from accessing asylum and safety is one case too many. We will continue to work with authorities inside Ukraine and in neighboring countries to ensure everyone fleeing the same violence and tragedy of war in Ukraine, is offered the same safety and protection., I am grateful that neighbouring countries have kept their borders open, and I welcome the unprecedented decision by the European Union to offer Temporary Protection. I am also humbled by the extraordinary compassion shown by local responders and global supporters as they help those fleeing the conflict, in the form of accommodation, transport, food, and financial and material donations. This support and solidarity demonstrated by the states and people across Europe and globally has been incredibly heartening., This level of solidarity should set the example for all refugee crises. Even as the Ukraine crisis intensifies, we must not forget the millions more children, women and men displaced by conflict, persecution, violence and human rights abuses. In many other regions of the world – far too many – the devastation inflicted on millions of innocents is no less real and no less cruel. The right to seek and gain asylum is universal. It is not conditional on the colour of your skin, your age, gender, beliefs or birthplace. Respect for refugee rights is not open to interpretation or negotiation., This crisis will challenge us. The capacity of neighbouring countries receiving refugees is already coming under strain. A protracted conflict characterized by the brutal disrespect of international humanitarian law which we have observed in the past month can kill, terrorize and displace millions more. The only way to resolve this crisis is for the war to end. But while the number fleeing continues to rise, both they and the people hosting them need and deserve our support. More will be needed – for states, for refugees, for local communities – and I urge the international community to ensure that it is forthcoming., The war in Ukraine has generated enormous suffering but also inspired acts of great courage, generosity and compassion. Ensuring continued support to its innocent victims is vital if we are to stop this crisis turning into a catastrophe., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/news-comment-without-international-solidarity-ukraine-s-displacement-crisis-could
Update 31 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (24 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,24 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Russian forces were shelling Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych where many people working at the nearby Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) live, putting them at risk and preventing further rotation of personnel to and from the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine’s regulatory authority said the shelling was endangering “the homes and families of those operational personnel that ensure the nuclear and radiation safety” of the Chornobyl NPP, which is under the control of Russian forces since 24 February. Slavutych is located outside the Exclusion Zone that was established around the NPP after the 1986 accident., Director General Grossi expressed concern about this development, which comes just a few days after technical staff at the Chornobyl NPP were finally able to rotate and go to their homes in Slavutych and rest after working for nearly four weeks without a change of shift, and he said the IAEA would continue to closely monitor the situation. Staff now working at the site also come from Slavutych., Earlier today, the regulator also informed the IAEA that it does not expect wildfires burning in the vicinity of the Chornobyl NPP to cause any significant radiological concern, a day after the country’s regulator said Ukrainian firefighters were trying to extinguish blazes in the area., Ukraine’s regulatory authority said radiation measurements were currently not carried out in the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone. But the regulator still assessed the radiological risks as low based on years of experience of such fires and detailed data on the locations and amounts of residual radioactive contamination in the soil following the 1986 accident., IAEA experts agree with their Ukrainian counterparts’ assessment of the situation, Director General Grossi said., The regulator told the IAEA yesterday that “fire events” had been registered in the area of the Exclusion Zone, set up after the accident 36 years ago, and that slight increases in caesium air concentrations were detected in the capital Kyiv and at two NPP sites west of Chornobyl, without posing any radiological concerns. It had earlier said it was closely monitoring the situation in the Exclusion Zone ahead of the annual “fire season” when spontaneous fires often occur in the area., The local fire station in the town of Chornobyl, located in the Exclusion Zone, still does not have access to the electricity grid and instead relies on diesel generators, the regulator said today. The NPP site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located, continues to have off-site power available., Also in Chornobyl town, the State Agency for the Management of the Exclusion Zone reported that an environmental laboratory had been “looted by marauders” and its equipment stolen. It was not possible to verify the whereabouts of the laboratory’s radiation calibration sources and environmental samples, it added. The Agency is seeking to obtain more information from the operators of the laboratory. However, based on the information provided, the IAEA assesses that the incident does not pose a significant radiological risk., In today’s update, the Ukrainian regulator also said that, out of the country’s 15 reactors at four sites, eight were continuing to operate, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Personnel at the four operating plants were rotating in eight-hour shifts, also at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, and radiation levels were normal., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-31-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-24-march-2022

Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, The Russian Federation launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In the space of just one month, more than 3.6 million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II., An additional 6.5 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine and over 12 million more have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war. Humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially., Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of lifesaving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access., UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and appealed to neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., Key figures - UKRAINE, 54 transit and reception centres visited and assessed, 8,500 additional hosting spaces created in reception centres for internally displaced persons (IDPs) allowing them to host 85,000 people in transit per month, 16,000 people received protection assistance at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 22,500 people reached with essential food and non-food items such as shelter materials, mattresses, blankets, kitchen sets, towels and hygiene items, 3,669 families with damaged homes received emergency shelter kits, 657 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance in first days, UKRAINE SITUATION UPDATE, The number of civilian casualties across Ukraine continues to rise. As of 20 March, OHCHR reports 2,421 civilian casualties, including 925 killed; actual figures are likely much higher. Hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in areas which are heavily impacted by fighting and shelling., The intensity of the fighting, and notably the indiscriminate airstrikes hitting civilians and civilian infrastructure, continues to trigger large-scale displacement, while simultaneously exacerbating the humanitarian needs of those who are internally displaced or remain in heavily affected areas., The humanitarian situation in Mariupol remains dire. From 18 to 20 March, over 13,000 people were evacuated. However, authorities in Donetsk Oblast say thousands who fled Mariupol now face starvation in Manhush and Melekine as they are once again trapped without safe passage out of locations where food and water are increasingly scarce., Mariupol’s City Council reports that 50-100 artillery shells hit the city every day and that some 80 per cent of the city’s housing has been affected by ongoing hostilities, of which at least 30 per cent is damaged beyond repair., Further evacuations took place from other areas heavily impacted by fighting. On 18 March, some 500 civilians reportedly departed from Berdiansk, 85-km west of Mariupol, and some 4,000 civilians left Sumy Oblast. Local authorities reported that some 35,000 civilians managed to leave Mariupol over the last few days., On 19 March, some 700 people were evacuated from Rubizhne, Luhansk, following heavy shelling, among them many who were wounded and many with limited mobility. On 21 March, a further 175 people were evacuated from Hirske, Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, 40 from Rubizhne and 20 from Kreminna., The latest Global Protection Cluster ‘Protection Snapshot’ (10-16 March) is available here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-5-24-march-2022

Protection and Human Rights",24 Mar 2022,"We are united in our condemnation of Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, who are bravely defending their homeland, and we call on Russia to end the brutal onslaught against its neighbor. We are united in our support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And we are united in our resolve to defend our shared values, including democracy, respect for human rights, global peace and stability, and the rules-based international order., Today, we are continuing coordinated transatlantic efforts to support the Ukrainian people, impose severe costs on Russia for its unjustifiable actions, and strengthen the resilience of our democracies, economies, and societies. In particular,, The United States and the European Union have strengthened and aligned their sanctions regimes, together with like-minded partners across the world. Additionally, efforts should be stepped up to coordinate responses against sanctions evasion., We continue to mobilize and coordinate significant humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine, those who have been forced to flee, and those affected by the severe impacts Russia's war is causing around the world. This includes more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance the United States is prepared to provide and €550 million from the EU., The United States and the European Union are coordinating closely to ensure that their efforts on temporary protection and humanitarian admission, including resettlement or transfers, are complementary and provide much-needed support to Ukraine's neighbors., We are announcing new actions to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries., The United States and the European Union are supporting the work of war crimes documentation experts who are gathering evidence on the ground in Ukraine., We are taking further, concrete steps in our energy cooperation to ensure the security of supply and to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels., In order to prevent a potential food crisis triggered by price hikes and disruptions to food supply sparked by Putin's war in Ukraine, we intend to redouble our combined efforts to increase global food security and provide direct food aid, where warranted, to our partners worldwide., We will advance our cooperation on cybersecurity through a variety of actions, from supporting the Government of Ukraine on cyber resilience and cyber defense to aiming to combat the abuse of virtual currency., ANNEX – TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE, Imposing Additional Costs on Russia, The United States and the European Union have strengthened and aligned their sanctions regimes, together with our like-minded partners across the world. Today, the United States is sanctioning more than 400 additional individuals and entities to align with measures taken by the EU and our allies and partners. This includes the Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) and 328 of its members, dozens of defense companies that fuel Putin's war machine and sustain its military industrial base, and more than 20 financial elites, including the head of Russia's largest financial institution. The Commission, in line with its competences, will continue to support further similar measures. Together, we should aim at holding accountable those responsible for the devastation and commit to imposing further costs on Russia until Putin ceases his aggression., The United States and the European Union are jointly working to blunt Russia's ability to deploy its remaining international reserves, including gold, to prop up its economy and fund its illegal war., Additionally, as announced in today's G7 leaders' statement, we are establishing an initiative to monitor the full implementation of our sanctions measures and coordinate responses against sanctions evasion. This will ensure that Russia will not be able to backfill or find workarounds that undermine the effect of our sanctions., Providing Humanitarian Assistance to the Ukrainian People, We reaffirm our deep support for the Ukrainian people, who are suffering from Russia's devastating bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructure. We urge Russia to facilitate unhindered humanitarian access and permanent safe passage for civilians. We continue to mobilize humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee. The United States and the European Union are responding to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in countries impacted by the situation in Ukraine. The United States and the European Commission are coordinating closely on the provision of aid, including a through a newly-established high-level dialogue and a U.S. government liaison in the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre. Today, the United States is announcing it is prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new funding toward humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia's war in Ukraine and its severe impacts around the world over the coming months. The European Commission has made available EUR 550 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance and, through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism in cooperation with its partners, it has delivered almost EUR 300 million worth of in-kind assistance., Welcoming Ukrainians Fleeing Violence, The European Union has generously welcomed almost three and a half million Ukrainians fleeing Russia's violence, providing them food, shelter, school, and employment opportunities, paying particular attention to the plight of children and providing them protection for the time they need. The United States and the European Union are coordinating closely to ensure that their efforts on temporary protection and humanitarian admission, including resettlement, are complementary and provide much-needed support to Ukraine's neighbors. Today, the United States is announcing plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's aggression through the full range of legal pathways, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program., Partnering to Promote Democratic Resilience and Human Rights, We steadfastly support the democratic aspirations and fundamental freedoms of the Ukrainian people. Today, we are announcing new commitments to bolster societal resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries, including Moldova., To support human rights defenders, anti-corruption watchdogs, journalists, and other members of civil society operating in and around Ukraine, the United States is launching the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI), which will provide at least $320 million in new funding to these groups and regional governments. The EDRI will support media freedom and counter disinformation, benefit the safety and security of activists and vulnerable groups, strengthen institutions and the region's rule of law, and help ensure accountability for human rights abuses and violations of international law. And it will expand rapid response capabilities and technical assistance to build resilience to Moscow's strategic corruption and kleptocracy., The European Commission announced plans to reallocate funds from EU programmes to support civil society organizations, human rights defenders, journalists, and pro-democracy activists in Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. In addition, the European Endowment for Democracy, with EU funding contributions, provided a significant number of emergency grants to contribute to saving and sustaining civic activism and media pluralism in Ukraine. It also opened a Centre for Ukrainian Activists (CUA) in Przemyśl, Poland, to provide support for activists and independent journalists in maintaining and sustaining their connections to their activities inside Ukraine., Promoting Accountability, There should be accountability for any war crimes committed in Ukraine. The United States and the European Union are supporting the important work of war crimes documentation experts who are gathering evidence on the ground in Ukraine. The coordination of documentation and evidence preservation efforts to ensure such accountability should be facilitated., Supporting Europe's Energy Security, We reconfirm our commitment to Europe's energy security and to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. Energy security and sustainability for the EU and Ukraine are essential for peace, freedom and democracy in Europe. The EU has confirmed its objective to reach independence from Russian gas well before the end of the decade while working to ensure reliable, affordable, and clean energy supplies to citizens and businesses in the EU and its neighbourhood. The United States intends to partner with the EU on these efforts. We understand that the rapid transition to clean energy is essential to advancing EU independence from Russian fossil fuels and are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, the objective of net zero emissions by 2050, and keeping a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on temperature rise within reach. In line with this vision, the European Commission and United States will establish a joint Task Force to address the immediate energy security needs of the EU and accelerate the clean energy transition., Securing Global Food Supplies, We are deeply concerned by how Putin's war in Ukraine has caused major disruptions to international food and agriculture supply chains and the threat it poses to global food security. We recognize that many countries around the world have relied on imported food staples and fertilizer inputs from Ukraine and Russia, with Putin's aggression disrupting that trade. As the United States and EU comprise many of the world's major agricultural producers and strong economies, we commit to redoubling our combined efforts to provide direct food aid and other forms of assistance, where warranted, and, to continue the necessary support for agricultural innovation and sustainable productivity growth to ensure global food security, while balancing enhancing climate resilience and reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions., We are committed to working with partners to address the attendant supply challenges and maintaining strong, ruled-based, and open global markets for staple agricultural commodities that feed the world. Specifically, the United States, through Feed the Future and our nutrition commitments, is providing over $11 billion over the next five years to address food security threats and nutrition across the globe. Additionally, the United States will remain one of the top providers of humanitarian food and nutrition assistance globally, having contributed approximately $4.6 billion in humanitarian food and nutrition assistance in 2021. We are also identifying tools in the U.S. government's existing food security tool kit and determining whether programs are fit for purpose for this situation and will make strategic adjustments as needed., For the period 2021 - 2024, the EU is pledging at least EUR 2,5 billion for international cooperation related to nutrition. This international cooperation programme will support food systems in about 70 partner countries. The proposed EU Emergency Support Programme for Ukraine of EUR 330 million will secure access to basic goods and services for the Ukrainian population and also support Ukraine's agricultural sector., Ensuring the Security of Cyberspace, We are committed to advancing our cybersecurity cooperation, both in response to Russia's illegal further invasion of Ukraine and in support of our longer-term strategic objectives. Together, we will enhance our efforts to coordinate cybersecurity assistance and provide Internet access to the Governments of Ukraine and Moldova, working with Member States and other likeminded partners. In the context of Ukraine and more generally, we will continue to reinforce responsible state behavior in cyberspace and to work together to increase cyber resilience in the face of destructive, disruptive, and destabilizing cyber activity by both States and non-State actors, while also working to hold accountable those responsible for such activity., We will work towards establishing more structured cybersecurity information exchanges on threats and threat actors and deepen our cooperation on new cybersecurity technologies and standards. We are committed to our partnership in the Counter Ransomware Initiative to disrupt ransomware groups and reduce related threats to our citizens and businesses. We will enhance efforts to address the abuse of virtual currency; bolster cybersecurity resilience; increase partner capacity for detecting and responding to ransomware activity within their own borders; and work to jointly hold accountable states that act as safe havens for ransomware activity., Combatting Illicit Use of Digital Assets, We intend to announce deeper collaboration to combat the illicit use of digital assets, including their potential misuse in evading multilateral sanctions imposed in response to Russia's unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Together, we intend to deepen our shared commitment to advance anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) for digital assets, consistent with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards., We will share best practices and coordinate capacity building efforts to help other countries implement AML/CFT frameworks for digital assets. We intend to form a transatlantic sprint between U.S. and EU government officials and, as appropriate, digital asset service providers, to expedite and increase sharing of financial intelligence on illicit use of digital assets. Finally, we will seek opportunities for joint actions against those who facilitate the misuse of digital assets for illicit activity., Press contact, Eric MAMER

Ukraine Crisis: Week of 12-18 March 2022,Infographic,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Last week, the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its fourth week. Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the northern, eastern, and southern regions of Ukraine. Since the start of the invasion, Russian forces have failed to capture any regional centers other than Kherson, but have continued advances against Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv (BBC, 21 March 2022). Intense shelling of Mariupol city continued throughout the week, with Russian forces bombarding civilian infrastructure and blocking civilian access to food, water, electricity, and heat (Washington Post, 12 March 2022)., In addition to remote violence targeting civilians, Russian forces carried out abductions of civilians in occupied territories, including mayors, members of local councils, activists, and at least one journalist. Multiple people reported being tortured while in detention or otherwise pressured into cooperating with Russian troops, such as being filmed repeating pro-Russian narratives (Zmina, 18 March 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-12-18-march-2022
"Ukraine: Urgent and extra support needed for separated and unaccompanied children, says UN child rights committee",News and Press Release,UNCRC,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (24 March 2022) – One month after the Russian Federation began its invasion of Ukraine, around one hundred children have been killed, thousands injured, and many more displaced or separated from their parents and family. The UN Child Rights Committee today asked States to provide core and integrated support to traumatised Ukrainian children, especially those who are unaccompanied. The Committee issued the following statement., “Since the start of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine one month ago, the world has witnessed a child rights crisis on a massive scale. It is currently estimated that around 100 children have been killed and 1.5 million children have left the country to seek safety and protection. It is not possible to ascertain how many children have lost or been separated from their parents, siblings and other family members, but it is known the numbers are distressingly high., These atrocities have demolished the foundations of the Ukrainian society including infrastructures for child protection, education and health. The consequences are irreparable, as the children in Ukraine are severely traumatised, the adverse impact of which will be borne by generations of Ukrainians to come., In a statement issued earlier this month, the Child Rights Committee highlighted that the aggression of the Russian Federation in Ukraine is in violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Bearing in mind that Ukraine has one of the largest numbers of children without parental care in Europe, the Committee is especially distraught because of the harm and suffering of these children and the risk they are facing inside and outside the Ukrainian borders. Children in institutions, children with disabilities and long-term illnesses, and those deprived of liberty are among the groups of children that have diverse and complex needs which must be met to ensure their life, survival and development, including a sense of security, continuity and stability. Additional concerns relate to Roma and other minority, stateless and/ undocumented children who are equally exposed., While the Committee applauds the generous response of mostly European countries in receiving displaced families and children from Ukraine, it considers it to be of paramount importance that all children, including unaccompanied children, are cared for in a supportive community and family-based environment and in accordance with international standards of care. All children who are unaccompanied or separated need a core package of integrated social services, including healthcare, mental health and psychosocial support, nutrition, education, housing, financial support and legal aid, without discrimination. To this effect, States should develop national strategies for the inclusion of unaccompanied, asylum-seeking and refugee children into national child protection systems in a non-discriminatory manner., The Committee urges the receiving States to take immediate measures to protect all unaccompanied and separated children who, due to their vulnerability, are inevitably at risk of trafficking, exploitation and abuse. The measures should include international and regional cooperation and coordination across borders for identification, registration and tracing of children with the aim of ensuring that no child is unaccounted for, and to enable and support family reunification, having the best interests of the child taken as a primary consideration.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-urgent-and-extra-support-needed-separated-and-unaccompanied-children-says-un
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 23 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"Date: 24 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 23 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,685 civilian casualties in the country: 1,035 killed and 1,650 injured. This included:, a total of 1,035 killed (214 men, 160 women, 14 girls, and 28 boys, as well as 48 children and 571 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,650 injured (181 men, 140 women, 28 girls, and 23 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,211 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,168 casualties (311 killed and 857 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 901 casualties (255 killed and 646 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 267 casualties (56 killed and 211 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv,
Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,517 casualties (724 killed and 793 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 24 March, 128 children had been killed and at least 172 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 23 March, 294 civilians had been killed in the region, including 15 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-23-march-2022-enruuk

According to the latest government data compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), over three million refugees have now left Ukraine for surrounding countries, with 59% of them in Poland followed by Romania (15%). It is estimated that over four million people could leave Ukraine and seek protection and support across the region., 1.2 Current risk assessment and priority public health concerns in Ukraine, 1.2.1 Access to health care, There are many challenges to accessing health care, with active hostilities and a lack of public transport restricting movement. More than 300 health-care facilities are in areas experiencing active hostilities and approximately 600 facilities are located within 10 kilometres of ongoing conflict, leaving the health system vulnerable to infrastructural damages and severe disruptions of critical services. WHO has verified 64 attacks on health care since 24 February, resulting in 37 injuries and 15 deaths. Further attacks are being verified.
Interruptions in supply of medicines have been reported in cities with active hostilities. Some areas, such as the city of Mariupol in the south, have suffered critical shortages of medical supplies.
The overall number of beds available for patients with COVID-19 has decreased by 27% from 23 February to 23 March; differences are seen between oblasts, with the largest decrease (80%) reported in the Luhansk oblast, followed by the Volyn (69%) and Chernihiv (56%) oblasts. Furthermore, the number of beds occupied by COVID19 patients has decreased nationally by 83%, reflecting potential challenges in accessing hospitals, limited data reporting, and a potential decrease in actual hospitalizations following the peak of the Omicron wave earlier in February.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emergency-ukraine-external-situation-report-4-published-24-march-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Mar 2022,"Moscow (ICRC) – Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), has completed a two-day visit to Moscow where he continued ongoing humanitarian discussions with the Russian authorities. As a neutral, impartial humanitarian actor, ICRC is mandated to speak with all sides of a conflict to advocate respect for international humanitarian law, or the law of armed conflict, to protect civilian life and to ensure aid is able to reach those most in need., During the visit Mr Maurer met with Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs; Colonel General Alexander Fomin, Deputy Minister for Defence. He also met Pavel Savchuk, President of the Russian Red Cross, and Mrs Moskalkova, Human Rights Commissioner., ""My conversations with Russian authorities are part of an existing and sustained bilateral dialogue between the ICRC and Russia on humanitarian needs and international humanitarian law. Last week I was in Kyiv and this week I was in Moscow; I have also visited the Donbas area several times. We speak to all sides with the same goal: saving lives and reducing suffering during armed conflict,"" said Mr Maurer. ""In the face of enormous needs, ICRC is rapidly expanding our humanitarian assistance to all those affected by the armed conflict in Ukraine."", The meetings focused on the armed conflict in Ukraine but also included humanitarian issues in Syria. On Ukraine, discussions focused on pressing humanitarian concerns, including:, Safe passages: Mr Maurer stressed that the parties must facilitate movements of civilians out of cities where fighting is taking place, and also the need to allow humanitarian supplies in. The ICRC urges the parties to agree on more safe passages and specific details to make them happen - such as starting time, duration, location - to allow civilians to escape the fighting., Protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure: The ICRC is concerned about the suffering inflicted on civilians when they are exposed to devastating levels of violence. Wherever they may be, civilians and those no longer directly participating in the hostilities remain protected by international humanitarian law. All civilian objects and infrastructure must be spared from attack, including hospitals, schools, water systems and electrical infrastructure. The principles of proportionality, distinction, and precaution must be followed and put into practice in military operations to limit civilian suffering., Prisoners of war, civilian internees, and the missing: ICRC's right to visit prisoners of war and civilian internees is an essential part of the parties' obligations to protect civilians and those no longer fighting. The repatriation and dignified treatment of the dead on all sides of the armed conflict is vital, as is the need for families to know the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. All sides of the armed conflict are bound to facilitate and benefit from this key humanitarian activity., ICRC's assistance scale-up: ICRC has brought in over 300 tons of aid in recent weeks and trucks are transporting medical supplies and relief, for example war-wounded kits to hospitals in Odessa and hygiene and relief items to displaced people in Vinnytsia and Dnipro. In Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, 2.5 tons of food and hygiene items were donated to local shelters. In the Donbas area, the ICRC has supported access to water for over 1 million people and supported over 140 medical facilities since 2014. Last week in Donetsk the ICRC distributed materials to help repair five health centers and damaged homes., For more information, please contact:, press@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icrc-president-completes-visit-russia-speak-about-humanitarian-issues-armed-conflict
"""The war has caused the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II"" - Statement by Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident & Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,UN RC/HC Ukraine,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"It has been one very long month since this devastating war started., This week as I traveled around Ukraine, I have seen damage and suffering that no country, no human should ever experience., It feels, in fact, as if it’s been a year, since the lives of millions of people have changed forever., One month since the invasion of Ukraine, the war has caused the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II. Ten million people have been forcibly displaced, with more than three million crossing borders in search of safety., The loss of life and severe trauma caused by attacks on civilian infrastructure, on hospitals, schools and places of shelter are utterly shocking, as is the scale of destruction, with some cities besieged or totally devastated by airstrikes and heavy artillery., Some 950 civilians have been reported killed although the death toll is estimated to be far higher., Hundreds of thousands of people trapped in besieged cities like Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and the capital, Kyiv, and in areas close to the frontlines, are exhausted and running out of the basics needed for human survival, coping with constant bombardment by living in basements without heating, cooking fuel or water., In the short term, three things are critical: civilians, whether they stay or leave, must be protected; safe passages are needed for humanitarian supplies and personnel; and we need a system of constant communication with parties to the conflict., The systematic bombardment of cities, towns, hospitals, schools and shelters is terrorizing civilians and causing appalling human suffering. They must be allowed to reach places of safety – and go wherever they choose – while safe passage for humanitarian supplies must be allowed. Heavy weapons must not be used in residential areas. These barbaric tactics must end. All those engaged in fighting must protect civilians, as they are obliged to under international humanitarian law. Even wars have laws., This grave humanitarian crisis particularly affects the most vulnerable people, especially children, women and girls, the elderly and people with disabilities. We must prioritise vulnerable people and ensure that their health, rights and dignity are safeguarded. And we thank governments for keeping their borders open and facilitating the safe passage of all who need to flee., To address the massive and growing needs at the speed and scale required, we need constant, free and sustained access. The main humanitarian challenge is to secure safe access in areas with ongoing fighting. Last week, with the establishment of a humanitarian notification system, UN agencies and partners in Ukraine successfully moved the first convoy of urgent humanitarian aid to the encircled city of Sumy in the northeast, one of the areas worst affected by the war. We will continue to facilitate dialogue at all levels for the safe passage of other humanitarian convoys to help the most vulnerable civilians caught in the fighting., The United Nations and our humanitarian partners have been scaling up aid operations and services to support people inside Ukraine.

A Tentative First Look at Options for Peace Operations in Ukraine,Analysis,ICG,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,24 Mar 2022,"Richard Gowan
UN Director, With the war in Ukraine raging, and no sign of an exit in view, a Polish peacekeeping proposal is unlikely to gather steam. But it is not too early for policymakers to start thinking about what tasks a future peace operation might undertake., Prior to this week’s NATO summit in Brussels, Poland stirred up discussions of sending an international peacekeeping force to Ukraine. The concept, which Polish officials have emphasised is at a “preliminary” stage, is to deploy a force that could assist with humanitarian operations and would be robust enough to defend itself in combat. The proposal is unlikely to gain traction since, like the idea of a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine, it raises the risks of direct confrontation with Russia. But peacekeeping operations come in many shapes and sizes, and it is possible that some sort of international presence will eventually be needed to support a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine. Policymakers should not let speculation about unrealistic peacekeeping options distract them from the immediate priority, which is to facilitate a negotiated settlement to the war. But it is still useful to think about what role some kind of peace operation – which is more likely to involve peace observers than fully fledged combat troops – could play if such a settlement does become feasible., A Chilly Reception for Poland’s Proposal, While the war continues unabated, there is little chance of a successful international deployment to mitigate the conflict. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which previously oversaw a civilian monitoring mission in Ukraine, withdrew its international personnel in February and early March. Prior the Polish gambit, some commentators had suggested that UN peacekeepers deploy to protect Ukraine’s nuclear plants, but Russia insisted there was no need for UN involvement., The Polish proposal for a “peace mission” under NATO or “some wider international structure” followed a visit by the Polish, Slovenian and Czech prime ministers to Kyiv to show solidarity with Ukraine on 15 March. Poland’s influential Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, who joined the trip, championed the peacekeeping idea upon his return. Details of the proposed operation have been rather scant, although a government spokesman in Warsaw did specify that it should deploy only in those parts of Ukraine that are not under Russian control. U.S. advocates of the idea, such as Jim Jeffrey, a former envoy for Syria, have suggested that NATO should focus on securing safe havens in the west of Ukraine., While some NATO members, such as Denmark, expressed interest in the proposal, a number of key players in the alliance responded unenthusiastically. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield underlined that the U.S. would not participate. Czech Defence Minister Jana Černochová also poured cold water on the idea, suggesting that a UN blue helmet mission would be preferable. Hungary has explicitly threatened to block the proposal., The reasons for this chilly response are clear. Russia attempted to justify its assault on Ukraine by claiming that NATO had plans to absorb the country, and Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy has conceded that Kyiv may need to accept permanent neutrality. Putin also warned that outside actors who intervened in the conflict would face “consequences greater than any [they] have faced” in history. The deployment of a NATO-flagged mission – or an independent multinational force largely made up of troops from NATO members – would look like a deliberate challenge to Moscow. The Kremlin has admonished that such an operation would be “very reckless and extremely dangerous”., But while the Polish initiative will almost certainly fizzle, there is a case for thinking through how peace operations at the lighter end of the spectrum – such as civilian or military monitoring teams to support a ceasefire – could be useful in Ukraine in the future., What Peacekeepers Can Do, Peace operations exist on a spectrum ranging from civilian peace observation to very robust peace enforcement operations, such as those NATO deployed to Kosovo and Afghanistan. As NATO troops discovered in the Afghan case – and NATO forces in Ukraine would probably discover at even greater cost – the line between robust peace maintenance and war fighting can be dangerously blurry. As for “lighter” missions – ie, ones that are less reliant on military force to reach their goals – it is important to be clear-eyed about what they can achieve. Unarmed or lightly armed observers can facilitate the implementation of a ceasefire and political agreement, if both sides want such deals to succeed, or flag warning signs that one side or another is deliberately breaking its commitments. Of course, Russia and Ukraine are not near this point yet, but it is possible to consider a scenario in which Kyiv and Moscow strike some sort of tentative bargain and need help to make it stick., There have been on-and-off discussions of peacekeeping in Ukraine since the initial crises over Crimea and Donbas eight years ago, although today’s war has rendered most previous proposals irrelevant. The OSCE launched its Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) in Ukraine in 2014, during the initial turmoil over Russia’s occupation of Crimea. The SMM was an unarmed civilian mission, involving 1,400 international and local staff at its peak, that gained a solid reputation for impartial reporting on the fighting. It also succeeded in negotiating local truces to allow authorities to undertake tasks such as repairing water supply infrastructure., But Ukrainian officials and their allies also sought to gauge interest in proposals for a more robust international presence. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko floated the idea of a UN force in Donbas in 2015. There was a brief moment of excitement in Kyiv and Western capitals in 2017, when Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that he might also be open to a UN mission in Ukraine, although Russian diplomats in New York followed up with only a thin proposal for lightly armed UN guards to accompany SMM monitors. The Trump administration pursued talks with Russia on options for a UN deployment in 2018, and a number of conflict resolution organisations, including Crisis Group, developed proposals for what such a mission might look like in 2017 and 2018. Some were distinctly ambitious, envisaging forces of 20,000 or more troops and police – under UN command or at least with a UN mandate – in Donbas to oversee reintegration of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics into Ukraine., In retrospect, all this effort was worthy but probably futile. As Crisis Group noted in December 2017, U.S. and Russian officials were able to discuss the tenets of peacekeeping but “U.S. diplomats admit that it is easier to agree on principles with Russia than concrete measures”. Moscow’s real level of interest was never clear. And while it was easy to sketch plans for forces of 20,000 troops on paper, some of the nations the U.S. hoped would supply peacekeepers, such as Sweden and Finland, were distinctly queasy at the prospect of their personnel facing off against recalcitrant Russian forces. The whole idea gradually went away., Whatever value these earlier discussions of peacekeeping had at the time, many of the assumptions involved no longer hold. The starting points for most previous proposals for peace operations in Ukraine included the ideas that 1) Russia would support a deployment, in return for incentives such as sanctions relief, meaning that peacekeepers would at least in theory face only few potential spoilers; and 2) the operation would be confined to Donbas (Crimea was generally seen as off the table). On the basis of these notions, it seemed fair to assume that it would be possible to manage missions directly or indirectly via the UN Security Council. Most analysts accepted NATO could not be directly involved., The starting points for thinking about any peace operation in Ukraine are now very different. Russia’s war has spread far beyond Donbas, meaning that – depending on the course of the war and the circumstances when major hostilities cease – the area of operations for a peacekeeping mission might be far more extensive than previously envisioned. It is also hard to imagine, at least right now, achieving the level of cooperation between Russia and outside actors that would allow a mission to succeed. Officials in a number of Western capitals say that they have done some preliminary thinking about what a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine might look like, but caution that it is too early to do detailed planning for concrete operations. Veteran peacekeepers underline that all peace operations need to either serve an existing political settlement or (at a minimum) create space for the conflict parties to work out the terms of such a settlement. The deployment of international forces in situations where there is neither a real political process nor a settlement to support – as in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s – is normally a recipe for mission creep or mission failure, or both., There is no sign of when a cessation of hostilities will be possible in Ukraine, and what it will involve. Scenarios range from a situation in which Russia ceases hostilities holding onto large areas of Ukrainian territory indefinitely, to one in which Moscow agrees to relinquish the land that it has seized since late February. Moscow and Kyiv have also floated ideas – from the former proposing “demilitarisation” of Ukraine to the latter contemplating permanent members of the Security Council offering the country security guarantees – that could affect what international military or civilian peacekeeping mechanisms might eventually be feasible., Contingency Planning, While any serious planning efforts will have to wait, it is possible to do some basic contingency planning for what a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine might look like. This planning should focus on what will likely be the initial element of any deal: the monitoring, verification and facilitation of the halt to hostilities and ensuing disengagement of forces. (Complicating matters, conflict resolution experts distinguish between different types of arrangement for ending hostilities, ranging from brief truces to formal, long-term ceasefires, all the way to detailed political settlements. Formal ceasefires and peace agreements usually involve more robust verification mechanisms than temporary pauses in combat.), Should it be possible for Ukraine to strike a bargain to end the war with Russia, Kyiv will likely want reassurance that Moscow will fulfil the ceasefire terms. The Ukrainians will have good reason to worry about the credibility of any ceasefire. Russia could agree to a pause in combat solely to buy time to resupply and rotate its forces, prior to a renewal of hostilities. There is also a danger that, as after any period of intense fighting, individual units could attack their foes after a formal ceasefire. Or accidental clashes could escalate. An international presence could monitor and respond to such incidents, rather as UN, OSCE and European Union observers have variously monitored the front lines in places such as southern Lebanon and Georgia., Such monitoring does not necessarily demand the deployment of large forces, but rather lightweight observation teams. If the war was to halt with the battle lines as they stand, it would be exceptionally difficult for any external actor to establish and sustain a large-scale mission along all fronts. The UN has, for example, roughly 1,000 blue-helmeted troops patrolling the Golan Heights between Israel and Syria. They cover a disputed border that is around 65km in length, north to south. By contrast, the “southern front” alone in the current Russian-Ukrainian war – running from Kherson to Mariupol – is over 400km long. A Golan-type operation in Ukraine would be untenable. Any observation mission would need to be able to cover large areas lightly, deploy teams to investigate security incidents quickly, and pass messages between the Russian and Ukrainian field commanders. There are lessons to draw from the pre-war activities of the SMM, which used drones to watch areas its monitors could not, and the UN has experimented with similar technologies elsewhere in recent years., Who could pull together such a lightweight, flexible observation mission at short notice? One option, as Crisis Group has noted, is to hold the old SMM on standby. OSCE members need to agree on the mission’s future mandate before March ends, but one option is to put it into formal “hibernation” – preserving it as a legal entity even as its operations remain paused – to allow for its rapid reactivation. It is, however, possible that Ukraine, Russia or both will want military as well as civilian monitors to oversee a ceasefire. Foreign military officers have the operational advantage of thinking and speaking in similar terms to the soldiers they monitor – although former military personnel often take jobs in civilian missions, too – and come with the political blessing of their home countries. The OSCE does not specialise in even limited military missions. In contrast, the UN could, in technical terms, take on this role, as it has run military observation missions since the late 1940s., While often dismissed as slow-moving, the UN has proven able to start up lightweight missions quite rapidly in other crises. In 2012, for example, the UN was able to get 300 military observers and over 100 civilian staff to deploy across Syria in six weeks (although this episode became a cautionary tale about deploying a peace operation in unfavourable circumstances, as a spike in violence meant that they would be withdrawn almost as fast). With a sense of urgency, the UN should be able to manage a similarly rapid deployment across Ukraine. But political problems could easily kick in. A major one would be to identify military officers from states that both Moscow and Kyiv would trust. While Ukraine might like to see NATO nationals, Russia could argue that only personnel from non-aligned countries, or from post-Soviet states, should deploy. Potential candidates could be the Latin American states, which have a long history of peacekeeping, or perhaps the United Arab Emirates, which sent troops to help NATO in Afghanistan but has worked to maintain good ties with Russia during the current crisis. But even politically neutral UN member states might recoil from putting their personnel in harm’s way., Given the inevitable political headaches of working through multilateral bodies such as the OSCE and UN, a third option would be for Russia and Ukraine to dispense with these organisations. International legal expert Marc Weller has suggested that Moscow and Kyiv sign a peace agreement mandating a “mixed commission” of Russian and Ukrainian officers chaired by a mutually acceptable third-country representative to oversee ceasefire and disengagement issues. An arrangement of this type would not only sidestep multilateral nuisances, but also require a very small number of foreign military personnel., It is too early to say which, if any, of these ideas will prove of value if and when a cessation of hostilities is possible in Ukraine. In the interim, national and international officials in concerned countries can take certain prudential steps to prepare for the *possibility *of peace observation in Ukraine – including the “hibernation” of the SMM and quiet planning in UN headquarters for military observation. Defence staffs in countries that might contribute to any mission should prepare rosters of military personnel and civilian experts with Russian and Ukrainian language skills and/or previous tours of duty with UN observation missions., The international response to the war in Ukraine and its eventual aftermath will extend far beyond observation or peacekeeping. The UN and other agencies are already involved in risky humanitarian missions. If peace is possible, post-conflict reconstruction will require immense investments by the EU, international financial institutions and other actors. Peacekeeping may prove to be a small part of this mix of international efforts or no part of it all. There is a natural tendency in moments of crisis to raise the idea of “peacekeeping” in a vague way, much as Poland has done. In the case of Ukraine, it would be unwise to invest too much hope in the prospects for peace operations. But it would be smart for those who might be called upon to launch a mission to begin getting their options in good order now.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/tentative-first-look-options-peace-operations-ukraine

More than half of Ukraine’s children displaced after one month of war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",24 Mar 2022,"Ongoing violence across the country has created a child rights crisis that could last for generations, NEW YORK/GENEVA/KYIV, 24 March 2022 – One month of war in Ukraine has led to the displacement of 4.3 million children – more than half of the country’s estimated 7.5 million child population. This includes more than 1.8 million children who have crossed into neighbouring countries as refugees and 2.5 million who are now internally displaced inside Ukraine., “The war has caused one of the fastest large-scale displacements of children since World War II,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come. Children’s safety, wellbeing and access to essential services are all under threat from non-stop horrific violence.”, According to OHCHR, 78 children have been killed, and 105 have been injured in Ukraine since the start of the war on 24 February. Yet these figures represent only those reports that the UN has been able to confirm, and the true toll is likely far higher., The war has also had devastating consequences on civilian infrastructure and access to basic services., The World Health Organisation (WHO), for example, has reported 52 attacks impacting health care facilities across the country over the last four weeks, while Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science has reported damage to more than 500 education facilities. An estimated 1.4 million people now lack access to safe water, while 4.6 million people have limited access to water or are at risk of being cut off. Over 450,000 children aged 6 to 23 months need complementary food support., UNICEF has already observed a reduction in vaccination coverage for routine and childhood immunizations, including measles and polio. This could quickly lead to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, especially in overcrowded areas where people are sheltering from the violence., “In just a few weeks, the war has wrought such devastation for Ukraine’s children,” said Russell. “Children urgently need peace and protection. They need their rights. UNICEF continues to appeal for an immediate cease-fire and for the protection of children from harm. Essential infrastructure on which children depend, including hospitals, schools and buildings sheltering civilians, must never come under attack.”, UNICEF and its partners are working to reach children in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries with humanitarian assistance., In Ukraine, UNICEF has delivered medical supplies to 49 hospitals in 9 regions – including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Lviv – improving access to healthcare for 400,000 mothers, newborns and children. UNICEF continues to distribute water and hygiene items in communities under siege. In addition, UNICEF is increasing the number of mobile child protection teams working inside acute conflict zones from 22 to 50 and has delivered 63 trucks of lifesaving supplies to support the needs of over 2.2 million people. In the coming weeks, UNICEF will start emergency cash transfers to the most vulnerable families and establish child-friendly spaces in key locations across the country., To protect and support the millions of children and families who have fled Ukraine, UNICEF and UNHCR in partnership with governments and civil society organizations, have created “Blue Dots,” one-stop safe spaces for children and women. ‘Blue Dots’ provide key information to travelling families, help to identify unaccompanied and separated children and ensure their protection. They also provide a hub for essential services. ‘Blue Dots’ have already been established in countries hosting Ukrainian children and women and are being scaled up over the coming days, including more than 20 in Poland., Despite intensive efforts to ensure safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, significant challenges remain in the most affected areas across the country., Media contacts, Christopher Tidey

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Mar 2022,"Voices from the Field, Sasha, a long-time staff member of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) from Mariupol, Ukraine, describes life in the city as it was encircled and bombarded by Russian forces. For security reasons, he is using only his first name., I was born in Mariupol, and I have spent my whole life in Mariupol. I studied and worked and had a good time in Mariupol. And when MSF hired me, I was happy to do meaningful work too. Life was good in Mariupol., But suddenly it became real hell., At first, none of us could believe what was happening, because in our times, this sort of thing just shouldn't happen. We didn't expect a war and we didn't expect bombs. We thought it was just talk on TV and that someone would stop this madness from happening. When I realised that it was actually becoming real, I felt sick -- so sick that I couldn't eat for three days., In the beginning, things almost seemed more or less normal, even though we knew that nothing really was normal anymore. But then the bombings started and the world we had known existed no more. Our lives became weaved between the bombs and missiles falling from the sky, destroying everything. We could think of nothing else and we could feel nothing else. The days of the week stopped to have any meaning, I couldn't tell whether it was Friday or Saturday, it was all just one long nightmare. My sister tried to keep count of the days, but for me it was all a blur., In the first few days, we fortunately managed to donate some of MSF’s remaining medical supplies to an emergency department in Mariupol, but when the electricity and phone network went down, we couldn’t contact our colleagues anymore and we couldn’t carry out any work. The bombing started and became worse each day. Our days then consisted of trying to stay alive and trying to find a way out., How can one describe one’s home becoming a place of terror? There were new cemeteries all over town, in almost all neighbourhoods. Even in the little yard of the kindergarten near my house, where children should be playing. How can this past ever bring a future for our children? How can we take more pain and sadness? Each day is like losing your whole life., In Mariupol, I was moved to see so many people helping others, with everyone seeming to always worry for someone else and never for themselves. Mothers worried for their children and children worried for the parents. I worried for my sister – she was so stressed because of the bombings that I thought her heart would stop. Her fitness watch showed 180 heart beats per minute and I was so worried to see her like this., I told her it would be stupid if she were to die from fear in the midst of all this! With time, she adapted more and instead of freezing with fear during the shelling, she told me about all the different hiding places she could think of. I was still extremely worried about her and it was clear that I needed to get her out of there., The bombing started and became worse each day. Our days then consisted of trying to stay alive and trying to find a way out.
SASHA, MSF STAFF MEMBER FROM MARIUPOL, We moved three times, to find the most secure place. We were lucky, as we ended up staying with an amazing group of people that I now consider my family. History has already proven that humankind survives when staying together and helping each other. I saw this with my own eyes and it really moved me, I was also moved to see how brave people were, or how brave they had to be. I remember one family cooking in the street outside their home. Just a few metres from their fire were two big holes in the ground from shells which had struck another family just a few days before., I was touched to see how people cling to life and what is good. On International Women’s Day on 8 March, we decided to celebrate it despite everything. We rang the neighbours and they invited their friends. Someone found one bottle of champagne and someone even made a cake with only half the ingredients of the recipe available. We even managed to put on a few minutes of music. For half an hour, we really felt the celebration and it felt good to be happy and laugh again. We even joked that this nightmare would end., But it continued and it seemed like it would never stop., We tried to leave every day but there were so many rumours about what was happening and what was not, we started to think it would never happen. One day, we heard that a convoy was going leave and we scrambled into my old car and rushed to find the departure point. We told as many people as we could, but now I am filled with sadness when I think of the ones I couldn’t tell. It all went so fast and we couldn’t call anyone because there was no phone network., The departure was a giant mess and panic with lots of cars going in all sorts of directions. We saw a car that had so many people in it that it was impossible to count them, their faces were pushed to the window screens. I don’t know how they made it out, but I hope they did. We had no map and we worried we would take the wrong direction, but somehow, we chose the right one and we made it out of Mariupol., It was only as we tried to leave Mariupol that I realised things were actually worse than I originally thought. It turns out I was lucky to shelter in part of the city that was relatively spared, but on the way out I saw so much destruction and sorrow. We saw giant craters among apartment blocks, destroyed supermarkets, medical facilities and schools, even destroyed shelters where people had sought safety., We are safe for now, but we don’t know what the future will hold. When I finally got access to the internet, I was shocked to see pictures of my beloved city in flames and my fellow citizens under rubble. In the news, I read about the shelling of Mariupol theatre, where many families with children had sought shelter and I just I can’t find the words to describe how that made me feel. I can only question why.
SASHA, MSF STAFF MEMBER FROM MARIUPOL, “We had no choice but to leave many loved ones behind. The thought of them and others still there is hard to bear. My heart aches with worry for my family. I tried to go back to bring them out, but I failed to do so. Now I have no news from them."", The people who are together will have a better chance to survive, but there are so many who are on their own. The ones that are old and frail cannot walk for kilometres to find water and food. How will they make it?, We had no choice but to leave so many loved ones behind. The thought of them and all the others still there is hard to bear. My heart aches with worry for my family. I tried to go back in to bring them out, but I failed to do so. Now I have no news from them., I can’t stop thinking of an old lady we met in the street two weeks ago. She was not walking well and her glasses were broken, so she couldn’t see much either. She pulled out a small mobile phone and asked if we could charge it for her. I tried to do it on my car battery, but I didn’t succeed. I told her that the phone network was down and that she would not be able to call anyone even if she had battery., “I know I will not be able to call anyone,” she said. “But perhaps one day someone will want to call me.” I realised that she was on her own and that all her hopes were hanging on the phone. Maybe someone is trying to call her. Maybe my family is trying to call me. We do not know., It’s almost one month since this nightmare began and the situation gets worse every day. People in Mariupol die each day because of shelling, bombing and due to the lack of all basic needs – food, water, healthcare. Innocent civilians struggle through unbearable conditions and hardships every day, every hour and every minute. Just a small part of them have managed to escape, but a huge number are still there, hiding in destroyed buildings or in basements of ruined houses without any type of support from outside., Why does all this still happen to innocent people? To what extent will humanity let this disaster continue?",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/bombs-over-mariupol-each-day-losing-your-whole-life

We are determined to defend our shared values and the rules-based international system. We are committed to the advancement of human rights, gender equality and inclusion, and the protection of fundamental freedoms. We call on Russia to stop its attacks on Ukraine immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces and all military equipment from Ukraine, and call on Belarus to stop facilitating and supporting Russia's invasion., Humanitarian support, We stand by the brave and resilient Ukrainian people as they defend their homeland against Russian aggression and as they suffer from the Russian military's indiscriminate and illegal attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. We abhor Russia's grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and will support all war crimes investigations in this regard. We urge Russia to ensure unhindered humanitarian access and permanent safe passage for civilians. We will continue to cooperate closely in the delivery of our humanitarian assistance within and outside Ukraine, and in support of a coordinated international response. The European Commission welcomes Canada's exploration of avenues to work with the European Emergency Response Coordination Centre and the Civil Protection Mechanism hubs in Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to help channel assistance to Ukraine., Refugees, The European Union has generously welcomed almost three and a half million Ukrainians fleeing Russia's violence, providing them food, shelter, school, and employment opportunities, paying particular attention to the plight of children and providing them protection for the time they need. Canada has launched the Canada-Ukraine authorization for emergency travel (CUAET) as part of the Government of Canada's broader support forthe people of Ukraine. The European Commission and Canada will continue to coordinate further support for those who have been forced to flee Ukraine, as well as the assistance to Ukraine's neighbours most affected., Sanctions, The EU and Canada have already adopted, in close transatlantic cooperation, unprecedented restrictive measures to impose massive costs on Russia for its military aggression against Ukraine. Canada and the EU have closely coordinated on severe sanctions against Russian and Belarussian officials who facilitated Russia's aggression; disconnecting key Russian banks from SWIFT; the closing of our air spaces; the banning of transactions with the Russian Central Bank, and; the reduction of dependencies to Russian energy commodities. The EU and Canada have commonly suspended Belarus' accession at the WTO. The Russian regime is paying a severe economic price for its heinous attacks, to the detriment of its people and their future., Together with our G7 partners and many others, Canada and the European Commission, within the framework of its competences, will further strengthen these sanctions and continue to degrade Russia's economic, industrial, technological and innovative potential by supporting the extension of restrictive measures on trade, in the financial sector and beyond. In this context, Canada and the European Commission, in line with its competences, will work to further step up enforcement and the fight against sanctions evasion., Green transition, We reconfirm our joint commitment to accelerating the global transition to a green, carbon-neutral future and emphasise the urgency of addressing climate change, including through diligent implementation of commitments made at COP26. We further agree that carbon pricing is an efficient, cost-effective and powerful tool to reduce emissions and drive clean innovation. We recognize each other's leadership in this area and commit to work together to engage international partners in expanding global carbon pricing coverage., We will continue to deliver on our climate finance commitments to support developing countries adapt to climate change and achieve their climate goals. We will also work together to ensure an ambitious outcome of the negotiations of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and remain committed to the transition towards more resource-efficient and circular economies., Energy cooperation, We will deepen our cooperation towards a net-zero energy transition, including by taking concrete steps in our energy cooperation to enhancesecurity of supply and work to eliminate the EU and its Member States' dependence on Russian energy. A dedicated working group on green transition and LNG is being created to develop a concrete action plan on these matters, and our officials will meet this week to further discuss enhancing energy-related cooperation., We remain committed to organizing a Clean Tech Summit in Canada in 2022 to promote our shared commitment to the green transition of our economies, while at the same time helping to promote our energy security, currently under such threat from Vladimir Putin's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine*.*, Safe, Secure Supply Chains, including for Critical Raw Materials, Building on the strong foundation of trusted trade provided by the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), we will work to ensure open and reliable supply chains between and among our businesses. We underline the importance of our joint commitment, as set out under the Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials, to ensure the security of critical minerals and metals value chains and supply, including reducing dependence on Russian minerals and metals, with a view to facilitating the transition to a climate-neutral economy., Democracy, Cybersecurity and Countering Disinformation, President Putin's attack on Ukraine amounts to an unprecedented attack on democratic principles and the rules-based international system. It has also underscored the need for democracies to strengthen international cooperation and coordination to stand up against authoritarianism and to develop new approaches to promote and protect democracies around the world., We are committed to advancing our cooperation on hybrid threats such as cybersecurity, both in response to Russia's aggression and longer-term objectives. Together, we will enhance efforts to coordinate assistance to the Governments of Ukraine and Moldova related to cyber resilience and defence, Internet access and countering disinformation, working with EU Member States and other likeminded partners, and through the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism., We will seek to reinforce further responsible state behavior in cyberspace and work together with the aim to increase cyber resilience in the face of destructive, disruptive, and destabilizing cyber activity by both states and non-state actors and to hold accountable those responsible for such activity., We further reconfirm our joint commitment to pursue deepened cooperation on ethical artificial intelligence, safe and secure data flows as well as digital credentials through agile regulation and joint standards., Food Security, We are very concerned about the food crisis caused by President Putin's war in Ukraine and we are committed to working together to address the immediate and long-term impacts of the war on global agriculture supply chains and food security. We recognize that the impacts will be felt more strongly by the most vulnerable countries, including those already facing humanitarian crisis. We will work together to support humanitarian partners, such as the World Food Program, to help meet the emergency food and nutrition needs of the growing number of acutely food insecure people. We should also work with international partners to support vulnerable countries to enhance the resilience of their agriculture and food systems to conflict, climate and economic shocks., Despite the many challenges we are facing together at present, it is important to acknowledge key milestones, including the 5th anniversary this fall of the provisional application of CETA and the Strategic Partnership Agreement. Both agreements have brought clear and concrete benefits to Europeans and Canadians, and we look forward to full ratification. The dialogue and cooperation on all major geopolitical and global economic, energy and environmental issues in the period up to and at the next Canada-EU Leaders' Summit, should be continued., Press contact, Eric MAMER Phone +32 2 299 40 73 Mail eric.mamer@ec.europa.eu, Dana SPINANT Phone +32 2 299 01 50 Mail dana.spinant@ec.europa.eu",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-president-von-der-leyen-and-prime-minister-trudeau
Ukraine: 1 month of conflict and devastating global implications on food security,News and Press Release,CARE,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",24 Mar 2022,"While early projections for 2022 predicted a record number of 274 million people in need for humanitarian assistance and protection around the world, these figures, however, did not include the staggering ripple effects of the fastest growing refugee crises in one of the world's food baskets. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for about 12% of total calories traded in the world, and they are both among the top five global exporters for many important cereals and oilseeds, including wheat, barley, sunflowers and maize., With the upcoming planting season around the corner (mid-March through mid-May), ongoing fighting in Ukraine and a wide-scaled mass displacement, farmers' inability to access their fields to plant their crops will disrupt food supply chains., Less food, higher prices, more need, less aid, While the disruption of the global supply chain directly affects countries that are depending heavily on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine, such as Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Sudan, the increasing prices on the world markets are felt globally as they impact the most vulnerable households which already need most of their income for food., ""To grasp the dramatic consequences, we have to understand that many of those countries already suffering from humanitarian crises will be amongst those hardest hit. Yemen alone imports 90% of its food staples, and half of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Already before the conflict in Ukraine, 17.4 million people in Yemen were experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, including 2.2 million children who are acutely malnourished"", explains Delphine Pinault, CARE's humanitarian advocacy coordinator., Consequences are already felt in Lebanon, which imports 66% of its wheat from Ukraine and 12% from Russia and where wheat reserves are expected to only last one more month (as of mid-March). ""The war in Ukraine risks having consequences far beyond its borders. In Lebanon, for more than a week now, bakeries have been rationing bread, an essential product for feeding the poorest. Last Monday, the price of a bag of bread increased by 20%"", warns Bujar Hoxha, director of CARE in Lebanon., In Somalia, where over 90% of wheat supplies come from Russia and Ukraine, the price of wheat and oil has already risen by 300%. Iman Abdullahi, CARE Somalia Country Director said, ""With the supply chain interrupted, we are concerned about what will happen when current supplies run out. We are already seeing an increase in the number of hungry and malnourished women and children arriving at the fixed health facilities and mobile teams we are operating in."", Maureen Miruka, CARE Kenya Country Director said, ""There has also been an increase of 48 % in gas which is widely used for cooking. Farming, which employs 40 % of the population, depends on fertilizer imported from Russia. The Ministry of Agriculture has reported that the already increasing prices could go up by 70 %. In a country that is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns, people are worried about what the future holds. We are concerned about the continued increase in the cost of living and the knock-on effects it will have on the communities we work in. Women stand to be affected the most. Whenever incomes in homes are negatively impacted, we have always noted an increase in gender-based violence against women. A continued decrease of food available for families affects in particular women and girls as all too often they will be the last to eat."", Double effect of price hikes, ""While the number of communities and individuals running short on food keeps growing, humanitarian organizations face a very similar problem: how do we fill the widening gap and empower communities to become self-sufficient, while the same amount of public and private donations buys less and less goods?"", asks Pinault. ""It is our hope and plea that, while the impressive solidarity with the people directly affected by the crises in Ukraine can be upheld, humanitarian relief does not have to be cut back on other dramatic crises situations."", About CARE: Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE has more than seven decades of experience helping people prepare for disasters, providing lifesaving assistance when a crisis hits, and helping communities recover after the emergency has passed.

"One month after the start of the war, Caritas Internationalis urges for peace in Ukraine and not to lose sight of the humanitarian consequences at an international level",News and Press Release,Caritas,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Mar 2022,"Exactly one month after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, Caritas Internationalis urges for an end to the hostilities and to guarantee unhindered humanitarian assistance. “Political interests cannot continue to prevail at the expense of an entire people in dire need of humanitarian assistance. We join the Holy Father’s repeated appeals for the “abhorrent” war in Ukraine to end immediately and for an end to the suffering of the population through a peaceful solution,” says Aloysius John, Caritas Internationalis secretary general. The Confederation of 162 national Caritas organisations worldwide also stresses the importance of taking into account the dramatic impact of the conflict in Ukraine in countries where crises have been going on for months and years and are now sadly forgotten., The toll of the first month of the war in Ukraine is at least 2,421 civilian victims, 3,389,044 refugees – including at least 1.5 million children – and nearly 6.5 million internally displaced persons., “The two Ukrainian Caritas organisations – Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes-Ukraine – had stood by the people from the very first moments and have never abandoned them even when, as in the case of Mariupol, heavy bombing forced the closure of some local centres.”, So far, Caritas has provided humanitarian assistance to several hundred thousand people only in Ukraine, with more than **23,500 meals and 5,100 personal hygiene kits **distributed every day. All Caritas organisations in neighbouring countries – including Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Moldova – are at the frontline in assisting the millions of refugees fleeing the war, supported by other members of the Caritas Confederation., Caritas and the Church are among the few remaining organisations to stand by the Ukrainian population, and their grassroots presence enables them to reach even very remote areas of conflict. “This is why our Confederation urges States and international agencies to support NGOs and faith-based organisations on the frontline to respond to the humanitarian crisis and deliver most of the aid and ensure protection in Ukraine”., Caritas Internationalis asks the parties involved to guarantee safe evacuation of vulnerable groups, especially children, women, elderly and people with disabilities. Assistance must be provided to people in need and refugees without any kind of discrimination on the basis of nationality., Caritas Internationalis also reiterates its call for the protection of the women and children on the move who represent around 90% of the refugees fleeing Ukraine and who are at great risk of becoming victims of human trafficking. It has been reported, also by local Caritas organisations, that there are organised crime groups on both sides of the border and in the host countries. Victims are often misled by the offer of transport to other countries and accommodation in private homes. Caritas organisations and NGOs active at the borders are already mobilising their anti-trafficking network to monitor the situation and protect vulnerable people. “We strongly recommend that States implement and strengthen safeguarding and protection mechanisms to protect migrant from human traffickers,” adds John., Finally, the Confederation urges that we do not forget the severe consequences that the Ukrainian conflict has and will have in many countries around the world where severe crises are already taking place. “The war in Ukraine will have a dramatic impact in terms of food insecurity. For example, in Syria, the price of a staple food like bread has skyrocketed. If COVID-19 increased the number of people in the world at risk of starvation by 130 million, this war is likely to increase the number of people at risk of starvation by the same number, if not more.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/one-month-after-start-war-caritas-internationalis-urges-peace-ukraine-and-not-lose

"Security Council Fails to Adopt Text Demanding Civilian Protection, Unhindered Humanitarian Access in Ukraine, as 13 Members Abstain",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",23 Mar 2022,"SC/14838, SECURITY COUNCIL
9002ND MEETING (AM), 2 Vote in Favour, None against, with Delegates Denouncing Draft as Attempt by Moscow to Justify Aggression against Neighbour, The Security Council failed today to adopt a draft resolution that would have demanded civilian protection in Ukraine and called for unhindered access for humanitarian assistance, as several delegates rejected the text as an attempt by the Russian Federation to justify its aggression against its neighbour., Tabled by the Russian Federation, the draft was defeated by a vote of 2 in favour (China, Russian Federation) to none against, with 13 abstentions. It was the Council’s third vote since 24 February (See Press Releases SC/14808 and SC/14809) and would have needed nine votes in favour with no veto to pass. Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria joined the Russian Federation in submitting the text., By its terms, the Council would have demanded that civilians are fully protected, that all parties ensure respect for and protection of all medical and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in their medical duties; that they respect international law in connection with objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population; and allow safe and unhindered passage to destinations outside Ukraine, including for foreign nationals, without discrimination., After the vote, the Russian Federation’s delegate said the action exposed all those for whom politicization of the humanitarian dossier is more important than delivering aid to vulnerable people. The absence of a resolution will only complicate the lives of humanitarians on the ground and allow Kyiv to ignore calls for a ceasefire, he argued. “Kyiv will continue to use civilians as human shields and to deploy heavy weaponry near hospitals and kindergartens,” he cautioned, adding that the Russian Federation will attempt to resolve humanitarian issues, as it has done in Donbass, “whose suffering you prefer to forget”., However, several delegates denounced the draft as an attempt to hide a brutal campaign of aggression., The representative of the United States described as “unconscionable” the Russian Federation’s attempt to submit a draft requesting that the international community resolve a humanitarian crisis that it alone created. “To state the obvious, Russia does not care about the deteriorating humanitarian conditions and the millions of lives and dreams the war has shattered,” she emphasized, in explanation of her delegation’s abstention. She denounced the Russian Federation’s attempt to make the Council complicit in its “flimsy fabrications”, pointing out that the draft makes no mention of its role as the sole cause of the crisis., France’s representative agreed, declaring: “This manoeuvre is not fooling anyone.” Recalling that his country and Mexico negotiated a humanitarian draft in good faith, he said they then decided to take it to the General Assembly, given the Russian Federation’s obstruction., Mexico’s delegate added that, after that was announced on 14 March, “strangely enough”, the Russian Federation decided to present an alternative text. He explained that his delegation abstained today because the draft attempts to change the meaning of certain paragraphs negotiated by the delegations of Mexico and France. It also lacks references to Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations — on the prohibition or threat of use of force on a State’s territorial integrity or political independence — and to an unequivocal cessation of hostilities., China’s delegate explained that his delegation’s support for the draft was based on its call for the international community to attach high importance to the humanitarian situation, and for the parties to coordinate on protecting civilians. He urged the parties to focus on the humanitarian issue, transcend political differences and do their best to seek consensus., At the meeting’s outset, the Council observed a moment of silence in memory of Madeleine K. Albright, former Secretary of State of the United States, who died today., Also speaking today were representatives of the United Kingdom, Albania, Ghana, Mexico, Ireland, Norway, Brazil, Gabon and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 5:07 p.m. and ended at 6:01 p.m., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) welcomed the initiative of Mexico and France in submitting a humanitarian resolution on the situation in Ukraine, a hope dashed by colleagues from the United Kingdom and the United States, who described it as unnecessary. The Council instead began a policy of mutual recrimination and accusations, he said, adding that Western countries alleged, in an unsubstantiated manner, that the Council cannot adopt a humanitarian draft on Ukraine as submitted by the Russian Federation. Categorically rejecting such a premise, he noted that his delegation is submitting a draft on the basis of the France-Mexico text, which is not politicized, and in that way, is analogous to other humanitarian drafts, he emphasized. Rather than continuing to capitalize on the issue, Council members should adopt a text that will provide an important framework work for humanitarian efforts, he said., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said the Russian Federation is using the Council to provide cover for its brutal actions. It is “unconscionable” that it would have the audacity to submit a draft resolution requesting that the international community resolve a humanitarian crisis that it alone created, she emphasized. Explaining that the United States will abstain from voting, she said: “To state the obvious, Russia does not care about the deteriorating humanitarian conditions and the millions of lives and dreams the war has shattered.” She reiterated: “Russia is the aggressor, the attacker, the invader, the sole party in Ukraine engaged in a campaign of brutality against the people of Ukraine.”, Noting that the Russian Federation is asking the Council to pass a resolution that does not acknowledge its own culpability, she pointed out that the world has seen images of millions of women and children fleeing for their lives; of bloodied pregnant women being carried out of the rubble; of the shelling of kindergartens, orphanages and humanitarian corridors; and attacks hitting apartment buildings, gas and water pipelines and a nuclear power plant. There are also images of people being shot while waiting in bread lines, journalists being killed in crossfire, and shelling by President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces that killed a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor in Kharkiv, she said, adding that, if the Council believes Moscow’s disinformation, “these are all movie sets, with actors”., Recalling that the United States warned for a third time on 22 March that the Russian Federation could use chemical or biological weapons, she said: “Mark my words, Russia will continue to be held accountable for what it is doing to the people in Ukraine.” It is attempting to make the Council complicit in its flimsy fabrications by putting forward a resolution that makes no mention of its role as the sole cause of this crisis, she noted, affirming: “We will play no part in that.”, She went on to accuse the Russian Federation of blocking the Council from carrying out its mandate, stressing that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine, as do the majority of United Nations Member States. The Russian Federation’s efforts to deny the truth will continue to fail, she predicted. Quoting Madeleine K. Albright, her country’s former Secretary of State who died today, she said: “Take it from someone who fled the Iron Curtain. I know what happens when you give the Russians the green light.” That is what the Council will do today if it passes this resolution, she warned., The Council then failed to adopt the draft resolution by a vote of 2 in favour (China**,** Russian Federation) to none against, with 13 abstentions., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said the text just rejected was a manoeuvre to justify the aggression against Ukraine. “They are taking Russia and the Russian economy into a war they didn’t search for,” he said, adding that Moscow now seeks to instrumentalize the Council in that effort. Should the Russian Federation really want to help Ukraine’s people, it only need end its war, he pointed out, emphasizing: “This manoeuvre is not fooling anyone.” He affirmed that the Council will not allow itself to be used in that way. He went on to explain that, while the delegations of France and Mexico negotiated a humanitarian draft in good faith, they decided to bring it before the General Assembly — and not to call a vote in the Council — in light of the Russian Federation’s obstruction., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), noting that with more than 100,000 people in the city of Mariupol are now living under a “medieval siege”, the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is not in doubt as its people endure a “living hell”. Meanwhile, skyrocketing food, energy and fertilizer prices worldwide threaten to spiral into a global hunger crisis, he said. Against that backdrop, the United Kingdom will not vote for any resolution that does not recognize the Russian Federation as the sole cause of the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe “and therefore, the key to ending it”, she emphasized. The draft tabled by Moscow’s delegation today called on all parties to uphold international law, ignoring the Russian Federation’s responsibility for violating it, she pointed out, adding that it also ignores the fact that it is that country bombing homes, schools and other civilian facilities. The General Assembly will soon vote on a text that makes clear that the only way to end the crisis is for Moscow to end its war, she asserted, stressing that “our first allegiance is to the human race”., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the war has been unjustified, unprovoked and illegal from the first and is becoming deadlier every day, adding that, Mariupol, which is being pummelled block by block, is the true face that the Russian Federation is presenting to the world. Emphasizing that the international community is aware of the genuine cause of the devastating humanitarian crisis, he said the Russian Federation does not need to call for a ceasefire or protection of civilians when its actions are the root cause. “We did not fall for such a trap,” or for the mockery just demonstrated by the voting result, he added. Calling upon the Russian Federation to “withdraw its troops, pack and go home”, he described that State as the sole and unique cause of the humanitarian crisis, asserting that, due to its obsession, cannot share responsibility with the victim Ukraine or anyone else. He stated that the text, with its misleading title is a mountain of hypocrisy, spineless and useless, which is why his delegation did not vote for it, he stressed., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) expressed concern over the humanitarian situation following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, and Ghana remains committed to any genuine effort to address the suffering of its people**.** His delegation abstained because the draft resolution does not speak to the settled position of the international community on the cause of this humanitarian catastrophe, nor to a requirement for an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities, the essential building blocks for a credible framework for humanitarian effort that is neutral, impartial and independent. While consensus on how to tackle the war in Ukraine has unfortunately eluded the Council, the United Nations is more than the work within the Council. He therefore hailed the bravery of the men and women in Ukraine, he noted, hailing the efforts of the Organization’s other entities in bringing hope to the many victims of the war, providing safe passage for civilians, and delivering food and medicine to those in critical need in cities under siege. He urged the parties to return to diplomacy and dialogue, prioritizing the safety of Ukraine’s people., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), explaining his delegation’s abstention, said that his country and France had carried out transparent consultations on a humanitarian draft that would have allowed the Council to assume its responsibilities in relation to the conflict in Ukraine. There was a frank exchange of positions aimed at arriving at a balanced text that could garner the necessary support, but after the consultations, it became clear that conditions were not in place to achieve agreement, he noted. “Strangely enough,” he said, after the 14 March announcement that Mexico and France would take their initiative to the General Assembly, the Russian Federation decided to present an alternative for a vote the following day. While the Russian delegation postponed the vote, its text does not consider any of Mexico’s positions, nor those of others, he noted, recalling that the text was “put into blue” on 16 March, with changes made to only two words. While it would appear that the draft contains elements of the original one submitted by Mexico and France, it attempts to change the meaning of certain paragraphs, he said, noting that the balance sought — which served as the basis for the text sent to the General Assembly — was excluded. He went on to point out that the text does not refer to Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations on the prohibition or threat of use of force on a State’s territorial integrity or political independence, nor does it refer to an unequivocal cessation of hostilities. A text so lacking does not respond to the reality on the ground nor to the pressing civilian needs, he stressed, further underscoring Mexico’s priority focus on humanitarian action, the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law., MARTIN GALLAGHER (Ireland) said his delegation abstained in the vote for one clear and simple reason: “The text tabled by the Russian Federation does nothing to ease the humanitarian suffering of the Ukrainian people.” Indeed, it failed to call for the very thing that would end civilian deaths, that would stop the destruction of Ukrainian cities and that would facilitate safe and unhindered evacuation of civilians and humanitarian access — an immediate end to hostilities. Describing the draft instead as a “cynical abuse of the multilateral system” by the aggressor, he stressed that, if Moscow wishes to take action to relieve the humanitarian suffering of the Ukrainian people, it should end the war now. Voicing regret that the Council has been prevented from acting by the Russian Federation, he added: “It is shameful that a permanent member of this Security Council has acted in this way.”, MONA JUUL (Norway) recalled that a party to a conflict cannot expect to be perceived as neutral. It should neither be the author of Council drafts nor participate in voting on the very same conflict to which it is a party. “No one can be in doubt of the Russian Federation’s status as a party,” she clarified. Yet, in meeting after meeting, it expects the Council to accept its accounts, reports and views, as if it is coming from a neutral place. For nearly a month, the Russian Federation has continued its reprehensible invasion of Ukraine. Civilians are being attacked, injured and killed — even as they try to flee to safety. “Homes, schools and hospitals are being bombed by Russia as we speak,” she affirmed. What is before the Council today is not a neutral, balanced humanitarian resolution. It is a distraction. The Russian Federation’s war is a clear violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, of international law and the very principles of the Charter of the United Nations. “If the Russian Federation cares about the protection of civilians in Ukraine, it can stop its senseless war,” she said. “They should do it now.”, RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said increasing reports of civilian casualties, including children, refugees and displaced people, reveal the deteriorating situation, adding that the Council should be able to address it despite differing political views. A truly consequential resolution on humanitarian issues should promote real help on the ground, help facilitate agreements, strengthen adherence to international humanitarian law, and promote the safe passage of civilians and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance, he affirmed. An end to hostilities is an integral part of any humanitarian effort and any Council resolution should be open to an inclusive discussion among its 15 members, with efforts to accommodate all views, he emphasized. While noting that today’s draft presents many important elements on the protection of civilians, he said it nonetheless lacks any reference to a cessation of hostilities — one reason why his delegation abstained. It also fails to recall the principles of proportionality, necessity and humanity, as well as the obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects, he added. Brazil will address any meaningful, inclusive and transparent initiatives, he affirmed, urging the parties to negotiate in good faith towards ending hostilities., ZHANG JUN (China) said the continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation and its spill-over effects have triggered widespread concern in the international community. It is heart-wrenching to witness rising casualties and serious shortfalls in humanitarian relief, he added, urging the Council to fulfil its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and play its due role in the humanitarian situation. China has put forward a six‑point initiative and provided several consignments of supplies to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Ukraine, he noted. Recalling the Council’s repeated consultations on the drafts proposed by France and Mexico, as well as the Russian Federation over the past few weeks, he called on all parties to focus on the humanitarian issue, transcend political differences and do their best to seek consensus. Expressing regret that the Council could not reach the broadest possible agreement in the end, he explained that his delegation’s vote in favour of the draft resolution was based on its call for the international community to attach high importance to the humanitarian situation, and for the parties to coordinate on protecting civilians, especially women, children and other vulnerable groups. China has always insisted that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, and their legitimate security concerns taken seriously, he emphasized, asserting that the key right now is for the parties to demonstrate political will, with the international community creating space for peace. He went on to stress that a long-term solution lies in abandoning the “cold war mentality” and refraining from “bloc confrontations”., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), emphasizing his country’s belief in the values underpinning the Geneva Conventions and its Additional Protocols, said they constitute the framework for humanitarian aspects that must not be combined with political posturing. Gabon abstained because humanitarian issues are dividing humanity and being instrumentalized for other purposes, he explained, underlining that they should instead be part of the social compact., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), thanking the draft resolution’s co-sponsors, said the vote exposed all those for whom politicization of the humanitarian dossier is more important than delivering aid to vulnerable people. Asking why the United States delegation chose to abstain, he said the true motivations were understood. Mexico’s delegate, meanwhile, made it seem as if the Russian Federation unexpectedly put the draft to the vote, he noted, clarifying that his delegation supported the Mexico-France draft, except for its politicized passages., The Russian Federation’s draft contained a call for the establishment of ceasefire and humanitarian pauses for the purpose of safe, unhindered evacuation of civilians, he said, adding that those expressing a desire to do so could leave without discrimination on any grounds. It also contained a call not to attack critical infrastructure or place heavy military equipment in densely populated areas, and for ensuring the protection of medical personnel, humane treatment for detainees and the protection of civilians. Yet, the Council refused to support the text for political reasons, he asserted. Instead, it heard that the Russian Federation is preparing to use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine. “This is an unimaginable accusation,” he emphasized. “Believe us, we have other means of warfare. We have no use for chemical or biological weapons,” he said, adding that his country destroyed them long ago., He went on to state that the absence of a resolution only complicates the lives of humanitarians on the ground and allows Kyiv to ignore calls for a ceasefire. “Kyiv will continue to use civilians as human shields and to deploy heavy weaponry near hospitals and kindergartens,” he said, adding that the Russian Federation will attempt to resolve humanitarian issues, as it has done in Donbass, “whose suffering you prefer to forget”. He cautioned against politicizing humanitarian issues, expressing regret that the Council could not adopt a text that would have resolved those challenges, saying the Russian Federation and all those genuinely interested will do their utmost to alleviate the plight of civilians., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates), Council President for March, spoke in her national capacity, welcoming the coordination among the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United Nations that recently led to the delivery of the first humanitarian convoy reaching Sumy, in eastern Ukraine. Nevertheless, there is also a crucial role for the Council to respond tangibly to the crisis, she noted. In that light, the delegation of the United Arab Emirates carefully studied the text presented by the Russian Federation, and supports some of its elements, she said, explaining that, ultimately, it abstained from voting because it would have liked to see a call for a nationwide cessation of hostilities. The continued fighting prevents the delivery of humanitarian aid, she added. Building on the dialogue that led to delivery of the Sumy convoy, agreement on other technical steps — such as civilian evacuation — is also needed. “The Council needs to rise to the occasion by adopting a dedicated compromise product that includes elements that we can all agree on,” she said, emphasizing that, whereas agreement was not possible today, the Council cannot abrogate its responsibility to help those needing help in Ukraine., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor a second time in response to the Russian Federation’s delegate, who asked why the United States failed to veto the draft, said such an action was not necessary. The text was not worthy of exercising that power, she added, declaring: “We don’t need this farcical resolution to provide humanitarian assistance.” She went on to note that the United States has so far provided upwards of $600 million to the people of Ukraine and will continue to do so., Mr. RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said he was taking the floor again as the Russian Federation’s representative had made a direct reference to his delegation, reiterating that his country remains open to frank dialogue towards solutions to the crisis, and on the best way for the Council to provide support and humanitarian assistance to those who need it most., For information media.

It covers the period from 3 p.m. (EET) 21 March to 12:00 p.m. (EET) 23 March. The next report will be published on or around 25 March., KEY FIGURES (FLASH APPEAL 2022), 12M people in need (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 6M people targeted (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), $1.1B funding required (US$) (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 41% funded (Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • As of 22 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 2,571 civilian casualties, including 977 killed, figures that are likely much higher and will continue to rise., • Between 24 February and 22 March, more than 650 residential buildings have been destroyed across Ukraine, while around 3,780 have suffered varying degrees of damages, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU).The extent of damages is likely more considerable, as insecurity prevents the assessment of damages., • As of 23 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) verified 64 attacks on health care in Ukraine, leading to 15 deaths and 37 injuries. In addition, according to the Ministry of Education and Science, 548 educational facilities have been damaged amid ongoing hostilities, 72 of which have been destroyed., • On 22 March, the Government of Ukraine issued a resolution amending the rules for delivering humanitarian aid from abroad, which cancels the majority of requirements for bringing in relief items. Furthermore, 14 European countries have agreed to a permission-free transit of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. These developments are expected to further facilitate the timely delivery of life-saving assistance to Ukraine., • According to the President of Ukraine, over the last two weeks, Ukraine has received over 100,000 tons of humanitarian aid from various actors and countries. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported that as of 23 March, 4,554 tons of aid was delivered to the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Luhanska and Donetska oblasts, and to five other oblasts of Ukraine, including 209 tons delivered on 22 March., • On 22 March, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) reported that it had received over 1,000 tons of humanitarian aid, including non-food items, medicines, among other relief items, within the last week from partners of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. As of 21 March, reports indicate that the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), in partnership with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), delivered 130 tons of essential supplies, including life-saving food, blankets and other items, to Ukraine., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. The humanitarian impact of the ongoing military clashes across Ukraine continues to exacerbate. As of 22 March, OHCHR reports 2,571 civilian casualties, including 977 killed, figures that are likely much higher and will continue to rise. Less than a month since the military offensive began on 24 February, the confirmed civilian death toll had already surpassed the number of people killed during the second-deadliest year of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine – 2015 – when more than 955 civilians were killed. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (east), the civilian toll continues to mount, with the Government-controlled areas (GCA) bearing the brunt of the recent escalation. In the two eastern oblasts, OHCHR reports 1,102 casualties (224 killed and 621 injured in GCA, and 55 killed and 202 injured in NGCA), while civilian casualties in other parts of Ukraine have reached 1,469., Between 24 February and 22 March, more than 650 residential buildings have been completely destroyed across Ukraine, while around 3,780 have suffered varying degrees of damages, according to SESU. SESU says that the actual extent of the destruction is likely considerably higher, as the latest figure only takes into consideration areas where emergency crews have been able to rapidly assess damages. A bridge over the Desna river leading to the northern city of Chernihiv has been reportedly destroyed. According to the Chernihivska Oblast Civil-Military Administration, the destruction of the bridge should not prevent the delivery of critical relief items to the affected city., As of 23 March, the WHO verified 64 attacks on health care2 in Ukraine, leading to 15 deaths and 37 injuries – close to 88 per cent of incidents recorded by WHO since 24 February globally. WHO strongly condemns these attacks as they violate international law and endanger lives. According to the Ministry of Education and Science, 548 educational facilities have been damaged amid ongoing hostilities, 72 of which have been completely destroyed. According to the Ukrainian Education Minister, around 3 million students from primary, middle and high school education were able to resume their studies online in 11 oblasts of Ukraine. Many colleges and universities across Ukraine continue providing online education. Meanwhile, around 2,900 educational facilities in areas of active hostilities remain on an extended school break., According to the Energy Ministry of Ukraine, as of 22 March, more than 865,000 users in nearly 1,320 settlements across Ukraine remain without electricity. The power supply is slowly being restored in Donetska, Kharkivska (north-east), Khersonska (south), Kyivska (north), Mykolaivska (south), Sumska (north-east) and Zaporizka (south-east) oblasts. However, repair works continue to be constrained by the current security conditions, while in some areas, restoration of power and other services remains virtually impossible due to ongoing hostilities. Moreover, as of 22 March, the number of users cut off from gas supplies rose to 291,000 compared with 281,000 a day before., Gender in humanitarian coordination. A rapid assessment of the impact of the ongoing situation on women’s groups and civil society organizations (CSOs) in Ukraine carried out by UN Women found that women face immediate safety risks, including gender-based violence, lack of access to basic necessities and services, including limited access to legal aid, gaps in childcare and other critical services, and have suffered considerable loss of livelihoods, while remaining largely excluded from humanitarian response planning as well as peace and security efforts., Despite facing significant operational challenges, including lack of funding, supply chain disruptions and mobility restrictions, more than half of survey respondents reported that their CSOs were fully operational. In fact, 66 per cent report providing new services and interventions in areas where they had not previously worked, as local and national organizations adjust their programming to meet the differentiated needs of women and girls in a rapidly changing context. In this context, UN Women says that humanitarian funding channeled to women’s groups must be prioritized and their participation in coordination mechanisms and decision-making processes must be guaranteed to address the specific needs and risks that women and girls face. UN Women has been added to the membership of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and has deployed capacity to establish the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group (GiHA) to strengthen gender considerations in the humanitarian response. UN Women and Care have launched a comprehensive Gender Analysis for Ukraine and a first publication which will include recommendations for the HCT and humanitarian actors will be released this week., Humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. While active hostilities prevent the rollout of comprehensive assessments, preliminary estimates of damages in the hardest-hit areas of eastern Ukraine are concerning. In Mariupol (Donetska oblast), local authorities estimate that around 80 per cent of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed. The city’s health-care system is on the verge of collapse, as active hostilities affect both health workers and infrastructure, bringing the delivery of critical health services, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), to a virtual halt. At city hospital No. 4, for instance, only 10 per cent of the nearly 100 staff capacity is reportedly still available. Access to safe water in NGCA of Donetska oblast remains critical. NGCA entities are reportedly providing water by schedule Donetsk city at three hours per day in most parts and two hours per day in other areas of the city., Humanitarian situation in northern Ukraine and the capital area. In northern Ukraine, although damages are not as critical as they are in the east, the level of destruction is still high. In the city of Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast), ongoing hostilities have forcibly displaced nearly half the population, with the most vulnerable, including people with disabilities and older persons, among those left behind. According to the city’s mayor, between 60 and 70 per cent of homes have been destroyed in the frontline suburbs of Bobrovytsia and Kyinka, with authorities urgently requesting backup generators and containers to distribute water as electricity and water facilities have suffered heavy damage. According to the oblast authorities, Chernihiv remains without electricity, affecting the operations of dependent water and heating systems. Due to the ongoing active hostilities in Sumska oblast, 73 settlements with nearly 19,000 residents have been left without electricity, while access to the water supply and heating remains limited in Okhtyrka., In Kyiv (Kyivska oblast), as of 22 March, municipal authorities estimate that more than 70 residential buildings have suffered varying degrees of damage since 24 February. Meanwhile, oblast authorities say that ongoing clashes on the outskirts of the capital push several communities to the brink of a humanitarian crisis, including Berezivka, Mykolaivka, Severynivka and Tarasove in the Buchanskyi district. The situation continues to worsen in the Ivankivska, Dymerska and Poliska hromadas in the Vyshhorodskyy district, while the Brovarskyy district has suffered large-scale damage to civilian infrastructure., Humanitarian situation in southern Ukraine: The southern city of Kherson (Khersonska oblast) remains under the alleged control of the Russian Federation forces. The oblast administration reports urgent needs in food, including baby food, hygiene items for infants and seriously ill people, as well as medicines. In addition, nearly 46,000 people have been cut off from water and electricity supplies, and close to 4,000 people do not have access to natural gas used for cooking and heating., Evacuation of civilians. According to the Ukrainian Ministry for Reintegration, on 21-22 March, 15,083 persons were reportedly evacuated from the hardest-hit locations, including 8,933 from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia and 4,750 from the capital area. So far, the Ukrainian governmental authorities have reportedly facilitated the evacuation of over 190,000 persons, while millions more have fled the hardest-hit locations towards western parts of the country and abroad on their own. According to the Ministry for Reintegration, nine corridors have been agreed upon for 23 March. As reported by the Russian Federation, on 22 March, 17,929 persons were evacuated from the affected areas towards the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that it facilitated the evacuation of 384,111 persons from NGCA and other areas of Ukraine towards the Russian Federation to date.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-23-march-2022

The setbacks have not, however, been an accompanied by a reduction in fighting. On the contrary, the Ukrainian military reported a buildup of Russian and Belarussian military equipment along the Ukrainian border with Belarus., In Kyiv, the country’s capital, Ukrainian forces successfully countered a Russian advance, driving occupying troops from a strategic suburb (Makariv) and thwarting their efforts to surround the city from the northwest.i To the east, Kharkiv—Ukraine’s second largest city—remains subjected to “near-constant shelling.” At least half-a-million residents have fled the fightingii and many others have sought shelter from bombardment underground.iii Kharkiv’s mayor said that almost 1,000 of the city’s residential buildings have been destroyed.iv In the south, battles still rage in Mykolaiv—among the first regional capitals to come under attack since the February 24 invasion. Though Russian troops had previously taken the city’s center, they have since been forced back by Ukrainian forces. The city is considered a strategic point in Russia’s westward push toward Odessa., The humanitarian situation in Mauripol, which has been completely surrounded by Russian forces for weeks, continues to deteriorate. Mauripol has become a symbol of the entire conflicts’ devastation—maternity wards, shelters, and other civilian locations have been devastated by attacks, severely hindering the populations’ ability to meet basic needs. Up to 200,000 civilians are believed to be trapped in the city. They face diminishing access to water, food, medicine, and other essentials as the Russian military continues to block efforts to bring goods inside and to let civilians flee.vi This week, the United States joined NGOs and international agencies in accusing Russia of committing violations of the rules of war and human rights—including usage of internationally banned weaponry (e.g., cluster munitions) and deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. viiviii At least 64 attacks on medical facilities alone have been confirmed to date by the World Health Organization (WHO)ix and a major news outlet has documented at least 1,500 instances of civilian buildings, structures, and vehicles being damaged or destroyed by fighting. x The International Criminal Court has reportedly opened a formal investigation into these allegations. xi Meanwhile, calls continue to pressure Russia to allow trapped civilians safe passage from active fighting and to allow delivery of essential supplies in besieged cities., The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says it can confirm 977 civilians deaths and 1,594 who have been injured in the conflict. However, the agency cautions actual figures are likely to be higher.xii In addition, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) estimates that 7,000-15,000 Russian troops may have died in fighting and another 30,000-40,000 have been injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-9-24-march-2022
"28 days of war, 64 verified attacks on health care, and 18 million people affected [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",23 Mar 2022,"Copenhagen, 24 March 2022, One month of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s health system, severely restricted access to services, and triggered an urgent need to treat trauma injuries and chronic conditions. Destroyed health infrastructure and disrupted chains of medical supplies now pose a grave threat to millions of people., Impact on health, Close to 7 million people are internally displaced, and the number of people that have fled to neighbouring countries is fast approaching 4 million., That means that 1 in 4 Ukrainians are now forcibly displaced, aggravating the condition of those suffering from noncommunicable diseases. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 1 in 3 of the internally displaced suffers from a chronic condition., A number of hospitals have been repurposed to care for the wounded: a shift due to necessity – which comes at the cost of essential services and primary health care. Approximately half of Ukraine’s pharmacies are thought to be closed. Many health workers are displaced themselves or unable to work., Close to 1000 health facilities are close to conflict lines or are in changed areas of control. The consequence of that – limited or no access to medicines, facilities and health professionals – mean that treatments of chronic conditions have almost stopped., COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization has also come to a halt. Prior to the invasion, at least 50 000 people were getting vaccinated against COVID-19 per day. Between 24 February and 15 March, however, only 175 000 people were vaccinated against COVID-19., Attacks on health care, As of 22 March, WHO had verified 64 incidents of attacks on health care in 25 days (between 24 February and 21 March) causing 15 deaths and 37 injuries. That is 2–3 attacks per day. WHO condemns these attacks in the strongest possible terms., “Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine. “They deprive already vulnerable people of care that is often the difference between life and death. Health care is not – and should never be – a target.”, WHO’s response, On the day the war started, WHO activated its contingency plans, repurposed staff and projects, and shifted focus to emergency needs – to support Ukraine’s health system and workers., WHO works closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and authorities to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system – and swiftly respond. WHO has opened an operations hub in Rzeszów in Poland, developed a pipeline of trauma supplies to most Ukrainian cities, and sent more than 100 metric tonnes of medical equipment over the border, to health facilities across the country., Some 36 metric tonnes of supplies are currently on their way to Lviv, with an additional 108 metric tonnes in the pipeline, consisting of trauma supplies, medication for chronic diseases, paediatric drugs and blood transfusion supplies., “What we are delivering – and where – meets the very needs of people on the ground, where Ukrainian health workers are working around the clock in unimaginable circumstances. A team of trained health-care professionals can, with one WHO trauma kit that contains surgical equipment, consumables and antiseptics – save the lives of 150 wounded people. In other words, delivering 10 such kits, means 1500 lives saved,” said Dr Habicht., As part of a United Nations convoy on 18 March, a WHO truck also reached Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine, carrying critical medical supplies sufficient to treat 150 trauma patients and provide primary health care to 15 000 patients for 3 months. Among other deliveries to health facilities in past days are artificial lung ventilation machines, chemical protection suits, a haematology analyser, liquid oxygen bulk tanks and cryogenic cylinders., More than 20 emergency medical teams have also been deployed to Ukraine, Poland and the Republic of Moldova, to provide training and specialized medical care to supplement existing services., In an assessment of the public health situation in refugee-hosting countries, WHO identifies and lists key health risks and makes related recommendations – on vaccine-preventable diseases, maternal and child health, and chronic infectious and noncommunicable diseases., “I have seen with my own eyes the exceptional humanitarian response in neighbouring countries, but this emergency is far from over. We expect more people – mainly women, children and older persons – with even greater health needs to be displaced in the coming weeks. They may face challenges in accessing the services and medicines that they need – and this can have life-threatening consequences,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., ENDS, For further information please contact: eupress@who.int, Media organizations can register to download WHO images related to the Ukraine response here: https://photos.euro.who.int/join, WHO video content: https://who.canto.global/v/UkraineEmergency",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/28-days-war-64-verified-attacks-health-care-and-18-million-people-affected-enruuk
Analyzing the Scale of Ukraine’s Destruction,Analysis,Direct Relief,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",23 Mar 2022,"An update on civilian casualties, health care attacks, infrastructure damage, and more., By Andrew Schroeder, CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE, AND ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE, As of March 20, the official civilian casualty totals from the United Nations included 902 deaths and 1,459 injuries. As usual, these numbers are a significant undercount, based upon the difficulty of receiving confirmed information from areas with active ongoing combat. Civilian casualties have been almost entirely confirmed according to the results of combat, and do not reflect elevated mortality because of losses to health care or other systems disruptions. According to UNHCR, “Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.”, Remote sensing of the most damaged areas of Ukraine is starting to tell a compelling picture of the scale of destruction to residential neighborhoods, critical infrastructure including health care, transportation corridors, schools, shopping areas, and recreational buildings including theaters. Satellite image analysis from UNOSAT, the United Nations satellite mapping agency, highlights the extraordinary impact of missile attacks and shelling on the city of Mariupol, where roughly 80% of residential infrastructure has been damaged to some degree. Mariupol has been the scene of some of the most highly visible recent attacks, including the missile attack on a maternity hospital and another on a theater where civilians including children were sheltering., The team at REACH has concluded an initial analysis of nighttime lights imagery in order to understand the change in urban settlements which remain illuminated at night and therefore demonstrate some reasonable level of continuous occupancy and activity. Power outages are a constant problem in Ukraine at the moment, so some of this analysis may reflect evacuations, displacement, and damage, while some reflects higher rates of power outage even if buildings may be occupied. The nighttime lights analysis shows drastic reductions in luminosity throughout the outskirts of Kyiv, almost total darkness at night throughout most of Kharkiv and Kherson, and significant changes even in the relatively less affected western Ukrainian city of Lviv., The other crucial ongoing issue related to civilian infrastructure involves the ongoing drumbeat of attacks on health facilities. The World Health Organization currently estimates that there are roughly two missile or shelling attacks on health facilities every day in Ukraine. Their official count now includes 62 attacks on hospitals or other health facilities including ambulances since the war began, which have resulted in 52 casualties including the deaths of 15 health workers. These numbers are drastically lower than the government of Ukraine’s own tally given the WHO’s rigorous verification process. Deliberate targeting of civilian health infrastructure is considered a war crime under the Geneva Conventions., REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS, The refugee and internal displacement crisis from and within Ukraine has moved with unprecedented speed and scale. Although the war is less than one month old the fighting has already produced a total of roughly 10 million displaced persons, which is nearly one-quarter of the entire population of Ukraine. As of March 20. UNHCR estimates there are nearly 3.5 million total Ukrainian refugees. The rate of border crossings continues to decline daily, however, with a steady reduction in the numbers entering neighboring countries ever since the peak daily crossing of 209,000 people on March 6., Refugee services are being established throughout the surrounding countries in the region. New data from UNHCR highlights the locations and type of refugee reception and accommodation centers now established across eastern Europe. The disproportionate share of facilities have been established on the borders between different countries, with Romania as the most extreme example perhaps, without any recorded refugee facilities in the interior., While Poland continues to house most Ukrainian refugees, there is now clear evidence from a variety of sources that diffusion of refugee populations is occurring throughout most of the European Union. A recent draft report from Meta (Facebook) which looks at the dispersion of people with an origin point in Ukraine found that Germany and the Czech Republic have seen the second and third most arrivals in total, with significant flows also occurring to countries such as Italy, France, and Turkey. Note that the numbers in the data from Meta may vary from the official counts and should be understood in conjunction with official numbers to add context and perspective., Recent work from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on internal displacement within Ukraine has drastically revised upward the numbers of displaced to more than 6.5 million people., While most internally displaced persons (about 40%) are in the western region of the country, there is no part of Ukraine that does not currently contain a significant number of displaced persons. While current estimates show almost 2.6 million displaced in the west, each of the north, central, east, and south regions contain over 1 million displaced persons. Key health issues for displaced persons include lack of adequate food, water, and sanitation, exposure to extremely cold temperatures, disconnection from medical services, lack of access to medications, as well as high levels of stress, anxiety, and mental trauma., NON-COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: FOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS, Ukraine has one of the most severe problems with tuberculosis and multi-drug resistance tuberculosis of any country. Roughly 32,000 new cases of active TB infection occur in Ukraine annually. According to a recent article in the journal Nature, there is already [considerable concern among health professionals that many TB patients have been forced to flee with a limited supply of medications and limited or no ability to re-supply their medications or to comply with basic directly observed therapy (DOTS) protocols. As quoted in the Nature article:, “Any interruption of treatment will lead to drug-resistant TB, including MDR TB,” Ditiu says. “After 5 years without treatment, 50% of people with pulmonary TB can die. Meanwhile, you infect many others around you.” And if you interrupt treatment for MDR TB, she says, “it is possible to develop extremely drug-resistant TB, where there are few drugs that work”., Prior to the war there was already significant evidence of artificially low rates of tuberculosis diagnosis in Ukraine, largely attributed to the confounding effect of Covid-19 which also showed up as severe respiratory infection. The combination of under-diagnosis, displacement due to the conflict, disruption of access to replenished drug supplies, and the lack of capacity to follow standard treatment protocols is dramatically raising risks that active TB patients will develop more severe forms of the infection, leading towards serious health complications and even death, while becoming increasingly infectious to those around them., MATERNAL, NEWBORN, SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, According to the World Health Organization, as of March 18 there have been 4,300 births in Ukraine since the start of the war, which averages out to roughly 1,400 births per week. As increasing pressure mounts through the combination of the destruction of civilian infrastructure, attacks on health facilities like the bombing of the maternity hospital in Mariupol, disruption of transportation, and widespread displacement, risks to deliveries particularly for those that require surgical interventions, as well as risks to newborn health in terms of nutritional support, clean water, and mitigation of infectious diseases, will continue to rise., In addition to safe delivery services, including emergency obstetric care, the Interagency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises through the United Nations places special emphasis on the need to ensure safe access to reproductive health and contraception as part of the Minimum Initial Service Package during emergencies., This includes:, As is the case in most emergencies, whether as a result of conflict or disaster, the most effective delivery system for basic health interventions which save the disproportionate share of lives occurs in primary care settings. Sexual and reproductive health care is no different in this regard, which makes it even more essential to minimize attacks on civilian health services and ensure access to primary care as well as hospital services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/analyzing-scale-ukraine-s-destruction
Statement by the IAEA Director General on Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine (23 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,23 Mar 2022,"Watch video, For the past few weeks, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been actively working to ensure the safety and security of all nuclear installations in Ukraine during these dramatic and unique circumstances where major nuclear facilities are operating in an armed conflict zone. I remain gravely concerned about the safety and security of the nuclear facilities in Ukraine. We have been and will remain in close and continuing contact with the Ukrainian Government, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, and the nuclear operator Energoatom. We have also been publishing daily updates with validated technical information about the situation on the ground to keep the global community informed, and we will continue to do so., As I have stated many times, there is an urgent need to conclude an agreed framework to preserve nuclear safety and security in Ukraine by establishing a clear commitment to observe and respect the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security. I have personally expressed my readiness to immediately come to Ukraine to conclude such an agreement, which would include substantial assistance and support measures, including on-site presence of IAEA experts at different facilities in Ukraine, as well as the delivery of vital safety equipment. This agreed framework will also help create the conditions for the IAEA to carry out safeguards verification activities., Intensive consultations have been ongoing for many days now, but a positive outcome still eludes us. Despite this, the distressing situation continues and the need to prevent a nuclear accident becomes more pressing with each day that passes. I want to thank the United Nations Secretariat and the many Governments that from the highest levels have expressed support for my initiative and the efforts of the IAEA. I reiterate today that the IAEA is ready and able to deploy immediately and provide indispensable assistance for ensuring nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. This assistance is essential to help avert the real risk of a severe nuclear accident that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond. I hope to be able to conclude this agreed framework without further delay. We cannot afford to lose any more time.

Update 30 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (23 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,23 Mar 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stands ready to send experts and equipment to Ukraine to help ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and prevent the risk of a severe accident that could threaten both people and the environment, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., In a video statement, the Director General said he remained gravely concerned about the situation and he again stressed the urgent need to conclude an agreed framework that would enable the IAEA to provide technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, which include 15 reactors a well as the Chornobyl site., ""I have personally expressed my readiness to immediately come to Ukraine to conclude such an agreement, which would include substantial assistance and support measures, including on-site presence of IAEA experts at different facilities in Ukraine, as well as the delivery of vital safety equipment,"" Director General Grossi said., However, he said ""a positive outcome still eludes us"" after intensive consultations for many days now, adding that ""the need to prevent a nuclear accident becomes more pressing with each day that passes""., ""I want to thank the United Nations Secretariat and the many Governments that from the highest levels have expressed support for my initiative and the efforts of the IAEA,"" the Director General said. The IAEA ""is ready and able to deploy immediately and provide indispensable assistance for ensuring nuclear safety and security in Ukraine."", He added: ""I hope to be able to conclude this agreed framework without further delay. We cannot afford to lose any more time. We need to act now."", Earlier today, Ukraine's regulatory authority informed the IAEA that firefighters were trying to extinguish wildfires near the Chornobyl NPP, an area which has seen such outbreaks also in previous years. The fire brigade from the town of Chornobyl has extinguished four fires, but there are still ongoing fires. The local fire station does not currently have access to the electricity grid, the regulator said. In the meantime, the station is relying on diesel generators for power, for which fuel is required, it added. The NPP site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located, continues to have off-site power available., The regulator informed the IAEA last week that it was closely monitoring the situation in the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone ahead of the annual ""fire season"" when spontaneous fires often occur in the area, still contaminated by radioactive material from the accident 36 years ago next month. Russian forces took control of the site on 24 February., In today's update, it said ""fire events"" were registered in the area of the Chornobyl NPP's Exclusion Zone. In the Exclusion Zone, the regulator said radiation measurements are not currently being performed. It said slight increases in caesium air concentrations had been detected in Kyiv and at two NPP sites west of Chornobyl, but the regulator told the IAEA that they did not pose significant radiological concerns. The IAEA is continuing to engage with the regulator to obtain further information about the fire situation., Of Ukraine's 15 reactors, located at four sites, the regulator said eight were continuing to operate, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Personnel at the four operating plants were rotating in eight-hour shifts, also at the Zaporizhzhya NPP., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-30-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-23-march-2022

23 MARCH 2022, The General Assembly resumed its emergency special session today to discuss two competing draft resolutions on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine — one that implicates the Russian Federation’s military offensive in the unfolding humanitarian crisis and the other that makes no mention of Moscow’s aggression against its neighbour., “Allowing for safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, including women, children, the elderly, the disabled and humanitarian personnel, is the need of the hour,” said Enrique Austria Manalo (Philippines), Vice-President of the General Assembly, speaking on behalf of Assembly President Abdulla Shahid (Maldives), as he reopened the special session., According to United Nations data, of Ukraine’s population of 44 million, some 3.56 million people have fled the country and 6.5 million have been internally displaced since 24 February. This means 1 in 4 people have been uprooted, he said, warning that essential services such as water, electricity, heating and emergency health and social services are under severe strain. This is projected to expand humanitarian needs among millions of Ukrainians and other community members, he said, urging all parties to respect international law and international humanitarian law., The eleventh emergency special session opened on 28 February and closed on 2 March after adopting a resolution by which the Assembly demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its unlawful use of force against its neighbour. That resolution was adopted by a vote of 141 in favour to 5 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Russian Federation and Syria) with 35 abstentions. (See Press Releases GA/12404, GA/12406 and GA/12407)., [Under Assembly resolution 377A(V), commonly known as the “Uniting for Peace” resolution, the world body resolved that if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, it shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to members for collective measures. This includes, in a case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression, the use of armed force when necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.], In today’s meeting, more than 60 delegations took the floor to exchange views on the two rival resolutions. The draft titled “humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.2) demands an immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, in particular of any attacks against civilians and civilian objects. The other, titled “Humanitarian situation emanating out of the conflict in Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.3), calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all parties in the conflict., Ukraine’s representative, introducing “L.2”, described the plight of his country as already reaching the level of a humanitarian disaster. “L.2” is a result of collective and informed effort by two dozen States from all regions, including France and Mexico, who led consultations on the draft. Using an analogy of individuals becoming passive when they see street violence in the presence of a crowd, he cautioned against this “bystander apathy”. Appealing to delegates in the Assembly Hall, he said this world body should not be ruled by this street violence psychology, urging responsible Member States to support “L.2”., His counterpart from South Africa, introducing “L.3”, emphasized the need for the United Nations to adopt a resolution by consensus on the humanitarian situation affecting the people of Ukraine. “L.3” is an attempt to present a text that specifically addresses that situation, devoid of other matters that would weaken the General Assembly’s unity on this issue. Stressing that the Assembly’s failure to garner consensus “would not bode well for humanitarian action and relief in Ukraine”, she said that while the political and strategic issues pertaining to the conflict should be discussed, it should not be done in the context of a resolution addressing the humanitarian situation., Mexico’s delegate said his country and France introduced a humanitarian resolution in the Security Council, but after two weeks of open consultations carried out in good faith, it became clear that an agreement would not be reached there. With the genuine support of the Assembly’s members, who wanted to be part of a humanitarian response, the matter was brought to this organ. “L.2”, which has at least 88 co-sponsors so far, is the outcome of a collective effort focused on the humanitarian aspect of the conflict and includes diverse views from the Organization’s five regional groups. The spirit of the United Nations must be honoured, he said, adding that the Assembly’s humanitarian initiative is the least the Ukrainian people deserve., The Russian Federation’s representative rejected “L.2” as it is full of anti-Russian elements and was submitted as a “political anti-Russian show”. “L.2” will only make the situation worse as it will embolden Ukraine’s regime, which has waged war on Donbas over the past eight years. The Russian Federation’s special military operation was launched only after efforts for peaceful resolutions of the conflict in Donbas were exhausted. “L.3” tabled by South Africa is close to what the Russian Federation submitted in the Council, he said, urging support for that text., Similarly, Syria’s representative warned that some States are mixing questions regarding the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine with their hostile political position against the Russian Federation. Resuming this emergency special session to introduce a draft resolution without a vote in the Security Council demonstrates that these States are not genuinely interested in resolving the humanitarian issues in Ukraine. South Africa, on the other hand, was careful to present a draft resolution focused exclusively on the humanitarian situation, and he welcomed this constructive approach and called on all States to consider it objectively., The Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, said the Russian Federation has done nothing to implement the resolution adopted by the Assembly on 2 March and has intensified suffering instead. European Union member States have kept borders open for everyone fleeing the war, he said, stressing that an Assembly resolution must accurately reflect the situation and its causes and urge respect for the most basic humanitarian principles., Poland’s delegate said that its border with Ukraine sees constant daily inflows of people who are severely traumatized. Of the more than 3.5 million people who have left Ukraine, 2.2 million have fled to Poland; most of them have found shelter and stayed in the country. “In the spirit of solidarity, Poland will continue to admit and provide shelter, food, health care and safety to every person in need, regardless of their nationality, race or religious creed,” she said, calling on every State to stand firmly behind “L.2”. Seventy-six years ago, the Assembly stood determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. “At the moment we are failing,” she said., The United States, its representative said, has recently assessed that the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. “L.2” is a response to the humanitarian catastrophe created by the Russian Federation. Abstention in the face of Moscow’s atrocities is unacceptable. The text calls for an end to this war, she said, appealing to “the one person with the ability to stop the violence, and that person is Vladimir Putin”., Ecuador’s delegate recounted the story of Diego, a 20-year-old fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, who arrived in his country. Diego was among the 700 Ecuadorians evacuated from Ukraine on the country’s three humanitarian flights. He is a living witness that the Russian Federation’s “special military operation” is nothing other than a clear invasion of Ukraine in violation of the United Nations Charter., Japan’s delegate said the international community has witnessed a permanent Security Council member violate its obligations to maintain international peace and security and continue to ignore the calls of the United Nations main organs, stressing that the Assembly must act by supporting “L.2”., Albania’s representative said that while Ukrainians know what they are fighting for, “Russians do not know what they are dying for”, describing the conflict as “a war of one man”. History has seen many failures of strongmen attempting to rewrite history. The crisis is affecting the entire world, making the poor poorer and the vulnerable more vulnerable, he said, adding that Albania co-sponsored “L.2”., Costa Rica’s delegate was among several speakers who underscored the broad humanitarian repercussions of the conflict, including famine and food insecurity, particularly for those countries that cannot afford interruptions of their food supply. She warned that places like Yemen and South Sudan are already on the brink of starvation and now face an even more devastating reality., Also speaking today were representatives of the Netherlands (also for Belgium and Luxemburg), Lithuania (for the Nordic-Baltic countries), Turkey, Fiji (on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum), Georgia, Bulgaria, Italy, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, Dominican Republic, Chile, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, Croatia, Australia, New Zealand, Czech Republic, Singapore, United Kingdom, France, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Paraguay, Slovakia, Greece, Gabon, Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf), Marshall Islands, Hungary, Federated States of Micronesia, Uruguay, Colombia, Timor-Leste, Ireland, Germany, Portugal, Viet Nam, Republic of Moldova, Argentina, Peru, Kiribati, Romania, Sri Lanka, Cyprus, Andorra, Jamaica and Malta., The Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. Thursday, 24 March, to continue its work and take action on the two rival resolutions., Opening Remarks, ENRIQUE AUSTRIA MANALO (Philippines), Vice-President of the General Assembly, speaking on behalf of Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, said that the security situation in Ukraine has deteriorated rapidly following the launch of the Russian military offensive on 24 February 2022. The intense military escalation and rapid expansion of the conflict throughout the country has resulted in severe loss of life, injuries, misery, and mass movement and displacement of the civilian population throughout the country and to neighbouring countries, as well as severe destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure and residential housing. According to United Nations data, of Ukraine’s 44 million population, some 3.56 million people have fled the country and 6.5 million have been internally displaced since 24 February. This means 1 in 4 people have been uprooted. Essential services such as water, electricity, heating and emergency health and social services are under severe strain, and people’s access to health care continues to be limited by growing insecurity and shrinking humanitarian space., This is projected to deepen and expand humanitarian needs among millions of Ukrainians and other community members, he warned. People on the move are extremely vulnerable to numerous potential health and protection risks, while local capacities in host communities receiving growing numbers of displaced people are already stretched to the brink. “Allowing for safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, including women, children, the elderly, the disabled and humanitarian personnel, is the need of the hour,” he stressed, urging all parties to respect international law and international humanitarian law., Introduction of Drafts, The General Assembly had before it two draft resolutions, one titled “Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine (document A/ES-11/L.2) and the other titled “Humanitarian situation emanating out of the conflict in Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.3)., “L.2” would have the Assembly demand an immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, in particular of any attacks against civilians and civilian objects. The 193-member organ would also demand that civilians, including humanitarian personnel, journalists and persons in vulnerable situations, including women and children, be fully protected. It would further demand full respect for and protection of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities., Moreover, the text would have the Assembly demand full respect for and protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and civilian infrastructure that is critical to the delivery of essential services in armed conflict. The Assembly would also demand that all parties protect civilians fleeing armed conflict and violence, including foreign nationals, notably students, without discrimination, to allow voluntary, safe and unhindered passage and that the parties comply with their obligation to ensure the safe, unhindered humanitarian access of humanitarian personnel as well as their means of transport, supplies and equipment to those in need in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries., By other terms of “L.2”, the Assembly would welcome and urge continued efforts by the Secretary-General, Member States, the United Nations system and the international community to deliver humanitarian assistance as well as assistance and protection for refugees. The Assembly would also urge the immediate peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine through political dialogue, negotiations, mediation and other peaceful means in accordance with international law., “L.3” would have the Assembly call for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all parties in the conflict, and encourages political dialogue, negotiations, mediation and other peaceful means aimed at achieving lasting peace and endorses the Secretary-General’s call to return to the path of dialogue and negotiations. By the text, the Assembly would demand that civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations, including women and children, be fully protected and that all parties concerned ensure respect for and the protection of all medical personnel and humanitarian personnel and their means of transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities., Moreover, the Assembly would further demand full respect for and protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and civilian infrastructure that are critical to the delivery of essential services in armed conflict and that all parties protect civilians fleeing the violence, including foreign nationals; allow for their voluntary, safe and unhindered passage, without discrimination, in particular on the basis of race; and comply with the obligation to allow and facilitate the rapid, safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries., By other terms of “L.3”, the Assembly would condemn all violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights and call upon all parties to the armed conflict to strictly respect international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I thereto, of 1977, and to respect international human rights law and international refugee law, including the principle of non-refoulement., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), introducing “L.2”, called for swift and concrete action by the United Nations in response to the war waged against his country by the Russian Federation, as thousands of people, including men and women, young and old, civilians and military personnel, were killed because Moscow decided to attack his country. Each passing day, the war aggravates the humanitarian situation, which already reached the level of a humanitarian disaster. Cities in Ukraine are being razed to the ground, and neighbouring countries accommodating those fleeing the war are stretched to the limit. Two dozen States from all regions tabled this draft resolution, he pointed out, adding: It is “a result of collective and informed effort”. While the draft clearly points to the root cause of the humanitarian catastrophe, it will send a powerful message and contribute to a breakthrough in the humanitarian situation. Appealing to delegates who gathered in the Assembly Hall, he cautioned against “the bystander apathy”. Individuals are less likely to stop street violence when in the presence of a crowd. The Assembly should not be ruled by this street violence psychology, he said, urging responsible Member States to support the draft., Statements, BJÖRN OLOF SKOOG, of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, said that the inhabitants of Mariupol have been under siege for 24 days and bombed day and night. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic. The Russian Federation is blocking the delivery of humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of the civilian population. Every day it is attacking the civilian population and infrastructure, he said, stressing that “deliberate attacks on civilians are shameful”. The Russian Federation has done nothing to implement the resolution adopted by the Assembly on 2 March and has intensified suffering instead. “These are dark days not just for the Ukrainian people but for the world in its entirety,” he said. Millions of Ukrainians and thousands of people from other parts of the world are caught in the conflict, many of whom have been instrumentalized by the Russian Federation as part of its disinformation campaign. European Union member States have kept borders open for everyone fleeing the war., Beyond Europe, this conflict is putting millions of people at risk of food insecurity, he said, noting that the European Commission has announced new measures to address that, not least in the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin. The European Union has been a solid supporter of Ukraine since 2014 and has provided 2.4 billion euros in humanitarian and early recovery assistance. Over the last eight years, it has also addressed the needs of the most vulnerable in eastern Ukraine — on both sides of the conflict line — and this will continue, he said. It will also continue to provide assistance to people fleeing other crises around the world including in Yemen, Ethiopia and the Sahel. The General Assembly must call on the Russian Federation to respect the basic principles of international humanitarian law. An Assembly resolution is needed that accurately reflects the situation and its causes and urges respect for the most basic humanitarian principles. The resolution presented by Ukraine and a large cross-regional group of countries calls for the protection of all those fleeing the war and addresses the major consequences on food security in many countries, including developing ones. “Russia must stop this war and end this unnecessary suffering,” he said., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), speaking on behalf of the Benelux countries and aligning herself with the European Union, said the group provides unwavering support for Ukraine and its sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders. She condemned the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, stressing that the Russian Federation alone is responsible for the war and the humanitarian crisis. “There is no doubt about what needs to be done and what needs to be done immediately,” she said, adding that is why the Assembly is gathered at this session today. “People fear for their lives every minute,” she said. Humanitarian corridors are being negotiated, but the terms are being violated., Another consequence of the war is the rising food insecurity in Ukraine and other parts of the world, she said. People in vulnerable parts of world, such as Yemen and the Horn of Africa, will be facing food shortages and more economic and social instability will be created. Grave violations of international humanitarian law are being committed. This is a humanitarian crisis and it shows disrespect for the important gains in international law fought for since the end of the Second World War, she said. All norms are being disregarded and trampled upon. The Benelux countries stand ready to support Ukraine and urge support for the resolution. There is one solution: The same party that started the war can choose to stop it now, she said., RYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), also speaking for Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden and aligning himself with the European Union, spotlighted the obvious, devastating humanitarian consequences and rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine. Expressing concern over the invasion’s potential impact on food insecurity, he said that the Russian Federation — “together with its accomplice, Belarus” — bears responsibility for the tremendous suffering inflicted on the Ukrainian people. “Civilians must not be targeted”, he underscored, calling for attacks on health-care facilities and schools to cease immediately. Also pointing out that the Russian Federation is using cluster, thermobaric and phosphorous munitions, he said this demonstrates the “systematic manner” in which that country is waging war on Ukraine and embodies its disregard for international law., Pointing out that more than one quarter of Ukraine’s population has been forced to flee their homes — mostly women and children — he said that the Russian Federation is obliged to allow rapid, safe and unhindered access for humanitarian actors to reach all in need. Further, safe, voluntary passage must be guaranteed for civilians, including through the opening of humanitarian corridors. Recalling the International Court of Justice’s recent order for the Russian Federation to stop its so-called military operation and the investigation opened by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, he stressed that there will be no impunity for violations of international law — including war crimes and crimes against humanity. This is not only to secure justice for victims but also to deter future violations of international law., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) recalled that a few days ago, some Western countries decided to request the resumption of the General Assembly special session to put a humanitarian resolution to a vote after they realized such a draft would not pass the Security Council. Today, the Russian Federation put its humanitarian resolution to a vote in the Council. The Russian draft took many elements from the France-Mexico draft, including calls for a ceasefire, for safe evacuation and protection of civilians, and for avoiding targeting critical infrastructure and heavy residential areas. The Western-led draft full of anti-Russian elements unfortunately ended up in the Assembly. Rejecting this “political anti-Russian show”, he called on Western countries to vote in favour of the Russian draft in the Council if they are truly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The draft before the Assembly will only make the matter worse as it will embolden Ukraine’s regime, which has waged war on Donbas over the past eight years. The Russian Federation’s special military operation was launched only after efforts for peaceful resolutions of the conflict in Donbas were exhausted. He denied that the Russian Federation is targeting civilians, explaining that Ukraine’s regime started using them as human shields and blocked them from leaving via humanitarian corridors. The draft before the Assembly does not mention the role of Western countries that are stoking the conflict. The draft tabled by South Africa is close to what the Russian Federation submitted in the Council, he said, urging Member States to make an independent choice., FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU (Turkey) said that the situation in Ukraine will mark this generation and the ones to come. The humanitarian crisis is not the result of a natural disaster, it is man-made and the result of the blatant violation of humanitarian law by the Russian Federation. There are 40 million Ukrainians suffering inside their own country, he said, noting that Turkey is working with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in order to address the situation. Some 10 million Ukrainians have — against all odds — managed to escape the horrors of war. There is also a larger humanitarian crisis unraveling around the world, he said, noting the rise in food prices and underscoring that developing countries may have to face even more serious consequences as a result of the war. Turkey is mobilizing all of its resources to help implement a ceasefire through diplomacy, he said. Member States have a duty “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, he said, stressing that “L.2” should be adopted., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan) said his Government is closely following the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor. “L.2” is critically important, he said, noting that it calls upon all Member States to act to alleviate the severe humanitarian consequences in and around Ukraine. Second, it addresses what has created the severe humanitarian consequences. The draft resolution reiterates the demand for the full implementation of Assembly resolution ES-11/1 of 2 March 2022, which deplores the Russian Federation’s aggression and demands that that country immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from Ukraine. The international community has witnessed a permanent Security Council member violate its obligations to maintain international peace and security and continue to ignore the calls of the United Nations main organs, he said, stressing that the Assembly must act by supporting “L.2”., SATYENDRA PRASAD (Fiji), speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, expressed deep concern about the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. He called on the Russian Federation to de-escalate the situation and return to the path of diplomacy in good faith. He also called for an immediate ceasefire, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to affected areas and the urgent withdrawal of military forces in accordance with internationally recognized borders. The Russian Federation’s actions are a violation of international law and inconsistent with the Charter, he said, expressing shock at the scale of the humanitarian crisis that has led to the displacement of 10 million people. He called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and international refugee law, and to uphold human rights. In particular, he called for the protection of civilians, civilian infrastructure, medical facilities and personnel, and nuclear sites. He applauded the hospitality of Ukraine’s neighbours and urged that all people be treated with respect and without discrimination., The Blue Pacific region is concerned with the spillover effect and the impact on issues such as food security and higher food prices and oil prices, including in the Pacific, he said. The Forum relies on the rules-based international order that has promoted peace among the international community for over half a century. Climate change and COVID‑19 must remain at the forefront of global efforts. Actions must be guided by established rules and norms. He reaffirmed the fundamental human rights and equal rights of all people and all nations, large and small., KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia), aligning himself with the European Union, said that after one month of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified war on Ukraine, hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed, including more than 100 children. Over 3.5 million Ukrainians were forced to flee and seek shelter in neighbouring countries, while 6.5 million are internally displaced. These numbers already signal the looming unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Europe and beyond, for many decades. Georgia strongly condemns the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and premeditated aggression against Ukraine, in blatant violation of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. This aggression has been a major wake-up call for the international community. Georgia experienced the Russian Federation’s full-scale military aggression in 2008. This pattern of behaviour brazenly undermines the entire international rules-based order and poses grave threats to regional and global peace and security. “They are inconsistent with the ways how responsible States should act in the twenty-first century,” he said. Georgia urges the Russian Federation to cease aggression immediately, completely and without preconditions, to withdraw all its forces and armaments from the whole territory of Ukraine within its international recognized borders, and to allow immediate, safe and unfettered access to all international humanitarian and human rights mechanisms. Georgia also urges the Russian Federation to do the same regarding the occupied Georgian regions and fulfil its obligations under the 12 August 2008 ceasefire agreement., LACHEZARA STOEVA (Bulgaria), aligning herself with the European Union, pointed out that, in less than one month, more than 3.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes in Ukraine and seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Further, an additional 6.5 million have been internally displaced. This “unspeakable war” has claimed the lives of at least 75 children and injured at least 99 others, she said, noting that the psychosocial and other effects of war are enormous and difficult to reverse. The use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, heavy artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems and air strikes have flattened once-vibrant cities, and the Russian Federation has deliberately destroyed civilian infrastructure in blatant violation of international humanitarian law. “Even wars have rules,” she stressed, stating that the Russian Federation is systematically violating all of them. “The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the twenty-first century,” she urged, adding that “this senseless war must stop now”., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy) expressed grave concern that the consequences of the war, including the destruction of critical infrastructure, will be felt for years to come. Condemning the Russian Federation’s total disregard for international humanitarian law and the failure of the Security Council to act, he said that a cross-regional group requested the resumption of this General Assembly special session. “If the Security Council cannot act, the General Assembly must retake the initiative,” he said, urging Moscow to immediately stop the war of aggression. “L.2” makes a clear distinction between the aggressor and victims, he said, stressing that Italy will continue to stand by the Ukrainian people., RICARDO DE SOUZA MONTEIRO (Brazil) expressed his deep concern over the growing number of civilian casualties and the increasing flow of refugees and internally displaced persons. His Government has joined humanitarian efforts and has implemented a humanitarian visa policy for people fleeing Ukraine. In response to the pressing need for humanitarian assistance, his Government has donated water purifiers, nine tons of food and half a ton of medical items. With the assistance of Brazil’s Embassy in Warsaw, the supplies were delivered into Ukraine in coordination with the country’s authorities. The conflict in Ukraine will disrupt food systems and increase hunger in the world, particularly in developing countries. He expressed concern over the imposition of broad economic sanctions, noting their negative impact will place additional hardships on already strained economies recovering from the pandemic. “In the end, the most vulnerable will suffer the consequences of measures proved to be mostly ineffective,” he said. Brazil encourages clear dialogue between the two parties to implement their obligations under international humanitarian law to ensure the safety of civilians and humanitarian workers, he said., ARRMANATHA CHRISTIAWAN NASIR (Indonesia) said it is disheartening that the Assembly has to meet again and millions of people are suffering in Ukraine. Many parts of the country have no basic services and infrastructure is destroyed. The world is looking to the United Nations to take action and to save lives, he said, stressing that the Organization has the responsibility to send a clear and united message to all parties. All efforts must be taken to stop the war and cease hostilities and create a ceasefire. International humanitarian law must be restored and safe passage guaranteed for civilians wishing to evacuate. Dialogue and negotiations must be intensified; this is the only way for lasting peace. It is time for the United Nations to maintain its unity as it is the global body to address humanitarian crises, he said, stressing that it is necessary to restore trust in the Organization., SUPARK PRONGTHURA (Thailand), expressing grave concern about the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, called for the respect and protection of civilian life and infrastructure and for the facilitation of access to humanitarian assistance, within and around Ukraine, without discrimination or politicization. He called on all parties to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law. Thailand has provided food, medical and other essential supplies to affected civilians through the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. Meanwhile, the Thai Red Cross Society has provided financial contributions to the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and helped raise public funds for its relief activities, he said, encouraging parties to continue bilateral talks., JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE (Dominican Republic) stated that the millions trapped in conflict in Ukraine are “paying for our inability to spare them this suffering and prevent the fracture of their lives and dignity”. Expressing indignation over the fact that two draft resolutions are on the table, he said the Dominican Republic, despite this, will focus on the millions of civilians who need protection. All laws governing the conduct of hostilities must be respected — without delay or conditions — and all necessary measures must be taken to avoid human suffering, including ensuring humanitarian access to affected populations and refraining from attacking civilian infrastructure. While all people trapped in armed conflict are vulnerable, women, children, older persons, those internally displaced and those living with a disability require and deserve immediate attention. Also noting that the Russian Federation and Ukraine produce 25 per cent of the global wheat and grain supply, he spotlighted the conflict’s potentially devastating effects on food security and underscored the need to prevent the situation from escalating., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the numbers are staggering, with 12 million people stranded and supplies cut off. “Everything is a target” under the Russian Federation’s bombing campaigns, he said, citing the destruction of schools and hospitals among other critical infrastructure. Moscow’s initial plan has been delayed by Ukraine’s resistance. While Ukrainians know what they are fighting for, “Russians do not know what they are dying for”, he said, describing the conflict as “a war of one man”. History has seen many failures of strongmen attempting to rewrite history. The crisis is affecting the entire world, making the poor poorer and the vulnerable more vulnerable, he said, adding that Albania cosponsored resolution “L.2”., JOANNA SYLWIA SKOCZEK (Poland), associating herself with the European Union, said an estimated 12 million people — almost 30 per cent of Ukraine’s population — will need humanitarian assistance. “The sole actor responsible for the disaster is Russia,” she said, citing the bomb dropped by Russian forces on a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol where civilians were sheltering, despite its clear markings as a civilian object. “This is a clear manifestation that Russia deliberately creates humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine and blatantly disregards the principles of international humanitarian law,” she insisted. She condemned in the strongest terms attacks against civilians and civilian objects. These acts constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions to which the Russian Federation is a party, as well as the laws and customs applicable in an international armed conflict., “These acts are war crimes under international law,” she affirmed. “We must not remain silent.” Pointing to almost 2,500 civilian casualties reported in Ukraine since the start of the invasion, including 925 persons killed, she said the real numbers are likely much higher. The Polish-Ukrainian border sees constant daily inflows of people who are severely traumatized. Of the more than 3.5 million people have left Ukraine, 2.2 million have fled to Poland; most of them have found shelter and stayed in the country. “In the spirit of solidarity, Poland will continue to admit and provide shelter, food, health care and safety to every person in need, regardless of their nationality, race or religious creed,” she said. She called on every State to stand firmly behind today’s resolution, which was elaborated with and agreed upon by Ukraine and thus respects its particular needs. Seventy-six years ago, the Assembly stood determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, she said. “At the moment we are failing.”, RENÉ ALFONSO RUIDÍAZ PÉREZ (Chile) said that the situation in Ukraine has worsened dramatically, including through the use of new missiles with “staggering destructive capacity”. International humanitarian law signals the instruments that should be used in cases such as Ukraine, including the most robust protection possible for civilians, among them humanitarian workers, journalists, women, children and medical personnel. The security and dignity of all those in Ukraine and entering countries of refuge should be guaranteed, he said, regardless of a person’s status. The international community has the responsibility to protect the civilian population affected by the conflict that is “the fruit of an act of aggression”, he said. He thanked all Member States that are hosting the 4 million people who have been forced to abandon Ukraine as a result of this conflict., CHRISTIAN WENAWESER (Liechtenstein) said when war begins war crimes follow. The Assembly must address the suffering of civilians. There has been great humanitarian suffering since Assembly last met on this issue. Civilians have borne the brunt of violations of international humanitarian law. These events also show a rejection of multilateralism. There are additional effects, after the pandemic, which are being felt around the globe, he said, emphasizing that the impact on a major agricultural producer will be severe and there will be a massive fallout in many areas, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. There must be an immediate cessation of hostilities. The Assembly has shown its ability to respond when the Charter is under threat. The Organization has extensive experience in humanitarian assistance and has set the ground rules for their delivery, he said, calling for those rules to be respected. Safe passage for those fleeing and those delivering humanitarian aid must be ensured, he stressed., BOŠTJAN MALOVRH (Slovenia), aligning himself with the European Union, stated that indiscriminate shelling and the bombing of civilian targets and infrastructure constitute grave violations of international humanitarian law. There should be no impunity for any such violation, and he supported prosecuting the crime of aggression at the international and national levels. He also spotlighted the growing refugee crisis and the urgent need to establish humanitarian corridors; for its part, Slovenia will continue to assist Ukraine and refugees while also providing financial support to germane United Nations mechanisms. Pointing out that this situation is not just a humanitarian crisis for Ukraine and Europe but also for global food security, he stressed the need to bolster the mandates of United Nations entities tasked in this area. Further, Member States must support “L.2”, which “accurately reflects the situation on the ground” and calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities by the Russian Federation, for the protection of civilians and for respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law., CRISTIAN ESPINOSA CAÑIZARES (Ecuador) recounted the story of Diego, a 20-year-old fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, who arrived in his country. Diego is among the 700 Ecuadorians who were evacuated from Ukraine on the country’s three humanitarian flights. He is a living witness that the “special military operation” is nothing other than a clear invasion of Ukraine in violation of the United Nations Charter. He said operative paragraph 6 of “L.2” demands that all parties protect civilians fleeing armed conflict and violence, including foreign nationals, notably students, without discrimination, to allow voluntary, safe and unhindered passage. He wondered how many times he heard that there would not be an invasion, urging an immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine., MARITZA CHAN VALVERDE (Costa Rica) said the streets of Ukrainian cities are being used as a battlefield, while homes, hospitals and even nuclear power plants have become military targets. Many Ukrainians remain trapped and are desperate for safe passage. The Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine is devastating, she said, stressing that the longer the aggression lasts, the deeper its impact in Ukraine and beyond its borders. She appealed to the Russian Federation to cease its hostilities against Ukraine. The protection of civilians is a fundamental obligation of the United Nations. Critical infrastructure such as water and electricity must be preserved, she said, noting that it must be protected against attacks waged by new technologies and cyberattacks. The humanitarian repercussions of this crisis are broad and include famine and food insecurity, particularly for those countries that cannot afford interruptions of their food supply. Places like Yemen and South Sudan are already on the brink of starvation and now face an even more devastating reality, she said., IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), associating himself with the European Union, said that as Ukrainian people are killed and maimed, displaced and starved by the occupying Russian forces, “it is the minimum of decency and compassion with the victims to acknowledge their sufferings and to help the 10 million displaced and others in need,”. The conflict’s humanitarian consequences have effects beyond the borders of Europe, he added, pointing out the resolution’s recognition of that in addressing its impact on food insecurity. Calling upon States to support all efforts to establish accountability for crimes committed in Ukraine, he urged the Russian Federation to comply with the order of the International Court of Justice that it immediately suspend its military operation in that country., MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia) said there is one reason and one reason alone for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine: the Russian Federation. It is an unprovoked, unjustified and illegal invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Improvement will not come from more money or more aide or greater access for non-governmental organizations, though those factors are all important. The most immediate improvement will come from the immediate withdrawal of Russian Federation forces from Ukrainian territory. “Any meaningful resolution on a humanitarian solution must call out the Russian Federation by name,” he said, stressing that the Russian Federation has to get out of Ukraine. He called on the Assembly to stand in absolute solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Australia is providing $65 million of life-saving assistance and working together with international partners. He called on the Russian Federation to meet its obligations under international law., CAROLYN SCHWALGER (New Zealand), associating herself with the Pacific Islands Forum, said the scale of the crisis in Ukraine demands a strong and effective response from the General Assembly. United Nations humanitarian resolutions on Ukraine should clearly identify Russia’s invasion as the cause of the severe spike in humanitarian needs, she added, emphasizing that Moscow is violating international humanitarian law every day the conflict continues, with its accomplice, Belarus, sharing responsibility. Commending the relief efforts of international organizations and neighbouring countries and the quick responses of the United Nations system, she noted that her country has made an initial contribution of 6 million New Zealand dollars to the humanitarian response, with further contributions expected. Expressing concern that the crisis is stretching the global humanitarian system to its limit and diverting resources and attention from other crises, she stressed: “No country, big or small, with or without a veto, should be allowed to act with impunity when it violates the basic tenets of international humanitarian law.”, JAKUB KULHÁNEK (Czech Republic), associating himself with the European Union statement, noted that the Russian Federation is a party to four Geneva Conventions and must respect its international obligations. It is most appropriate that the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into the situation in Ukraine, he said, adding that impunity for crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction, including war crimes, is unacceptable. Welcoming the resolution’s adoption, he highlighted that people in his country have provided shelter for more than 270,000 refugees from Ukraine and around 215,000 of them have already been granted a special visa granting them access to health care, social protection, education and the labour market. The Czech Government also seeks to provide decent accommodation to refugees fleeing the aggression, he said, pointing out that it has recently approved additional in-kind humanitarian assistance in the total sum of CZK 300 million (approximately $13.5 million) in medical and other supplies to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova., BASSAM SABBAGH (Syria) said that, once again, the General Assembly is witnessing the “exploitation of human-rights issues to create a state of polarization and politicization used to serve the political interests of some”. Some States are mixing questions regarding the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine with their hostile political position against the Russian Federation, and resuming this emergency special session to introduce a draft resolution without a vote in the Security Council demonstrates that these States are not genuinely interested in resolving the humanitarian issues in Ukraine. Rather, they seek to advance a hostile position against the Russian Federation by putting forward an “erroneous, one-dimensional view of reality”, he said. South Africa, on the other hand, was careful to present a draft resolution focused exclusively on the humanitarian situation, and he welcomed this constructive approach and called on all States to consider it objectively. He went on to stress that humanitarian operations must be implemented according to the principles of neutrality and non-discrimination, recalling his own country’s experience with politicized humanitarian assistance., BURHAN GAFOOR (Singapore) said his delegation supported the 2 March Assembly resolution. It is time to implement the text now, he said, emphasizing the need to abide by obligations under international humanitarian law while calling for full urgent implementation of “the resolution we already adopted”. Saddened by the growing number of civilian casualties, he called on the Russian Federation to cease its military operations immediately. The unfolding humanitarian crisis must be stopped, he said, underscoring that the international community’s priority is to immediately cease hostilities. Commending the efforts of United Nations and ICRC, he called for safe, unhindered access for humanitarian workers., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that since the Assembly met four weeks ago, Ukraine has fallen victim to a humanitarian catastrophe due to the Russian Federation’s unnecessary war of choice. More than 3.5 million refugees, including 1.5 million children, have fled Ukraine and more than 12 million people now require humanitarian assistance. Developing countries are paying a heavy price. A global food, energy and economic crisis is setting in, which, alongside COVID‑19, risks undermining decades of progress. Medieval siege tactics are being deployed in Mariupol, where innocent families have been without food, water or power for days. Noting that the United Kingdom has donated more than £400 million to help aid agencies respond to deteriorating humanitarian conditions, she urged Member States to focus on the actions needed to end the suffering. The only way to end the humanitarian crisis is for the Russian Federation to end its war. People are looking to the United Nations to defend international principles. “We can condemn the Russian invasion and enforce the founding principles upon which the United Nations was built,” she said, encouraging support for the resolution, which so far is backed by 86 co-sponsors across all regions. The United Kingdom will vote for the text and urges others to do the same., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that 10 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee and more than 3.5 million of them are now refugees in neighbouring countries. He commended the solidarity shown by European Member States in helping and sheltering them. The utmost priority is the immediate cessation of hostilities and full respect for international humanitarian law, he said, emphasizing that civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, must be protected and humanitarian access guaranteed. For three weeks, France and Mexico have staged discussions in good faith for a draft Security Council resolution demanding a cessation of hostilities and respect for international humanitarian law. Noting that this initiative has been transferred to the General Assembly, he said the draft resolution introduced by Ukraine is the fruit of a collaborative process. No one will emerge victorious from this war and only the end of the Russian Federation’s offensive will stop still more losses. The Russian Federation must denounce the use of force and respect the Charter of the United Nations, he stressed., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), paying tribute to former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said that her story of fleeing the former Czechoslovakia and rising to a high position in the United States Government “echoed in my mind” as the General Assembly meets on Ukraine. One month after the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of that country, the world need only look at the plight of those in Mariupol to understand the brutality that President Putin has inflicted. The Russian Federation’s actions there will be investigated thoroughly, and the world will know of Russian brutality in that city, alongside those of Aleppo and Grozny. Noting that her Government has recently assessed that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, she underscored that the world must “stand together in the face of unconscionable violence”. The resolution “L.2” is a response to this humanitarian catastrophe, and was negotiated by a diverse, cross-regional group of States. The text calls for the protection of all civilians, support to neighbouring countries that have opened their border to refugees and support to the United Nations and its humanitarian partners in their life-saving work. Abstention in the face of the Russian Federation’s atrocities is unacceptable, and that country must be held accountable for the humanitarian crisis it is creating. She went on to say that the text demands an end to this war, appealing to “the one person with the ability to stop the violence, and that person is Vladimir Putin”., CHO HYUN (Republic of Korea), strongly condemning attacks against civilians and civilian objects, expressed particular concern about the millions of women and children on the move who have been exposed to the risks of violence, including gender-based violence, and human trafficking. Children, unaccompanied by or separated from their families, must be identified, protected, and provided with a safe place to stay, he emphasized, pointing to continued bombing and shelling in populated areas. Expressing deep concern over the conflict’s negative ripple effects on global food and energy security, he said the Republic of Korea has contributed $10 million for humanitarian assistance, including emergency medical items and equipment, as well as flexible funding in response to the United Nations-led appeal. Recalling the Korean War of the 1950s, he noted that children in Ukraine are enduring similar suffering today., PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL (Switzerland) said the Assembly faces a clear choice — that of unity in the face of a serious violation of international law ­ and it must protect human life. Condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms, she called on the former to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s territory. Switzerland has delivered more than 500 tons of aid to Ukraine and approved an additional 80 million Swiss francs for its humanitarian programme there and the region. She encouraged all initiatives that allow for the protection of civilians and persons “hors de combatas”, as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian pauses and humanitarian corridors must be well-planned, secured in a coordinated manner and agreed upon and implemented in detail between the parties. Calling for the protection of vulnerable people who are unable to leave the encircled towns by their own means, she expressed great concern over credible reports of the use of cluster munitions in populated areas. “Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited and constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law,” she insisted, stressing that the Geneva Conventions can be used to find common ground and dialogue. “Their respect is non-negotiable.”, YASHAR T. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan) said the situation in and around Ukraine is a matter of serious concern and efforts towards a peaceful solution have not produced results to stop the fighting and provide humanitarian assistance. Civilians continue to bear much of the harm. There are increasing civilian casualties and increasing numbers of displaced people. As the situation continues to cause more human suffering, there must be strict respect for international humanitarian law to protect civilians and infrastructure. Unimpeded humanitarian assistance to all these in need and safe passage for those fleeing the fighting is also vital. Azerbaijan has made consistent steps to help the people of Ukraine and has provided $12.9 million in aid, he said. He called for the earliest possible settlement of the conflict through peaceful, diplomatic means with full compliance of international law. He also urged respect for sovereignty and the inviolability of borders and encouraged the parties to continue dialogue., OMAR CASTAÑEDA SOLARES (Guatemala) said his delegation co-sponsored “L.2” — along with more than 70 Member States — and expressed shock at the images of more than 3.2 million Ukrainians fleeing their country, forcibly displaced by the aggression of another State: a callous and atrocious conflict, reminiscent of images from the Second World War. Although Ukraine and Guatemala are geographically far apart, they are united by the values of humanity, solidarity and above all to unequivocally protect the dignity of people fleeing conflict and violence. Condemning all violations and abuses of human rights, he stressed “it is time to bring an end to this senseless conflict”, calling for a ceasefire — no more lives lost, civilians injured and mothers suffering the loss of their children and families. Calling for diplomacy to be prioritized to avoid an escalation of the conflict that might have even greater dire consequences at the global level, he reiterated the importance of seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis, with respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, international humanitarian law and international human rights law., JULIO CÉSAR ARRIOLA RAMÍREZ (Paraguay) said that despite intensive efforts made and repeated calls for an end to hostilities, the world continues to bear witness to the suffering of millions of people in Ukraine, including children. The General Assembly must guarantee safe, unhindered access for humanitarian workers. He urged diplomatic efforts to be intensified. His delegation decided to cosponsor “L.2” to address both the cause of the conflict and its terrible consequences. Member States should send out a message of unity, he said, urging a return to the path of respecting international law., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating himself with the European Union, said that his country is concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The conflict has already resulted in significant human cost, including loss of civilian life and damage to infrastructure. “The conflict needs to end, and it needs to end now,” he said, “and there is only one actor that can stop it, and that is the aggressor, the Russian Federation.” According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2.9 million children are in need of humanitarian aid. This is proof of a “living hell”. Ukraine needs the help of the international community, he said, noting he is shocked by reports that the Russian Federation deliberately strikes civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. Last Friday, a gentleman who survived the Nazi Holocaust was killed in Ukraine when his apartment building was shelled, he said, noting that the Russian pretext of “denazification” could not be more hypocritical. He expressed his full support of all initiatives assisting Ukrainians fleeing their country and said they are welcome in Slovakia., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), aligning herself with the European Union, said that Ukraine is facing one of the world’s most protracted humanitarian crises and that respect for international humanitarian law is “our minimum duty as human beings in these dark moments”. Detailing the efforts of the Greek Consulates in Mariupol and Odessa to evacuate Greek diaspora as part of operation “Nostos” (homecoming), she said Greece has also delivered its first package of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Further, when things return to normal, the Government’s first action will be to rebuild the maternity hospital in Mariupol. It will also continue to be present in the region, one in which Greeks settled centuries ago. Expressing concern over reports of attacks on civilians, humanitarian workers and civilian facilities such as hospitals and schools, she underscored the urgent need to preserve and protect the humanitarian space. She went on to say that the international community’s struggle today is not only to secure urgently needed humanitarian assistance and save innocent lives, but also “to preserve our human side”., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said the need for humanitarian action in Ukraine is bringing the Assembly together today. A war without limits is unacceptable. Strict respect for international humanitarian law is necessary. There needs to be a distinction between civilian populations and military targets. Quick unimpeded access to combat areas must be provided. Humanitarian action should not be held hostage to any political or tactical gains, he said, stressing that Gabon will not allow any attempts to instrumentalize it and will make sure humanitarian efforts are in line with peoples’ needs. He paid tribute to the brave man and women working on the frontlines who are giving a ray of hope to people who are suffering., MOHAMMED ABDULAZIZ H. ALATEEK (Saudi Arabia), speaking on behalf of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, said its member States are committed to international law and the Charter of the United Nations, urging all parties to the conflict to respect the principles of good neighbourliness and non-interference in the affairs of other States. Calling for a return to negotiations and the immediate cessation of all hostilities, he noted the members of the Council have friendly relations with all parties. Civilians must be spared further suffering, with those involved upholding their responsibilities under international humanitarian law to provide assistance and avoid targeting any civilian institutions. Commending those who have provided convoys, he voiced hope that this is but one step in bringing about a peaceful resolution to the crisis., AMATLAIN ELIZABETH KABUA (Marshall Islands), associating herself with the Pacific Islands Forum, voiced support for the urgent need to address the increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, as the Assembly cannot afford to be silent or weak at a moment where the whole world demands its leadership. “We must speak, and speak as one, but also must act with conviction,” she emphasized. Should the Assembly fail to do so, it would be harming the global community, and particularly its relevance for small nations like hers. This is not a matter of moral equivalence, or simply an isolated dispute, she stressed, as the Assembly’s 2 March resolution has not been fully implemented, and the recent decision of the International Court of Justice has gone unheard. The grave humanitarian crisis cannot be effectively addressed without immediate cessation of hostilities by the Russian Federation, in particular attacks against civilians and civilian objects, further aggravated by the siege of cities, especially Mariupol. “These are not opinions, they are indisputable facts based on objective truth and evidence,” she stressed, with vital tenants of the Geneva Convention being violated. The multilateral wheels of accountability are already in motion — but accountability also extends to the vote today, also a clear expression of the Charter “and who among us has the courage to stand behind it,” she said. Noting her delegation cosponsored and will vote in favour “L.2”, she urged other nations to do likewise., ZSUZSANNA HORVÁTH (Hungary), associating herself with the European Union, said that the resolution adopted on 2 March had already sent a strong message from the international community. It was adopted with overwhelming support. “L.2” should enjoy equal support. Her delegation supports this draft, she said, urging others to do the same. The war initiated by the Russian Federation turns 55 children into refugees every minute, she warned, urging Moscow to abide by international humanitarian law. Hungary is committed to assisting those fleeing the conflict. Its border crossings have been operating in full capacity and they are open without discrimination. Her country has rolled out a large-scale humanitarian assistance programme and stands by Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrality, she assured., Mr. MULALAP (Federated States of Micronesia), associating himself with the Pacific Islands Forum, said the war has only intensified since the emergency special session’s last meeting three weeks ago. Thanking Ukraine’s neighbours for stepping up to help the most vulnerable as they flee the fighting, he said even more must be done. Humanitarian corridors are essential to allow for aid to reach those most in need and to facilitate the departure of innocent civilians from hostilities, but their agreed terms are repeatedly violated by the aggressor. Against that backdrop, he expressed support for the draft resolution before the Assembly today, as the root cause of the conflict — and who is responsible — is clear. Urging the international community to rally behind the text, he said its adoption would not only be deeply appreciated as a humanitarian gesture but would also signal the broader resolve of the United Nations and its members., CARLOS AMORÍN (Uruguay) said that the international community must act in light of the grave humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian Federation’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Safe paths for displaced persons should be provided so that the population can be evacuated from the zone of conflict, he said, condemning attacks against civilians and calling on all parties to observe international humanitarian law. There should be a focus on avoiding hunger and a lack of foodstuffs, he stressed, calling for the protection of critical assets used to provide essential services. He expressed his support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and specialized agencies to supply and distribute humanitarian aid and welcomed the appointment of a crisis coordinator for Ukraine. A lasting solution for the current humanitarian situation in Ukraine depends on the end of the armed conflict, he said, demanding a full cessation of hostilities by the Russian Federation., GUILLERMO ROQUE FERNANDEZ DE SOTO VALDERRAMA (Colombia) said that the scene in Mariupol is one of extreme cruelty — an atrocity that no explanation can justify. Expressing solidarity with the Ukrainian people, he condemned grave violations against the right to life and demanded protection for the civilian population. “There is no place here for indifference” at the suffering of millions of people, he stressed. He called for the emergency special session to appeal to the Russian Federation to end its aggression against a sovereign nation and to respect international humanitarian law and the principles of constructive dialogue, free negotiation and multilateralism — “the only weapons that should be used here”. Colombia knows the consequences of conflict and understands that negotiation and dialogue are the only way to build rather than destroy. Member States must unite to achieve immediate de-escalation of this war and avoid further human suffering. “We cannot allow civilians to be confused for combatants,” he added., KARLITO NUNES (Timor-Leste) expressed deep concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine, noting that the conflict has had a particular impact on children and women, causing internal displacement and creating refugees. He called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict through diplomacy, dialogue and de-escalation of tension. Recognizing the importance of humanitarian contributions made by the international community, neighbouring countries and the United Nations in support of Ukraine’s people, he noted that his country has contributed $1.5 million through the World Food Programme in Timor-Leste to help address the food crisis there., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said the deteriorating humanitarian situation will escalate while there is no immediate cessation of hostilities. Pointing to the 3.5 million refugees and more than 1 million internally displaced persons created by the war, he said that it is inconceivable that 1.5 million children have had to flee their country in less than four weeks. In the face of such great need, Mexico and France introduced a humanitarian resolution in the Security Council. After two weeks of open consultations carried out in good faith, it because clear that an agreement would not be reached in the Council. With the genuine support of the Assembly’s members, who wanted to be part of a humanitarian response, the matter was brought to this organ, he said, noting that “L.2” has 88 co-sponsors. No one can doubt that the impact of the crisis will be global and affect everyone over the long-term. The humanitarian response must be commensurate with humanitarian needs, he said, stressing that humanitarian assistance cannot be held hostage to political situations and the principles of such assistance must be enforced. “L.2” is the outcome of a collective effort focused on the humanitarian aspect of the conflict and includes diverse views from the five regional groups of the United Nations. The spirit of the United Nations must be honoured. The Assembly’s humanitarian initiative is the least the Ukrainian people deserve., DONAL KENNEALLY (Ireland), associating himself with the European Union, reiterated Ireland’s condemnation of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. “The Russian Federation has failed to respect the will of this Assembly,” he said, recalling the resolution adopted three weeks ago. Instead, the continued invasion of Ukraine has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. The Security Council — primarily as the result of the anachronistic veto power — remains deadlocked and unable to act in response to that unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Welcoming the draft resolution before the Assembly in that context, he called on the Russian Federation to immediately end its invasion, withdraw its forces and to turn to the path of dialogue and diplomacy, “before any more of Ukraine’s people are forced to pay the terrible price of pitiless war”., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany), associating herself with the European Union, said that schools and hospitals in Ukraine are bombed and women, children and the elderly are dying. Day by day, thousands of children arrive in Warsaw, Berlin and the Republic of Moldova. A generation is being scarred for life. Mariupol has been bombed into rubble, into a graveyard, she said. The General Assembly has condemned the Russian Federation’s violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The Russian Federation continues to attack without regard for international law or for the people of Ukraine. There is a text on the table that Member States from around the world have agreed with Ukraine, demanding full compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law. Humanitarian efforts must be stepped up, she said, noting that Germany and the rest of the European Union will continue to shelter all those fleeing this war, regardless of their country of origin., FRANCISCO DUARTE LOPES (Portugal), aligning himself with the European Union, said the indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine’s population and civilian infrastructure must stop. Calling on the Russian Federation to fully comply with international humanitarian law, he stressed that the war in Ukraine has provoked one of the fastest growing refugee crises in Europe since the Second World War. Thanking Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Republic of Moldova for hosting and assisting those who fled, he said Portugal has received more than 20,000 refugees from Ukraine, who benefit from automatic access to health care and social security under a temporary protection system, as well as to housing and employment pools. He welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative to establish a United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, describing the draft resolution as a necessary step and fully justified, given the increasingly dire situation., MATHU JOYINI (South Africa) expressed concern over the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, stating that the conflict has security, political and economic impacts on countries in all parts of the world. Mediation, dialogue and negotiation are the most sustainable methods of resolving even the most intractable of divisions, and she welcomed rounds of negotiation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. She also urged all sides to uphold international law and the principle of State sovereignty and territorial integrity, including that of Ukraine. The immediate cessation of hostilities should be the first step towards ameliorating the humanitarian situation, and she further called for the fair treatment of nationals of all countries seeking to leave the conflict area., Introducing “L.3”, she emphasized the need for the United Nations to adopt a resolution by consensus on the humanitarian situation affecting the people of Ukraine. That resolution must focus specifically on the humanitarian plight of the civilians affected and guarantee protection for objects indispensable to their survival. Further, humanitarian organizations must uphold the principles of neutrality and impartiality in their activities. “L.3” is an attempt to present a resolution that specifically addresses the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, devoid of other matters that would weaken the General Assembly’s unity on this issue. Stressing that the Assembly’s failure to garner consensus “would not bode well for humanitarian action and relief in Ukraine”, she said that, while the political and strategic issues pertaining to the conflict should be discussed, it should not be done in the context of a resolution addressing the humanitarian situation., HOANG GIANG DANG (Viet Nam) said Viet Nam has consistently underscored respect for the Charter. All international disputes must be settled by peaceful means. The principles of sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity, and refraining from the use of force must be respected. Viet Nam understands first-hand the violence of war and its aftermath. It shares the great concerns of the international community about the conflict in Ukraine and the international humanitarian crisis. The wider repercussion of the situation in Ukraine for the region and the world at large could not be underestimated. Against this backdrop, it is imperative to exercise utmost restraint and immediately cease the use of force to prevent further casualties and losses, as called for by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers since 3 March. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected and secure humanitarian access provided. The best way to protect civilians is to end the conflict. The road to peace lies in continuing dialogue, he said, stressing the crucial need to end hostilities and find a long-term solution., GHEORGHE LEUCĂ (Republic of Moldova), associating himself with the European Union, condemned in the strongest possible terms the unjustified war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. “These hostilities are threatening the international architecture of rules and norms that we have been building and consolidating for over 75 years,” he said. Noting that some 370,000 Ukrainians and third-country nationals have so far fled the horrors of war and entered the Republic of Moldova, he said his country has never before experienced such a crisis. Despite already facing many other health and economic challenges, the country is working hard to mobilize assistance and to offer food, shelter and medicine to everyone in need. Against that backdrop, his delegation co-sponsored and will vote in favour of the resolution before the Assembly today, and once again calls for the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace in Ukraine., MARÍA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF (Argentina) said that three days ago the High Commissioner for Refugees reported that the number of refugees and internally displaced persons is approaching 10 million. Of those, millions are children, older persons and persons with disabilities. She noted the suffering of those besieged in cities and the scars that will remain on the bodies of victims for the rest of their lives. In 1944, the world made a firm commitment to avoid war for forthcoming generations. This sacred mandate is not being respected, she said, stressing that there is no more room for violence. A lasting solution will only be reached by peaceful means, she said, calling for an immediate de-escalation of the conflict and for all parties to return to the negotiating table. For that to happen, there must be a ceasefire. She reiterated her condemnation of the Russian Federation for their invasion of Ukraine. It is vital that immediate and free access be given for effective humanitarian aid., JOSÉ MANUEL RODRÍGUEZ CUADROS (Peru) called for the parties to immediately agree to a ceasefire and continue diplomatic negotiations to bring an end to the conflict. While the conflict continues, however, the parties must comply with their overwhelming obligations under international law to limit the suffering of the civilian population and ensure that their human rights are protected. “These are not goodwill recommendations, nor are they guidelines for desirable conduct,” he stressed; rather, they are obligations. International humanitarian law doesn’t ask questions about the motives leading to a conflict — its main objective is to relieve the human suffering caused by war. The United Nations has the mandate to protect all those affected by conflict, and the international community must also assist refugees and displaced persons — without discrimination of any kind. Detailing many of the obligations arising from international humanitarian law in the context of armed conflict, he also stressed that the international community “cannot foster the entrenchment of unyielding political positions”. A negotiated settlement that contemplates the interests of all parties is the only way to restore peace and end suffering, he said., TEBURORO TITO (Kiribati), aligning himself with the Pacific Island Forum, said “because our Kiribati culture is deeply rooted in the sacredness and sanctity of every human person, we cannot help feeling sad and distressed and longing for meaningful ways to address the cries of innocent, helpless lives in Ukraine at this time.” When Kiribati joined the United Nations 23 years ago, it did so in the belief that as a small island, with no military or defence force, its future safety and security lied in the capable hands of the United Nations. The Organization is a place where all nations, large or small, rich or poor, powerful or powerless are treated equal under a supreme global law embodied by the Charter. He asked the five countries charged with ensuring that humanity does not suffer any wars to faithfully honour the sacred trust and duty given to them so all wars end and world peace is established for all nations and peoples now and in the future. The best support for the mounting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is to co-sponsor and vote yes for the resolution before the Assembly and respectfully request all Member States to play their part however possible, materially and spiritually, to restore peace in Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the rest of the world., ION JINGA (Romania), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine — including the consequent involvement of Belarus, all human rights violations, abuses, and violations of international humanitarian law thus — in the strongest terms. Describing the humanitarian situation as a disaster, heemphasized the need for an immediate end to attacks on civilians and for safe passage, jointly agreed by the parties, to allow the movement of refugees and the transport of much-needed medical assistance for those who choose to stay. “The continuing aggression against the civilian population and the humanitarian situation in Ukraine are simply unbearable, and this is the reason why this resolution must be adopted as a matter of urgency.” Hewent on to state that Romania has been fully mobilized and is committed to support Ukrainian civilians forced to flee, noting that more than 550,000 have already entered hiscountry, with 4,300 asylum applications filed., PAHALA RALLAGE SANATHANA SUGEESHWARA GUNARATNA (Sri Lanka), recalling that members of the Assembly “have pledged to treat each other with mutual respect”, said developing nations around the globe are undergoing severe economic stress as a result of a failure of the developed States to conduct their affairs with a duty of care. “If we look around us, we find a world atlas of chaos,” he said, adding that there appears to be no urgency to resolve issues that threaten the very existence of humankind. “It is therefore our plea that this Assembly pledges today to bring the temperature down,” he stressed, urging all combatants to cease their hostilities, de-escalate and return to the negotiating table with a view to ensuring mutual respect for each other. “Our nations cannot be used as the chessboard of international politics,” he stressed., ANDREAS HADJICHRYSANTHOU (Cyprus), aligning himself with the European Union, said the international community has been shocked by the images of death and destruction coming out of Ukraine during the past four weeks. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that 10 million people have either been displaced inside the country or fled as refugees following the Russian Federation’s invasion. He called for the immediate cessation of hostilities, unhindered access to humanitarian aid and safe passage for civilians, condemning the indiscriminate attacks against them and infrastructure and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. “The apocalyptic images from Mariupol, one of the most historic cities in Ukraine that now lies in ruins, are just devastating,” he stated. Cypriots — a third of them still displaced themselves — have displayed solidarity, contributing to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and sending the largest-ever shipment of aid to the country. Cyprus has also welcomed more than 6,000 Ukrainian refugees. Reiterating support for the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, he condemned “this senseless war” and called upon all Member States to support “L.2”., ELISENDA VIVES BALMAÑA (Andorra), aligning herself with the European Union, expressed deep concern over the rapid deterioration of the situation in Ukraine. More than 3.5 million people have fled the country. Andorra is alarmed by the attacks against civilians, hospitals and schools. There must be respect for humanitarian law. Civilian populations, hospitals and schools should never be targeted during hostilities. Andorra welcomes the courageous work of humanitarian workers on the ground, which must be recognized and protected. Andorra is a co-sponsor of “L.2” and will vote in favour of the draft. The implications of the conflict will affect the global economy and food security and the lives of many people. The consequences will linger not only in the lives of millions of Ukrainians but also in their memory. Moreover, the effects on international law are indisputable, she said, reiterating her country’s call for respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations. The decision of the International Court of Justice, which calls for the immediate suspension of military operations in Ukraine, is legally binding and must be respected. Andorra appeals for a ceasefire and expresses solidarity with the people of Ukraine., BRIAN CHRISTOPHER MANLEY WALLACE (Jamaica) said that the humanitarian crisis is a direct consequence of the invasion by the Russian Federation. The military action by that country violates the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. He joined the call for the parties to the conflict to abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law, as well as the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities in order for humanitarian assistance to be rendered to the population. The preservation of a global rules-based multilateral system is imperative, especially for small States like Jamaica. This system cannot be threatened, he said, stressing that the global community must demand the immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to dialogue and diplomacy. The humanitarian relief effort must be supported so that the necessary assistance can be provided to the civilian population as quickly as possible., DARREN CAMILLERI (Malta), aligning himself with the European Union, said that unprovoked, unjustified Russian aggression has led to the loss of civilian lives — including women and children — along with needless suffering and psychological trauma that will last for years to come. In Mariupol, the situation is devastating, as relentless Russian strikes have turned the city into ash and rubble in a matter of weeks. He called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its hostilities and pursue a negotiated solution. Stressing that the principles of international humanitarian law are non-negotiable and “cannot be revoked through the use of force”, he called for the timely delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need. Blocking such delivery is unacceptable. He further called on Member States to vote in favour of “L.2”, pointing out that such a vote is one in favour of the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and the sovereignty, territorial integrity and people of Ukraine., For information media.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 22 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,23 Mar 2022,"Date: 23 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 22 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,571 civilian casualties in the country: 977 killed and 1,594 injured. This included:, a total of 977 killed (196 men, 144 women, 12 girls, and 27 boys, as well as 42 children and 556 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,594 injured (174 men, 136 women, 24 girls, and 20 boys, as well as 64 children and 1,176 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,102 casualties (279 killed and 823 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 845 casualties (224 killed and 621 injured),  On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 257 casualties (55 killed and 202 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,469 casualties (698 killed and 771 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 23 March, 121 children had been killed and 167 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 22 March, 286 civilians had been killed in the region, including 15 children., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time. Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact:

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirms £220m assistance for Ukraine in spring statement – reaction from Bond, the UK network of NGOs",News and Press Release,Bond,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",23 Mar 2022,"In today’s spring statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed the UK would be allocating £220million in humanitarian and development assistance to Ukraine following the devastating invasion from Russia. This money will be coming out of the already-reduced UK aid budget, which Sunak cut from 0.7 to 0.5 per cent of gross national income (GNI) last year, rather than being additional to the diminished pot., Simon Starling, Director of Policy, Advocacy and Research at Bond, said in response: “The UK government’s allocation of £220m to the Ukraine crisis is welcome and mirrors the generosity of the UK public, but it would be ill-judged and morally wrong if our support came at the expense of other marginalised communities affected by extreme poverty, conflict and inequality. “The money we give to Ukraine – and all future crises – should be additional to the already-reduced UK aid budget, not taken from it, until the government meets its 0.7% commitment. Otherwise, we risk sabotaging our own efforts to assist people in crisis in countries such as Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Yemen., “The government must recognise the vital role UK aid plays in responding to today’s multiple crises and helping to prevent future ones by restoring the budget to 0.7% of GNI as soon as possible.”, ENDS, Notes to editor:, Bond is the UK network for organisations working in international development. Bond unites and supports a diverse network of over 400 civil society organisations from across the UK, and allies to help eradicate global poverty, inequality and injustice., For further information or interviews please contact Juliet Conway on 07990518334 or jconway@bond.org.uk",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/chancellor-rishi-sunak-confirms-220m-assistance-ukraine-spring-statement-reaction

Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Mar 2022,"Almost 1 month has passed since Russia launched its war of aggression on Ukraine., In less than 4 weeks, the fighting has led to massive displacement and suffering. Nearly 6.5 million people have been internally displaced. Many have already fled the war to neighbouring countries. Almost 12.5 million Ukrainian civilians remain stranded in conflict-affected areas, seeking shelter from erupting battles on city streets., Since the start of the invasion, the EU has been working around the clock to provide emergency relief to those in need., Following an initial request from the Government of Ukraine on 15 February, the EU started coordinating the delivery of supplies via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism: a facility to organise rapid relief efforts among EU countries and an additional 6 participating countries., In the days that have followed, European nations have rallied together in solidarity with Ukrainian people, offering an unprecedented amount of civil protection assistance in record time., For the EU, the first priority continues to be Ukraine. To date, all 27 EU countries, plus Norway and Turkey, have offered in-kind assistance to the Ukrainian authorities., This has included items such as medical supplies, medicine, shelter equipment as well as ambulances, firefighting equipment, power generators and water pumps. As of 23 March 2022, over 8,000 tonnes of relief items have been channelled to cities and towns throughout Ukraine., With needs growing exponentially, further assistance is being mobilised every day. To help address pressing medical needs arising from the war, the EU is providing additional emergency aid items from the rescEU strategic reserve., Vital equipment from the rescEU medical stockpile, notably ventilators, infusion pumps, patient monitors, masks and gowns, ultrasound devices and oxygen concentrators, worth over €10 million, is being shared with Ukraine., In parallel, the EU is also channelling humanitarian aid to conflict-affected people in Ukraine, as well as to refugee in neighbouring countries, amounting to €93 million., Our assistance includes food, water, health and protection, as well as support for basic needs. Humanitarian aid is being routed through our humanitarian partners who have promptly scaled up their operations in Ukraine., Speaking about the ongoing relief effort, Commissioner for Crisis Management, JanezLenarčič, said:* “Russia’s war in Ukraine is amounting to a humanitarian catastrophe not seen in decades in Europe. People inside Ukraine are seeking safety. The EU, through its Civil Protection Mechanism, is coordinating 24/7 with Ukrainian authorities. The EU stands in full solidarity with Ukrainian people at this horrific time.”*, Civil protection assistance is also being supplied to Ukraine’s neighbours, where many civilians are seeking refuge., According to the latest estimates, over 3.5 million people have sought shelter in Poland, Moldova and Slovakia, among others. The number continues to grow by the day., In view of the mass inflow of civilians, Moldova activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on 24 February, asking for assistance to accommodate refugees fleeing Ukraine., Slovakia and Poland did the same on 27 and 28 February. Czechia also requested support via the Mechanism on 11 March, seeking shelter sets, tents and other accommodation items., So far, many European countries have offered temporary accommodation items and medical supplies, including Greece, Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, France, and Slovenia, among others., In addition, Norway has also contributed as a participating state to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism., All of this is being organised through a number of civil protection logistics hubs, which were set up with the support of the European Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) in neighbouring countries., These centres are channelling the assistance delivered from European countries via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in response to the requests for assistance by Ukraine., At the beginning of the crisis, 2 hubs were established in Poland and Romania to expedite the delivery of aid. Another hub has just started operating in Slovakia., Teams of EU civil protection experts are on the ground, helping the authorities with the constant flow of assistance., “*When we get offers for assistance, we make sure they get here as quickly as possible, and in a coordinated manner. We work closely with the Polish authorities. Then, they are loaded on trucks and trains headed for Ukraine and dispatched to the places where they are most needed,” *says Jürgen Schreiber, who is leading the Civil Protection team in Poland., “Personally, I am impressed by the outpour of solidarity that we have been seeing here in Poland and countries all over the world,” Schreiber adds., Through these logistics hubs, the EU continues coordinating the delivery of aid to Ukraine. Via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, European nations remain committed to supporting neighbouring countries., With civil protection assistance, the EU continues to offer relief and assistance to innocent civilians fleeing from Russia’s war on Ukraine., Story by Michael Bruton, EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations.

Attacks on Ukraine’s Hospitals Will Cause Long-Term Harm to Health,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",22 Mar 2022,"From trauma-related injuries to chronic diseases, the effects of Ukraine’s destroyed or damaged health facilities will cause harm for a long time to come., Attacks on hospitals and other health facilities have been a prominent -- and horrifying -- feature of the war in Ukraine. A maternity and children's hospital was bombed in Mariupol in a widely publicized attack, and Ukraine accused Russia of attacking a psychiatric hospital in Kharkiv, to name just two examples., The country's health minister said that Russian forces have shelled 135 hospitals and damaged 43 ambulances, and the WHO has confirmed 49 attacks on hospitals and nine on medical transport units., ""The number is astonishing in such a short period of time,"" said Leonard Rubenstein, a professor and director of the Program on Human Rights and Health in Conflict Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health., He compared the situation in Ukraine to the more than ten years of war in Syria -- in which health facilities have been heavily targeted and in which Russia is likewise significantly involved. Even compared to Syria, ""where the attacks were horrific and sustained over many, many years...this concentration is astonishing."", The war in Ukraine is likely to hurt the health of those affected for a long time to come, and it's likely that the destruction of hospitals and other health facilities will have grave consequences, Rubenstein said., THE ATTACKS IN CONTEXT, Only a small percentage of the country's roughly 2,500 hospitals have been attacked, but health economist and former Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Health Pavlo Kovtuniuk, who is working with a team evaluating damage to Ukraine's health facilities, said that's not the right way to consider the matter: ""We should look at where they are destroyed...there are cities where all the health infrastructure is destroyed."", Because these attacks frequently come in areas occupied or under siege by Russian forces, ""facilities are being destroyed exactly in the areas where needs are becoming most acute,"" said Judy Twigg, a professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert on Russia's and Ukraine's health systems., ""With the number of hospitals hit, we know that their capacity in the short term to deal with the enormous demand on services, particularly with traumatic injuries, is going to be severely compromised,"" Rubenstein said. ""Most hospitals, most communities, are not used to dealing with...these traumatic injuries."", Rubenstein also heads up the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and Is the author of ""Perilous Medicine: The Struggle to Protect Health Care from the Violence of War."" He explained that conflict situations severely affect health systems and public health, in ways that aren't necessarily intuitive., Although the conflict in Ukraine -- and Syria and Yemen before it -- have drawn public attention to wartime attacks on health facilities, there isn't enough information to know whether such attacks are on the rise., ""Nobody was tracking them like we are trying to track them now, so we don't have a baseline,"" Rubenstein said. ""It had the problem of not being on the global health agenda, and it wasn't particularly on the human rights agenda, except for a handful of organizations., DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES, But it's clear that war increases the prevalence of infectious disease, both because people are in crowded conditions and because vaccine campaigns are often disrupted by the conflict. In Yemen, where the health and water infrastructure were damaged, which led to more than a million cases of the disease -- ""and the capacity to treat it was also diminished by attacks on hospitals,"" Rubenstein said., Because travel is dangerous, people often ""take their chances without medical care, which leads to more suffering and more death."", Women giving birth are often afraid to go to hospitals, and more likely to receive a Caesarean section if they do, Rubenstein said., In addition, ""the hospitals are stressed and the supplies diminished, so dialysis programs diminish. Trauma care often has to be prioritized to save people's lives, so chronic disease care diminishes significantly."", Trauma from the event leads to widespread mental health issues -- and perhaps particularly for people like health care workers, a fact that Rubenstein said is not widely addressed., Attacks on hospitals -- and the harm it causes to civilians -- most often goes unpunished. ""There has been complete impunity,"" said Rubenstein. ""There's been no accountability in Syria, there's no amount of accountability in Yemen, so yes, they feel they can get away with it."", And health care workers often flee the country along with other civilians during a war, further decimating the medical system where a conflict is taking place., HEALTH IN TRANSITION, Before the conflict, Ukraine's health system was in transition., ""Prior to 2015, Ukraine was the last of the countries that had been part of the Soviet Union to undergo any kind of reform,"" Twigg said. ""It was an inefficient, wasteful, corrupt dinosaur."", But reforms beginning in 2015 addressed the issue of corruption in drug procurement and created a new national health service, in which state funding for health care went through an independent agency that published its records. Nearly every Ukrainian adult signed a contract with a primary health care doctor. The country focused its efforts on primary care, reducing reliance on what Twigg described as a bloated hospital system with the longest average lengths of hospital stay in the world., The country maintained its share of health problems, however. Kovtuniuk described repeated recent outbreaks of polio and measles, due largely to extremely low vaccination rates. Tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDS were all ongoing challenges., In addition, rates of alcohol use and smoking were high, as was the prevalence of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Rates of mortality among middle-aged men were especially pronounced, according to Twigg., The dozens of facilities shelled in the war present a significant problem for Ukraine's health system, Twigg said. ""I think what we can expect to see is a huge need for resources to be diverted, once the war is over, into reconstruction of destroyed or damaged facilities,"" she said. ""Even with an enormous amount of postwar investment...it's going to take a lot of money."", REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME, Twigg is concerned that Ukrainians' day-to-day health needs will be affected by the urgent requirement to rebuild health infrastructure and deal with the most pressing health issues. She's also deeply concerned about the mental health of people affected by the conflict. And should the war continue, she feels Russian attacks on health facilities are sure to follow suit., Should the worst-case scenario occur and Russia end up occupying most of all of Ukraine, Twigg said Ukrainians will continue to resist, most likely leading to ongoing war injuries. People who use intravenous drugs could be denied medications like methadone, which Twigg said are illegal in Russia., Should Ukraine manage to repel the Russians, Twigg said it's essential for humanitarian organizations to follow the country's lead when it comes to rebuilding, and to ""support according to their priorities and their needs."", But even when the war comes to an end, Kovtuniuk said, normalcy won't return. ""They use civilians and their sufferings as part of the war,"" he said. ""The world will never be the same again.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/attacks-ukraine-s-hospitals-will-cause-long-term-harm-health

Questions and Answers: Commission acts to safeguard global food security and support EU farmers and consumers,News and Press Release,ECHO,"Agriculture
Contributions
Food and Nutrition
Health",23 Mar 2022,"What is the Commission doing to ensure food security in Ukraine?, The Commission has proposed an EU Emergency Support Programme of €330 million to Ukraine to help alleviate the suffering of Ukrainians caused by the Russian invasion. This support will help to secure access to basic goods and services as well as protection., To support Ukraine's agricultural output, the Commission is working to develop and implement a short and medium term food security strategy to ensure that inputs reach Ukrainian farms where possible, and that transportation and storage facilities are maintained to enable Ukraine to feed its citizens and to eventually regain its export markets. The Commission is also working with the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on the ground in Western Ukraine to support small farms and secure agricultural production., In addition, on request of the Ukrainian agricultural authorities, the Commission will seek to ensure that access to EU markets is preserved and facilitated in a flexible way both for imports to and exports from Ukrainian markets., The Commission has mobilised the largest ever response of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to support the Ukrainian people, providing medical aid as well as food items. Furthermore, the EU has signed agreements for €93 million initial humanitarian aid, with €85 million to Ukraine and €8 million to Moldova. The funding will help people inside Ukraine and those who have fled to neighbouring countries by providing food, water, healthcare, shelter, protection and help to cover their basic needs., What is the situation of global agricultural markets?, The Commission is closely monitoring the situation of food security worldwide as both Ukraine and Russia are important suppliers to global markets especially for cereals and vegetable oils. Ukraine accounts for 10% of the world wheat market, 13% of the barley market, 15% of the maize market, and is the most important player in the market for sunflower oil (over 50% of world trade). As far as Russia is concerned, these figures are respectively 24% (wheat), 14% (barley) and 23% (sunflower oil). North Africa and the Middle East import over 50% of their cereal needs from Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine is also an important supplier of (feed) maize to the European Union and China. While key customers of Ukrainian and Russian wheat reportedly have stocks for some months, price increases are already felt in some countries. For instance, Yemen, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan, and Nigeria are important importers, many of them already severely food insecure., There is no immediate threat to food security in the EU as the EU is a big producer and a net exporter of cereals. The immediate impact rather lies in the increase of costs throughout the food supply chain, the disruption of trade flows from and to Ukraine and Russia, as well as to their impacts on global food security., For the EU's neighbourhood in North Africa and the Middle East though, both availability and affordability are at risk in wheat, the basic food staple, but also in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, price increases will have repercussions on net food importer countries, further pushing up the already rising number of undernourished people globally., What is the Commission doing to help third countries at risk of food insecurity?, In international fora, the EU has called on its international partners, particularly the FAO and AMIS, to provide timely guidance as food security is a global challenge and most severe consequences are facing many food-importing developing countries., For the period 2021 – 2024, the EU is pledging at least €2.5 billion (€1.4 billion for development and €1.1 billion for humanitarian aid) for international cooperation with a nutrition objective. The EU will fund development and humanitarian actions in nutrition-relevant sectors including food assistance, agriculture, water, sanitation and hygiene, social protection, health, education, to help improve nutrition outcomes. In the 2021-27 international cooperation programmes the EU will support food systems in about 70 partner countries., In the short term, humanitarian assistance should be stepped up for low-income food-deficit countries as well as countries affected by conflict in North Africa and the Middle East, in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa., Moreover, the EU will continue to strongly advocate, including in international fora, to avoid export restrictions and export bans on food. The track record shows that such restrictions are disastrous, as the 2007-8 crisis amply demonstrated in various parts of the world. WTO coordination will be essential., In the medium term, the EU will continue to support countries in the transformation towards resilient and sustainable agricultural and aquatic food systems. This includes analytical and policy support, elaborated in the context of the follow-up to the 2021 Food Systems Summit and Nutrition for Growth Summit. In this context, the EU will step up its international cooperation on food research and innovation, including playing a leadership role in the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), with particular reference to climate change adaptation and mitigation and sustainable management and protection of natural resources, applying approaches such as agro-ecology, landscape management and agro-forestry, diversification of trade flows and production systems, and reduction of food loss and waste., To increase resilience, importing countries are encouraged to ensure better diversification of sources of food supplies, through a robust bilateral and multilateral trade policy. Moreover, well-functioning global supply chains and logistics are essential for global food security., What can the Commission do to tackle rising consumer food prices?, The inflation on consumer food prices was already fast going up in several Member States before the Russian invasion of Ukraine owing to high energy and other inputs costs. Now, there is further pressure with the disruption of trade caused by the conflict. The trade in grain, energy and fertilisers is particularly affected, and this is noticeable in rising prices for these commodities. The Commission closely monitors these developments and the extent to which they will be transmitted to consumer food prices., The EU is a net food exporter and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) maintains sufficient availability of food and reasonable prices for consumers. A well-functioning food supply chain, including a competition framework that takes account of the characteristics of the agricultural sector, and a fluid single market allow for the best allocation of resources between food operators in the EU, leading to the best value for money possible for EU consumers., However the food price increase will impact low-income consumers. The first line of support for these more vulnerable groups are national social protection programmes aided by EU programmes such as the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), which supports food banks throughout the EU., Rates of Value Added Tax (VAT) on food can also be reduced down to zero to lower food costs to consumers., How will the €500 million be distributed to farmers?, While the market needs to gradually adjust to new circumstances, support is needed for producers in sectors where input costs are rising to unsustainable levels and where products cannot find their normal market outlet. In order to react efficiently and effectively against this threat of a market disturbance, the Commission will distribute national envelopes to Member States so they can support the producers in the EU agricultural sectors affected by market disturbance induced by the war in Ukraine., Member States should design measures which contribute to food security or address market imbalances. The measures should target farmers who are the hardest hit by the crisis. Support under these measures should be prioritised if they engage in one or more of the following activities pursuing these goals: circular economy, nutrient management, efficient use of resources, and environmental and climate friendly production methods. Member States should also ensure that, when farmers are not the direct beneficiaries of the payments of the Union aid, the economic benefit of the Union aid is passed on to them in full., It will be exceptionally possible to complement this EU support up to 200% with national funds., Member States will notify the Commission not later than 30 June 2022 the measures they will take, their intended impact and the criteria for granting the aid., Amounts available to Member States, Member State, EUR, Belgium, 6 268 410, Bulgaria, 10 611 143, Czechia, 11 249 937, Denmark, 10 389 359, Germany, 60 059 869, Estonia, 2 571 111, Ireland, 15 754 693, Greece, 26 298 105, Spain, 64 490 253, France, 89 330 157, Croatia, 5 354 710, Italy, 48 116 688, Cyprus, 632 153, Latvia, 4 235 161, Lithuania, 7 682 787, Luxembourg, 443 570, Hungary, 16 939 316, Malta, 69 059, Netherlands, 8 097 139, Austria, 8 998 887, Poland, 44 844 365, Portugal, 9 105 131, Romania, 25 490 649, Slovenia, 1 746 390, Slovakia, 5 239 169, Finland, 6 872 674, Sweden, 9 109 115, What is the procedure for transferring funds from the crisis reserve?, In the 2022 budget, like in previous years, a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution (""the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector"") has been established by applying a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism. It amounts to €497.3 million., The Commission will present to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal for a transfer from the reserve to the budget lines financing the support measures. The support measures will apply once the European Parliament and the Council agree to the transfer., How will the private storage for pigmeat work?, From 25 March onwards, operators will have the possibility to apply for aid to cover part of the storage costs of pigmeat, provided that they keep it out of the market for minimum 2 months up to maximum 5 months. Aid levels vary depending on the cuts put in storage. Applications can be lodged until 29 April., How can we enhance resilience by reducing dependencies on fertilisers and inputs needed for agricultural production?, The resilience of the EU agri-food sector requires diversified import sources and market outlets through an ambitious bilateral and multilateral trade policy., The EU invests already considerably in research and innovation to substitute energy-intensive inputs, such as synthetic fertilisers, and to accelerate the transition to more sustainable, resilient, and competitive farming systems. Strategies and technologies to produce bio-based alternatives with similar or improved properties from locally sourced residues will be further scaled-up. Progress in plant breeding and precision farming can also reduce the use of inputs, while producing healthier crops and higher yields. Holistic and environmentally sustainable production systems, such as mixed-farming, agroecology, or organic farming, will optimise the nutrient cycles, strengthen the resilience of the agricultural sector and use minimal levels of chemical inputs., Member States are urged to revise their CAP strategic plans with a view to support farmers in adopting practices reducing the use of fertilisers and optimising the efficiency in their applications. This can be done specifically through precision farming, but also organic farming, agro-ecology and more efficient use through advice and training on nutrient management plays an important role. Member States should fully exploit the possibilities of their CAP Strategic Plan in this regard, as well as optimising and reducing use of other inputs such as antibiotics and pesticides and engage in carbon farming., How can we reduce on dependence on feed imports?, The Farm to Fork Strategy announces actions to foster EU-grown plant proteins, to support the incorporation of alternative feed materials and to facilitate a better use of European feed resources through the use of feed additives., In addition, the ambitious targets in the Farm to Fork Strategy to avoid nutrient losses by reducing fertiliser use by at least 20% by 2030 and to reach at least 25% of EU agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, will favour the development of EU-grown protein plants, which naturally enrich the soil reducing the need for synthetic fertilisers., The future CAP also provides several supportive instruments in this respect, for instance, sectoral operational programmes that Member States may implement in the plant protein sector, eco-schemes that would reward the integration of legumes in rotation plans and coupled income support for protein crops., In the framework of Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, the EU is investing in research and innovation programme that supports activities in themes such as breeding of protein plants, feeding, sustainable use of resources, alternative proteins for feed and food, and animal health and welfare., Is the derogation on land lying fallow for crops in line with the Green Deal and the Commission's environmental ambition?, The derogation is a temporary measure for 2022 to alleviate some demand and supply disturbances in short terms for agricultural products., As an emergency measure in claim year 2022, this derogation is allowing production on fallow land for grass and crops for food and feed to enlarge the EU's production capacity., Introducing more biodiversity in the agricultural fields will continue to be an objective for environmental benefit but also for a better resilience and agronomic preservation of agricultural land in medium term perspectives., How does the Commission's plan for food security and resilience fit with the Farm to Fork strategy?, The war in Ukraine combined with an ongoing commodity price surge brings to the forefront the links between geopolitics, globalisation, climate change and food security., The Farm to Fork Strategy is an important part of our structural, medium term response. The strategy highlights the need for a resilient EU food system, something underlined by the current crisis. Striving for sustainable food systems includes reducing the input dependence of EU agriculture. In this communication, the Commission underlines the need to prioritise actions that increase yields sustainably through both technological as well as agro-ecological innovation., The contribution to the Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategies should not be abandoned or weakened. Stronger environmental and climate sustainability will increase our resilience and is therefore equally important for food security as addressing disturbances in supply of certain crops is in the short term., We were already committed to strengthening our food security framework, as a follow-up to the Commission's food security contingency plan communication. The Commission has convened on 9 March for the first time its new European Food Security Crisis preparedness & response Mechanism (EFSCM) that was put in place recently based on the Contingency plan communication, which was widely supported by the Council. The group has discussed the current situation and possible action needed to ensure food security in Europe and in the world., Member States submitted their draft CAP Strategic Plans before Russia invaded Ukraine. Will you allow them to revise their draft plans to adapt them to the radically changed context?, The Commission acknowledges that the Ukraine crisis may have consequences on the strategic plans, including the need to modify the initial proposals., In particular, there will be scope to reinforce elements of the plans aiming to strengthen resilience of the sector, reduce energy dependence and expand the sustainable production capacity., After the adoption and publication of the observation letters, the Commission will work closely with Member States to improve the Plans and introduce the necessary changes., How will the new CAP and strategic plans contribute to increasing food security and resilience?, There is a clear need to strengthen resilience, reduce energy dependence (on synthetic fertilisers and scale up the production of renewable energy) and preserve and expand sustainable production capacity. These are all core elements of sustainable agriculture and reflected in the Farm to Fork approach., This is why the Commission will support activities such as boosting sustainable biogas production and use as well as carbon removals, improving energy efficiency, extending the use of agro ecological practices and precision agriculture, reducing dependence on input and fodder imports through sustainable livestock systems and fostering protein crop production, and spreading through the transfer of knowledge the widest possible application of best practices., The Commission is assessing the Strategic Plans of Member States with these considerations of the sector's economic, environmental and social viability in mind., Press contact, Miriam GARCIA FERRER

Update 29 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (22 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,22 Mar 2022,"Ukraine has not reported any major new developments related to nuclear safety over the past 24 hours, with the regulator today informing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that safety systems are continuing to function at the country’s four operating nuclear power plants and radiation levels remain at normal levels, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., At the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), whose last reactor was shut down more than two decades ago, a new shift of technical personnel was in place after the long-delayed staff rotation that began at the weekend was completed yesterday, the regulator said. It was the first change of Ukrainian personnel there since Russian forces took control of the area on 24 February. Various radioactive waste management facilities are now located at the site of the 1986 accident., The IAEA is aware of media reports of forest fires in the area near the Chernobyl site and is seeking further information about the situation from its Ukrainian counterpart. The regulator informed the IAEA last week that it was closely monitoring the situation in the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone ahead of the annual “fire season” when spontaneous fires often occur in the area, still contaminated by radioactive material from the accident 36 years ago next month., Of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, located at four sites, the regulator said eight were now operating, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Personnel at the four operating plants were rotating in eight-hour shifts, also at the Zaporizhzhya NPP., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-29-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-22-march-2022

Between March 9 and 16, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather initial insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. While Displacement Tracking Matrix tools are being established, this general population assessment will serve as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the conflict-affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The probabilistic sample, representative at macro-region level, was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,000 respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) method. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. Population estimates assume that children travel together with their adult guardians. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-1-16-march-2022

This includes an estimated 6.5 million men, women and children who are internally displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and nearly 3.5 million people who have crossed international borders out of Ukraine as refugees, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)., Humanitarian organizations are concerned about the risk of trafficking and sexual exploitation and IOM has scaled up its trafficking prevention measures, providing verified and safe information to refugees and third-country nationals on the move. IOM has also reinforced its regional hotlines to help people with important safety and resource information. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has verified 6 additional reports of attacks on health care in Ukraine yesterday. As of 20 March, WHO has verified 52 attacks on health care in 25 days. WHO notes that this is more than 2 attacks per day, stressing that this, of course, is unacceptable and that health care must always be protected., For their part, the UN’s Children Fund and UNHCR, in partnership with local governments and civil society organizations, are setting up what they call “Blue Dots” centers. Those are one-stop safe spaces for children and women. ""Blue Dots"" centers help to identify unaccompanied and separated children and ensure their protection, as well as provide a hub for essential services and information for travelling families., The World Food Programme (WFP) said that it has reached more than 330,000 crisis-affected people inside Ukraine with food assistance, and that’s since the beginning of the conflict. Food delivery to cooperating partners is also being scaled up, reaching more than 900 metric tons over the last days. In Kharkiv, WFP doubled its bread distribution through partners, reaching nearly 78 metric tons for about 260,000 people. In Kyiv – following the delivery of 26 metric tons of high-energy biscuits – WFP’s partners have delivered about 325 metric tons of vegetable oil and 478 metric tons of wheat flour to nearly 70,000 vulnerable people. In Dnipro, some 2.2 metric tons of mixed canned food was also distributed to the most vulnerable., Last Friday, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said that the first UN-organized convoy reached Sumy with emergency supplies for 35,000 people and equipment to repair water systems to help another 50,000 people.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Mar 2022,"An MCC staff person in Ukraine, who used to work with displaced people, is now displaced herself. She talks about her experience., By Jason Dueck, In the silence that lived between the deadly warnings of air raid sirens, the sound of a small choir, singing a song of praise, echoed out of a church sanctuary in western Ukraine. Just the night before, Anna*, administrative coordinator for MCC Ukraine, had absent-mindedly hummed a few bars of the song during an evening tea break at the church., Uplifted by that quiet moment of inspiration, the church's pastor suggested some of the young people in the church record a performance of the song as an act of worship. He hoped the lyrics speaking of God's power and protection might offer spiritual comfort in a dangerous time., But this hymn about God's love and power isn't the only thing the church is offering to their neighbours. Anna and her family fled Zaporizhzhia, their home in southeastern Ukraine, as the conflict edged dangerously close. They were taken in by the church's pastor and his family near Lviv. Anna and her family immediately joined the efforts of the church to house, feed and care for as many of the masses of refugees moving to or through western Ukraine as they could manage., They've filled the upper level of the church with foam mattresses and blankets to offer rest to the weary. They're finding temporary homes for as many refugees as they can, often dozens of people each day. They pray with and for those who are without hope. And they prepare hot meals and clean water for the hungry and thirsty., All the work Anna is doing with the church and alongside other local organizations is supported by generous donations to MCC's Ukraine emergency response., For years, Anna’s work has involved supporting displaced people from other parts of the country, and now she’s having that experience from the other side. She says that even as prepared as her family was physically to flee their home, it's essentially impossible to be prepared emotionally for what it is like., ""When I came to the church [last week], I entered the building and I started to cry. I started to cry a lot, I could not stop. Because I was feeling that I lost something, or I was leaving something in the past. I understood that we are refugees now. We are far away from our home. It was only a few years ago we were serving refugees from the east of Ukraine. We had refugees in our church. And now I understand that in this time, we are refugees somewhere."", While her experience as a refugee has been emotionally and spiritually taxing, she says she's found a great deal of meaning and hope by choosing to help others experiencing the same challenges., ""I cannot imagine that a week ago I was as a refugee, like, I just came here,"" says Anna. ""But in the last few days, I was able to welcome these people who just came from these hard places. And I can see how much fear and worry they have in their eyes. But I can understand what they're feeling. And now I can invite them to the table to sit and to be there and to eat this warm meal. And I tell them that now they're in a safe place — praise the Lord — and that we have friends around the world. So I try to be useful. I try to be helpful for people who just arrived here."", In addition to Anna’s efforts near Lviv, MCC continues to respond to immediate needs in Ukraine through its local partners. In Uman and in the Cherkasy region, an MCC partner is providing lodging, meals, basic medications and food items for IDPs as well as fuel for people who are evacuating. In Zaporizhzhia, an MCC partner is delivering food baskets to the homes of individuals with disabilities. And in Avdiivka, an MCC partner is providing families that are staying in the city with food and enough funds to cover basic needs for two weeks., *Last name withheld for security.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mcc-partners-ukraine-work-meet-physical-and-spiritual-needs

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 21 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,22 Mar 2022,"Date: 22 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 21 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,510 civilian casualties in the country: 953 killed and 1,557 injured. This included:, a total of 953 killed (192 men, 142 women, 12 girls, and 26 boys, as well as 40 children and 541 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,557 injured (171 men, 132 women, 23 girls, and 19 boys, as well as 63 children and 1,149 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,078 casualties (271 killed and 807 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 827 casualties (216 killed and 611 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 251 casualties (55 killed and 196 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,432 casualties (682 killed and 750 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 22 March, 117 children had been killed and more than 155 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 21 March, 280 civilians had been killed in the region, including 15 children., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 20 March 2022 local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 21 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 21 March have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:, Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or Lori Brumat +41 22 928 91 49 / lori.brumat@un.org, Ravina Shamdasani + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-21-march-2022-enruuk

The Ukrainian people are enduring a living hell – and the reverberations are being felt worldwide with skyrocketing food, energy and fertilizer prices threatening to spiral into a global hunger crisis., Developing countries were already suffocating under the burden of COVID and lack of access to adequate financing., Now they are also paying a heavy price as a result of this war., At the same time, we cannot lose hope., From my outreach with various actors, elements of diplomatic progress are coming into view on several key issues., There is enough on the table to cease hostilities – now … and seriously negotiate -- now., This war is unwinnable. Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table.
That is inevitable., The only question is:, How many more lives must be lost?, How many more bombs must fall?, How many Mariupols must be destroyed?, How many Ukrainians and Russians will be killed before everyone realizes that this war has no winners — only losers?, How many more people will have to die in Ukraine, and how many people around the world will have to face hunger for this to stop?, Continuing the war in Ukraine is morally unacceptable, politically indefensible and militarily nonsensical., What I said from this podium almost one month ago should be even more evident today., By any measure – by even the shrewdest calculation -- it is time to stop the fighting now and give peace a chance., It is time to end this absurd war., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-generals-remarks-press-war-ukraine-22-march-2022-enuk
Ukraine: Protection of LGBTI and gender-diverse refugees remains critical – UN expert,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (22 March 2022) - As the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine intensifies, it is essential for States and all stakeholders engaged in protecting forcibly displaced persons to recognise and respond to the uniquely gendered exposure to risk and protection needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex (LGBTI) and gender-diverse refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced and undocumented people, a UN expert said today., Victor Madrigal-Borloz, UN Independent Expert on protection from violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, expressed his deep concern about evidence being brought to his attention confirming that exposure to dangers faced by people who seek protection during this time is greatly exacerbated for those who identify as LGBTI and/or gender-diverse. He issues the following statement:, “LGBTI and gender-diverse people are vulnerable to acts of stigmatisation, harassment and violence from both armed combatants and civilians, whether such acts are opportunistically motivated, connected to larger social discriminatory patterns, or the result of explicit, targeted political repression., After carrying out an official visit to Ukraine in 2019 I observed achievements and challenges. I lament that the military operation by the Russian Federation and the ensuing armed conflict will destroy decades of progress in the fight against discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity in law, in access to justice, and in public policy, including the health, education, employment and housing sectors., In addition to the challenges existing before the onset of the military invasion, LGBTI and gender-diverse persons are experiencing specific and particularly acute persecutory risks during the armed conflict and humanitarian response efforts. A particularly telling example is that of trans and gender-diverse people whose legal identity documents do not correspond with their gender or physical presentation, who encounter severe difficulties at checkpoints, border crossings, reception centers, health facilities and other critical locations. This includes challenges in evacuating from civilian enclaves through humanitarian corridors, securing medical exemptions from male-only compulsory military service, being admitted at border crossings as refugees, and accessing safe housing with adequate sanitation facilities, sensitive medical care and reproductive rights services. These barriers increase the likelihood of some people being forced to seek irregular routes to safety, with the attendant risks of trafficking, exploitation, and abuse., In armed conflicts, LGBTI and gender-diverse displaced people are often marginalised or excluded from many established evacuation and emergency response services and processes, especially those operating in environments where being of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity is seen to be politically sensitive, thus leaving many to fend for themselves and exposing them to risks of abuse and violence along transport routes, at border crossings, in reception centers, collective shelters, camp settings and health facilities., The protection of LGBTI and gender-diverse people is a human rights imperative and should not be subject to political discretion. In armed conflict, robust human rights monitoring mechanisms stand prepared to take all measures necessary to protect the human rights of each party in the conflict. LGBTI and gender-diverse people are not exceptionally exempt from exercising their rights in such situations., I welcome the actions of many States, particularly those neighboring Ukraine, to admit people fleeing conflict into their territories, as well to the EU in offering temporary protection to those fleeing the conflict and underscore that those providing protection and assistance must strengthen their ability to respond effectively to displaced people whose sexual orientation and gender identity exacerbates their exposure to risk. In that respect, civil society organisations that serve LGBTI and gender-diverse displaced people are frequently the best positioned to provide specialised knowledge on how sexual orientation or gender identity creates specific exposures to risk during this conflict, as well as how to respond most effectively., States and humanitarian agencies must ensure that civil society organisations with such expertise are included in the planning and implementation of all humanitarian assistance and recovery efforts. I have received abundant information to the fact that LGBTI-represented groups are organising themselves and using their significant knowledge to respond to this crisis and to best address the needs of forcibly displaced people who are LGBTI and gender-diverse. These organisations have been at the forefront of mobilising solutions to the crisis., I call on States, members of the international community, security forces, humanitarian, human rights, and development cooperation allies to pay the necessary attention to the vulnerability and protection needs of LGBTI and gender-diverse people who have been forcibly displaced. This is a critical moment to come together and establish the foundation for effective and meaningful mechanisms that not only protect LGBTI and gender-diverse people in situations of armed conflict, but also ensure their full participation in political, peace and accountability processes once hostilities cease.”, ENDS, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, The Experts are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Protection and Human Rights",22 Mar 2022,"New York, 22 March 2022 - As armed conflict continues to rage in Ukraine, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC), Virginia Gamba, is urgently calling attention on the plight of Ukrainian children who have been uprooted, their schools as well as medical facilities closed, destroyed, damaged, or used for military purposes, and their physical integrity and well-being constantly threatened by the ravages of conflict., The Special Representative is particularly worried about the information on growing numbers of killing and maiming of civilians, including children, attacks on schools and hospitals, and the denial of humanitarian access. She further reminds that the recruitment and use of children is prohibited under international law and that regardless of their roles, under no circumstances should children below 18 years be involved in armed conflict., “When parties to armed conflict cannot find common ground for the peaceful resolution of their disputes; when military action primes over humanitarian concerns; when the dread of war continues to uproot populations, time has come to place children at the heart of negotiations and strive to find common ground, for the children’s sake,” the Special Representative said., “I urge all parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine to resolutely engage in meaningful peace negotiations. Hostilities must cease for the sake of Ukrainian children. Political and military considerations must take second place when the lives, protection and well-being of children are at stake,” she reminded., The Special Representative also urged parties to immediately cease attacks on schools and hospitals, on related protected personnel and to not use these facilities for military purposes., Furthermore, she issued a reminder that uprooted children are at their most vulnerable and all must be done to ensure their protection. “We must be vigilant and redouble our efforts to ensure that these children do not fall prey to human predators, continue their education and be provided with the assurances that their interests and needs will be prioritized wherever they are,” she added., Note to editors: The Children and Armed Conflict mandate reports and verifies on six grave violations common in situations of armed conflict. The six grave violations are recruitment and use, killing and maiming, rape and other forms of sexual violence, abduction, attacks on schools and hospitals and denial of humanitarian access to children., For additional information, please contact:, Fabienne Vinet, Communications Officer, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict

Ukraine Crisis: Save the Children calls for immediate halt on intercountry adoptions to keep children safe,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,22 Mar 2022,"KYEV, 22 March 2022 – Save the Children has called for an immediate ban on intercountry adoptions of children uprooted by the war in Ukraine to protect them from further risk of harm at the hands of traffickers or child abusers until appropriate safeguards are in place., The child rights organisation warned that during mass movement of refugees, well-meaning people may attempt to ‘rescue’ children from the crisis-affected area in the mistaken belief that they will be better cared for in other environments., But the child rights organisation stressed that the best place for children is with their families and communities and adoption is not an appropriate response for unaccompanied children until authorities and agencies have made all efforts to trace and reunite them with their families., The organisation also warned that not everybody attempting to foster or adopt children from Ukraine does so with the best intentions, and that child traffickers can exploit a lack of rigorous safeguarding systems in place at the early stages in a crisis., Save the Children is calling on states to support a moratorium on all adoptions until appropriate safeguards can be reinstated for the unaccompanied children who have fled Ukraine and those who have been uprooted within the country., Save the Children staff in Romania have seen some children arriving from Ukraine unaccompanied, having been sent by family members unable to leave the country but wanting their children to be safe from ground attack and aerial explosions. Other children have been separated from their families in the chaos of fleeing their homes. Many of those arriving are aged under 14 and showing signs of psychological distress, the organisation said., Amanda Brydon, Global Head for Child Protection Advocacy for Save the Children said: “As in any crisis, children on their own in Ukraine and neighbouring countries are at increased risk of abuse, exploitation, trafficking and neglect. Every effort must be made to ensure safeguards are in place to protect them from abuse., “Sadly, we have seen this before in other humanitarian emergencies: children are often mistaken as orphans or are ‘rescued’ out of crisis-affected areas in the mistaken belief that they will be better cared for away from the devastation caused by conflict or natural disasters all while family members are still looking for them at home., “There is so much upheaval in a child’s life during this time that the best place for them is with their families, relatives and communities, rather than being removed to a foreign country and language. The most protective environment for a child is the safety and stability of their own family., “At this stage of this crisis, an immediate moratorium on intercountry adoptions is critical to ensure that children are safe, and that where possible and in their best interests, they are reunited with their caregivers or verified family members. Sending funds to trusted humanitarian agencies for their response to this crisis is one of the best ways to be able to support such children currently.”, Ukraine has suspended its intercountry adoption program until further notice in light of the Russian military operation that began on 24 February. However, it is important for receiving countries to also suspend intercountry adoption proceedings to ensure the appropriate international standards and safeguards, Save the Children said[i]., Save the Children is working to support families to stay together as they move from Ukraine and to ensure protection when children are identified as unaccompanied in Poland and Romania, working in close coordination with child protection authorities in these countries., So far more than 1.5 million children have fled the war in Ukraine in the past four weeks while an estimated 6 million remain in the country, in grave risk of physical and emotional harm., Notes to editors, Save the Children has been operating in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Throughout the eight-year conflict, we have been delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families, including distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses. Our specialist support children in having access to safe, inclusive, quality education and are working with schools and community centres to help children overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their resilience and ability to cope with stresses in their daily lives., We now have a team in Poland, coordinating with local partners to assess the situation and respond to needs as quickly as we can. Save the Children is working here to establish family tracing and reunification procedures with other agencies to help reunite children with extended family and friends in Poland and neighbouring countries, as well as to establish child protection systems and reporting mechanisms to keep children safe., In Romania, Save the Children staff and volunteers continue to help refugees arriving from Ukraine at the border and in reception centres with provision of basic non-food items and other outreach services., For many years now, Save the Children has been working with refugee and migrant children inside and outside of Europe, aiming to support vulnerable children with the greatest needs. We run reception centres providing child friendly activities and work on informing children about their rights in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Norway. In Italy, we also support relocation efforts, train temporary legal guardians who assist children during their asylum procedures, and work with UN agencies to ensure unaccompanied children are protected., You can donate to Save the Children’s Children Emergency Fund, which supports children affected by crises, such as the Ukraine conflict, here., ENDS, [i] According to the 1993 Adoption Convention and 1996 Child Protection Convention, all receiving States should apply its standards and safeguards (when cooperating with Ukraine), including during a situation of armed conflict., https://www.hcch.net/en/news-archive/details/?varevent=854, For further enquiries please contact:, Emily Wight, Emily.Wight@savethechildren.org, Anna Rauhanen, Anna.Rauhanen@savethechildren.org, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-save-children-calls-immediate-halt-intercountry-adoptions-keep

To coordinate the best possible care for these patients, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism expands its reserve with a new medical evacuation airplane. The airplane has been financed by the EU and is hosted by Norway, a Participating State to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism., The new medical evacuation plane has been developed to address shortcomings in case of emergency needs for patients affected by highly infectious diseases and is part of rescEU, the common European reserve of resources., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: ""I thank Norway for the swift implementation of the agreement. The new airplane enters into service when we need it the most. This brutal war in Ukraine has forced millions to flee, including vulnerable patients whose lives depend on urgent medical care. With this new addition to the rescEU fleet, the EU ensures that we have an increased capacity to help people across the continent, in today's and future crises."", In addition to the medical evacuation to Norway, using the rescEU capacity, the EU has transferred chronically ill Ukrainian refugees from Poland to Italy and Ireland., These evacuations have been financially and operationally supported by the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and the EU Early Warning and Response System. More evacuation operations of Ukrainian patients are underway, for example from Poland to Germany and Denmark., The strategic medical evacuation plane for patients with highly infectious diseases is part of the wider rescEU reserve, which includes other capabilities such as firefighting airplanes and helicopters, stockpiles that include items for medical emergencies as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear., rescEU constitutes an extra layer of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, reinforcing cross-border disaster preparedness and contributing to boost the EU's ability to better respond to emergencies., Following the activation of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, rescEU ensures a faster and more comprehensive response to disasters. rescEU capabilities are 100% EU-financed and the European Commission, in close cooperation with the country hosting the reserve, is coordinating the operation., In an emergency, the rescEU reserve provides assistance to all EU Member States and the Participating States to the Mechanism, and can also be deployed to EU neighbouring countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-first-resceu-medical-evacuation-plane-enters-service-help-transfer-ukrainian

Between 24 and 19 March, the OHCHR recorded 2,361 civilian casualties, including 902 people killed, however, these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA). On 20 March, a missile struck a shopping centre in northern Kyiv, destroying the building and resulting in the death of at least eight people., Meanwhile, in the Sumy region, shelling of a chemical plant led to a leak in a 50 tonne tank of ammonia on 21 March, with one person at the chemical plant injured., Ukraine has rejected a demand from the Russian Federation to surrender the city of Mariupol, which has been the centre of continued shelling over the past week. The Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine called for the negotiation of a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol, as food and drinking water have become increasingly scarce for civilians trapped in the city. As of 21 March, only eight humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon by the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation, limiting opportunities for civilian evacuation in the midst of continued shelling., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 19 March, over 3.3 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. IOM estimates that the war has already resulted in the internal displacement of around 6.48 million people. Under the European Union’s Temporary Protection Directive, Member States are working to provide immediate support and resettlement pathways for Ukrainian refugees, while humanitarian partners in coordination with consular authorities and participating governments have begun facilitating repatriation services, temporary relocation, and resettlement for displaced third country nationals. For both crisis-affected people outside of Ukraine, as well as internally displaced people, access to information on the availability and location of life-saving humanitarian aid, legal residency and employment, transportation, and the evolving situation in the country and at border control points remains limited. IOM, together with NGO partners and local authorities, is establishing information points, sharing updated information on local services, and expanding its network of information hotlines and referral pathways.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-9-21-march-2022

Currently, FCA supports Hungarian Interchurch Aid (HIA) who is assisting people in Hungary, the Transcarpathia region and in Lviv with food, water, hygiene items and life-saving medical equipment., “Finns have donated generously to our response to aid those who have been affected by the war in Ukraine and we are responding now and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Our experience serving refugees in other countries, particularly in education, will be invaluable in assisting those inside and outside Ukraine, especially women and children,” says Jouni Hemberg, Executive Director, FCA., 15,254 people have already been assisted by the joint efforts of FCA and HIA by the delivery of seven million euro of life-saving medical equipment to Western Ukraine and 278 metric tons of food and other essential items to a number of locations where displaced people are located. HIA has established reception centres for those who have fled the conflict, both on the Hungary-Ukraine border and in Budapest., “Some of these people have left their home in ten or twenty minutes – they have left everything behind. Their journey to Lviv and further has taken 24 hours or more. Some of the families have been living in shelters for days, even weeks.

Running the health response to Ukraine’s emergency: Interview with WHO Representative Jarno Habicht [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",21 Mar 2022,"Jarno Habicht has worked with WHO for the last 19 years and served as WHO Representative (WR) in Ukraine since 2018. He answers questions about WHO’s preparation for armed conflicts in the country and its health-related humanitarian response since the Russian military offensive and war began., What was your experience in Ukraine before the current Russian military offensive started?, “Ukraine has been the most dynamic country to work in from a health perspective. Since 2014, 3.4 million people in the Donbas region of south-eastern Ukraine have needed health-related humanitarian assistance. In addition, when I started working here, the measles outbreak in the country was the second largest in the world, before our team helped in efforts to respond to it. And of course, we then had COVID-19 to deal with since 2020, so I have been working closely with the government to develop a national COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, and been active in our pandemic response across the whole country. Then, late last year, a polio outbreak was detected, so we started working, together with the Ministry of Health and partners, to get all children from the ages of 6 months to 6 years vaccinated. Since 2016, Ukraine has been in a process of reform and, even with all these health emergencies going on, government reforms of the health system to move towards universal health coverage didn’t stop. New institutions have been created and new practices applied. All in all, as a public health professional, it has been very challenging, but very rewarding, to be working in Ukraine all these years.”, How long has WHO been preparing for the possible escalation of the conflict in Ukraine?, “In Ukraine, we have always worked on emergency preparedness, but we started to do more hands-on work in October/November last year. This included visits to oblasts in the eastern part of Ukraine, filling our warehouses with supplies and delivering to selected hospitals, and bringing in colleagues from the Regional Office and headquarters to assess our operations. In December, we also set up our emergency medical teams, briefed authorities, and translated WHO guidelines and materials focused on armed conflicts into Ukrainian., Early this year, we also pre-positioned trauma supplies – essential life-saving materials and treatments for injuries – in our warehouses and hospitals, and Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO Regional Director, made a special visit to the country to discuss what needed to be done from a health perspective in the face of escalating violence.”, How did you feel when the Russian military offensive started?, “At the end of February, when the military offensive started, it was the school holidays, so people were perhaps feeling more relaxed than usual – making the attack even more of a shock. We had just signed a Biennial Collaborative Agreement between WHO and the national health authorities in January to take the health agenda further, so were really looking forward to all the positive changes we could make. We were also supposed to have a WHO- and World Bank-supported national conference on hospital reforms at the end of March, and were preparing to celebrate World Health Day on 7 April to make progress on primary health care. All of these initiatives had to be put on hold. The last weeks have involved learning, reflecting and coming to terms with the situation, because even though we have been preparing for hostilities for a long time, and more intensely in the last 4 or 5 months, none of us thought this would actually happen to such an extent.”, How has the WHO Country Office adapted in response to the war?, “We have a very agile, dynamic team – we work from wherever we are. Some colleagues have relocated; some colleagues have temporarily evacuated; some colleagues have also arrived into Ukraine. One thing we learned from the COVID-19 emergency is that, wherever you are, you are virtually connected to colleagues. We have daily online meetings involving staff in 20-plus countries. We also have more than 60 colleagues in Ukraine, some in Kyiv, some elsewhere.”, What has WHO been able to do to support the health response in Ukraine?, “I'm very proud that, due to our experience and team spirit, we are one of the UN agencies which has been able to deliver goods to Kyiv and other cities. Moreover, in all my 19 years of experience with WHO, I have never felt the 3 levels of WHO – headquarters, Regional Office and Country Office – come so closely together, listen to each other and prioritize the response. We are finding solutions and we really are getting our best brains and people together to respond. That’s how we got medical supplies from Dubai to Poland, from Poland to Ukraine, and from Ukraine to individual hospitals across the country. Our WHO Country Office is just a small team, but we are able to mobilize thousands across the whole organization to support Ukraine.”, How would you describe the current health and humanitarian situation in the country?, “It's changing daily. In less than a month, over 3 million people have left the country and nearly 2 million have been internally displaced. This has happened faster than in any previous European crisis. There is no safe place in Ukraine right now, yet we need to ensure that health services are available., Meanwhile, the military offensive continues, with a number of cities being entirely isolated – people are running out of food and water, and hospitals might not have electricity. Worse still, we have seen many attacks on health workers and health facilities as well as patients. This is happening daily and is unacceptable. So, if you ask me how to describe it, every day things are getting worse, which means every day the health response is becoming more difficult.”, How are you and your staff coping with the situation?, “Personally, I tend to work. It’s also important to sleep – fortunately for me, the more stressed I am, the better I sleep! Honestly, though, it's difficult, especially as everything I own is in Kyiv: my clothes, my apartment. But most importantly, I have my health and energy to support Ukraine. Dealing with all of this is hard and all of us have stories to be told at a later time., Over the last week we have been refocusing and regrouping to respond to the enormous health challenges the country now faces. 3 weeks ago, we dreamed that we could still do some of our development work, but the huge scale of the humanitarian crisis must be recognized. Right now, we need to focus on the humanitarian response, but also start thinking about the recovery phase, not knowing whether this war will end in the near future, or if it will last for a long time.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/running-health-response-ukraine-s-emergency-interview-who-representative-jarno

Update 28 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (21 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,21 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that the long-delayed rotation of technical staff at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) was completed today, enabling them to go home and rest for the first time since Russian forces took control of the site last month, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine’s regulatory authority said about half of the outgoing shift of technical staff left the site of the 1986 accident yesterday and the rest followed today, with the exception of thirteen staff members who declined to rotate. Most Ukrainian guards also remained at the site, it added., Damaged roads and bridges had complicated the transportation of staff to the nearby city of Slavutych, the regulator said. The staff had been at Chornobyl since the day before Russian forces took control of the site on 24 February. They left after handing over operations to newly arrived Ukrainian colleagues who replaced them after nearly four weeks., The new work shift also comes from Slavutych and includes two supervisors instead of the usual one to ensure that there is back-up available on the site, the regulator said. An agreement had been reached on how to organize future staff rotations at the NPP, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located, it said., Director General Grossi, who had repeatedly expressed deep concern about the well-being of the Ukrainian staff at the Chornobyl NPP, welcomed the completion of the staff rotation and again praised them for their courage and tireless efforts in carrying out their vital work tasks during extremely difficult and stressful conditions in the presence of foreign military forces., The Director General said he was continuing consultations with a view to agreeing on a framework aimed at ensuring the safety and security of all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. “With this framework in place, the Agency would be able to provide effective technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of these facilities,” he said., In southern Ukraine, the two operating units of the Zaporizhzhya NPP continued to operate at two thirds of their maximum capacity of around 1000 Megawatt electric (MWe) each after the repair last week of two power lines, one off-site and one on-site, the regulator said. The Zaporizhzhya NPP now has three high voltage (750 kV) off-site power lines available, including one on standby. The regulator reiterated that the safety systems were fully functional at the NPP, which is controlled by Russian forces since 4 March., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational NPPs, the Ukrainian regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including the two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range and safety systems are operating, it said., A research reactor in the capital Kyiv was in a safe shutdown state, the regulator said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-28-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-21-march-2022

They met with refugees; members of Polish civil society; and United Nations, U.S. government, and Polish officials., The Ukraine Crisis, As a result of the Russian invasion, Ukraine is in a human rights and humanitarian crisis. About 6.48 million people are estimated to be displaced within the borders of Ukraine, and more than 3.3 million people have fled Ukraine, becoming refugees. The vast majority of refugees are women and children, who are at particular risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation, and gender-based violence. More than 2 million of the refugees are in Poland., The Global Response, The speed and breadth of the international response to the crisis has been unprecedented and generous, with the European Union, the United States, and other donor governments contributing generously to aid efforts. The EU is providing legal status and protections to people who have sought or are seeking refuge from the war in EU countries. A very welcome development, it stands in sharp contrast to European responses to refugee flight from outside the continent—but should be the norm., Refugees in Poland (And Elsewhere in the Region), The generous refugee response mobilized in Poland is impressive and heartwarming. Volunteers have largely been the backbone of the effort, with provincial governments (voivodeships) offering varying levels of support—and in many respects playing catch up. In Poland and other receiving countries, the UN, EU, and other donors must support governments and civil society to meet refugees’ reception and integration needs in the immediate and longer term. These include safe accommodation, medical and mental healthcare, and access to education and employment. An effective response will be grounded in local civil society organizations, investing in their capacity to scale existing services. Swiftly developing government initiatives to responsibly collect and share information about aid efforts within and across borders is necessary to strengthen protections and avoid trafficking, exploitation, and other rights abuses in the region., Unfortunately, non-Ukrainians—in particular Black and brown individuals—who have fled Ukraine have faced greater obstacles in reception and integration, with problems emerging on both sides of borders. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the EU, and other leaders have publicly urged that everyone fleeing Ukraine be allowed into the EU, regardless of race or nationality., The Humanitarian Crisis within Ukraine’s Borders, Even as States take on the responsibility of welcoming refugees fleeing Ukraine—a challenge Europe can manage—they must give urgent attention to what is emerging as a far more formidable challenge: the humanitarian emergency within Ukraine. Conflict, and especially the Russian bombardment of civilian institutions and inability of civilians to flee in safety, has created an overwhelming internal crisis, exacerbating an already dire situation. Moreover, several factors suggest that the situation will become even more desperate. In particular, as the Russian military’s offensive has become frustrated, it is laying siege to population centers and creating enormous suffering., War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in Ukraine, Refugees International is persuaded that the Russian military and the Russian government are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. They must end such abuses and must be held accountable for a broad range of widespread, indiscriminate, and what clearly appear to be cruel, deliberate, and unprovoked attacks against civilians in Ukraine and against civilian institutions., Recommendations, Ending the Conflict, Refuge and Protection Outside Ukraine, The UN Secretary General and interested governments—including the government of China—must press Russian President Vladimir Putin to guarantee Ukrainian civilians’ safe passage to more secure areas within Ukraine and to countries that will offer genuine protection for those seeking to flee Ukraine. Countries bordering Ukraine should continue providing unencumbered access to territory., EU Member States must swiftly implement the EU Temporary Protection Directive in an inclusive way to provide safety and support for all those who need protection., Governments in countries receiving refugees must prioritize registration procedures that collect data disaggregated by age, gender, origin, and other factors, and should take advantage of available EU funding and resources to effectively share responsibility for refugee reception with a view towards integration. This includes sustaining a community-based reception model and avoiding refugee camps., Governments and organizations, informed by refugees themselves, should design and implement programming tailored to the specific needs of the people fleeing Ukraine, who are largely women and children. This should include transitional cash and cash-for-work programs, trafficking and gender-based violence prevention, and access to mental healthcare and childcare. Continuous monitoring can help ensure the response adapts to meet changing needs. The UN and European governments should provide adequate resources and coordination support, as necessary, to sustain a response that benefits refugees and their host communities., The United States and other donor countries should direct significant financial support to the governments of refugee-receiving countries bordering Ukraine, in accordance with their level of need. Donors should work with national governments to ensure that aid is provided to NGOs and officials working at local levels in each of these countries., The UN Secretary General, the U.S. Secretary of State, EU leaders, and European governments should press Poland and other nations bordering Ukraine to ensure that non-Ukrainian nationals are treated fairly and without discrimination, including in accessing safe territory and adequate reception conditions, and receiving protection and integration support if unable to return to their countries of origin., As part of an international responsibility-sharing effort, U.S. President Joe Biden should immediately announce that he will authorize, on an emergency basis, the resettlement of at least 100,000 Ukrainian refugees over the next two years., Humanitarian Assistance Within the Borders of Ukraine, The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the EU through its Civil Protection Mechanism, and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) must accelerate efforts to develop an assistance support infrastructure in Ukraine. Donor governments must commit to sustain the generous levels of support that will be necessary and prioritize delivering aid through local organizations in Ukraine or in the region., Humanitarian aid should respond to civilians’ needs for immediate relief, including food, water, safe shelter, and medical care (including medical evacuations), and prioritize cash-based assistance wherever practical. Aid should also support early recovery efforts., Armed forces should guarantee safe and unimpeded access to civilians in need for humanitarian actors to deliver life-saving aid. This includes establishing and preserving safe humanitarian corridors for the movement of goods and people., Accountability for Abuses of International Humanitarian Law (The Laws of Armed Conflict), The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) should intensify the investigation relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has been supported by a number of governments., The United States government should publicly support the ICC effort.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/crisis-ukraine-humanitarian-and-human-rights-imperatives

As of 20 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 2,421 civilian casualties, including 925 killed, figures that are likely much higher. In less than a month, the confirmed civilian death toll has already reached the equivalent of 70 per cent of all confirmed civilian deaths over the last seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine combined., • On 19 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people was destroyed by bombing in Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east). This comes after last week’s bombing of the city’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre – where more than 1,000 people had sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities. At the time of writing, the number of civilian casualties remains unclear., • On 20 March, heavy shelling in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north) reportedly left at least eight people dead and another injured. As clashes intensify in the capital and other areas of Kvivska oblast, a 35-hour curfew has been imposed across the oblast from 8:00 p.m. (EET) on 21 March to 7:00 a.m. on 23 March., • Between 18 and 20 March, more than 13,000 people were evacuated from Mariupol. There are unconfirmed reports that people fleeing areas of the city allegedly controlled by the Russian Federation forces are being forced to evacuate towards non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) and the Russian Federation with their Ukrainian passports confiscated. These alleged incidents of forced displacement would constitute a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions., • Donetska oblast authorities (Government-controlled areas, GCA) say thousands who have fled the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol now face starvation in Manhush and Melekine (Donetska oblast, NGCA), as they are once again trapped without safe passage out of locations where food and water are becoming increasingly scarce., • As of 20 March, Donetska oblast authorities report damage to at least 10 health facilities, more than 320 educational facilities and nearly 1,110 residential buildings, among other critical civilian infrastructure damaged or destroyed., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Civilian causalities: Civilian casualties across Ukraine continue to rise. As of 20 March, OHCHR reports 2,421 civilian casualties, including 925 killed, figures that are likely much higher as limited humanitarian access prevents corroboration in the hardest-hit areas. In just 24 days, the confirmed civilian death toll has already reached the equivalent of around 70 per cent of all confirmed civilian deaths over the last seven years of fighting in eastern Ukraine combined – 1,320 civilians were killed between 2015 and 2021., In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, OHCHR reports 1,017 casualties (256 killed and 761 injured in GCA, and 55 killed and 190 injured in NGCA), and 1,404 civilian casualties in other parts of Ukraine. These figures do not reflect civilian casualties in the worst-affected cities in eastern Ukraine, including Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetska oblast). In Mariupol alone, the number of civilian casualties has already reached 20,000 people – including more than 3,000 possibly killed – according to municipal authorities, although the actual figure remains unknown., Overnight on 19-20 March, at least five civilians were killed, including a child, after attacks in Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast, east). In neighboring Luhanska oblast, at least two dozen homes and apartment buildings were destroyed by attacks in Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk that left at least three dead, including two children. Meanwhile, residential homes were allegedly shelled in the strategic southern port city Odesa (Odeska oblast, south-west) on 21 March. Local authorities have not reported any civilian casualties., On 20 March, heavy shelling of a residential area in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv damaged four schools, six apartment buildings and destroyed a shopping mall, reportedly leaving at least eight people dead and another injured. As clashes intensify in the capital and other areas of Kyivska oblast, a 35-hour curfew has been imposed across the oblast from 8:00 p.m. (EET) on 21 March to 7:00 a.m. on 23 March., Environmental hazards: Amid ongoing fighting, the potential for an environmental health catastrophe looms on the horizon. As of 21 March, the air pollution level in Kyiv remains categorized as unhealthy, with the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration in the capital currently more than 12 times higher than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) air quality guideline value. In a positive development, nearly half of the Chernobyl nuclear plant’s staff were able to rotate and return to their homes on 20 March after working non-stop for nearly a month after the Russian Federation troops allegedly occupied the plant on 24 February., On 21 March, another potentially serious environmental health concern emerged when the Sumykhimprom chemical factory in Novoselytsia (Sumska oblast, north-east) – located just 6 km south-east of the city of Sumy – started leaking ammonia after being shelled, contaminating a roughly 2.5 km-zone around the facility. Oblast authorities advised residents near the factory to seek refuge in shelters and basements for protection, as local emergency services responded to the potentially dangerous incident, which they say does not pose a threat to the approximately 250,000 people living in nearby Sumy., Displacement: To date, nearly 6.5 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine, while almost 3.4 million have fled across international borders – more than 2 million of whom have sought refuge in Poland alone. People on the move are extremely vulnerable to a myriad of potential health and protection risks, while local capacities in host communities receiving growing numbers of displaced people are already stretched to the brink., Forcibly displaced people urgently need basic shelter and protection. Amid harsh winter conditions and the growing risk of disease outbreaks, including a new wave of COVID-19, the establishment of camp-like settings for displaced people will likely create more challenges for affected people and the humanitarian response than it will create conditions for durable solutions to widescale displacement and needs. As such, UN agencies and humanitarian partners will roll out cash-for-rent assistance as part of the wider multi-purpose cash response strategy, providing affected people with the resources they need to find appropriate accommodations and avoid the mushrooming of displacement camps across the country., More than 12 million people remain stranded within affected areas across Ukraine, unable to leave due to ongoing clashes, destruction of bridges and roads, and a lack of resources or information on where to find safety and appropriate accommodation. These people are among the most vulnerable in Ukraine, directly exposed to heightened insecurity and almost completely cut off from basic supplies, including food, water and medicine., Eastern Ukraine: The humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine remains the biggest concern. More than 200,000 people are now without access to water across Donetska oblast, with new localities being affected each day. As the scope and scale of clashes in the oblast increase, there are growing concerns that all of Donetska oblast could be cut off from the water supply in the coming weeks, leaving millions of people without access to water. As of 20 March, Donetska oblast authorities report damage to at least 10 health facilities, more than 320 educational facilities, nearly 1,110 residential buildings, 15 heating and water facilities, 30 gas pipelines, 34 electricity facilities, 21 bridges and 18 railway facilities., In neighboring Luhanska oblast, constant shelling has destroyed around 80 per cent of some localities, leaving nearly 100,000 users without electricity. Humanitarian needs in communities in and around the so-called contact line have grown exponentially compared to before the recent escalation, as fighting expands into new areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, exacerbating underlying needs accumulated over eight years of armed conflict., In Mariupol, despite slowly growing evacuations, hundreds of thousands of people have remained trapped inside the encircled city for several weeks, lacking access to the most basic necessities for survival. On 19 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people was destroyed by bombing. This comes after last week’s bombing of Mariupol’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre – where more than 1,000 people had sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities. In both instances, although some survivors have been pulled from the rubble, the number of casualties remains unknown, as hundreds are likely still trapped beneath the rubble while active hostilities hinder search-and-rescue operations., Evacuations: Between 18 and 20 March, the Government of Ukraine says more than 23,000 people were reportedly evacuated from the hardest-hit areas of the country, including more than 13,000 evacuated from Mariupol via Berdiansk en route to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east). There are unconfirmed reports that people fleeing areas of Mariupol allegedly controlled by the Russian Federation forces are being forced to evacuate towards NGCA and the Russian Federation with their Ukrainian passports confiscated. On 19 March, local authorities reported that between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents were forcibly moved across the border into the south-west of the Russian Federation. According to the Ukrainian Ombudsperson, such incidents of forced displacement constitute a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions., Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported that around 347,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine towards the Russian Federation since the escalation of hostilities, including 16,054 people during the past 24 hours. This includes people who have reportedly been evacuated and those who have crossed the border seeking refuge on their own. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., As conditions grow increasingly desperate, there is a growing number of spontaneous evacuations out of Mariupol and other affected cities without any security guarantees for residents fleeing ongoing fighting. Even for those fortunate enough to escape Mariupol, Donetska oblast authorities say thousands who have fled the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol now face starvation in Manhush and Melekine (Donetska oblast, NGCA), as they are once again trapped without safe passage out of localities where food and water are becoming increasingly scarce.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-21-march-2022

His addressed focused on “Keeping 1.5 Alive”. The Secretary-General warned that, while some progress was made at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021, the main emissions gap problem was not properly addressed. “We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,” the Secretary-General said, quoting the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which says that half of humanity is already living in the danger zone., The Secretary-General also said the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine risks upending global food and energy markets, with major implications for the global climate agenda. He warned that countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness, he said, adding that [addiction] to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction. The Secretary-General urged countries to put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future. His full remarks and video were all shared with you earlier., Ukraine, A quite lengthy humanitarian update for you on Ukraine: we, along with our partners, remain deeply concerned over the impact of reported fighting on civilians trapped in cities in eastern, north-eastern and southern Ukraine, including in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Izyum, Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Mariupol. Since 24 February, more than 10 million people have now been forced from their homes in search of safety and security — nearly a quarter of the population of Ukraine. This includes an estimated 6.5 million men, women and children who are internally displaced, and that’s according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and nearly 3.5 million people who have crossed international borders out of Ukraine as refugees, and that’s according to Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)., Humanitarian organizations are concerned about the risk of trafficking and sexual exploitation and IOM has scaled up its trafficking prevention measures, providing verified and safe information to refugees and third-country nationals on the move. IOM has also reinforced its regional hotlines to help people with important safety and resource information. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has verified six additional reports of attacks on health care in Ukraine yesterday. As of 20 March, WHO has verified 52 attacks on health care in 25 days. WHO notes that this is more than two attacks per day, stressing that this, of course, is unacceptable and that health care must always be protected. For their part, the UN Children Fund (UNICEF) and UNHCR, in partnership with local governments and civil society organizations, are setting up what they call “Blue Dots” centres. Those are one-stop safe spaces for children and women. “Blue Dots” centres help to identify unaccompanied and separated children and ensure their protection, as well as provide a hub for essential services and information for travelling families., The World Food Programme (WFP) said that it has reached more than 330,000 crisis-affected people inside Ukraine with food assistance, and that’s since the beginning of the conflict. Food delivery to cooperating partners is also being scaled up, reaching more than 900 metric tons over the last days. In Kharkiv, WFP doubled its bread distribution through partners, reaching nearly 78 metric tons for about 260,000 people. In Kyiv — following the delivery of 26 metric tons of high-energy biscuits — WFP’s partners have delivered about 325 metric tons of vegetable oil and 478 metric tons of wheat flour to nearly 70,000 vulnerable people. In Dnipro, some 2.2 metric tons of mixed canned food was also distributed to the most vulnerable. As you will have seen last Friday, our Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said that the first UN-organized convoy reached Sumy with emergency supplies for 35,000 people and equipment to repair water systems to help another 50,000 people. This was organized through good cooperation with the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. We hope that this is the first of many convoys that will make to deliveries to people trapped by the fighting., Yemen, A quick note on Yemen: I can tell you we strongly condemn the recent attacks on several energy and other civilian facilities in Saudi Arabia, which reportedly caused material damage and have been claimed by the Houthis. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited by international humanitarian law. These actions damage prospects for peace and regional stability and are detrimental to the ongoing mediation efforts of our Special Envoy Hans Grundberg. We call upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid any further escalation. We strongly urge the parties to engage constructively and without preconditions with Mr. Grundberg and his mediation efforts with the aim of advancing the political process to reach a comprehensive negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Yemen. Just to give you a quick update on what Mr. Grundberg has been doing: on Saturday he was in Muscat, where he met with Ansar Allah’s chief negotiator, Mohammed Abdulsalam, and Omani officials. They discussed ongoing UN consultations and efforts to address the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, including a possible truce during the holy month of Ramadan, which, as you know, is coming up. Mr. Grundberg is continuing the discussions with the parties to the conflict., Central African Republic, Turning to the Central African Republic, our colleagues at the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) are telling us that, over the weekend, key opposition parties have withdrawn from the Republican dialogue, which began earlier today. In communiqués issued over the weekend, they deplored the lack of inclusivity as a reason for withdrawing from the dialogue process. In a tweet, Mankeur Ndiaye, the Head of the Mission, said the dialogue is a very important opportunity for the Central African Republic. He called on all those involved to work towards a historic compromise to allow the dialogue to bring about a consensus to help move the country forward. The Republican dialogue is expected to conclude on 27 March and will address issues such as peace and security, governance, the rule of law and the strengthening of institutions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/daily-press-briefing-office-spokesperson-secretary-general-21-march-2022-climate

Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Mar 2022,"As conflict deepens suffering inside Ukraine, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is scaling up cross-border aid from Poland with the support of partners like NEEKA., By Matthew Saltmarsh in Shehyni, Ukraine, With temperatures recently plummeting on the Poland-Ukraine border, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, dispatched a consignment of thermal blankets onto the Ukraine side to offer a little more warmth to those waiting long hours in line to reach safety., The blankets were moved recently from UNHCR’s warehouse in Rzeszow, Poland, crossing the border at Medyka to deliver to women, children and vulnerable people in long lines at Shehyni, on the Ukrainian side, as they waited in the open to file through the border point., While the crossing point has been quieter in the last days, there is no guarantee this will last. Shelling has recently shifted westwards and there are concerns that a new mass outflow to Poland, which has already welcomed over 2 million refugees in three weeks, remains possible., In response, UNHCR is scaling up the provision of hot meals, blankets, tents and Rubb Halls around borders through its partners. The distribution was conducted with one of UNHCR Ukraine’s partners, NEEKA, which brought along a crew of volunteers to help unload the truck near the border and hand out the blankets, alongside UNHCR Ukraine staff., Among those waiting in line was Firuza, 28, from near Kharkiv, where she had been a German and English language teacher at university and an adult college for the last five years. She is 35 weeks pregnant and had spent three days on the road with her mother and sister., UNCHR Ukraine colleagues were helping escort her to the front of the queue to avoid hours in the open, waiting to cross. “We have been travelling at least three days, it took a long time,” she said. “We want to save our lives. We don’t have any home right now. It was bombed.”, “We had been staying in another flat and went to see our home – and we when went to check, it wasn’t there anymore.”, Her family has roots in Tajikistan, as well as Ukraine, and her grandparents had been displaced by conflict to Ukraine 30 years ago. “Our family has had to flee again – they became refugees here because my grandmother was Ukrainian. And now, again,” she said., When asked where her husband was, she broke down in tears. He has stayed back in Ukraine. Composing herself, she added, “We hope that everything will be fine. We will survive.”, At that point she wasn’t sure where she would end up. She has no relatives or friends in Europe and preferred to settle somewhere not too far from Ukraine, perhaps Germany. “Staying close is better. German is my best second language.”, The truck was unloaded in minutes and blankets were handed out directly to grateful recipients in the lines. Hot food at Shehyni is being provided by other NGOs, but the needs are still great. Boris, the team leader for NEEKA in Lviv and the region, was coordinating the distribution, smoothing the process with border guards, his mobile phone constantly buzzing., NEEKA has been feeding the displaced in lines at border crossings since the war started offering hot soup, tea and biscuits. They have a range of other humanitarian actions in the country including temporary shelters, were the displaced can stay for a short spell to recuperate before moving onwards. They are also offering legal support to those in need at borders., “In Lviv and the western region, NEEKA has big plans to scale up our work on range of humanitarian help,” Boris said. “We’ll do what we can, where there are needs.”, Since last week, UNHCR has been moving trucks regularly across the border. The goods arrive either by airlift to Rzeszow airport, or by road, and go primarily to Lviv, Ukraine, for distribution to internally displaced people in the west of the country., Other UNHCR stocks are being moved from Lviv to areas more directly impacted in the centre and east of the country when conditions allow. Among the essentials are thermal blankets, mattresses, sleeping bags, plastic sheets, tinned food, solar lamps, batteries and hygiene kits., Some days after the distribution, UNHCR reestablished contact with Firuza. She had made it to Germany and was looking forward to giving birth. “The baby is doing great, everyone here in the hospital loves him already,” she said. “We will stay strong – we don’t have any other option.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/blanket-delivery-offers-some-warmth-refugees-waiting-cross-ukraine-border

Technical assistance and capacity-building, I. Executive summary, This report is based on the work of the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.1 It covers the period from 1 November 2019 to 31 October 2021 and provides a brief overview of the situation concerning civic space,2 including freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, and the situation of human rights defenders in territory controlled by the Government, territory controlled by self-proclaimed ‘Luhansk peoples republic’ and ‘Donetsk peoples republic’3 and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, occupied by the Russian Federation.4 In addition to identifying trends, the report provides recommendations to promote and protect civic space throughout Ukraine. The strengthening of civic space is a necessary condition to empower civil society, and encourage participation by all groups in democratic processes., During the reporting period, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) monitored political and legislative developments in Governmentcontrolled territory that resulted in restrictions on civic space. For example, freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association as well as the right to participate were negatively affected before and after the 2020 local elections due to an increase in attacks against opposition political parties, their members and staff. Similarly, amendments to the State language legislation led to threats, intimidation, property damage, and in one case, physical violence against those who expressed critical opinions on its implementation. More generally, attacks against journalists and media professionals during the reporting period often targeted those working on politically sensitive topics.3., The ongoing armed conflict and different views regarding the origins and causes of the conflict have also created an environment that has negatively affected the exercise of the rights to freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, and the right to participate. Sanctions introduced by the Government led to the closure of several major media outlets and some smaller online ones. The decisions introducing these sanctions failed to demonstrate compliance with international standards on permissible restrictions on freedom of expression, as they were not taken by an impartial authority and did not demonstrate necessity and proportionality. Finally, human rights defenders working on issues such as prevention of corruption, protection of the environment, and promotion of gender equality and rights of minorities (including LGBTI) continued to be targeted by attacks, threats, acts of intimidation and hate speech. In most cases, the perpetrators remain unidentified, contributing to a sense of impunity and fuelling further attacks. Women human rights defenders faced additional gendered risks due to their professional activities., In territory controlled by self-proclaimed 'republics', OHCHR continued to document developments indicating further shrinking of civic space. Many human rights groups and activists have left this territory, either due to insurmountable restrictions on their work or persecution for carrying out their legitimate human rights work. Those who have remained and continued their work, in particular women human rights defenders, face a high degree of insecurity., Armed groups of both self-proclaimed 'republics' have also persecuted individuals who attempted to organize independent trade unions and strikes to demand timely remuneration and safe working conditions, negatively affecting the freedom of association. During the reporting period, armed groups imposed restrictions on the use of social media, which had previously been seen as the only remaining safe space for free expression. OHCHR notes with concern that social media users can no longer safely exchange critical views, and at least four users have faced arbitrary detention and criminal penalties for expressing themselves online. Changes to ‘legislation’ criminalizing slander and defamation, including through social media, led to increased fear about the consequences of openly expressing critical opinions about developments in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’, further contributing to shrinking civic space in this territory., The situation in Crimea allows for very limited expression of views critical of the Russian Federation authorities and their policies. Freedom of expression is particularly curtailed by penalization of opinions through the application of Russian Federation antiextremism laws. Crimea lacks a safe and diverse media environment, which would enable pluralistic reporting and unrestricted access to information. The right of peaceful assembly is undermined by the pre-authorization requirement and prosecution of participants in peaceful assemblies, including political protests. Groups and associations, perceived as opposing the occupation of Crimea or Russian Federation policies, such as the Mejlis and Crimean Solidarity, suffer from unjustified interference with their activities. Human rights defenders and criminal defence lawyers, both men and women, face retaliation for their work, including through prosecution and intimidation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/civic-space-and-fundamental-freedoms-ukraine-1-november-2019-31-october-2021

Since the beginning of the invasion, these donations have already reached tens of thousands of people. PIN has already sent seven trains and 13 trucks full of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and we have over 100 staff on the ground in affected areas. Additionally, thanks to our Czech donors, we've been able to provide more than CZK 170 million worth of aid to victims of war in Ukraine and in the Czech Republic., CONTENT, Over 3,500 pallets full of aid have arrived in Ukraine (equivalent to 110 trucks), CZK 124 MILLION WORTH OF AID, Together with Regiojet and other partners from around the Czech Republic, PIN has been able to dispatch trains full of humanitarian aid three times a week. Seven trains with food and other necessary materials have already transported over 3,500 pallets (totalling CZK 109 million) to Ukraine. Such large deliveries of aid are made possible thanks to a combination of generous donations and significant discounts from suppliers., ""Czech aid is one of the largest, if not the largest, source of humanitarian aid that has been delivered to Ukraine or is currently on its way. It is easy to wonder if the aid that we are giving amounts to very much, as big numbers often sound abstract. For this reason, I’ve tried to divide the total amount of food that we are donating into an average purchase that I might take home once or twice a week to feed my family. It turns out that our deliveries make up about 150-200 thousand purchases like this. Basically, they are enough for one family to eat for a few days. Of course, we are always working hard to deliver even more aid to the besieged cities,” says Šimon Pánek, Director of People in Need, Together with partner Ukrainian organizations, People in Need has delivered three trains loaded with hundreds of tons of food, sleeping bags, blankets, hygiene supplies, operating kits, as well as power banks and other essential items to Kiev and other harder-to-reach areas around the capital. Another three trains have also been sent to the city of Donetsk and the Kharkiv and Luhansk regions. The aid onboard will be transported further to Slavyansk or Zaporozhye. Additionally, People in Need trucks are part of the first-ever convoy to Sumy, and if the humanitarian corridor opens, we will deliver aid to Mariupol., We also sent 13 trucks with material worth CZK 15 million to other affected areas. Non-perishable food, milk, baby food, medicine, and toilet paper are being transported from one place to another on demand. We have transported truckloads of water jerry cans to the east of Ukraine, because people often have no way to store and transport water there.

Over 15,000 people are regularly supplied with drinking water in areas where the war has damaged water mains or where the water lines were not working properly even before the invasion. We provide water to nineteen cisterns in the vicinity of Uhledar and Ardievka, and then take six-liter jerry cans to other places. Villages and towns such as Sčastia, Stanytsia Luhanska and many others have been completely destroyed by shelling and, as a result, their water, electricity and gas supply lines are simply not working. For this reason, we are delivering water, sanitary supplies and food to shelters in these areas. In the regions of Chernivtsi and Donetsk, we are also distributing food rations or cash to the most vulnerable., Many of those waiting in collective centres today have experienced bombings, been forced to hide in shelters and had to say goodbye to loved ones or witnessed violence and suffering. Trained psychologists themselves work from affected areas such as Bakhumut, Kramatorsk or Slovyansk.

We have provided significant support to food banks, which spend 70% of their supplies to help families fleeing war., Supporting school children, Under COVID constraints, People in Need developed new types of online educational support, tutoring, e-inclusion support, as well as providing direct educational support to children who need it. We believe that some elements will be easily adaptable in the current situation, and we are preparing volunteers to engage in educational support when it becomes clear what systemic pathway the Department for Education will choose. 119 teachers are undergoing a course that can support them in working with children with trauma.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Mar 2022,"Geneva – Almost 6.48 million people are displaced in Ukraine as a direct result of the war, according to a study by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted between 09 and 16 March., IOM's data show that 13.5 per cent of those newly displaced had already had prior experience with displacement during 2014-2015., Many of those displaced are particularly vulnerable, pregnant and breastfeeding women, elderly persons, those with disabilities, chronic illnesses and people directly affected by violence. More than 60 per cent of heads of households surveyed are accompanied by children., Over 53 per cent of internally displaced people are women. According to the survey, the most pressing needs include medicines, health services and financial resources., These people are among the nearly 10 million that have been forcibly displaced both in Ukraine and beyond the country’s borders in neighboring countries, among them 186,000 third-country nationals., “The scale of human suffering and forced displacement due to the war far exceeds any worst-case scenario planning,” says IOM Director General António Vitorino., “Responding to the needs of those internally displaced and stranded in Ukraine is our top priority. Our teams have been reaching thousands of people with essential aid, but we need hostilities to cease in order to be able to reach people in severely affected areas.”, People displaced within the country’s borders need urgent humanitarian assistance amidst the worsening situation in Ukraine, a cessation of hostilities and the creation of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape to safety., While operational and security challenges persist, IOM continues to provide much needed aid in Ukraine and neighboring countries, whenever and wherever possible, in close coordination with humanitarian partners, distributing core relief items to displaced persons, including blankets, food, kitchen sets and hygiene kits., To date, IOM has distributed more than 18,000 thermal blankets and 8,000 hygiene kits to newly displaced persons in collective centres in Lviv, Ivano Frankivsk, Dnipro, Mykolaiv and Zakarpattia Regions. As new humanitarian relief supplies arrive to IOM warehouses in Ukraine every day, additional distributions are being coordinated with the Ukrainian government at the municipal and oblast level and with IOM’s growing implementing partner network., In coordination with the State Migration Service of Ukraine, IOM has also provided food and kitchenware at two shelters for displaced people in Zakarpattia region and delivered hygiene kits to four social institutions in Luhansk., The Organization also manages regional hotlines to support the safety of individuals on the move in Ukraine. Between 24 February and 16 March, IOM Ukraine provided more than 12,000 consultations through the national toll-free migrant advice and counter-trafficking hotline (“527”)., The top three questions our teams are receiving include general information about human trafficking and safe travel, procedures to seek asylum and obtain refugee status, and possible support from diplomatic institutions and relevant organizations., For more information, please contact: Safa Msehli, Email: smsehli@iom.int, Tel: +4179 403 5526, or Paul Dillon, Email: pdillon@iom.int, Tel: +41796369874",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/almost-65-million-people-internally-displaced-ukraine-iom

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Mar 2022,"Bucharest, 21 March 2022 - As the world’s largest humanitarian network responds to the unfolding crisis in Europe, its leadership returns from Ukraine with a warning about the coming days and weeks — and reaffirms that the Red Cross will strengthen support inside and outside its borders., Francesco Rocca, President of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), connected with some of the 6,000 Ukrainian Red Cross volunteers delivering aid to families experiencing the worst weeks of their lives., “The devastating reality of Ukraine is that the needs are growing every day. Amidst increased violence and a disrupted supply chain, delivering essential goods in many parts of the country is getting harder — not easier. Responding to a crisis of this magnitude takes teamwork, which is why we’re working hand-in-hand with the Ukrainian Red Cross on the ground to let people know that they’re not alone. Not ever,” states Rocca., Since the conflict began, the Ukrainian Red Cross has distributed hundreds of tons of essential goods and team members have supported the evacuation of approximately 57,000 people from Energodar, Sumy, Kviy region, Kharkiv and Kherson region. The Ukrainian Red Cross is not only providing first aid, but also teaching it to people who are taking cover in basements and shelters., No one in Ukraine is left unscathed by the ongoing conflict. An estimated 18 million people — or one-third of the population — will require humanitarian assistance., “Ukrainian Red Cross volunteers have lost homes, communities, and loved ones. Yet, they keep doing the work of delivering aid and comfort to families in need. I am humbled by their resilience and their commitment to humanitarianism in the midst of conflict.”, Speaking from the Romanian border in Siret, Mr. Rocca stressed the altruistic nature of community members around Europe welcoming the more than 3 million people who have fled Ukraine., After Poland, Romania has received the second highest number of people crossing its borders in search of safety: more than 500,000 according to the UN Refugee Agency., Romanian Red Cross teams have been working 24/7 at border crossings since day one, providing items such as food, water, diapers, feminine hygiene products, warm gloves, and other necessities. The Romanian Red Cross is offering SIM cards and mobile charging stations — to help people who have been separated from their loved ones in Ukraine to reconnect. Many who have crossed the border simply ask for a cup of coffee or tea. Seemingly simple aid like this can offer families peace of mind in an otherwise hopeless moment., “We have provided more than 400 tons of aid to those affected by the conflict, but a hot drink and a warm welcome is what many of those fleeing say they appreciate most,” says Rocca., Media contacts:, In Romania and Ukraine: Tommaso Della Longa, +41 797 084 367, tommaso.dellalonga@ifrc.org

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 20 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"Date: 21 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 20 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,421 civilian casualties in the country: 925 killed and 1,496 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 21 March, 115 children had been killed and more than 148 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 20 March, 276 civilians had been killed in the region, including 15 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-20-march-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Mar 2022,"Violations of international humanitarian law prevent humanitarian aid from reaching desperate people across Ukraine., Since the invasion of Ukraine, People in Need has organized regular deliveries of humanitarian aid to the most affected parts of the country. So far, PIN has sent seven trains and thirteen trucks of material aid to Ukraine. The aid delivered by these trains has been further distributed throughout Ukraine, and more trains are on their way. However, this aid will not reach everywhere—many towns remain inaccessible. Worse still, humanitarian corridors are not functioning, escape routes are being shelled, and people have had to survive in damaged houses for weeks without food, water, heat or medical care., Humanitarians and people on the ground are recording daily violations of international humanitarian law and committing of war crimes such as the shelling of civilians and civilian infrastructure. The UN's international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague supports this view and has ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine, saying the court had not seen any evidence to support Russian's justification for the war., War does not permit lawlessness, As Russian forces advance, the number of accusations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and violations of humanitarian law grows. The evidence of Russian war crimes is overwhelming, and it comes not only from sources in Ukraine. The war is being waged online. It is possible to watch live coverage of the shelling of civilian objects such as hospitals and schools; these are actions in direct contravention of the rules of warfare., When war erupts, international conventions and fundamental human rights remain enforceable. Despite what some may believe, even war has rules, the violation of which makes the violator a criminal. People in Need has extensive experience of humanitarian work in warzones. In 30 years, PIN has set up humanitarian missions in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, in the Middle East; and in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, in Africa., The protection of civilians is a top priority in wartime, One inviolable rule of war concerns avoiding attacking civilians or civilian sites. Such sites include medical facilities, educational institutions, and residential areas—these must not be attacked. According to the UN, between 24 February and 18 March, at least 847 civilians were killed— including 64 children. At least 1,399 people were injured—including 78 children. Due to difficulty in reaching some places, it has not been possible to conduct a full audit of casualties. Therefore, it is inevitable that the actual figures are much higher—the total number of civilians killed will run into the thousands., Recent reports detail a multitude of Russian attacks on civilian targets. Attacked civilian infrastructure includes a kindergarten in the village of Okhtyrka, in the Sumy region; and a maternity hospital and theater —where hundreds of people were sheltering—in the trapped city of Mariupol. It is impossible to get aid to Mariupol, and local medical staff are treating wounded civilians in the basement of the city's destroyed hospital., Residents have been unable to leave the occupied towns for several weeks, In early March, the Russian Federation and Ukraine agreed to create several safe escape routes from places occupied by the Russian army. However, reality is showing that Russian forces are not honoring their agreement. Additionally, despite several local ceasefires, the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and the towns around Kyiv has been a failure. While some humanitarian corridors are partly successful, many others seem to exist only on paper and are ignored, with both warring parties accusing each other of intransigence., People trying to flee the rubble of their homes have frequently come under direct fire and experience constant danger. Undermining or otherwise endangering agreed safe evacuation routes is a direct violation of the Geneva Conventions. Not only are non-combatants being prevented from leaving these places to find safety, but there is also no way of treating the wounded, providing medical care, transporting children and women, or providing such essentials as food and water., People in Need is distributing drinking water by bottle and by truck to the areas in most need, many of which are in eastern Ukraine. These deliveries go to places where fighting has cut the pipes. PIN's humanitarian train bridge, which is linked to local Ukrainian distribution, supplies the most urgent material to areas throughout the entirety of Ukraine. However, we cannot reach towns where humanitarian corridors are unstable. Thus, people in these towns rely on dwindling local resources., World court orders Russia to immediately halt invasion of Ukraine, In early March, the conflict in Ukraine was addressed by the Prosecutor of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the highest court of the United Nations. The ICJ deemed Russia's invasion to be illegal. However, this institution has only minimal abilities to enforce its verdict. Moreover, Russia has veto power in the Security Council, thus further undermining any possible avenues of enforcement. The order for Russia to halt all its military operations in Ukraine can be seen as a partial victory that may lead to further ostracization and sanctions., However, what this will mean in real terms for the Russian invasion of Ukraine is unclear, especially when we realize that Russia has ignored all previous efforts to end the war by the international community and individual states. The ICJ's ruling is unlikely to lead to any significant change., Author: Karolína Šugarová, Alyona Budagovska, Petr Stefan, People in Need",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/even-war-has-rules-and-ukraine-they-are-being-grossly-violated

Almost 3.5 million people have become refugees and an estimated 6.5 million people have become internally displaced within Ukraine. A further 12 million people are estimated to be stranded or are unable to leave Ukraine due to increasing violence, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation, Heather Macey, International Rescue Committee's Team Lead in Poland, ""This is like nothing we've ever seen before - the speed of displacement is unprecedented and the humanitarian needs are soaring each day - especially for women, children and the elderly that make up the majority of those displaced. We've seen that people are arriving at the Polish border, with goodwill and intent, offering homes and transport to people who have fled the crisis, but this of course poses a massive security risk for vulnerable people who could fall victim to crime, exploitation or trafficking., ""Within Ukraine, well over 6 million people have become displaced and are in need of basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, medical care and heating. The number of attacks and airstrikes have significantly increased in the last few days, putting the lives of civilians and humanitarian aid workers at risk and making it extremely difficult to access those that need support and assistance. We're already seeing widespread need both in Ukraine and in bordering states where almost 3.5million people have fled. With the speed and scale of displacement in this crisis, we are plummeting further into a humanitarian catastrophe- there must be an end to the violence to avoid further suffering."", The IRC is working with partners in Poland to provide information services through an existing hotline, offering legal counseling and psychological support, and will facilitate access to services (through social workers, interpreters, and cultural assistants) to displaced people.

Many are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure., Between 24 February and 15 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 2,149 civilian casualties. The total consists of 816 people killed and 1,333 injured. The actual number is likely to be much higher, unfortunately., Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools., A number of UN senior officials briefed Member States on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The meeting was chaired by Martin Griffiths, the UN’s Humanitarian Coordinator., The devastation and suffering in Mariupol and Kharkiv raise grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks. International humanitarian law is crystal clear. Civilians are entitled to protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Direct attacks on civilians are prohibited. Yet, the magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. This demands a thorough investigation and accountability., Speaking from Ukraine, the UN Crisis Coordinator Amin Awad warned that this war has created unprecedented humanitarian challenges that continue to rise. He said that we, along with our humanitarian partners, are on the ground and we are in 17 locations operating out of 10 hubs. However, Mr. Awad stressed that we need to do more and we need safe humanitarian access., From Lviv, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for the UN in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, said that we are working on a joint response to integrate the long-term development needs with the immediate humanitarian response. She noted that water and sanitation have either been partially or totally destroyed in Ukraine, with dramatic and immediate and long-term socioeconomic impacts., And just a few more details for you on what is happening on the ground. We continue to be extremely concerned that many people – including the most vulnerable groups such as older people and people with disabilities – are trapped in areas of escalating conflict. With essential services disrupted, they are unable to meet their basic needs for food, water, and medicines., The World Food Programme for its part has been warning that the country’s food supply chain is falling apart: trucks and trains are being destroyed, airports bombed, many bridges have fallen, supermarkets and warehouses have been emptied. WFP said that is has mobilized food supplies for 3 million people inside Ukraine for one month. In recent days, the World Food Programme has delivered 26 metric tons of high-energy biscuits in the capital Kyiv, targeting 30,000 people., In Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, WFP distributed more than 53 metric tons of bread to 212,400 crisis-affected people.

For its part, the International Organization for Migration said its newly established hotline has received more than 10,000 calls over the last 10 days, including from people seeking specialized counselling., The UN refugee agency said that almost 3.3 million people, most of them women and children, have crossed international borders out of Ukraine., For its part, the UN Children’s Fund said that as of yesterday 17 March, it had dispatched 85 trucks carrying 858 tons of emergency supplies to support children and families in war-torn Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Out of this total, 78 trucks carrying more than 780 tons were sent to Ukraine while the remaining 7 trucks were sent to nearby countries., A total of 34 trucks have already arrived in Ukraine, with more deliveries expected in the coming days.

We are making progress with both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to allow for regular discussion on specific humanitarian issues, including safe passage and supply routes for humanitarian cargo. We, along with international and local non-governmental organizations, are pushing east towards areas of greater needs. I do hope to have a bit more of an update for you on that front later today.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-un-work-ukraine-18032022-enuk
"Ukraine conflict will worsen hunger in world’s worst crisis zones, warns IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",21 Mar 2022,"New York, NY, March 21, 2022 — Food security in countries already facing severe levels of hunger will drastically worsen as the war in Ukraine will diminish global grain supplies and drive up fuel prices. As the world's attention centers on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the IRC is calling on world leaders to renew their commitment to supporting people affected by crises across the globe., Humanitarian needs in countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and Somalia could rise as global grain exports are disrupted, food and fuel prices increase, and critical attention is diverted to Ukraine. Countries across East Africa, including Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, which are already facing the worst drought seen in decades, bring over 90 percent of its imported wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Yemen, which remains chronically underfunded, relies on Ukraine and Russia for just over a fifth of its wheat consumption, providing a bleak picture of what families across this region could suffer if the situation is left unaddressed. As Ukraine's crop production cycle this year is disrupted due to the conflict, countries heavily reliant on grain imports from Ukraine are likely to be impacted in the coming year., Bob Kitchen, Vice President of Emergencies at the IRC said,, ""With more than five million people displaced as a result of the war in Ukraine, the international attention and funding directed towards the crisis is warranted and needed, but it is simultaneously highlighting where attention and funding has been waning elsewhere. In Afghanistan, where over half the population is experiencing extreme hunger, only 13% of the humanitarian response plan has been funded, whilst Yemen, now entering its eighth year of conflict, is facing the reality of having less than 30% of the total funds required for humanitarian assistance following the donor pledging conference earlier this month. This is woefully inadequate to address the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Yemen. If donors do not increase their pledges, we will see further cuts to critical humanitarian assistance which will cost lives., ""Meanwhile, food insecurity across the Horn of Africa is precarious and is set to worsen as the Ukraine crisis threatens the reliance on grain the region has. Four consecutive seasons without adequate rainfall have seriously impacted crop harvests which millions of people across East Africa depend on for consumption and livelihoods. At least 4 million Somalis are projected to face emergency levels of hunger by June of this year, and coupled with failing crop production, disruptions in imports from Ukraine will further increase humanitarian need across East Africa. In the Sahel, almost 30 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, with vulnerabilities and needs worsening as climate shocks, conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to wreak havoc across the region., ""In January of this year, IRC released our Emergency Watchlist, highlighting the countries where humanitarian crises are most at risk of deterioration. The international attention and outpouring of support and funding directed at the Ukraine crisis is of course warranted - but only serves to highlight where attention and funding has been waning despite the severity of crisis, ""People living in Afghanistan, Yemen, Nigeria, Syria, and other countries enduring vast and deteriorating humanitarian needs, must not be left behind. Donors must at the very least, commit to channeling 50% of total international aid to fragile and conflict affected states and using diplomatic means to find political solutions to conflicts driving humanitarian need."", The IRC is working with partners in Poland to provide information services through an existing hotline, offering legal counseling and psychological support, and will facilitate access to services (through social workers, interpreters, and cultural assistants) to displaced people. With partners in Ukraine IRC is also providing evacuation services and essential items to those that have become displaced according to individual needs. This could include blankets, sleeping bags, warm clothes or cash assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-will-worsen-hunger-world-s-worst-crisis-zones-warns-irc

Protracted crises in Syria, Yemen, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel are worsening while the horrors in Ukraine are getting our attention. Humanitarian relief can help mitigate the effects of these crises on vulnerable communities, but ultimately, inclusive political solutions are needed to end them., “Leaders need to break the deadlock of indifference towards conflicts in other parts of the world. The speed at which the EU, the United Nations and other international partners acted in response to the war in Ukraine should trigger the same urgency for solutions to the neglected crises of our time. Widespread condemnation, appeals for a cessation of conflict, rapidly mobilizing funding, and opening borders to citizens seeking protection, must be replicated in other crises., “It is the first time Europe has witnessed mass flight at such speed at its doorsteps. But proximity does not define greater responsibility under international refugee law. We expect the EU to lead by example and pave the way to revise existing protection mechanisms, guided by a humanitarian imperative, so that all people can be equally protected – regardless of their passports., ""The EU and UN should immediately convene a European Summit where heads of governments agree on real responsibility-sharing when it comes to refugees fleeing Ukraine and elsewhere. The summit should also address effective refugee resettlement across Europe, providing long term aid inside Ukraine, and diplomacy to pave the wave for a ceasefire and peace talks.”, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:, Norwegian Refugee Council's global media hotline: media@nrc.no, +47 905 623 29",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-must-break-deadlock-indifference-world
Six million children trapped in Ukraine face grave danger as attacks on schools and hospitals soar,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education

Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Mar 2022,"KYIV, 21 March 2022 – Up to six million children trapped inside Ukraine are in imminent danger as an increasing number of hospitals and schools come under attack, Save the Children said., Urban areas across Ukraine have been repeatedly shelled, reducing complete streets to rubble. At least 464 schools and 43 hospitals have been damaged. The relentless bombardment has forced at least one in five children in Ukraine – or more than 1.5 million – to flee the country. Nearly six million children remain in Ukraine, with many believed to be sheltering inside buildings that are coming under attack, leaving children vulnerable to injury or death, as well as to deprivation of food, clean water and health care., In the besieged city of Mariupol, bombs hit a theatre and swimming pool on Wednesday where hundreds of people, including children, were sheltering. At least 21 people were reported killed the following day after an airstrike hit a school and community centre near the city of Kharkiv on Thursday., Damage to essential services like schools and hospitals will increase if fighting continues, especially in populated areas. There are currently more than 300 health facilities in areas with active fighting or with a significant presence of military troops, and an additional 600 facilities are located within 10 km of hostilities., Nearly half of all attacks on health systems worldwide this year have occurred in Ukraine, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). If forces continue to drop bombs and shell health facilities, thousands of children and pregnant women still living in Ukraine will be without life-saving health care., Pete Walsh, Save the Children’s Country Director in Ukraine, said:, “Up to six million children in Ukraine remain in grave danger as the war in Ukraine nears the one-month mark. We are extremely alarmed by reports that bombs and intense shelling have damaged more than 460 schools across the country, and over 60 now lay in complete ruins. School should be a safe haven for children, not a place of fear, injury or death., “The streets of Ukraine are being used as a battlefield. At least 59 children have already been killed in the escalating violence, according to the UN, with media reports indicating the number could be as high as 100., “The rules of war are very clear: children are not a target, and neither are hospitals or schools. We must protect the children in Ukraine at all costs. How many more lives need to be lost until this war ends?”, While fighting is ongoing, there are international legal obligations to take all necessary precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects, including schools and hospitals, which are protected under International Humanitarian Law. Parties must uphold and protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education staff - and refrain from military-related use of educational facilities. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas should also be avoided as it risks severe harm to civilians, in particular children. To date, these are the main causes for civilian harm., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses., Ends, Notes to the editor, - Prior to the war in Ukraine, an estimated 7.5 million children lived in Ukraine.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Mar 2022,"Residents Describe Harsh Conditions During Russian Attack, Thirty-two civilians who managed to escape southeastern Ukraine’s besieged city of Mariupol last week told Human Rights Watch how they struggled to survive in below-freezing temperatures as Russian forces relentlessly attacked the city. They described men, women, and children sheltering in basements with little to no access to running water, power, heating, medical care, or mobile phone service since the siege began on March 2, 2022., Russian forces laying siege to Mariupol should immediately ensure that civilians in Mariupol are not being denied access to items essential for their survival such as water, food, and medicine, and should facilitate safe passage to areas under control of Ukrainian forces for civilians who choose to leave the city., “Mariupol residents have described a freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “And these are the lucky ones who were able to escape, leaving behind thousands who are cut off from the world in the besieged city.”, The current death toll in Mariupol remains unknown. An assistant to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, told Human Rights Watch on March 20 that more than 3,000 civilians may have died since the fighting began, but he said the exact number was unclear. Local authorities have reported that at least 80 percent of the city’s residential buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify these figures, or to assess how many of those killed were civilians., On March 16 and 17, Human Rights Watch interviewed 30 Mariupol residents in person at a makeshift registration center in Zaporizhzhia, a city about 220 kilometers northwest of Mariupol. They were among several thousand Mariupol residents who fled the city on March 15 and 16 in personally arranged convoys with private cars, on journeys that took between 24 and 72 hours. Human Rights Watch also interviewed a couple in Zaporizhzhia who were waiting for their two children to arrive from Mariupol. On March 16 alone, at least 3,200 people from Mariupol made it to Zaporizhzhia, according to two local officials working at the registration center. Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with two other Mariupol residents who had managed to escape the city., “The last two weeks were pure horror,” a school principal from Mariupol told Human Rights Watch. “We left because our city is no more.” A 32-year-old woman who fled to Zaporizhzhia with her three children said that, by the time they left, their house in Mariupol was so damaged that it looked like a strainer, covered with holes caused by the persistent attacks. A 64-year-old woman said: “I think those who are left will get killed or starve to death. We have nowhere to come back to.”, Mariupol is a coastal city between two regions currently under the effective control of Russian forces. Since around March 2, Russian forces have completely surrounded the city and blocked the port. Reports of fighting within the city center have emerged in recent days, and many of the residents who fled said they saw Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and military equipment in their neighborhoods. Andryushchenko told Human Rights Watch that, as of March 20, at least 200,000 of the city’s pre-war population of over 400,000 remain in the city., Residents who escaped said that hospitals, schools, shops, and countless homes had been damaged or destroyed by shelling. Many said that their family members or neighbors had suffered serious and, in some cases, fatal injuries from metal fragments of explosives and that they saw dead bodies strewn on the roads when they ventured out to look for food or water or to find a signal for their mobile phones., The inability to communicate with relatives, friends, and the outside world was a particular challenge for people in Mariupol. Almost all cell phone towers had stopped delivering a signal by March 2, with only faint signals in specific locations after that. A graphic designer said that every day she would walk two and a half kilometers each way to a Kyivstar cellphone tower to try to get reception, ducking down to the ground every time a plane flew overhead., Everyone interviewed noted that the lack of information caused by ruptures in telecommunication and electricity made it very difficult to figure out how to evacuate the city safely., Those interviewed described staying in basements for days in crowded and unsanitary conditions, unable to shower and with little to eat or drink. One woman said she stayed for two weeks in a basement with at least 80 people that was about 300 square meters; a man stayed with 50 people in a basement that was 50 square meters; and another man said he stayed with 18 people in a basement that was 10 square meters., Older people and people with disabilities described the additional challenges they faced: unable to move to their basements for shelter, they sat in their apartments with blown out windows, the walls vibrating with each attack. An 82-year-old man who stayed in his sixth-floor apartment since the attacks began, said he distracted himself by cleaning up the glass shards that littered the floors: “I was shaking as the bombs were dropping. The walls were shaking, and I was afraid the building would collapse. But I spent my days trying to clean the glass shards. I was just cleaning, I had to somehow occupy myself. It was pointless, but it was all I could do to keep busy.”, On March 9, Russian forces attacked a hospital complex in Mariupol, reportedly wounding at least 17 civilians, including medical staff and pregnant women. One pregnant woman reportedly died from her injuries after being transferred to another hospital following the attack. Human Rights Watch verified and analyzed 7 videos and 10 photographs showing the aftermath of the attack, including the destruction of the entire front wall of the children’s hospital, apparent fragmentation marks on the façade of the neighboring maternity ward, and a large impact crater from the detonation of an air-dropped munition on the southern part of the courtyard. Russia later confirmed that it had targeted the hospital, alleging that Ukrainian forces had been occupying it and that they had warned civilians inside to leave. Human Rights Watch was unable to verify these claims., On March 16, a drama theater in Mariupol that had been sheltering at least 500 people came under attack. In satellite imagery of the theater from March 14, the Russian word for “children” is clearly visible in large Cyrillic script on the ground in front of and behind the theater. A mother and son who sheltered in the theater for two weeks said that hundreds of people were still in the theater when they left at 9 a.m. on March 16, just hours before the attack. It appears that most people sheltering in the theater managed to survive while hiding in the basement, according to local authorities. The Russian Defense Ministry denied carrying out the attack and blamed Ukrainian government-backed forces., Russian and Ukrainian forces reportedly agreed to the terms of a temporary ceasefire and creation of a humanitarian corridor on March 4 to allow civilians to evacuate from Mariupol safely. At least seven initial efforts to carry out the agreement and facilitate evacuations failed as ceasefires were broken., According to Kirill Timoshenko, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, at least 9,000 Mariupol residents had been able to flee to Zaporizhzhia using an agreed-upon humanitarian corridor over the previous few days. However, the mayor’s assistant, Andryushchenko, said that agreement only covered a corridor between the Russian-controlled city of Berdyansk, 65 kilometers southwest of Mariupol, and Zaporizhzhia. He said that the route traveling out of Mariupol to Berdyansk is still subject to ongoing heavy fighting, and that civilians have not been offered any specific guarantees with respect to a humanitarian corridor or safe passage for this stretch., Local authorities in Mariupol also reported on March 19 that Russian forces had taken “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border” into southwestern Russia. The Russian ministry of defense announced on March 20 that nearly 60,000 Mariupol residents were “evacuated to Russia” over the past three days, and that Mariupol residents have a “voluntary choice” regarding which corridor to take or whether to stay in the city. Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify these accounts. If Mariupol residents have been forcibly transferred to Russia, that could constitute a war crime. Under international humanitarian law, the transfer of a civilian, individually or en masse, is not voluntary, and is therefore prohibited, simply because the civilian agrees to it. A transfer can be forcible when a person volunteers because they fear consequences such as violence, duress, or detention if they remain, and the occupying power is taking advantage of a coercive environment to conduct the transfer., Both Russia and Ukraine have obligations to ensure access for humanitarian assistance to civilians and to take all feasible steps to allow the civilian population to evacuate safely, if they choose, whether or not an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors is put into effect. Russia is prohibited from forcibly requiring civilians, individually or en masse, to evacuate to places in Russia or other countries such as Belarus., The use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. These weapons have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. This includes the use of unguided and unobserved large-caliber projectiles and aviation bombs. The use of these weapons should be avoided in populated areas., The International Criminal Court, the UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry, and other relevant jurisdictions should investigate potential war crimes in Mariupol, with a view to prosecuting those most responsible, Human Rights Watch said., “For those who were able to escape Mariupol, leaving friends and families behind, the news of recent evacuations has given them a bit of hope that those they love may make it out of the city alive,” Wille said. “Russian and Ukrainian forces should urgently do what it takes to protect civilians remaining in Mariupol, and to allow those who want to leave the besieged city to do so in safety.”, Accounts from Mariupol Residents, Those interviewed are either not identified by name or identified by their first names only for their protection., Explosive Weapons with Wide-Area Effects, All 32 Mariupol residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch described periods of sustained and often intensifying attacks with explosive weapons, from the beginning of fighting on February 24 to the moment they fled the city. Witnesses described attacks that killed and injured their neighbors as they took shelter in their homes, prepared food, and fetched water, throwing them from buildings and piercing them with fragments. The attacks also destroyed and damaged homes, businesses, and critical civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools, collapsing and burning buildings in numerous parts of the city. The descriptions of the attacks and their effects are consistent with the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects., Serhii, a shipping inspector, said he was on the balcony of his father’s apartment, when a detonation occurred, catapulting a man out of the window of the building next door and to the ground outside, killing him. The same attack started a fire in one of the stairwells of his father’s building. “We don’t know if there were casualties because that part of the building collapsed, and no one could search for people in the rubble because of the constant shelling,” he said. Several days after that incident, he said: “I was just coming out of the building carrying some water, and I saw [a neighbor’s] body … His dead body was just lying there, with his intestines hanging out.”, Several residents described attacks that killed or injured people as they were on their way to get what little food was available, or to collect water from nearby rivers or springs., One man said that three women were on their way to buy bread when an attack took place, killing one of the women, tearing off her hands, and seriously injuring the two others. He said he started to take one woman who had a serious stomach wound to the hospital until he came across Ukrainian soldiers who said they would take her to get treatment., A 37-year-old man described how his neighbor was killed. “On March 8, an attack hit while a young man from our building was outside trying to start a fire to cook,” he explained. “He was pierced by pieces of metal, including to his heart, and he died. Because of the continued attacks, his family has not been able to bury him yet, so his body is still in a van outside.”, A doctor from Mariupol said that the hospital where she worked was damaged in an attack on March 10. The hospital had been closed since February 24. A school principal said that two munitions exploded in the yard of his school on March 15. “A lot of windows were broken,” he said, adding that dozens of other schools in the city were also damaged., Access to Water and Sanitation, Everyone interviewed said that running water had stopped in the city on or around March 2, and that they had not been able to shower since. To try to get potable and non-potable water, they waited in line for up to six hours at fresh springs and at water trucks in the city, melted snow, collected buckets of rainwater, or flushed out their buildings’ heating systems., One man, Valery, said that on March 8, International Women’s Day, the men sheltering in his basement collected as much snow as possible to melt and boil over a fire, so that the women and children could wash themselves., Some people said they had to defecate in buckets. One woman said the 30 people sheltering in her basement had only one bucket., Access to Food, Those interviewed said they survived on food that they had at home before the fighting started and shared their dwindling stocks with those sheltering with them. Once looters had broken into shops, some said, they also went in and stole food. However, many of those interviewed owned personal vehicles and had considerable stockpiles of foodstuffs, so their experience was not necessarily representative of the experience of other civilians remaining in the city., Viktoria, a graphic designer, said that her family and her neighbor’s family eventually only had expired cans of paté left to eat, with the adults eating only one meal a day. Several families said they ran out of baby formula early on. Everyone said they cooked their food on open fires in the yards outside their buildings, or in kitchens that were near their basements., Several people interviewed who had been sheltering in larger basements with more people said that volunteers, the military, and the police sometimes came to their basements to deliver some food, water, and medicine., None of those interviewed said they saw Russian forces distributing aid at any point. According to Ukrainian authorities, a convoy of humanitarian vehicles trying to bring aid into Mariupol was stuck in the Russian-controlled city of Berdyansk, 65 kilometers southwest of Mariupol, as of March 15. The convoy had reportedly turned back by March 20 without reaching Mariupol or delivering the aid., Access to Electricity, Everyone interviewed said they lost electricity on around March 2. Valery said his basement had a generator, but it was destroyed in an attack on March 10. One woman noted that, even in those buildings with generators, families eventually ran out of fuel for them to run., Human Rights Watch recognizes that the internationally protected right to an adequate standard of living includes everyone’s right, without discrimination, to sufficient, reliable, safe, clean, accessible, and affordable electricity. Access to electricity is critical to ensuring other basic rights, including but not limited to the rights to health, housing, and water. Steps should be taken to restore reliable electricity access for civilians to safeguard their other basic rights., Access to Information, Once Mariupol was besieged, people in the city lost access to phone lines, television, and most local radio stations (with the exception of some medium wave stations that were faint). They had no ability to access information about what was happening inside or outside the city. Everyone interviewed said that this lack of information was one of the things that made it the most difficult for them to figure out how to leave the city safely., Valery said he lived in a building next to a mobile phone tower, which initially gave him a weak signal. But after several attacks next to the tower, including the one that destroyed his building’s generator, the tower itself was hit on March 10, and the signal was completely gone., In an example of how residents struggled to reach their loved ones, Ganna, an anesthesiologist, showed researchers a picture she had taken of a piece of paper that a mother had stuck to a water cistern in the city, where many people were going to fetch water, hoping her daughters might see it. “We made it out of the left [bank], now in Kirovskii [neighborhood] at Natasha's,” the note said., Serhii, a factory foreman, and his wife were waiting at the reception center in Zaporizhzhia for their daughter, son, and grandson. They said they had not heard from them for eight days, and only found out they were alive the night before, when their children called them from a city between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia. “You see how grey my hair is?” Serhii said. “It turned grey in these 8 days.”, Russian forces took over local radio broadcasts just after they encircled the city, and they sent text messages to those inside the city, which came through when residents happened to pick up a signal. One man said that he heard Russian forces announcing on the radio: “Give up soldiers. Come out with a white flag on your gun, leaning it onto your left shoulder and approach us and we guarantee food, clothes, and will let you join your family after the fighting stops.”, Two people said that at one point when their phones were on, they received text messages that they assumed had been sent by the Russian forces. Ina, the graphic designer, said she received a message from the number 777 that read: “Ukrainian army surrender.”, Those interviewed said they did not receive any messages directed at civilians warning them to take precautions prior to attacks or about access to humanitarian assistance or routes for safe passage., Access to Health Care, Some people interviewed said they did not know whether any hospitals in the city were functioning, while others said that they had heard of one or two civilian and military hospitals that were still open, but with wait times spanning days. Human Rights Watch spoke to the daughter of a man who lost his eye after an explosion on March 6, which also damaged their home. When they rushed him to the hospital, she said there was no running water and limited electricity from their generators that they were using only to perform life-saving operations., Andri, an engineer, said his home was about 200 meters from the main hospital in Mariupol that was treating Covid-19 patients. He said that on March 12, staff at the hospital told him that they had run out of oxygen days earlier and as a result people with serious respiratory symptoms were dying., One man working as a volunteer delivering aid to shelters said that several people had come into the basement where he was sheltering with wounds from metal fragments caused by explosions. They were unable to make it to a hospital. “Sometimes the ambulance started driving toward us, but then had to turn back because of the shelling and come back later,” he said., Oksana, a wheelchair user who cannot walk since an accident 17 years ago, has been on daily medication to treat thyroid cancer for the past six years. She said she ran out of her medicine soon after the fighting started, when the pharmacies had already been looted and emptied out. She went to the hospital near her home that was open, but doctors there said they had run out of the medication she was on and gave her a substitute. She has no idea what the impact of being off her required medication for so long will mean for her future., Mykola, the principal, said that even though his school had sheltered up to 200 people, they only had basic medicine there and the teachers, all trained in first aid, had to start acting as medics. “We gave medical assistance as we could with the means that we had,” he said., A medic working at the reception center in Zaporizhzhia said that 55 people had been treated at their makeshift clinic, and that one woman who arrived on March 15 with a serious wound caused on March 8 by a metal fragment, had to be rushed straight to the hospital. On March 17, the World Health Organization expressed concern that there is “the potential for multidrug-resistant infections” in the case of such injuries “given the previous high rates of over-the-counter antimicrobials, and limited access to treatments.”, The Route Out, Following what residents described as days of especially heavy shelling on March 13 and 14, some of them with access to private cars decided to try to leave the city on their own, despite the ongoing shelling and needing to pass through Russian checkpoints. A convoy of about 160 cars left Mariupol on March 14, and hundreds more left on March 15. Serhii, the shipping inspector, told Human Rights Watch he estimated that, for each car in Mariupol that still functioned, he had seen at least 50 other cars destroyed during the bombardment, seriously limiting the ability of many Mariupol residents to escape., Residents described passing through between 15 and 20 Russian military checkpoints between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia. They all said that Russian soldiers either asked for the documents of the driver or for everyone’s documents. Serhii said the soldiers were paying particular attention to the registered address that is written in Ukrainian passports to see if people were from Mariupol or elsewhere. “I suspect they did this because, if they came across a man not from Mariupol, they would assume he was a soldier,” he said. The Russian forces also made Serhii expose his shoulders, apparently to look for signs of bruising which might indicate that a person had used a firearm. Another resident said that they inspected the hands of the adult men for signs that they had been fighting or using a weapon., Four people interviewed said that soldiers inspected their phones at the checkpoints, something that they had heard might happen, so they had deleted any photos of the damage from Russian forces’ bombardment in Mariupol before leaving the city. At one checkpoint, a Russian soldier asked Olexsandr if he had any “forbidden” photos on his phone. “I asked him what was considered forbidden, and the soldier told me any photos of any Russian military vehicles,” Olexsandr said. He had wiped his phone before passing through the checkpoints., None of the Mariupol residents described serious mistreatment by soldiers at the checkpoints. One of them said that the Russian soldiers treated everyone in his car correctly, but several people were detained from the vehicle that was two cars ahead of them at the checkpoint. When that car made it to the checkpoint, he said, the soldiers fired their weapons in the air after what seemed to be a verbal altercation. One soldier then dragged a man out of the car, bent him over a barricade, and fired a weapon over his head. After that, everyone in the car was detained. The witness did not know what had led to the detentions or what happened to those who were detained., Another person said his car was fired upon, he presumed by Russian forces because he was driving through an area fully under Russian control, but it was too dark to see. Later he examined the car and said the side had been pierced by a metal fragment. Mykola, the principal, said that between Mariupol and exiting the area under Russian control, he saw at least 10 burned cars on the sides of the road or in fields, and in one case, he saw a dead body lying next to a burned-out car., Those Left Behind, As of March 17, several thousand residents – a small fraction of the residents still trapped in Mariupol by the intense fighting – were able to flee. Everyone interviewed said that they had only been able to leave because they had their own car or were able to find a ride with someone who did, and that many people with whom they had sheltered in basements and those with limited mobility had stayed behind., Because electricity and telecommunications are not functioning, those who were able to leave had no information about those who are still in the city. One woman who was able to find a ride said she was forced to leave her mother who could not make it down the stairs to the shelter in her wheelchair., Ina said that she left with about 16 other people, and about 65 others remained in the basement where they were sheltering. “As we were leaving, we noticed there was only about two-days’ worth of food stocks left for everyone, so I don’t know what will happen to them,” she said., Mykola said at one point his school, where he was sheltering, had housed 200 people. When he left, he said at least 50 people remained in the school with no means of transport out., Several residents cited locations housing hundreds of people at the time they left the city, and they were worried that these areas might come under attack., Legal Obligations and Relevant International Humanitarian Law, Sieges directed at military targets, which includes enemy forces, and for the purpose of capturing an enemy-controlled area, are permitted under the laws of war, as a legitimate military objective. Siege tactics cannot include starving a civilian population or attacking, destroying, removing, or rendering useless objects indispensable to the civilian population’s survival. Deliberate employment of such tactics is a war crime. Tactics that arbitrarily deny civilians access to items essential for their well-being such as water, food, and medicine are also prohibited, and all parties should protect objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, including those necessary for water distribution and sanitation., The laws of war prohibit deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects and attacks that cause anticipated harm to civilians disproportionate to the expected military benefit.Unlawful and wanton excessive destruction of property, not militarily justified, is a war crime. Both parties are required, as far as feasible, to take necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians, and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations., Evacuations of civilians in and around Mariupol who want to leave, should be facilitated. When an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors is put into effect, parties should not breach that agreement in any way that places civilians at risk. All parties must abide by their obligations not to carry out attacks that would target or cause harm to civilians who are on the move, including along railway and road routes being used to leave. Parties should allow access for neutral and independent humanitarian actors to support civilians at particular risk who may need assistance to leave, including people with disabilities, older people, pregnant people, children, and people with chronic or severe medical conditions., Parties to the conflict are prohibited from deporting or forcibly transferring the civilian population of an occupied territory, in whole or in part, unless it is demanded by civilian security or imperative military reasons. The fourth Geneva Convention prohibits individual or mass forcible transfers of civilians from occupied territory to the territory of the occupying power or any other country, occupied or not, regardless of their motive. If for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement, provisional, temporary evacuations may occur, but those evacuated must be transferred back to their homes as soon as the specific hostilities in the area in question have ceased. Violation of this prohibition is a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions and prosecutable as a war crime. The International Criminal Court, which has opened an investigation into potential war crimes in Ukraine, can prosecute the war crime of “the deportation or transfer [by the Occupying Power] of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory.”, Ukraine, and Russia in the areas that it currently controls access to or occupies, should ensure that there is adequate supply of food, water, and medicine, and that services vital for the civilian population continue., Both parties should abide by obligations to allow and facilitate the rapid passage of humanitarian aid for all civilians in need and not deny access or arbitrarily interfere with distribution. Starving civilians as a method of warfare is a war crime.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-ensure-safe-passage-aid-mariupol-civilians
Update 27 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (20 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,20 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that around half of the staff at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had finally been able to rotate and return to their homes after working at the Russian-controlled site for nearly four weeks, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine’s national regulator confirmed that the rotation of on-site personnel had begun in the morning and that those who had left had already been replaced by other Ukrainian staff., Director General Grossi, who has expressed deep concern about the well-being of the Ukrainian staff at the site of the 1986 accident, welcomed the news about the partial rotation of personnel. He said they had been carrying out their important work tasks under immensely stressful and tiring conditions in the presence of foreign military forces and without proper rest., The difficult staffing situation at the Chornobyl NPP over the past few weeks has put at risk one of seven indispensable nuclear safety pillars that he outlined earlier this month, which states that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., Russian forces took control of the Chornobyl NPP on 24 February, but its Ukrainian staff have continued to manage day-to-day operations at the site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located. Before today’s rotation, the same work shift had been on-site since the day before the Russian forces entered the area., “It is a positive – albeit long overdue – development that some staff at the Chornobyl NPP have now rotated and returned to their families. They deserve our full respect and admiration for having worked in these extremely difficult circumstances,” Director General Grossi said. “They were there for far too long. I sincerely hope that remaining staff from this shift can also rotate soon.”, The challenging and uncertain situation at the Chornobyl NPP has underlined the importance of an IAEA initiative aimed at ensuring the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, the Director General said. He said he was continuing consultations with a view to agreeing on a framework for the delivery of IAEA assistance. “With this framework in place, the Agency would be able to provide effective technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of these facilities,” he said., In southern Ukraine, the two operating units at the Zaporizhzhya NPP have gradually increased their power output to two thirds of their maximum capacity of around 1000 Megawatt electric (MWe) each after the repair last week of two power lines, one external and one on-site, the regulator said., The Zaporizhzhya NPP now has three high voltage (750 kV) off-site power lines available, including one on standby. The regulator reiterated that the NPP’s safety systems were fully functional at the site, which is controlled by Russian forces since 4 March., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational NPPs, the Ukrainian regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including the two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range and safety systems are operating, it said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-27-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-20-march-2022

Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, resulting in widescale destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement., The situation in the country continues to deteriorate, with ongoing clashes in Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sievierodonetsk and Northern Kyiv. Between 24 and 17 March, the OHCHR recorded 2,032 civilian casualties, including 780 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA). On 16 March, Mariupol’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre (Donetska oblast, east), where more than 1,000 people sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities, suffered extensive damages after an alleged airstrike. Unconfirmed preliminary reports suggest that the bomb shelter withstood the blast, as people were pulled from the rubble., As internal displacement in Ukraine continues, health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs are quickly emerging as areas of concern. Access to food and safe drinking water is limited or completely cut off and many civilians remain trapped in urban centres while those living in crowded shelters have limited access to sanitation facilities and health services, thus increasing their risk of infectious disease transmission. Approximately 35.7% of the population of Ukraine has received two COVID-19 vaccines so a new outbreak could overwhelm the country’s already compromised healthcare capacity. More than 300 healthcare facilities are located in areas experiencing active hostilities or with a significant presence of Russian Federation forces, while 600 facilities are within 10km of ongoing clashes, leaving the health system particularly vulnerable to infrastructural damages and severe interruptions in critical services. Meanwhile, damaged water infrastructure in eastern Ukraine continues to go unrepaired as shelling and fighting continue., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 18 March, over 3.2 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. Additionally, IOM has calculated that the war has already led to the internal displacement of over 6.4 million people. In this context, the United Nations is becoming increasingly concerned about the risk of trafficking in persons as well as the well-being of vulnerable persons, such as children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-8-18-march-2022

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 19 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,20 Mar 2022,"Date: 20 March 2022 From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 19 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,361 civilian casualties in the country: 902 killed and 1,459 injured. This included:, a total of 902 killed (179 men, 134 women, 11 girls, and 25 boys, as well as 39 children and 514 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,459 injured (156 men, 117 women, 22 girls, and 16 boys, as well as 60 children and 1,088 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 992 casualties (248 killed and 744 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 756 casualties (195 killed and 561 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 236 casualties (53 killed and 183 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,369 casualties (654 killed and 715 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 20 March, 115 children had been killed and more than 140 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 19 March, 266 civilians had been killed in the region, including 14 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-19-march-2022-enruuk

These additional measures will help ensure Russia pays a high price for its blatant violation of the UN Charter and its disregard for international humanitarian law., Ukraine is showing remarkable courage and resilience as it endures Russia’s unprovoked war., Following discussions between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence and their Ukrainian counterparts, it is clear that Ukraine’s need for military assistance remains urgent and ongoing. In response, Defence has developed an additional $21 million support package of defensive military assistance for Ukrainian Armed Forces, which will bring Australia’s total military assistance so far to $91 million., To meet Ukrainian priority requests, this package will comprise additional material from Australian Defence Force stocks., The Government will continue to identify opportunities to provide further military assistance where it is able to provide required capability to the Ukraine Armed Forces expeditiously., Russia is targeting civilians, causing immense suffering. Today, the Morrison Government commits to an additional $30 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. This contribution will focus on protecting women, children, the elderly and the disabled, and takes the total we have so far committed to $65 million., To help address education and critical protection needs for children, people living with a disability and those facing risks of gender-based violence, Australia will provide $10 million through non-government organisations under the Australian Humanitarian Partnership., We will provide $8 million to the United Nations Population Fund to protect displaced women and girls from gender-based violence and ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services., To help address increasingly severe food shortages, Australia will also contribute $10 million to the World Food Programme., And to enhance the response of Australian NGOs and their partners in the region, we will provide $2 million to the Emergency Action Alliance Ukraine Appeal – funding which will attract matched private donations., To encourage Australians to respond to the crisis in Ukraine, we will also amend the Overseas Aid Gift Deduction Scheme’s list of eligible countries. Donations to approved aid organisations that are directly supporting Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary will be tax deductible., Australia will continue to impose high costs on Russia. We have so far imposed a total of 476 sanctions on 443 individuals, including many oligarchs close to President Putin, and 33 entities, including most of Russia’s banking sector and all entities responsible for Russia’s sovereign debt., The Government has overnight imposed an immediate ban on Australian exports of alumina and aluminium ores (including bauxite) to Russia, which will limit its capacity to produce aluminium – a critical export for Russia., Aluminium is a global input across the auto, aerospace, packaging, machinery and construction sectors, and a critical input into armaments industries., Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20 per cent of its alumina needs., The Foreign Minister has imposed the export ban under Australia’s autonomous sanctions against Russia. The Government will work closely with exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new and expand existing markets., This significant step demonstrates the Morrison Government’s absolute commitment to holding the Putin regime to account for the egregious way in which it is flouting international law and the law of armed conflict by invading its neighbour without justification, and targeting innocent civilians., Furthermore, Australia will support Ukraine’s energy security by donating at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal. This follows a request for assistance from the Government of Ukraine, supported by the Government of Poland, and discussions with other European partners., The assistance will help keep the country’s coal-fired power generators operating and supplying electricity to country’s power grid, supporting the Ukrainian people by keeping lights on, homes heated, and factories running at this very difficult time., The Australian Government has worked with the Australian coal industry to source supplies. Whitehaven Coal has quickly arranged a shipment, and the Government is now working with Whitehaven and the Ukrainian and Polish Governments to deliver the supplies at the earliest available opportunity., The cost of the coal and its delivery to the destination port will be met by the Australian Government., To help Ukrainians forced to flee from Russia’s military invasion, we will also make available a temporary humanitarian visa to Ukrainians who have arrived in Australia., This visa will be valid for three years and allow people to work, study and access Medicare., Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, the Morrison Government has issued almost 4500 visas to Ukrainians. Over 600 Ukrainians with these visas have arrived and more are coming every day., The Government will continue working closely with the Ukrainian-Australian community to ensure those arriving from Ukraine will be provided support throughout their stay in Australia.

Ukraine: UNESCO implementing new emergency measures to protect journalists [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UNESCO,Protection and Human Rights,17 Mar 2022,"Today UNESCO announced new emergency measures to protect journalists in Ukraine, to help displaced Ukrainian journalist unions to continue their work and to support the free flow of information about the war. The Organization is providing an initial batch of 125 sets of Personal Protective Equipment as well as training on hostile environments., Every day, journalists and media workers are risking their lives in Ukraine to provide life-saving information to local populations and inform the world of the reality of this war. We are determined to support and protect them in every way possible. UNESCO has been resolutely committed to this since the beginning of the crisis, in close collaboration with its international partners and local professionals.
Audrey Azoulay
Director-General of UNESCO, From the first day of the war, UNESCO has consistently called for the respect of international law to protect journalists, technicians, fixers and other media professionals as civilians in a conflict zone, and to refrain from any attack on communication infrastructure. The Organization has also monitored attacks on journalists and damage to press infrastructure, as well as systematically condemning the killing of at least four journalists and the wounding of several others., The UN agency is in constant contact with local journalists' associations, international NGOs and online platforms to identify needs, provide technical advice and work on urgent interventions. To respond to these needs, Audrey Azoulay announced Wednesday several additional emergency measures to be rolled out this week by UNESCO., Providing protective equipment, Thousands of journalists are reporting from the ground in Ukraine, many without the necessary protective equipment or training. This especially includes local Ukrainian journalists who previously reported on local issues and have been thrust into the role of war correspondents, unprepared for the risks they now face., UNESCO is providing them with an initial batch of 125 sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), consisting of bullet-proof press vests and helmets. They will be distributed from next week by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), via its Press Freedom Centre in L’viv, and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ)., As attacks on journalists during the war have already shown, having high quality Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) can save lives. That is why UNESCO is working with its partners to minimise the number of journalists operating without this critical equipment.
Audrey Azoulay
Director-General of UNESCO, Tuesday, the Director-General of UNESCO called on UNESCO Member States to support this effort and provide the financial resources to amplify it., Training journalists to work safely in war zones, UNESCO is translating into Ukrainian and distributing in multiple languages its training manual for journalists on hostile environments, developed together with RSF., In addition to this manual, UNESCO is organizing online courses in Hostile Environment and First Aid Training (HEFAT) as well as the psychological trauma associated with operating in a conflict zone, in partnership with IFJ and RSF. UNESCO will also support efforts to establish in-person training, particularly at the Press Freedom centre in L’viv., Furthermore, UNESCO is providing funding so that trained professionals can be available 24 hours a day through a dedicated hotline set up by National Union of Journalists of Ukraine, which journalists can call if they need assistance evacuating from a danger zone., Helping displaced Ukrainian journalist unions, UNESCO is working with the International Federation of Journalists to relocate the offices of Ukraine’s two journalist unions to Poland, close to the border with Ukraine., This relocation will ensure that the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine (NUJU), with more than 4000 members, and the Independent Media Trade Union of Ukraine (IMTUU), with around 2000, can continue to provide practical support to all journalists in Ukraine and those who have fled to neighbouring countries., Media contact:

Más de 1,5 millones de personas han huido a través de las fronteras de Ucrania en 10 días y muchas decenas de miles más han sido desplazadas dentro del país en lo que es una situación humanitaria y de seguridad extremadamente volátil., Poblaciones necesitadas, Antes de la ofensiva militar, las autoridades ucranianas habían registrado 1,46 millones de personas desplazadas internas (PDI), de las cuales 854.000 residían en zonas controladas por el Gobierno, además de 1,7 millones de personas afectadas por el conflicto. La mayoría habían sido desplazadas desde el estallido inicial de las hostilidades en el sureste de Ucrania en 2014. También había 35.000 personas apátridas y 5.000 personas refugiadas y solicitantes de asilo, principalmente de Afganistán, cuya necesidad de asistencia del ACNUR se espera que sea aún más aguda conforme se desarrolle la situación., Hay dos grupos principales identificados para recibir asistencia: las PDI dentro de Ucrania y las personas refugiadas de Ucrania que han buscado seguridad en el extranjero, la mayoría de las cuales son mujeres, niñas y niños. El Equipo Humanitario de País (HCT, por sus siglas en inglés) prevé que la ofensiva militar podría desplazar hasta 6,7 millones de personas dentro de Ucrania, de las cuales 4,3 millones necesitarán asistencia humanitaria para salvar sus vidas., En el marco de este Llamamiento Suplementario, el ACNUR asistirá a 2,1 millones de PDI durante un período inicial de tres meses, en consonancia con el calendario del Llamamiento Humanitario Urgente. Como parte del HCT, el ACNUR ha tomado medidas para garantizar la seguridad de su personal y de sus socios, para permanecer y brindar protección, albergue, artículos de asistencia básicos y dinero en efectivo para satisfacer las necesidades básicas. El ACNUR también declaró el nivel 3 de emergencia en Ucrania el 25 de febrero de 2022, lo cual supone una respuesta excepcional de todo el ACNUR a la crisis., Este llamamiento también ayudará a 2,4 millones de personas refugiadas. Diez días después del inicio de la ofensiva militar, más de 1,5 millones de personas refugiadas habían llegado a la vecina Hungría, la República de Moldavia, Polonia, Rumanía y Eslovaquia. Algunas continuaron hacia otros países europeos y más allá. El ACNUR calcula que más de 4 millones de personas refugiadas podrían huir de Ucrania en busca de seguridad en los seis meses posteriores a la ofensiva militar. Debido a las circunstancias de la crisis, la mayoría de las personas refugiadas son mujeres, niñas y niños., El 25 de febrero, el ACNUR declaró el nivel 2 de emergencia en la República de Moldavia,

Además, dependiendo de la magnitud de la salida de personas refugiadas y de la respuesta de los países de la región, el ACNUR necesitará USD $240 millones para seis meses de respuesta en Hungría, la República de Moldavia, Polonia, Rumanía, Eslovaquia y otros países afectados.

Update 26 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (19 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,19 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Ukrainian engineers had repaired and reconnected one of three previously disconnected power lines linking the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to the electricity grid, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The repair of the power line means that the country’s largest nuclear power plant now has three off-site lines available, Ukraine’s regulatory authority added. NPPs use such lines to send the electricity they generate to the grid and, if required, to obtain power themselves., The Zaporizhzhya NPP has four high voltage (750 kV) external power lines plus one on standby. It has in recent weeks lost connection to three of them, but the regulator today said one was reconnected in the evening of 18 March. It had earlier said it was expected to be reconnected on 22 March., The regulator reiterated that the NPP’s safety systems were fully functional. It was not known when the two other non-operational lines could be reconnected, it added. Russian forces took control of the NPP on 4 March. Of its six reactors, two are operating., In an official note to the IAEA today on the “current situation of safety of Ukrainian nuclear facilities”, the Russian Federation claimed that at the Zaporizhzhya NPP “the rotation of personnel is carried out in a regular mode” and that “there are no problems with spare parts”. It also said that “explosive objects …. on the territory” of the NPP after events on 4 March “were eliminated”., In northern Ukraine, the Ukrainian national regulator said the Chornobyl NPP remained connected to the power grid after engineers on 14 March restored power supplies that had been lost for five days. Russian forces on 24 February took control of the site.

This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 19 March, 112 children had been killed and more than 140 injured.

Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, The Russian Federation launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In three weeks, more than 3.2 million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine, while an additional 6.5 million people have been displaced internally within the country. Over 12 million people have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine. Humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially., Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines., UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and appealed to neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., UKRAINE SITUATION UPDATE, • The humanitarian needs in eastern Ukraine are becoming even more urgent. More than 200,000 people are now without access to water across several localities in Donetsk oblast while the constant shelling in Luhansk region has destroyed 80% of some localities, leaving almost 100,000 families without electricity., • Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and lack of safe passage are increasing protection risks and posing serious threats to the lives of thousands of civilians. Vulnerable population groups such as women and children, people with disabilities or serious medical conditions, as well as older people and minority groups, are increasingly facing barriers in accessing critical services such as transportation, food, medicines, and emergency health care., • Local authorities across Luhansk region are evacuating some 500 people per day. Overall, some 11,000 people have been evacuated from Luhansk region since 24 February., • The humanitarian situation in Mariupol and Sumy is extremely dire, with residents facing a critical and potentially fatal shortage of food, water and medicines., On 15 March, the Mariupol City Council announced that some 2,000 private vehicles left the city and another 2,000 cars are awaiting the opportunity to leave. Local officials report that some 350,000 people are still trapped in the encircled city, most of whom are living in dire conditions., • On 16 March, there was an attack on a theatre where some 1,000 civilians, including children, were reportedly sheltering in the city of Mariupol. It is reported that 130 survivors have been rescued while hundreds more remain missing., • The Government of Ukraine has adopted a new resolution to simplify registration for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the centralized IDP database. This will improve the understanding of the scope and needs of the IDP population., • In Odesa, authorities have appealed for support for general food assistance to cover the needs of some 450,000 people in the city, as well as support for medicine., • The UNHCR-led Shelter Cluster published its first situation report on 15 March.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-4-18-march-2022

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • Now in its fourth week, the ongoing military offensive has already caused 2,149 civilian casualties, including 816 killed, according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The actual figures are likely much higher as fierce clashes continue across the country., • Nearly 6.5 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine, adding to the almost 3.3 million and counting who have fled the country since 24 February. Combined, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and those who have fled to other countries amount to around 9.8 million people – more than 23 per cent of the country’s population., • On 18 March, the first UN-organized convoy, including relief items from the international non-governmental organization (INGO) People in Need (PIN) and four UN entities (UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP) and World Health Organization (WHO), reached Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east). The convoy delivered 130 tons of much-needed medical supplies, bottled water, ready-to-eat meals and canned food for 35,000 people as well as essential equipment for the repair of water systems that will help improve access to water for some 50,000 people., • The situation in Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) continues to deteriorate. The city’s Deputy Mayor Serhii Orlov says that the estimated death toll of more than 2,350 people is likely as much as two times higher. Mariupol’s City Council reports that around 80 per cent of the city’s housing stock has been affected by ongoing hostilities, with nearly 30 per cent estimated to be damaged beyond the point of repair., • In the southern city of Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast, south), Human Rights Watch claims that cluster munition rockets – which are subject to an international treaty ban on account of their widespread indiscriminate effects and the long-lasting dangers they pose to civilians – were repeatedly fired into the densely populated city on three separate occasions between 7 and 13 March, causing several civilian casualties and damaging homes, businesses and other civilian infrastructure., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Now in its fourth week, the military offensive in Ukraine continues to generate increasing civilian casualties and grave humanitarian consequences. As of 17 March, OHCHR reports 2,149 civilian casualties, including 816 killed, figures that are likely much higher. These include 903 reported casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (172 killed and 503 injured in Government-controlled areas (GCA), and 50 killed and 178 injured in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) and 1,246 civilian casualties in other parts of Ukraine., Ongoing hostilities in Ukraine continue to drive unprecedented levels of displacement both inside the country and across international borders. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted a representative survey of the general population in Ukraine to gather initial insights into internal displacement and mobility flows. The methodology and results of the survey were reviewed by the Protection Cluster, OCHA, UNHCR and REACH, and the group agreed that IOM’s survey provided a credible population figure for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine, which is now estimated at 6.48 million, adding to the almost 3.3 million and counting who have fled the country since 24 February, according to UNHCR., Combined, the number of IDPs and those who have fled to other countries amount to around 9.8 million people – more than 23 per cent of the country’s population. In a context characterized by large-scale and complex movements, the risks of gender-based violence (GBV), human trafficking, and sexual exploitation and abuse have risen exponentially both within and outside Ukraine. As such, Accountability to Affected Populations and protection considerations must be at the heart of all response activities., On 17 March, the Government of Ukraine reported that nearly 6,000 people – most from the southern city of Mariupol and small towns across Kyivska oblast, including Borodianka, Brovary and Shevchenko – were evacuated along eight of the nine agreed-upon evacuation corridors. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reports that around 300,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine towards Russia since the escalation of hostilities. This includes people who have reportedly been evacuated and those who have crossed the border seeking refuge on their own. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., Early on 18 March, multiple missile strikes reportedly destroyed the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Facility (Lvivska oblast, west) – located just 6 km from the city centre of Lviv – as ongoing hostilities continue to spread further west. In the past two weeks, there has been an increase in attacks on both military and civilian infrastructure in western Ukraine, including against airports and military facilities in Ivano-Frankivska (west), Lvivska and Volynska (north-west) oblasts., Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing military offensive as ongoing hostilities have flared up in recent days. The current situation is only exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities and unmet humanitarian needs that have accumulated over the last eight years of active fighting in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (east)., On 17 March, in the town of Merefa (Kharkivska oblast, east) – about 25 km south-west of Kharkiv – at least 21 people were reportedly killed and other 25 injured, 10 of whom remain in serious condition, following relentless shelling. The next day, on 18 March in neighbouring Donetska oblast, local officials report that a missile strike killed at least two people and injured six others in the city of Kramatorsk., In the southern Khersonska oblast, oblast authorities say the number of people without access to water and electricity continues to increase, reaching 45,750 as of 17 March – an increase of about 1,250 compared to the day before. Overall, more than 65 settlements have no access to electricity, while nearly 20 only have partial access to power. As of 16 March, the Ministry of Energy says that more than 933,000 users across Ukraine remain without electricity., In the southern city of Mykolaiv, Human Rights Watch claims that cluster munition rockets – which are subject to an international treaty ban on account of their widespread indiscriminate effects and the long-lasting dangers they pose to civilians – were repeatedly fired into the densely populated city on three separate occasions between 7 and 13 March, causing several civilian casualties and damaging homes, businesses and other civilian infrastructure., The situation in Mariupol continues to get worse by the hour. The city’s Deputy Mayor Serhii Orlov says that the estimated death toll of more than 2,350 people is likely as much as two times higher in reality, as there are still many people trapped under the rubble. Mr. Orlov adds that 80-90 per cent of the city has been bombed since 24 February, leaving almost all buildings in the city either damaged or destroyed., The City Council of Mariupol says the city is being hit by 50 to 100 artillery shells every day, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into hiding in overcrowded shelters and basements with limited food and water. According to the City Council, around 80 per cent of Mariupol’s housing stock has been affected by ongoing hostilities, with nearly 30 per cent estimated to be damaged beyond the point of repair.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-18-march-2022-enruuk

"Ukraine: UN expert warns of global famine, urges end to Russia aggression",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",18 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (18 March 2022) - The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused profound rates of hunger in the country, and raises the risk of higher rates of hunger in Russia, and may cause a global surge in malnutrition and famine. He issues the following statement:, “For the last three years, global rates of hunger and famine have been on the rise. With the Russian invasion, we are now facing the risk of imminent famine and starvation in more places around the world. The military attacks against Ukraine must be stopped immediately before there are profound global, long-term consequences to everyone’s food security., Ukraine and Russia are two of the top five grain exporters in the world. By some estimates, what is at stake is global food security since the global agricultural trade involved is worth nearly $1.8 trillion. The immediate food related effects of the conflict are being felt in Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh, and Iran who buy more than 60 percent of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and all of them have outstanding food imports. Lebanon, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, and Pakistan also rely heavily on the two countries for their wheat supply. With the planting season starting soon in Ukraine and Russia, I am concerned about long-term disruptions., I’m also worried about how the Russian invasion of Ukraine will hurt people in Russia. Many countries have imposed targeted economic sanctions against Russia and many businesses are voluntarily divesting from or boycotting Russia. As economic sanctions against Russia are expanding beyond individuals and institutions and are becoming more general, my concern is that the most vulnerable people in Russia may bear a disproportionate burden. The effectiveness of sanctions should always be measured against the potential violation of people’s human rights and humanitarian consequences., Equal thought and effort should be directed towards envisaging and facilitating the recovery process in Ukraine. Even with war raging, the international community should give special attention to support family-run farms and small-scale farmers in Ukraine. Family-run farms and small-scale farmers are proving to be the most adaptable and resilient in times of crisis. Ukraine’s recovery will depend on family and small-scale farmers., Hunger, famine and malnutrition are always the result of political failures. As with any military invasion, all countries must work in solidarity to address the urgent nutritional needs of all vulnerable people especially refugees, older persons, people with disabilities, and children. Food should never be weaponized and no country in the world should be driven into famine and desperation.”, ENDS, Mr. Michael FAKHRI is the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food He was appointed Special Rapporteur d by the Human Rights Council in March 2020 and assumed his functions on 1 May 2020.

"United Nations ‘Not Aware of Any Biological Weapons Programme in Ukraine’, Disarmament Affairs Chief Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,18 Mar 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
8999TH MEETING (AM)
SC/14835
18 MARCH 2022, Delegate Calls Moscow’s Claims Nonsense, ‘Rehash of Amateurish Information’, The United Nations is still not aware of any biological weapons programme being conducted in Ukraine, the senior disarmament official told the Security Council today, responding to fresh allegations by the Russian Federation of the existence of such research., Izumi Nakamitsu, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, addressed the Council at the outset of the emergency session, as several of its 15 members denounced the meeting as a “charade” and “not worthy of a permanent member of the Security Council”., Referring to the Russian Federation’s circulation of fresh documents alleging the existence of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine, she said the United Nations has neither the mandate nor the capacity to investigate such allegations. Reiterating her statement before the Council at a similar meeting on 11 March, she stressed that the United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programme in Ukraine (see Press Release SC/14827). She added that both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States parties to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons., The representative of the Russian Federation, outlining his delegation’s newly circulated documents, said evidence of dangerous biological weapons projects — carried out in Ukraine, and supported by the United States — was recently discovered in the course of his country’s special military operation. On 11 March, when confronted by similar evidence, the delegate of the United States was not able to explain documented proof of a 2005 agreement signed between United States and Ukrainian ministers, which laid out support for joint biological research on Ukrainian territory., Over the last week, he said, new details have come to light, namely that the components for biological weapons were being created on Ukrainian territory. Citing proof of direct United States funding to Ukraine amounting to $32 million, he said the new documents refute United State assertions that it does not operate any biological laboratories in Ukraine. “The facts show otherwise,” he said, noting that Ukrainian authorities gave the United States carte blanche to carry out dangerous experiments on its territory in return for free travel to international conferences. Those included studies into Crimean-Congo Fever, leptospirosis and other dangerous pathogens, whose use could be easily dressed up as “naturally occurring”. “We are talking about more and more proof that, at the heart of Central Europe, a dangerous biological operation was being carried out,” he stressed, warning that the new evidence is “only the tip of the iceberg” and pledging to keep the global community informed as more facts emerge., Responding to those allegations, the representative of the United States recalled that the Council already heard a similar “tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories” at its 11 March meeting. Today, the Russian Federation’s claims sound as if they were forwarded through a chain email from “some dark corner of the Internet”. As she said on 11 March, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons programme, but only hosts public health facilities that are proudly supported by the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other Governments and international institutions. Moreover, she expressed grave concern that today’s fresh allegations could be part of a Russian “false flag effort in action”, warning that Moscow could then use biological or chemical weapons against Ukrainians., The United Kingdom’s delegate, recalling that just yesterday the Council discussed the devastating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, said today it is hearing yet another “rehash of amateurish information that we discussed and debunked last Friday”. “It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now,” she said, adding that the real threat to international peace and security is the ongoing Russian aggression. Describing today’s charade as “not worthy of a permanent member of the Security Council”, she urged Moscow to urgently end its invasion of Ukraine., The representative of Gabon was among other Council members who expressed concern about the worsening crisis in Ukraine, as well as the grave tenor of today’s meeting, while noting that no new facts have been raised since the 11 March meeting on the same topic. All States parties must abide by the terms of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, of which Gabon is also a member, he said, reiterating his country’s repeated calls for the parties to engage in negotiations in good faith in order to bring an end to the war, whose consequences are already being felt far beyond Ukraine., China’s representative struck a different tone, emphasizing that any information on biological military activities should trigger “high concern” by the international community. Urging the relevant parties to take a responsible approach, he encouraged those mentioned in the Russian Federation’s new evidence to respond to questions raised and offer timely, comprehensive clarifications to assuage the international community’s doubts. “We do not consider it too much to ask,” he said, while cautioning against the use of any double standards., Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, Ireland, France, Ghana, Brazil, Kenya, Norway, India, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 11:17 a.m., Briefing, IZUMI NAKAMITSU, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said she has been informed of the Russian Federation’s submission of new documents regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. As she informed the Council in a similar meeting on 11 March, the United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programmes. Noting that the Organization currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate such information, she said both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States parties to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons., Outlining possible courses of action for resolving inter-State problems under that Convention — which include the possible convening of a consultative meeting — she said the Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support any procedures under its terms that States parties may decide to use. Turning to the issue of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, she said the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that according to the Ukrainian authorities, all safety systems at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remained fully functional as of 17 March, following the site’s loss of connection to a third external power line linking it to the national electricity grid., Although officials from the Russian Federation’s State nuclear power company were present at the facilities in southern Ukraine, she said, Ukrainian staff continue to operate the plant. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant remains connected to the national electricity grid, following reconnection on 14 March. However, Ukrainian operators and guards have not been able to rotate for three weeks. IAEA reports that, according to the Ukrainian authorities, eight of the country’s 15 reactors remain operational. Meanwhile, IAEA is still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at Chernobyl, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other nuclear power plants in Ukraine., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) recalled that, in the course of his country’s special military operation in Ukraine, information was discovered of dangerous projects related to a biological and weapons programme in Ukraine, backed by Western colleagues. Last week, when confronted by such evidence, the United States delegate was not able to explain documentary proof of such cooperation — namely, of a 2005 agreement signed between United States and Ukrainian ministers, which laid out support for joint biological research on Ukrainian territory. Over the last week, new details have come to light, namely that the components for biological weapons were being created on Ukrainian territory. Indeed, he said, the United States was not assisting the Ukrainian Ministry of Health as it claimed, but rather the Ministry of Defence. The Russian Federation has circulated proof of that agreement to the Council, including proof of direct funding to Ukraine amounting to $32 million and of research direction by the Pentagon., The representatives of the United States continue to muddle that information, asserting that the country does not operate in any biological laboratories in Ukraine, “but the facts show otherwise”, he continued. In fact, the Ukrainian authorities gave the United States carte blanche to carry out dangerous experiments on its territory in return for free travel and accommodations to international conferences. Describing the use of the Ukrainian territory by the United States as cynical, he called on other countries that provide such access to Washington, D.C., to carefully study their cooperation contracts and to share data on the activities of some 360 laboratories under United States control around the world., In Ukraine, he said, evidence points to studies that were conducted on Crimean-Congo fever, leptospirosis and other dangerous pathogens. As those are naturally present in both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, their use could then be easily dressed up as naturally occurring. In that context, he called for more attention to be paid to the contractors selected by the United States to carry out such research, namely the Black & Veatch company. Noting that research into six families of viruses — including coronaviruses — were identified in the United States-Ukraine research since 2009, he said documents now reveal the involvement of the Kharkov Institute, which was central in studying how such illnesses could pass from bats into humans. Ukrainian specialists were not informed of associated risks and were kept in the dark as to the real goals of the research. Meanwhile, biological waste was transported long distances and evidence was often destroyed., Spotlighting the United States Government staff member Joanna Wintrol as the individual who signed the documents found by the Russian Federation, he stated: “We are talking about more and more proof that, at the heart of Central Europe, a dangerous biological operation was being carried out.” Recalling that, in 2018, residents of Luhansk and Donetsk saw the spread of a new, deadly, multi-resistant strain of tuberculosis, he stressed that the outbreak now “does not look like a coincidence”. The Russian Federation has long pushed for an additional protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention to provide more transparency on such activities, but the United States has blocked it. Today, it is evident that the facts discovered are “only the tip of the iceberg”. The Russian Federation will continue to keep the international community informed as more facts emerge, he said., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the Council heard nothing new from the High Representative today “because there is nothing new”. On 11 March, the Council heard that the United Nations is not aware of any alleged programmes in Ukraine inconsistent with international treaty obligations, including on chemical or biological weapons. “What are we doing this morning,” he asked, questioning why the Council is being asked to consider non-existent chemical weapons programmes in Ukraine, developed in non-existent laboratories and financed by non-existent programmes from the United States. The Russian Federation’s claims remain unverified, unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and not independently assessed: “in a word, not credible”. He blamed Moscow for abusing the Council in an attempt to shift attention from its crimes and stalled invasion of Ukraine, pointing also to its track record of accusing others of crimes it perpetrates, including attempted assassinations and poisoning of its own citizens. Claims must be properly and fully investigated. The Russian Federation should agree to an immediate ceasefire throughout Ukraine, withdraw all its forces to within 40 kilometres of suspected locations, request United Nations security forces to secure a radius of that size, and allow diagnostic and research teams to conduct investigations. Instead, “we have the impression that Russia speaks to itself”, he said, stressing that with one exception, “everyone around this table”, as well as 140 countries in the General Assembly, has been clear on the need to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, dealing with issues not by killing innocent people and destroying a country, but rather through negotiations and diplomatic channels., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that last week the Council heard a “tirade of bizarre conspiracy theories”. Today, it is hearing things that sound like they were forwarded to her Russian counterpart through a chain email from “some dark corner of the Internet”. As she said on 11 March, Ukraine does not have a biological weapons programme. “There are no such labs, not near Russia’s border, not anywhere,” she said. They are public health facilities, proudly supported by the United States, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other Governments and international institutions. Rather, it is the Russian Federation that has long maintained a chemical weapons programme in violation of international law and a well-documented history of chemical weapons use. “Russia is the aggressor,” she said, recalling that it poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal with nerve agents, and currently supports Syria’s Assad regime, shielding it from accountability. The Council convened today because the Russian Federation knew that its ploy to pass an exculpatory resolution had failed. “This meeting is a result of their isolation on this Council and on the world stage,” she said, reiterating “deep and serious” concern that this decision represents a “potential false flag effort in action”. Moscow has repeatedly accused others of the very violations it plans to perpetrate; it is possible it plans to use chemical or biological agents against Ukrainians. The United States will continue to tell the world where it believes the Russian Federation is heading and recall that Moscow has repeatedly lied to the Council in recent weeks. Despite all evidence, the Russian Federation said it would not invade Ukraine, that it was interested in diplomacy. “Where are the 100,000 troops who were sitting on the Russian side of the border now?” she asked. Sadly, many have given their lives in this “senseless unconscionable war” against the Ukrainian people, she said, adding that Moscow lied to its own people as well, shutting down its own media to hide the truth. Its disinformation is a sign of its desperation. “That is the truth,” she said. “We will continue to ensure the world sees it and hears it.”, GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said that it is deeply troubling to hear the Russian Federation’s unsubstantiated, unfounded allegations, noting that the only “so-called proof provided is to point to transparent projects necessary for biosecurity, for human or animal health. Research of the kind carried out by many countries to advance global health”, she said. Urging Moscow to cease its campaigns of disinformation, she pointed out that Russian military forces in Ukraine have already demonstrated reckless disregard for nuclear safety and security since the start of their invasion, which raises real fears of a significant radiological, chemical or biological accident. Stressing that the use of biological and chemical weapons is immoral and illegal in any circumstance, she urged Moscow not to violate or undermine the essential multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation instruments of global security., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), noting that no new information was presented today, said the Russian Federation is mounting a cynical and irresponsible disinformation campaign. “This meeting is not based on any proven fact,” he stressed, noting that Ukraine has no biological weapons programme and complies with its international obligations in that regard. The Russian Federation, on the other hand, has repeatedly used chemical weapons in recent years — including in support of the Syrian regime and in the United Kingdom in targeted assassination attempts. Warning against inventing an alternate reality, he expressed deep concern that such disinformation could be a prelude to the use of a chemical or biological weapon in Ukraine. “If such attacks took place, there would be only one responsible, it would be Russia,” he said, describing such a possible use of weapons as an intolerable escalation of the conflict that would lead to massive economic sanctions in response., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), recalling that just yesterday the Council discussed the devastating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, said today it is hearing yet another “rehash of amateurish information that we discussed and debunked last Friday”. “It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now,” she said, stressing that laboratories in Ukraine carrying out research into public health hazards are not a threat to international peace and security, unlike the massive aggression being carried out in Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Describing today’s charade as “not worthy of a permanent member of the Security Council”, she urged Moscow to urgently end its invasion., KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) reaffirmed that a conclusive determination of Ukraine’s biological programme can only be made after assessments by internationally credited bodies. The weaponization of chemical or biological agents would be unconscionable and should not be contemplated. The international community must forge consensus towards the creation of a verification regime for the Biological Weapons Convention, given recent global developments, she said, stressing that the possession of weapons of mass destruction neither assures international peace nor national security. She raised the pressing need to cease hostilities and unconditionally and immediately withdraw all Russian invading troops from Ukraine’s borders, especially given the price hikes in food and gas negatively impacting the fragile global economy struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. She welcomed the Secretary-General’s intention to work to mitigate the war’s impact and reinforce solidarity, adding that civilians must be protected, with safe passage provided for evacuees. She also called for an immediate end to attacks on medical facilities and for the protection of medical and humanitarian personnel., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) requested Council members to refrain from attempting to interpret his country’s position on any issue, stressing that it is “perfectly capable of presenting its own views”. Fifty years ago, Brazil adopted the Biological Weapons Convention, determined to exclude the possibility of such agents and toxins from being used as weapons. It took that important step convinced that such use would be repugnant to the conscience of humankind. Today, for the second time in a week, the Council has gathered to discuss alleged development, production and stockpiling of such abhorrent weapons. Accusations of this gravity must be thoroughly substantiated by solid evidence, which must be presented to and confirmed by an independent and impartial authority as foreseen in the Convention’s Article VI. Brazil has long supported the creation of a multilateral verification protocol to the Convention, with measures to guarantee protection and security against emerging threats. The situation today only reinforces the need to establish such a mechanism. Brazil looks forward to Convention’s ninth review conference, he said, calling for a restart of negotiations to strengthen the regime, including by creating a protocol and deepening discussions on biosafety and security. Stressing that legitimate scientific and technological research should be kept distinct from possible violations of the prohibition of the development and production of biological weapons “if we wish to preserve the current biological weapons regime”, he said research into new and dangerous pathogens should be subject to strict transparency mechanisms. He condemned in the strongest possible terms the use or threat thereof of chemical or biological weapons by anyone, under any circumstances., STEPHANIE NGONYO MUIGAI (Kenya), noting the intolerable cost of the armed conflict in Ukraine, pointed to the increase in prices of essential commodities all over the world, particularly in the global South, due to shortages and sanctions. Expressing concern about the targeting of civilians as well as residential homes, health facilities, shelters, and power and water infrastructure, she stressed that the Council should focus on getting a cessation of the military campaign. Any allegation of development of biological weapons in contravention of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Biological Weapons must not be taken lightly, she emphasized, calling on all State parties to the Convention to make use of the established mechanisms to investigate such allegations and to seize the opportunity of the Ninth Review Conference later this year to strengthen the biological weapons regime., MONA JUUL (Norway) said that she did not understand the rationale behind the last-minute call to have further discussions about the biological weapons programmes in Ukraine today. Further, she said it was unacceptable of the Russian Federation to continue to repeat its unsupported claim that Ukraine is preparing to use biological weapons. Stressing that Norway remains a firm supporter of the Biological Weapons Convention, she reiterated her country’s condemnation on any use of such weapons. She also expressed deep regret that the Russian Federation, by calling these meetings, seeks to undermine this Council and its vital role in peace diplomacy. “Russia is waging an unlawful war against another UN Member State with devastating humanitarian consequences,” she stated, adding that the sole responsibility for the war falls on the Russian Federation., CHRISTOPHE NANGA (Gabon) said that, in the absence of any new facts since last week’s meeting, his country’s position remains unchanged. All States parties must abide by the terms of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, of which Gabon is also a member. He reiterated his call for the parties to engage in negotiations in good faith in order to bring an end to the war, whose consequences are already being felt far beyond Ukraine., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) stressed that his country attaches high importance to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention as a key global and non-discriminatory disarmament instrument, prohibiting an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. Any matter relating to obligations under the Convention should be addressed as per its provisions and through consultations and cooperation between the parties concerned. Expressing deep concern at the progressively deteriorating situation in Ukraine, he welcomed the latest round of diplomatic talks between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, stressing that immediate cessation of hostilities and diligently pursuing the path of dialogue and diplomacy is the only way forward., ZHANG JUN (China) said he shared the desire of the international community to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible in order to avoid more civilian casualties. That the Russian Federation and Ukraine have held four negotiation rounds and “stay in touch with each other” offers hope for a ceasefire. China will continue to facilitate dialogue and supports the United Nations in ramping up mediation efforts. He encouraged parties to carry out activities that are conducive to peace talks, pointing to the goal of European security. He expressed hope that the United States, European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) can engage the Russian Federation in a comprehensive dialogue that explores ways to put in place a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture, based on the principle of “indivisible security”. China’s position on weapons of mass destruction is clear, he affirmed, noting that it stands for their complete prohibition and destruction. It opposes the development, possession and use of any such weapons by any country, and he urged those that have yet to do so to destroy their stockpiles. He called for early negotiations of the Biological Weapons Convention verification regime, adding that China has been a victim of biological and chemical weapons use. Stressing that any information on biological military activities should trigger “high concern” by the international community, he urged the relevant parties to take a responsible approach. The Russian Federation has reviewed new documents, and he encouraged the party concerned to respond to questions and offer timely, comprehensive clarifications to remove the international community’s doubts. “We do not consider it too much to ask,” he said, cautioning against the use of any double standards., JUAN RAMON DE LA FUENTE RAMIREZ (Mexico) affirmed that the Biological Weapons Convention is the fundamental instrument within the disarmament regime to address issues raised today, as it contains mechanisms for dispute resolution consultations, which should be used when a States party deems it necessary. When there are doubts, as suggested, “why don’t you proceed on terms of the Convention”, he asked, stressing that the Council cannot be held hostage by contradictory signs, raising issues one day, only to substitute them the next. Explaining that Mexico continues to be open to dialogue and negotiations, he said there must be reciprocity on this effective commitment to dialogue. Noting that less than 24 hours have passed since the last Council meeting on Ukraine, he said a cessation of hostilities is urgently needed to ensure the unhindered supply of humanitarian aid, without restrictions or exclusions., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) said the use of biological weapons or other weapons of mass destruction by any party under any circumstances cannot be justified, describing their use as an attack on humanity as a whole, for which perpetrators must be held accountable. He said their prohibition, including through the Biological Weapons Convention, is among the world’s most important achievements, and that maintaining consensus on their prohibition is part of the Council’s responsibility to maintain international peace and security. He called for using all diplomatic tools available to alleviate civilian suffering and to stop hostilities in Ukraine, which in turn would allow for resolving the conflict in line with international law., The representative of the Russian Federation, taking the floor again, took issue with statements that were “literally repeated” from the Council’s 11 March meeting, adding that “if you have heard nothing new, it is because you were not listening to us”. His delegation provided new material and documents, which it disseminated. These documents have signatures, prepared on the basis of cooperation between the United States and Ukraine. He cautioned the representative of the United States against making unfounded accusations about Russian propaganda, and to instead answer the questions raised. He denounced accusations that the Russian Federation would deploy biological chemical weapons against Ukraine, when in fact it officially warned that it has information about Ukrainian nationalists using chemical agents in some regions, and then accusing Moscow of having deployed them. “This is a false flag operation,” he clarified. He also did not say that Ukraine has a military biological programme. Rather, he said the programme belongs to the United States and that Ukraine “is being kept in the dark”. He also offered facts about the spike in lethal diseases in Ukraine, for which there are no explanations, but which could be linked to this kind of activity. Secret military programmes are not shared with the United Nations “or anyone else”, he said, noting that the Russian Federation would keep the Council abreast of new facts, which he assured would soon be revealed., For information media.

Distinguished Members of the Security Council,, I am aware that the Russian Federation has submitted documents regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine., As I informed the Council last Friday, the United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons programmes.
I would also like to note that the United Nations currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information., As I previously informed the Council, the relevant instrument of international law is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons., The Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention., Mister President,, The Biological Weapons Convention contains several measures to which concerned States Parties can have recourse in order to address situations in which they have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers., Pursuant to Article V of the Convention, its States Parties undertake to consult one another and to co-operate in solving any problems., Such consultation and cooperation can take place on a bilateral basis between the concerned States Parties, or it can be undertaken through appropriate international procedures., One such international procedure that has been elaborated within the framework of the Biological Weapons Convention is the convening of a consultative meeting., Other possibilities for addressing concerns between States Parties also exist under Article V of the Convention, as well as under Article VI., As I mentioned last week, the BWC needs to be operationalized and institutionalized to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to face future challenges. The Convention’s upcoming Ninth Review Conference presents the ideal opportunity for its States Parties to comprehensively strengthen the Convention., The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support any procedures under the Biological Weapons Convention that States Parties may decide to use., Mister President,, Turning to the issue of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that according to the Ukrainian authorities, all safety systems at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant remained fully functional as of yesterday, following the site’s loss of connection to a third external power line linking it to the national electricity grid., Although officials from Russia’s state nuclear power company were present at the facilities in southern Ukraine, Ukrainian staff continue to operate the plant., The Chornobyl power plant remains connected to the national electricity grid, following reconnection on 14 March. However, Ukrainian operators and guards have not been able to rotate for three weeks., The IAEA has reported that, according to the Ukrainian authorities, eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating., I understand that, regarding nuclear safeguards, the IAEA is still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other nuclear power plants in Ukraine., I take this opportunity to reiterate the Secretary-General’s support for efforts by the IAEA to establish a framework on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and urge all parties to work towards this end., Mister President,, I wish also to highlight the terrible toll this conflict is having on civilians. The civilian casualties continue to rise: as of 16 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had recorded 2,032 civilian casualties, including 780 killed of whom 58 were children., The actual number of casualties is believed to be much higher., Most of these casualties are caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area., These include attacks using heavy artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems, ballistic and cruise missiles, and air strikes.
I also want to reiterate that attacks directed at civilians are prohibited by international humanitarian law.
We must find a diplomatic solution to this war to put an end to the violence., As Secretary-General Guterres said, and I quote: “We need an immediate cessation of hostilities and serious negotiations based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law., We need peace. Peace for the people of Ukraine. Peace for the world. We need peace now.” I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-representative-s-briefing-security-council-threats-international-peace-and

Avoiding an Even Worse Catastrophe in Ukraine,Analysis,ICG,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,18 Mar 2022,"With the war in Ukraine grinding on, Western governments should pursue a strategy that raises costs to Russia while urgently exploring the contours of a negotiated solution. Such an approach is imperative to halt Ukraine’s decimation – and to ward off the gravest threat of nuclear confrontation in decades., As large-scale war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, Western governments backing Kyiv are balancing several imperatives. On one hand, they must support Kyiv as it resists a Russian invasion that is destroying much of the country and raise the costs of aggression to Moscow. On the other, they have to minimise risks of the war spiralling into a wider confrontation between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) – a scenario both sides have worked for decades to avoid because of the possibility that it could all too easily turn nuclear. A third factor is no less important. The longer the war lasts, and the higher the human toll, the harder it will be for the West to leave room for a negotiated solution and the graver the risks of escalation. Western governments should not aim for a complete, but likely unattainable, victory that includes a return to the pre-2014 status quo and war crimes investigations, let alone Russian President Vladimir Putin’s departure. Their main objective should rather be an agreement that both sides can accept and that will bring the war to a close., This objective should inform all of Western governments’ actions with respect to the war. With weapons supplies to Ukraine, they should aim to help its resistance hold off Russia’s assault long enough that Moscow accepts a settlement that is as palatable to Kyiv as possible. Western leaders should, as they have done so far, avoid tactics – like a no-fly zone – that would be tantamount to war with Russia. Sanctions should aim to encourage a negotiated deal and, as far as possible, constrain Moscow; this requires communicating to the Kremlin that a settlement acceptable to Kyiv will mean an end to at least some of the restrictions crippling Russia’s economy. Open lines of communication with Moscow remain vital, both for testing options for a deal between Russia and Ukraine and for signalling NATO’s own red lines, averting as best possible miscalculation by Moscow and managing incidents., A Terrible Toll, The war has confounded expectations to date. Most analysts – Ukrainian, Russian and Western – expected Russia’s larger, better-equipped army to rapidly overcome Ukraine’s smaller numbers. Instead, Russian forces turned out to be ill prepared and quickly demoralised, while Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been far more determined and resourceful than Moscow appears to have anticipated. Ukraine has also used Western-supplied anti-tank weapons, air defences such as Stinger missiles, ordnance and body armour to dash Russian hopes of an easy win. Russian forces are having difficulty seizing and holding territory. Their advance from the north is long stalled; those in the east and south are encountering significant Ukrainian pushback. Ukraine’s information campaign of visual evidence of abandoned or destroyed Russian equipment and stories of Ukrainian heroism has been extremely effective with Western audiences, if less so in some other parts of the world., In the face of Ukraine’s resistance, Russia has turned to ever more brutal tactics. At first, Moscow seemingly sought to avoid civilian casualties in the expectation of a friendly reception by Ukrainians. Now Russian forces are bombarding cities and towns, killing and maiming thousands of civilians. Their record in Chechnya (within Russia itself) and in Syria gives good reason to fear that the civilian toll could get much worse., The West’s response, unprecedented in both unity and scope, appears to have taken the Kremlin aback almost as much as Ukraine’s resilience. Having spent the weeks leading up to the attack working to avert the war through diplomacy, once Russian tanks were rolling, Western states shifted gears fast, pivoting to a strategy of maximising the invasion’s costs to Russia. They have imposed severe sanctions, sent substantial supplies of weapons and other aid to Kyiv, and worked to isolate Russia on the international stage. In this way, the U.S., the European Union (EU) and their allies made good on the threats they issued prior to the invasion and arguably have gone further, inspired in part by the fierce struggle Ukrainians themselves have put up., As weapons shipments have helped Ukrainians slow Russia’s battlefield advance, Western policies have rendered Russia the most sanctioned country worldwide and wreaked havoc on its economy. The U.S., the EU, the UK, Japan and other countries banned national banks from doing business with the Russian Central Bank and put in place sanctions on a number of major Russian banks, seven of which were cut off from the SWIFT financial transactions system. Western countries froze $300 billion of the Russian Central Bank’s $640 billion in reserves, which led to a sharp decrease in the ruble’s exchange rate. The U.S. and EU also blocked the flow of cash dollars and euros to Russia and constrained that of potentially dual-use technologies and electronic chips. The U.S. and UK have banned imports of Russian oil and gas, while the EU has proscribed steel product imports. Finally, international payment systems such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and JCB have disconnected from all Russian banks., Many Russians have already felt the pinch. They can no longer pay with bank cards abroad, cannot easily withdraw cash from foreign currency accounts and face steep inflation, particularly for foreign-made goods. More than 300 foreign companies have left Russia, ceasing their production, services and sales. International shipping and logistics companies and foreign ports are also refusing to work with Russia. All these steps will both increase unemployment and worsen commodity shortages in the Russian domestic market. The EU’s plans to wean itself off Russian hydrocarbons, if carried out, will also hit the Russian economy hard. Already, grocery stores are rationing staples, such as flour and sugar., Ukrainians are, of course, paying the heaviest price. As Russia’s assault razes buildings, city blocks, villages and towns, over three million refugees have fled the country. These are overwhelmingly women, children and the elderly: men between the ages of eighteen and 60 are allowed to exit Ukraine only in rare circumstances. (As Crisis Group has separately noted, how much this policy – which adds family separation and heightened risks to war’s trauma – helps Ukraine defend itself is unclear.) Millions have also fled within Ukraine, to the western part of the country, where shelling is less, though Russian strikes have hit the western city of Lviv, where many of the displaced have taken shelter, suggesting that could change. Those who stay in cities under fire face shortages of food, water and heat. Especially shocking are images from the southern port city of Mariupol, whose civilians are trapped under bombardment that increasingly recalls Russia’s levelling of Grozny in Chechnya and Aleppo in Syria, and have been forced to bury the dead in mass graves. On 16 March, airstrikes destroyed a theatre in Mariupol that was reportedly sheltering hundreds of civilians and was marked with the Russian word for “children” in letters that could be seen from the air., Neither side shows any sign of backing down or giving up. Direct negotiations between representatives of Moscow and Kyiv have yet to include the senior-level negotiators needed to conclude a deal. Neither those talks nor shuttle diplomacy by French, German, Israeli and Turkish leaders have revealed much moderation in Moscow’s stance or much overlap between Russian and Ukrainian positions. True, there are minor indications of movement. Ukrainian leaders, including President Volodymr Zelenskyy, say Russia’s positions have become more “realistic”. Zelenskyy has also indicated that while the country will continue to seek EU admission, he may stop asking to join NATO – a long-stated red line for Moscow. As for Russia, the Kremlin may have dropped its demand that Ukraine “denazify”, which is to say remove Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, from power, along with his government. But Moscow continues to insist on its sovereignty over Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and the independence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics within their Soviet-era borders, that is, three times more territory than that held by Russia-backed separatists as of 23 February. It still demands Ukraine’s neutrality and demilitarisation, though perhaps would be flexible about what that means were other aspects of a deal in place. While it is positive that talks continue, they have thus far yielded little concrete benefit. Even some of the humanitarian corridors agreed upon by negotiators have failed, as evacuating civilians found themselves instead under Russian fire or travelling through mined areas., Avoiding the Escalation Trap, As the West piles more assistance into Ukraine, Russia has pushed back with threats, both tacit and explicit. The most jarring of these involves nuclear menacing, playing on NATO’s desire to avoid escalation. President Putin early on threatened outside actors with “consequences far greater than any of you have faced in history” if they intervened in Ukraine – a barely veiled nuclear threat – but left vague what actions would cross the line. He also announced that his deterrent forces would henceforth operate under a heretofore unknown alert status (which, in the end, appeared to amount to dispatching more personnel to already well-staffed command centres). Russia held nuclear exercises after the invasion was under way (the U.S., by contrast, cancelled a scheduled drill to avoid unintended signalling). Putin and other Russians (including Moscow’s permanent representative to the UN Security Council) have, meanwhile, alleged with no evidence that Ukraine was developing nuclear capabilities or had plans to use chemical or biological weapons, raising fears that Russia may seek a pretext to use such weapons itself and point the finger at Ukraine., Beyond nuclear threats, the Kremlin has also declared that NATO weapons supplies are legitimate targets, though what it means by this warning is unclear. For now, it is sticking to targets in Ukraine rather than risk an attack on NATO territory and the response that could invite, although it may seek to engineer deniable accidents and otherwise disrupt supply efforts in countries staging weapons deliveries. On 13 March, Russia bombed the Yavoriv military training site in western Ukraine, only 20km away from the Polish border. The site has symbolic importance – in that NATO member state officers had trained Ukrainian soldiers there in years past – but was not actually a supply depot or a Western facility, suggesting either bad intelligence or restraint., As for Western leaders, they have largely walked a line between imposing the sorts of costs that they threatened in an effort to deter the war (sanctions, arms supplies to Ukraine and troop build-ups on Russia’s western flank) and taking steps that might cause the war to spin beyond Ukraine. These leaders have stated clearly that they do not intend to fight Russia directly, because doing so could lead to broader war pitting nuclear-armed states – Russia, on one side, and three NATO members (the U.S., the UK and France) on the other – against each other., But as the war grinds on, pressure is mounting for a stronger Western response. The sheer numbers of displaced, images of Ukrainian suffering and growing evidence that Russian military operations – perhaps not intentionally but certainly with insufficient care – are doing tremendous harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure have deepened sympathy for Ukraine, particularly in NATO and EU countries. Having won enormous public admiration for his courage under fire, Zelenskyy has appealed directly to the U.S. Congress and other Western legislatures – broadcasting in fatigues from war-torn Kyiv – and implored the West to become directly involved. He and other Ukrainian officials continue to press NATO countries to “close the sky” over Ukraine – alluding to the imposition of a no-fly zone that would likely put Western and Russian forces in combat with each other, and which Western officials have wisely taken off the table. But civil society groups, parliamentarians and opinion leaders throughout the West increasingly echo Kyiv’s calls for more help and the intensive media coverage ensures that the topic remains in the public eye., Those promoting a stronger Western line offer several arguments to bolster their case. Some hold that the moral imperative of helping Ukraine, whose civilians are dying under Russian bombardment, should make Western capitals less risk-averse. Some argue that if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, its appetite for aggression elsewhere, including against NATO member states, will only grow. Others believe that the risk of nuclear use by the Kremlin is in any case difficult to predict and manage, especially given that Moscow sees itself as at war with the West already. Still others hold that it is the Kremlin that will back down if faced with the risk of war with NATO., What these arguments share is an uncomfortable element of guesswork and wishful thinking. While the Ukraine conflict triggering a nuclear confrontation might appear unfathomable, given the consequences of such a war, measures that invite a direct battle between Russia and NATO would run a perilous risk of just that. Throughout the Cold War, Russia and the U.S. avoided direct clashes precisely because of fears that the danger of a struggle turning nuclear would be unmanageable. While debates have long raged over whether, in fact, a conventional war between the two sides could be contained, with terror of nuclear annihilation restraining either or both, policymakers have historically erred on the side of caution., This logic remains as valid today as it was then. While some elements of Moscow’s current nuclear strategy are intentionally ambiguous, and President Putin’s choices are his own, Russia does have a stated doctrine for possible nuclear weapon use. This doctrine allows that Russia may use nuclear force in the event of nuclear, chemical or biological weapon attack on itself or its allies; if it faces conventional aggression that threatens the very existence of the state; if it is under ballistic missile attack; or if there is a risk to its nuclear command and control capabilities., A conventional war with NATO could too easily fall within this framework. For Moscow, a war with NATO would be inherently existential. The alliance’s military capacity dwarfs Russia’s – as the latter’s struggles in Ukraine vividly illustrate – and could do the country tremendous damage. Once the fight is under way, it would be tough if not impossible to convince Kremlin officials that NATO’s aims are limited. Moscow would expect the alliance, if only for its own defensive reasons, to both hit targets inside Russia and take early steps to eliminate the Russian capacity for a nuclear strike. It would also assess NATO’s goals in a war as including regime change – an impression that can only be exacerbated by Western rhetoric calling for Putin to be deposed by coup or assassination or discussions of putting him and members of his inner circle on trial for war crimes (reinforced recently when U.S. President Joe Biden called his Russian counterpart a war criminal). Such calculations could push Russia toward using nuclear weapons while it can, as the only possible way to force NATO to back down. It is not hard to see that action provoking a harsher, potentially nuclear, NATO response, as the alliance, too, tries to demonstrate resolve., What Now?, So how should Western powers balance potentially competing imperatives – punishing and deterring aggression, on one hand, and avoiding profoundly dangerous escalation on the other – as the war proceeds? Thus far, they are largely on the right path but it is important they bear in mind the purposes of each tool they are already or considering using., The conventional arms that the U.S. and NATO partners have supplied are appropriately helping Ukraine resist Moscow’s assault; the goal of these transfers should be to improve Kyiv’s position and allow it to negotiate more palatable terms to end the war with Russia when both parties are truly ready for talks. The escalatory risks that these transfers present thus far seem limited, while the difference they make is crucial. A steady supply of portable air defences such as Stingers, and potentially some heavier missile batteries, would help Kyiv maintain the superiority it now enjoys in the sky over government-controlled Ukraine. Armed drones will continue to be valuable, including as anti-artillery systems. Maintaining a flow of ammunition for all of these capabilities, as well as body armour and personal weapons for the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians now under arms, is possibly the most important thing Ukraine’s partners can do., At the same time, Western weapons provision needs to minimise the risk of direct engagement with Russia. Enforcing a no-fly zone, for example, would require militarily engaging Russian aircraft and potentially taking out Russia’s own air defences, including on Russian territory. It would, in other words, be an act of war. NATO would also be sensible to refrain from transferring equipment that would require the presence of member state personnel to service it – as might be the case with fighter jets that some Western officials suggest providing – as they could then be in the line of fire., Minimising risks of escalation also means finding ways to convey to Russia the dangers of overstepping NATO’s own red lines and heading off, to the extent possible, Moscow’s potential miscalculations. The Kremlin appears to have badly misjudged how Western governments would respond to (and Ukrainians resist) its invasion. That experience should, in principle, leave Moscow somewhat chastened and more cautious. Western leaders should, however, still do their part to make clear what actions they see as crossing their own red lines. They might even leverage the reality that they, themselves, cannot perfectly predict their reactions. Even as the Kremlin reminds the world of its nuclear arsenal, Western capitals can remind Moscow that in the event of certain Russian actions, their responses may be difficult to control. Chemical weapons use, for example, would inevitably bring Russia’s further isolation, but it may also set off an inexorable march toward NATO military action. Already, members of the U.S. Congress are among those arguing that such tactics should trigger direct Western involvement. Pointing these statements out to Moscow might help it understand the danger., As for the unprecedented sanctions and other political and economic pressure on Russia, these should also be part of a policy that aims to end the war through a deal and, as best possible, gives Moscow incentives to de-escalate. For now, Western leaders appear to hold out divergent hopes of what sanctions will achieve. They should clarify their goals and adjust their policies accordingly., Western leaders’ expectations of sanctions’ impact inside Russia need to be realistic. They cannot count on economic penalties to end the war by turning Russia’s public or elite against it. Indeed, sanctions may well harden many Russians’ positions and increase, rather than decrease, support for the invasion and Putin himself. The Kremlin is long practiced at deflecting antipathy for sanctions against the Western governments enforcing them. A draconian Russian government crackdown on free speech and protest that has already led tens of thousands to flee the country also diminishes prospects for mass unrest in opposition to the war. Sanctions and a failing military campaign may turn elites against the war, and it is perhaps not completely inconceivable that they motivate some form of palace coup. But that is a long shot, not a reasonable assumption for planning. Besides, the more that Kremlin officials believe that Western policy in Ukraine aims to provoke their overthrow, the likelier they are to view the war as existential, potentially triggering even greater violence, increasing the risks of war with NATO and putting compromise further beyond reach. Constraining Moscow’s ability to prosecute the war by shrinking its economy has a more compelling logic. In that sense, sanctions do have value, if paired with continued global diplomacy to maintain pressure on Moscow. But simply weakening Russia will not end the war, at least not quickly., More important is for Western governments to use the limited leverage that sanctions offer to best effect. Too often they fail to do so because of a reluctance to lift restrictions unless maximalist demands are met; they should not repeat that mistake this time around. If the aim is peace in Ukraine, the right message to send to Moscow, however unsatisfactory it might seem, is that a deal Kyiv accepts will yield a measure of sanctions relief. In the war’s aftermath, such relief will not return Russia’s economy to its prior state, particularly if the Kremlin maintains its harsh domestic policies. Many firms and investors will continue to avoid the country for some time, if nothing else because they will distrust its markets. Nonetheless, the restoration of foreign payment systems and lifting of blocking sanctions against some Russian banks could help partly restore the Russian financial system’s normal functioning., As for the nature of a deal that would lead to those steps, Western capitals should, broadly speaking, take their cue from Kyiv. A ceasefire alone would not be enough, as it would leave large numbers of Russian forces on Ukrainian soil with a continuous risk of the shooting starting again. (Indeed, a pause in fighting could enable Russia to resupply its troops.) But a ceasefire coupled with verifiable Russian withdrawals might appropriately trigger some sanctions relief. Ukraine’s Western partners should also be willing to consider other outcomes that seem suboptimal – Ukraine regaining control of the self-declared republics in Donbas, for example, but in effect accepting the loss of Crimea – if Kyiv itself swallows such an arrangement, with all its attendant problems. A deal that puts in place a process for resolution of the Donbas question over time, although it would be fraught, would also be worth considering, notwithstanding the deadlock in Donbas negotiations over recent years. Ukraine’s full demilitarisation seems out of the question, but Russian-Ukrainian conventional arms control could limit both sides’ deployments in border areas. Kyiv has already spoken of eschewing pursuit of NATO membership. As NATO is not planning to invite Ukraine to join, it should be ready to accept this step. As for the EU, Ukraine may also need to propose a relationship that falls short of membership, particularly as that organisation, too, seems unlikely to enlarge any time soon., Lastly, Western leaders need to keep open lines of communication to Moscow, both to make their red lines as clear as possible and do whatever they can to promote an end to the war. The shuttle diplomacy of the leaders of France, Germany, Israel, Turkey and others, although seemingly not immediately effective, could lay the groundwork for compromise later. Ideally, open channels would include military-to-military links, so as to better protect against misunderstandings – whether related to the supply of weapons or NATO’s troop build-ups along the alliance’s eastern flank – blowing up., Conclusion, ​​For now, Western governments have largely charted the right course in their response to Russia’s invasion, factoring in risks of escalation even while helping Ukraine fight back. But the moment is extraordinarily dangerous. Not only is the war destroying Ukrainian cities, forcing millions from their homes and potentially upending Europe’s security architecture. It also pits one nuclear power against a smaller neighbour backed by other nuclear powers, with only murky red lines separating nuclear-armed states from direct confrontation. After at least a decade of worsening bad blood between Russia and the West, and as understandable outrage mounts in Western capitals at Russia’s aggression and Ukraine’s suffering, that bulwark is hardly reassuring., Some caution still guides calculations on both sides, with Western leaders sensibly rejecting a no-fly zone and Russia thus far not targeting weapons convoys outside Ukraine itself. But the room for miscalculation is frightening, particularly if the Kremlin again misreads the mood in Western capitals. How bad things get depends largely on President Putin himself. But Western leaders can make their own red lines and their own domestic pressures as clear as possible and do everything within their power to create incentives for a settlement. Keeping doors open to ending the conflict is not just about stopping Ukraine’s decimation. It is about stepping back from a standoff that poses the gravest threat of nuclear confrontation for at least half a century.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/avoiding-even-worse-catastrophe-ukraine

Russian Invasion in Ukraine Leads to Increased Risks of Human Trafficking – IOM [EN/UK],News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Women and children fleeing from the Russian military invasion in Ukraine and heading to other countries face risks of human trafficking, while men staying in the country can also become a prey for exploiters, warns IOM, the UN Migration Agency., According to the UN data, as of 18 March, over 3 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine to neighbouring countries, including 162,000 third-country nationals. At least 1.9 million people have been internally displaced. They need critical humanitarian support and protection., In 2021, the IOM Mission in Ukraine identified and assisted over 1,000 victims of trafficking, men, women and children. These numbers are only the tip of the iceberg, as many trafficking survivors do not get identified nor receive assistance. An IOM-commissioned survey estimated that 46,000 Ukrainians suffered from human trafficking during 2019-2021. Eighteen per cent of the respondents surveyed by IOM last year said they were ready to accept an informal and risky job offer abroad, almost a third would do so in Ukraine., “We know how quickly the criminal world adjusts to changing realities and finds new victims. We call on Ukrainians and other nationals leaving Ukraine to stay alert and be cautious when on the move, at a new place or at home,” said IOM Ukraine Chief of Mission Anh Nguyen., While cases of human trafficking are usually difficult to identify in the immediate aftermath of mass displacement, initial reports from within and outside of Ukraine indicate that traffickers are ready to exploit the vulnerabilities of those fleeing Ukraine. IOM also flags cases of family separation, unaccompanied and separated children that are on the rise, as well as potential cases of conflict-related sexual violence among protection concerns that are linked to human trafficking. Loss of jobs and income as a result of the war, and limited possibilities to meet basic needs in the case of both IDPs and refugees but also widely the conflict-affected population, will add to the risks., To address the issue, IOM Ukraine has scaled up the work of the National Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline 527, by extending opening hours, doubling the number of advisers and offering reliable and updated information on a wide range of topics. The hotline, which can be accessed from within Ukraine, has already provided over 12,000 consultations to over 2,400 callers received from 24 February to 16 March only, which is 60 per cent more compared to the same period last year. More than half of the people calling are newly displaced persons. The hotline provides verified information on rights and obligations related to the current procedures of border crossing, services within Ukraine and neighbouring countries, work of border-crossing points, safe travel and countering human trafficking., IOM has also boosted its prevention work on the ground by developing targeted information leaflets and posters with safe travel rules in times of war, including for women and girls. Additionally to a wide online outreach, IOM has started distributing over 100,000 leaflets, including in partnerships with partner NGOs that provide protection services to IDPs and conflict-affected populations in ten regions in western, southern and central Ukraine, at transport hubs and reception centres, as well as at the border crossing points. Furthermore, targeted trafficking prevention information promoting 527 Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline was disseminated through official social media channels of the Ministry of Social Policy and Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, as well as through local authorities., As media play a key role in trafficking prevention, IOM encourages media outlets to share safe travel advice available at: https://bit.ly/BasicSafetyRules, The IOM-supported National Migrant Advice and Counter-Trafficking Hotline can be reached in Ukraine at 527 (free from mobile phones) or at 0 800 505 501 (free from landline phones) from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Those staying abroad can reach hotline consultants at 527.hotline@gmail.com., For additional information, please contact Varvara Zhluktenko, IOM Mission in Ukraine, via vzhluktenko@iom.int or at +38 067 447 97 92",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russian-invasion-ukraine-leads-increased-risks-human-trafficking-iom-enuk
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 17 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Date: 18 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 17 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,149 civilian casualties in the country: 816 killed and 1,333 injured. This included:, a total of 816 killed (152 men, 116 women, 7 girls, and 16 boys, as well as 36 children and 489 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,333 injured (133 men, 104 women, 17 girls, and 7 boys, as well as 50 children and 1,022 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 903 casualties (222 killed and 681 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 675 casualties (172 killed and 503 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 228 casualties (50 killed and 178 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,246 casualties (594 killed and 652 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. (local time) 18 March, 109 children had been killed and more than 130 injured. OHCHR also notes the report of the Head of the Investigative Department of the National Police of Kharkiv Region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 17 March, 250 civilians had been killed in the region, including 13 children. _________________________________",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-17-march-2022-enruuk-0
Update 25 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (18 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,18 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Ukrainian engineers were repairing one of three disconnected power lines linking the country’s largest nuclear power plant to the electricity grid and expected it to be working again early next week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has four high voltage (750 kV) external power lines plus one on standby. Two of the four were damaged earlier, and the plant last week lost connection to a third line, which the Ukrainian regulator today said was expected to be reconnected to the plant on 22 March., With the two off-site power lines that are currently available, including the one on standby, all safety systems at the NPP remain fully functional and there are no safety concerns, the regulator said. It was not known when the two other non-functioning lines could be reconnected, it added., On 4 March, Russian forces took control of the NPP. Of its six reactors, two are operating. These two units reduced power generation to 500 Megawatts (MWe) each after a break yesterday in an on-site power line, but they increased it again to 600 MWe after it was fixed and reconnected later the same evening, the regulator said., The Chornobyl NPP remained connected to the power grid after engineers on 14 March restored power supplies that had been lost for five days, the regulator said. Russian forces on 24 February took control of the site. Staff there have not been able to rotate for more than three weeks., In Kharkiv, the regulator said there was currently no external power supply to a nuclear research facility that was previously damaged by shelling, but its personnel were still maintaining the operability of its equipment. Radiation levels remained within background levels, it said. The facility is used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Because its nuclear material is subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, the IAEA has assessed that the reported damage or loss of external power would not have had any radiological consequence., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational NPPs, the Ukrainian regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including the two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range and safety systems are operating, it said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported earlier this week. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine., Director General Grossi said he is continuing his consultations with a view to agree on a framework on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. “With this framework in place, the Agency would be able to provide effective technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of these facilities,” he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-25-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-18-march-2022

Presentation: 17/03/2022, Methodology: Between March 9 and 16 2022, IOM, conducted a rapid representative survey of the general population in Ukraine to gather initial insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. While Displacement Tracking Matrix tools are being established, this general population survey will serve as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the conflict-affected population. The geographical scope of the survey covers all five macro-regions (West, East, North,
Center, South, and the city of Kyiv). The probabilistic sample, representative at macro-region level, was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,000 respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) method. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. Population estimates assume that children travel together with their adult guardians.

Since the start of escalation, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society has been helping people all over Ukraine, responding to the specific needs of each region., The humanitarian situation in Ukraine, The worst impacted regions are in the East, as well as Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kyiv regions. Due to the shelling of civilian targets, many people in those regions lost access to water, electricity, gas, phone and internet networks, and food. Many people stay for days in makeshift shelters and basements. Dampness coupled with cold temperatures, cause illnesses that require medical attention., ""The impact on vulnerable groups is most severe. People living with disabilities, critically ill or wounded, stay in the basements. They often lack access to food, water, and medication. They can't get out of shelters due to continued shelling, and they don't have a mobile connection to ask for help,"" -- says Maksym Dotsenko, Director General, NC Ukrainian Red Cross Society., The impact of the armed conflict is enormous. Disruptions of gas, water, and food supplies impact the whole of Ukraine. Due to the continued shelling of civilian targets, many families are on the move, fleeing to safer locations. UNHCR reports that since 24 February, 2,808,792 people, mainly women and children, crossed the Ukrainian border. The number of internally displaced people is much higher., The needs of people in Ukraine, First priority for the Red Cross is the first aid kits. The other priority is food, hygiene products, medicines, and basic supplies for those stranded in shelters. Separately, the Red Cross would like to stress the importance of ensuring the safety of the civilian population and observing international humanitarian law. We also work on supporting those who were able to flee to safety., The Ukrainian Red Cross provides help all over the country, The Ukrainian Red Cross receives thousands of requests every day. We try to respond to everyone who asked for help, within the limits of our resources. ""We gather data and provide support in a centralised way. We work through local Red Cross branches and through local authorities. Volunteers come to rescue: the number of our volunteers has doubled since the start of the conflict. There are 6,000 Ukrainian Red Cross volunteers today. We are grateful to all volunteers and to all our staff for their dedicated round the clock service"", -- says Maksym Dotsenko., The Red Cross volunteers and staff continue working along several workstreams, including the processing of the missing person's requests, providing first aid, and providing psychological support. We also continue raising awareness of international humanitarian law and training people in anti-mines (2,000 people trained) and first aid (42,000 people trained)., Staff and volunteers continue delivering medicines and supplies to hospitals, humanitarian aid to shelters, household items to those who fled their homes.

We work together with national and local governments and help to take civilians out of the shelled areas"", -- says Maksym Dotsenko., The Emergency Response Teams provided the following assistance so far:, Emergency Response Teams work together with the State Department for Emergencies and act as first responders during fires, explosions, and destruction. Since 24 February, 200 people received assistance in such situations. Between 14 and 15 March, the volunteers from Emergency Response units were helping Kyiv residents whose houses were shelled.

"Ukraine: UN expert says war against multi-ethnic population must stop, calls for protection of all minorities",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (16 March 2022) – The UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Fernand de Varennes, today expressed grave concerns about the situation of minorities in the context of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the treatment of minorities fleeing the conflict. He issues the following statement:, “The world is witnessing tremendous human suffering in Ukraine. The lives of all people of Ukraine are in danger, including ethnic, national, linguistic and religious minorities., Up until the end of 12 March 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights had recorded and confirmed 1,663 civilian deaths or injuries in the context of Russia's armed attack against Ukraine: 596 killed, including 43 children; 1,067 injured, including 57 children. The actual casualties are much higher. These human losses were recorded in the regions where different ethnic groups have been coexisting with each other for many years. A vivid example is the town of Volnovakha in Donetsk region which has been almost completely destroyed by shelling. Volnovakha is home to ethnic Ukrainians, Russians, Armenians, Greeks and Jews., Following the reports indicating that the Russian army took control over the city of Kherson, I express particular concern over the situation of Crimean Tatars in Kherson region., Military operations are also happening in the regions with compact populations of small-numbered minorities, like Turkic-speaking Urums in the region of Mariupol. The operations are putting in danger both the lives of these people and their distinct culture, and their language., The war in Ukraine is life-threatening not only to its multiethnic nation, but also to unique minority cultural heritage sites all over the country, such as the old Jewish cemetery in the city of Bila Tserkva which has reportedly been damaged because of the military operations. Strikes in the area of the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center, where tens of thousands of Jews were killed by the Nazis in a two-day massacre during World War Two, should sober up the Russian authorities. They need to stop the offensive now., While I am imploring Russia to stop the war, I am also urging the United Nations and its Member States, international and regional organisations to mainstream minority issues in their responses to this human catastrophe, and to Ukraine and neighbouring countries to respond without discrimination to the refugee crisis in the treatment of minorities such as Roma, international students, at borders and elsewhere., It is of paramount importance to acknowledge that minorities, such as Roma, many of whom may be undocumented in Ukraine, face specific vulnerabilities in the times of this conflict. I urge all parties to ensure that all minorities, including Roma, have access to humanitarian assistance without any discrimination. All people of Ukraine, including people of African, Asian, Middle Eastern descent and Roma should be granted equal protection and safety when seeking refuge inside and outside of the country, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, language or status. Minorities such as Roma or people of African descent and all others regardless of the colour of their skin, or their ethnicity or religion, must all be dealt with without discrimination along their evacuation route out of Ukraine., I welcome the decision of the Human Rights Council to establish an Independent International Commission of Inquiry toinvestigate all alleged violations of human rights in the context of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. It is essential that the commission uses minority rights lenses in its work and actively engages with minority rights defenders from Ukraine., Finally, I express my concern over increased hate speech against ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in different parts of the world, as they’re often associated with the aggression committed by the Russian authorities. Hate speech and calls to restrict the rights of Russian or Russian speaking minorities doesn’t contribute to peace and must be addressed in line with international human rights standards.”, ENDS, Mr. Fernand de Varennes was appointed as UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues by the Human Rights Council in June 2017. He is tasked by the UN Human Rights Council, to promote the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, among other things., The Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Ukraine refugees: Operational guidelines to support Member States in applying the Temporary Protection Directive,News and Press Release,EC,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Since the start of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, more than 3 million people have fled the country, with UN estimates suggesting that more than half of them are children. To respond to this unprecedented situation, the EU agreed in record time to activate the Temporary Protection Directive to help people fleeing war in Ukraine. The Directive became immediately applicable on 4 March and now offers immediate protection and a clear legal status to millions of people., Today, the Commission is presenting operational guidelines to support Member States in applying the Directive. The comprehensive guidelines will help those arriving to have a consistent and effective level of rights and the Member States to assume their new responsibilities., Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas said: “The unprecedented decision to grant immediate protection to all those who call Ukraine their home is now being translated into practice. To help make this process as smooth as possible, the Commission is supporting Member States with operational guidance. For example, to ensure people can move around the Union unhindered, we clarify that they should be able to receive 15 day visas at the border and that in any case carriers should not be fined for transporting them without documentation. One of the biggest concerns now is the number of children arriving unaccompanied who need to be registered and given specialised care.”, Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson said: “In a matter of days, 3 million people crossed into the EU. The show of solidarity has been immense and the reaction of the authorities impressive; but real challenges exist to ensure national systems do not become overwhelmed and that people enjoy the protection they deserve. Based on questions from Member States, we are proposing the following operational guidelines which we will regularly update to make sure the Commission supports Member States every step of the way – from arrival to integration.”, Guidelines to Member States, The guidelines are intended as a living document to reflect the situation on the ground and take due consideration of the evolving needs of the Member States. The main elements include:, Background, On 4 March 2022, following the Commission's proposal the previous day, the Council unanimously adopted the implementing decision introducing temporary protection for people fleeing war in Ukraine. After this decision, the Commission received a clear demand for further information and launched a webpage to inform and support those fleeing war when arriving in the EU., To coordinate operational support for Member States of first entry, the Commission has been convening meetings on the situation in Ukraine as part of the EU Migration Preparedness and Crisis Blueprint. Alongside this Network, a ‘Solidarity Platform' coordinated by the Commission is collecting and examining Member States' needs in order to provide an operational response. These guidelines will also complement the existing Guidelines for external border management to facilitate border crossings at the EU-Ukraine borders., For More Information, Operational Guidelines for the implementation of Council implementing Decision introducing temporary protection, Council Implementing Decision introducing temporary protection, Temporary Protection Directive, Information for people fleeing the war in Ukraine, Press contact, Anitta HIPPER

Water Sanitation Hygiene",18 Mar 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., With more than 3.1 million refugees forced to flee Ukraine over the past three weeks, and millions internally displaced within the country, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is warning that humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially., In addition to those who have had to flee, around 13 million people have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine and are in need of humanitarian and protection assistance., Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines., Humanitarian reports received from those areas are horrifying, and we continue to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and appeal to neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing in search of safety., As UNHCR has warned from the outset, the pace and magnitude of the internal displacement and refugee exodus from Ukraine, as well as resulting humanitarian needs, will only increase if the situation deteriorates., In Ukraine:, The humanitarian situation in cities such as Mariupol and Sumy is extremely dire, with residents facing critical and potentially fatal shortages of food, water and medicines. UNHCR is closely tracking negotiations for safe passage and already has humanitarian cargo pre-positioned. We are ready to send critical supplies into Sumy as soon as conditions allow., In Odesa, authorities have appealed for support for general food assistance to cover the needs of some 450,000 people in the city, as well as medicines. As of 17 March, a permanent consultation point for protection, legal, and social matters is functioning at the Odesa railway station where 600 to 800 individuals transit daily on their way from Mykolaiv to the western oblasts of Ukraine., The humanitarian needs in eastern Ukraine are becoming even more urgent. More than 200,000 people are now without access to water across several localities in Donetsk oblast while the constant shelling in Luhansk region has destroyed 80 percent of some localities, leaving 97,800 families without power., Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and lack of safe passage are increasing protection risks and posing serious threats to the lives of thousands of civilians. Vulnerable population groups -- such as women and children, people with disabilities or with serious medical conditions, as well as older people and minority groups -- are increasingly facing barriers in accessing critical services such as transportation, food, water, medicines, and emergency health care in impacted areas., As part of the humanitarian response in Ukraine, and in close coordination with local authorities and other humanitarian agencies, we continue supporting the establishment of reception centres, delivering core relief items and emergency shelter and strengthening our support at border crossing points inside Ukraine. Protection services also remain of paramount importance, and we continue to facilitate access to legal aid, psychosocial support and other assistance to those most vulnerable., UNHCR is launching a large-scale multi-purpose cash programme to help internally displaced people (IDPs), who fled their homes and left behind their belongings. This will help cover their basic needs like rent, food and hygiene items. Cash assistance allows people to make choices, prioritize their needs and boosts local providers. UNHCR started enrolling IDPs for its programme in Lviv on 17 March and will progressively expand to other cities and regions., Outside Ukraine:, UNHCR staff on the ground undertake regular protection monitoring -- at the main border crossing points, transit centers and reception centers and other locations where refugees pass or gather -- to assess protection risks and assist the authorities in addressing them., As women and children constitute some 90 per cent of those who have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries, UNHCR and other agencies have warned of increased risks of trafficking and exploitation. Given the very high protection risks, UNHCR and partners are disseminating key information and awareness raising messages to alert refugees of the risks of trafficking, exploitation and abuse., We deployed Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Coordinators, gender and child protection experts to Poland, Moldova, Hungary, and Romania and have set up protection coordination structures with other partners and national authorities to ensure an efficient and coherent approach., In response to the Ukraine emergency, UNHCR and UNICEF have agreed to jointly roll out the 'Blue Dots' in 6 countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia). Other countries may be added as the situation evolves and depending on the needs on the ground., The Blue Dots are one-stop-shops, and safe spaces which provide a minimum set of protection services for children, families and others with specific needs, in support of existing services and government efforts., They aim to improve accessibility and standardization of services provided by different partners, as well as predictability through a recognizable label -- the 'Blue Dot'. They have become a recognizable component of emergency assistance and a good example of inclusiveness in collaboration, where all service providers are welcomed to operate, provided the services meet relevant protection standards., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-warns-rising-needs-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-calls-cessation

UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition responds to Ukrainian call for support,News and Press Release,UNESCO,Education,18 Mar 2022,"UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition pledged to support Ukraine’s efforts to provide on-line learning and psycho-social counselling to students and teachers in the country during a meeting with the Deputy Minister of Education and officials from the Ministry on 15 March 2022., The Global Education Coalition, established in March 2020 to maintain learning continuity during COVID-19 pandemic, is an alliance of 200 public and private partners active in over 100 countries that matches expertise with needs in an agile and rapid manner., Partners present at the meeting convened by UNESCO included Apple, Blackboard, Carey Institute for Global Good, Code.org, Curious Learning, EdX, Google, GSMA, IBM, ISTE, Khan Academy, KPMG, LabXchange, Learning Equality, Microsoft, Orange, Qualcomm, Raccoon Gang, Study Portals, Teach For All, Teacher Task Force, University of People and WeSchool., Support from the partners ranged from scholarships for learners, free access to accredited courses, translation of educational content, crisis-sensitive teacher training and professional development support for teachers., Among the commitments by members of the Global Education Coalition:, The Ministry has called on the international community to support the development and implementation of a Plan to protect and restore education in Ukraine., More than one million school-age children have been forced to flee violence into neighboring countries, while the entire school and university age population is affected., “We have been working intensively from the first day of the war. We cannot lose this entire generation of children,” said Arthur Seletskiy, Deputy Minister of Education and Science. “We are relaunching distance learning where security and safety enables. Our “Learning without Limits” project is enabling students to follow video classes. Resources for education are being diverted to our defense so we desperately need your financial support for education, learning materials and educational infrastructure.”, Dmytro Zavgorodnii, Head of the Ministry’s Digital Department explained that Ukraine boosted its distance learning system during COVID-19 through the All-Ukrainian School Online platform, the Laptop for Every Teacher initiative and the Online University Admission. He requested support for expanding these to create additional contents for primary school; provide advanced training and additional laptops for school teachers, and an e-exam platform for university applicants., “Education must be part of the humanitarian response - to provide psychosocial support, protection, kinship and opportunities to keep learning in these dramatic times,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education. “Ukraine’s impressive range of remote learning platforms is a basis for building resilience. UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition can be leveraged to expand online learning platforms in Ukraine and refugee-hosting countries; to support teachers; make available learning contents and provide online socio-emotional support to help students and teachers.”, According to data from UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics, Ukraine’s total school-age population from pre-primary to tertiary education is over 6.84 million. This represents 1.05 million in pre-primary, 1.72 million and 2.54 million respectively at primary and secondary levels, and 1.53 million in tertiary education., Ukraine has become a hub for students from abroad at tertiary level, with a five-fold increase between 2001 and 2020 to 61,000 foreign students. The top five countries sending students to Ukraine are India, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria., The county counts 15,500 preschool institutions; 14,000 primary and basic secondary schools; , 695 vocational education institutions; and 336 higher education institutions., According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, as of 13 March, 379 educational institutions have been damaged or destroyed in Ukraine., In a meeting with Ukraine’s Minister of Education and Science Shkarlet on 13 March, Stefania Giannini pledged to support Ukraine to meet the needs of all learners, both within the country and in neighbouring and refugee hosting countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unesco-s-global-education-coalition-responds-ukrainian-call-support
Ukrainian Crisis: TSF provides telecom suppport to refugees and humanitarian organisations,News and Press Release,TSF,Logistics and Telecommunications,18 Mar 2022,"In this context of war, many families find themselves separated. Communication remains the only possible link for those, often women and children, who take refuge in neighbouring countries. To support them, TSF is installing a free Wi-Fi connection on the daily bus convoys organised by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) between Ukraine and Romania., This convoy, which leaves every day from Palanca, on the Moldovan-Ukrainian border, consists of 15 buses, and allows refugees fleeing Ukraine from the south, mainly women and children, to reach Romania and its capital Bucharest in safety. Thanks to the TSF connection, during this 500km journey, the refugees will be able to stay in contact with their loved ones in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, as well as obtain essential information for their future., Also mobilised in Ukraine, a TSF team provides support to humanitarian operations in the country. From Lviv, TSF collaborates with the Ukrainian NGO Vostok-SOS, which coordinates medical and food supplies to 100 sites in Ukraine. The supply of satellite equipment for the city of Odessa is also being finalised. A TSF team remains mobilised on the borders between Romania, Moldova and Ukraine to prepare for a possible massive flow of refugees following the intensification of the conflict in the city of Odessa., Assessments and discussions with humanitarian actors are also continuing on the Polish side, to identify possible actions TSF could take to help refugees fleeing Ukraine via this route. ""The complexity of the crisis, its constant evolution and the extent of the area affected by the crisis, make humanitarian assistance particularly difficult. We are working to ensure the most effective support possible for victims and humanitarian actors in Ukraine and neighbouring countries"" explains Jean-François Cazenave, President of TSF.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-tsf-provides-telecom-suppport-refugees-and-humanitarian

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 16 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,17 Mar 2022,"Date: 17 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 16 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 2,032 civilian casualties in the country: 780 killed and 1,252 injured. This included:, a total of 780 killed (146 men, 111 women, 7 girls, and 15 boys, as well as 36 children and 465 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,252 injured (130 men, 100 women, 17 girls, and 7 boys, as well as 44 children and 954 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 854 casualties (208 killed and 646 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 634 casualties (162 killed and 472 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 220 casualties (46 killed and 174 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,178 casualties (572 killed and 606 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Sievierodonetsk and Rubizhne (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 9 a.m. (local time) 17 March, 108 children had been killed and more than 120 injured.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Mar 2022,"On February 24, 2022, Russia launched its troops in Ukraine. Three weeks later, the toll of the offensive is already very heavy: several hundred dead and wounded, and millions of others have had to flee their towns and villages to find shelter from the fighting. Numerous buildings and infrastructure have been destroyed, basic public services have been severely disrupted and supply chains have been cut., HUMANITARIAN NEEDS ASSESSMENT, Based on its experience in conflict zones, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL decided to quickly dispatch two missions to assess the humanitarian needs of the affected populations: the first to Ukraine and the second to Moldova., The findings are alarming. “Hundreds of thousands of people have left everything behind overnight. They find themselves in absolute destitution and are faced with very difficult living conditions, without access to water and heating. No one is spared. We meet many elderly people who have to face the cold, hunger, thirst and lack of hygiene,” says Philippe Bonnet, head of the Emergency mission for SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL., The situation is particularly critical at the borders. “The road from Lviv to the Polish border is very congested. When our team arrived, there were between 25 and 30 km of traffic jams. People arrive with their families, but the men have to turn back because they are not allowed to leave the country [editor’s note: since the general mobilization decreed on February 24, Ukrainians between the ages of 18 and 60 are forbidden to leave their country]. It is really heartbreaking for these families who know that the men will probably be called to fight. So, women, children and elderly people get out of their cars and walk across the border while the men go back the other way. The border crossing is particularly harsh: people have to wait for hours in the cold and they lack water and food,” continues the mission leader., Our teams also visited the cities of Lviv and Uman, which has become “hot spots” for displaced people since the war began. “Many people are leaving the eastern part of Ukraine and Kiev for the west and Poland in particular,” explains the head of mission., The city of Lviv, located 70 km from the Polish border, is full of displaced people who wander from one place to another in search of accommodation for the night or a means of transportation to reach a border country. These searches are particularly complicated: there is no longer any accommodation available in Lviv and car rental companies refuse to rent their vehicles for fear that they will go abroad or end up in a combat zone. Many have no choice but to take refuge in makeshift shelters, such as the Arena stadium, which hosts nearly 6,000 people each week. “The improvised reception centres are facing enormous needs that are increasing as the conflict continues. The city is saturated and local authorities are asking for help.”, observes Philippe Bonnet., The town of Uman is also an important crossroads: every day, thousands of displaced people arrive there from Kiev, Kharkiv, Mariupol or Dnipro. They stay for the night in abandoned places before “taking the road again”. “We met Lila, who had just arrived from Soumy after several days of travelling. She had initially chosen to stay in her town where the fighting was raging. But after 3 days of living hidden in her cellar with her children, without water, electricity or heating, she decided to leave,” reports Philippe Bonnet., Our teams have finally estimated the needs in Moldova, which has received the second largest number of people from Ukraine since the conflict began. “People passing through Moldova need to be accompanied during their transit. A response is in place by the government and civil society that is completely dedicated to the emergency response and is exhausted. The majority of the aid is done through voluntary work by Moldovans who have given up all their free time to respond to the emergency. However, Moldovan society is having to return to its normal functioning and is rapidly disengaging from the response., Thus, NGOs such as SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL have to take over the accompaniment of people waiting for transport or when they arrive too exhausted to continue their journey directly – Moldova is not a major destination country for Ukrainians – by ensuring access to shelter, water, toilets, hot meals, etc. More and more women and children are arriving on foot, without transport and sometimes without a clear destination. In a state of shock because of the war, the abandonment of their daily lives overnight, the lack of news from relatives who are sometimes unreachable and the men who have remained in Ukraine, these people often need rest in dignified and protected spaces to enable them to recover physically and emotionally. SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is distributing hot meals from 17 March 2022 and is positioning itself to take over the management of transit centres globally., The host populations of Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, are extremely affected by their commitment but also by the reception of the refugees in their homes. It is therefore essential to strengthen and support this solidarity, which is why our teams provide financial support to the most vulnerable families who have opened their doors to enable them to meet the needs of the people they are hosting., BASIC NECESSITIES, To meet the urgent needs identified, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL quickly helped to distribute drinking water and thousands of hot meals in the cities of Lviv and Uman., At the same time, our NGO is organising the departure of an exceptional convoy of 38-tonne lorries to provide essential items to displaced people in transit in Ukraine and at the Moldovan border: non-perishable food, baby milk, bottles, bottled water, nappies, sanitary products, first aid items, cots, mattresses, etc., These items will be made available to the local reception centres. “We want to support the relief efforts that have been set up urgently and that are struggling to cope with this exponential demand. We are acting in coordination with local associations and authorities,” explains Philippe Bonnet., Finally, the “Emergency” mission plans to provide latrines and showers in the near future to enable the displaced population to maintain a decent level of hygiene and to relieve themselves in a safe and dignified manner., In order to carry out its operations, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is asking for financial support from as many people as possible., « The challenge that we face is immense and risks worsening dramatically; it is essential to immediately bring the most vulnerable people to safety and to prepare to support many others in the future. Diagnostics are underway in other areas, closer to the fighting. The needs there are certainly considerable”, concludes the head of mission.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-emergency-support-displaced-populations

In Warsaw a transit centre will be constructed and run with partners at the central train station. NRC teams are also providing information and legal assistance to help Ukrainian and non-Ukrainian displaced people obtain protection and access essential services in several locations across the country, including in the eastern and west regions., “The situation for millions of people inside Ukraine is growing more desperate by the day. We are therefore organising food, water, sanitation, shelters, and legal support. But most of all the vulnerable families need protection from the ruthless bombing and shelling that engulfs them,” said Jan Egeland NRC’s Secretary General., NRC is working with a large number of national partners in Poland, Moldova, and Romania, to ensure Ukrainian refugees have somewhere safe to sleep, that children can go to school, and that families are able to access existing national social support systems. In the coming weeks NRC will work to provide cash directly to thousands of displaced mothers and fathers so they can take care of the basic needs of their families, both inside Ukraine and when they become refugees. Agreements have been signed with financial providers, partner organisations and needs assessments have been carried out in Ukraine and Poland., NRC has also started cross-border operations into Ukraine through neighbouring countries and has so far provided food and other aid supplies along evacuation routes., “Our brave colleagues are working day and night under extreme conditions to meet the growing needs of exhausted children, women, and men. We have used and committed all our private donations and funding received from the Norwegian government, USD 17 million, to aid displaced and conflict-stricken Ukrainians. Without more funding faster from more donor countries, we will run out of resources to continue our emergency work by April,” said Egeland., So far, NRC has entered partnerships with 15 local organisations in Ukraine, Poland, Moldova, and Romania that effectively can deliver services. NRC will also provide training for an effective response in accordance with humanitarian principles. NRC’s regional crisis response plan sets out to assist 800,000 people with a total cost of US$82 million in the next six months.

Protection and Human Rights",18 Mar 2022,"Explosive Weapons Leave People Dead, Wounded, Homeless; Damage Vital Infrastructure, (Lviv) – More than 450 civilians were reportedly killed or injured in the first 11 days of the war, in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, as a result of Russian airstrikes and artillery shelling of populated areas, Human Rights Watch said today. The attacks damaged civilian buildings, including apartment blocks, schools, places of worship, and shops, impeding access to food and medicines. They also damaged infrastructure in the city causing civilians to lose vital services such as electricity, heat, and water., Human Rights Watch identified Russian use of cluster munitions and explosive weapons with wide-area effect in heavily populated areas in Kharkiv, in apparent indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Indiscriminate shelling in heavily populated areas violates international humanitarian law and may constitute a war crime., “In Kharkiv, Russian military forces showed disregard for civilian lives through repeated apparent indiscriminate attacks in populated areas” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Russia’s military may believe they can disregard the laws of war in their assault on Kharkiv, but the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Kharkiv and there will be accountability for those responsible.”, According to Kharkiv regional police, between February 24 and March 7, 2022, a total of 133 civilians were killed, 5 of them children, and 319 civilians were wounded. One of the attacks Human Rights Watch documented killed a man as he was waiting in line outside a supermarket; another killed two people who had apparently just emerged from a shelter to get water., A spokesperson for the Kharkiv mayor’s office told Human Rights Watch that as of March 4, approximately 500,000 people remained in the city, from a pre-war population of 1.8 million., “People are leaving Kharkiv ‘empty,’” a resident told Human Rights Watch. “They don’t pack bags or take their things. They grab their documents and each other and they flee.” Those who remain have endured intermittent heat at best, as outside temperatures have ranged between 2 and -4 Celsius, as well as shortages of food, water, and essential medicines., Yuri Sydorenka, the head of the External Affairs Department of Kharkiv’s mayor’s office, said that as of March 3 the city was experiencing major medicine shortages: “So far, we have some ways to get medication in, but we need more.” On March 7 the deputy head of the Health Ministry’s Kharkiv office, Zhanna Strogaya, told Human Rights Watch that at least 14 healthcare facilities had been damaged, 9 of them seriously., Human Rights Watch interviewed 29 people, including Kharkiv residents, medical workers, volunteers assisting with evacuation, and municipal officials, about the attacks. Human Rights Watch verified and analyzed 29 videos and 41 photographs posted on Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok, and another 2 videos and 18 photographs sent directly to researchers to corroborate witness testimony and to identify additional impact sites and damage., The attacks Human Rights Watch documented took place between February 24 and March 5. They damaged or destroyed residential buildings, schools, market stalls, churches, stores, hospitals, university departments, and other civilian infrastructure throughout the city. The Ukrainian human rights group Truth Hounds also documented many of these attacks., “Our city center is being erased,” one Kharkiv resident told Human Rights Watch., Sydorenka, said that on March 2 alone, Russian shelling killed 34 people and injured 285. Ten of the injured are children. He also said that the attacks damaged hundreds of apartment buildings and disrupted the city’s water and power supply, leaving about 300 apartment buildings without electricity., A 45-year-old woman who was living in Kharkiv’s southeast Industrialny district, on March 2 said, “Where I live, there is no internet, no hot water, we had no heating for several days. I only have the food I bought before the crisis started. Everything is closed, there is no bread.”, Several people said that the basements, underground parking lots, and other facilities used as bomb shelters were freezing cold, and when sheltering in them, civilians had little access to basic needs such as food and water. A man from Saltivka, a large residential area in Kharkiv’s northeast, said that his family spent six nights in an unheated basement in sub-zero temperature, with little food and water. “It was so cold that I started having seizures,” he said. “The stores are running low on food and water, you can still buy Coca-Cola but that’s about it.”, Many people also shared their fears that their apartment building infrastructure was not safe. “There are water pipes in our basements and there is a danger that a water pipe might burst,” one woman said. Another said that she did not take shelter in the basement, because she was worried that the building would collapse and they would be “buried under the rubble.” “It is safer in the flat,” she said. She and her four-year-old son were taking shelter in the bathroom on the fourth floor of her apartment building., Dozens of educational facilities, including schools and preschools, were damaged or destroyed in the first week of the war, Sydorenka said. Human Rights Watch documented damage to eight schools and two university departments., Under international humanitarian law parties to an armed conflict have obligations to distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants, between civilian objects and military objectives, and to take precautions to protect civilians and other non-combatants from the hazards of war. Failure to observe the principle of distinction, in particular by directing an attack against civilians or civilian objects or conducting indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, constitutes a war crime when committed deliberately or recklessly. Unlawful and wanton excessive destruction of property that is not militarily justified, is also a war crime., Human Rights Watch was not able to conduct on-site visits in Kharkiv and used interviews with witnesses and images from the damage to try to identify the types of weapons Russian forces used in the attacks documented. This analysis demonstrates that in addition to cluster munitions, Russian forces used explosive weapons with wide-area effect., The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effect in populated areas heightens the likelihood of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. These weapons have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. Long-term effects of their use include damage to civilian buildings and critical infrastructure, interference with services such as health care and education, and displacement of the local population. Russia and Ukraine should avoid using explosive weapons in populated areas. Every country, including Russia and Ukraine, should support a strong political declaration that includes a commitment to avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effect in populated areas., Russian and Ukrainian forces should make all efforts to ensure that adequate supplies and humanitarian assistance are able to reach civilians in and around Kharkiv, and every country, and intergovernmental organizations should press both parties to abide by their international humanitarian law obligations and ensure access for humanitarian assistance and safe passage for civilian evacuations. The parties should allow access to neutral and independent humanitarian aid providers so they can offer support to vulnerable civilians who may need assistance to leave, including people with disabilities, older people, pregnant people, children, and people with chronic or severe medical conditions. If an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors is reached and put into effect, the parties should not breach that agreement in any way that places civilians at risk., The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. The extensive civilian losses and damage in Kharkiv underline the importance of the court’s scrutiny on the lawfulness of the attacks on the city. The Commission of Inquiry established on March 4 by the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva should also investigate alleged unlawful attacks in Kharkiv., “Our assessment points to multiple indiscriminate attacks in the first 11 days of hostilities in Kharkiv, and media reports indicate that Russia has carried out further indiscriminate attacks harming civilians as fighting continues in Kharkiv and elsewhere,” Williamson said. “Russia should immediately abide by its obligations to avoid and minimize civilian harm, and not lose sight of the fact that multiple international investigations are underway to hold those who don’t meet their obligations to account.”, For detailed findings about the attacks and more detail about the laws of war, please see below., Methodology, Human Rights watch interviewed 7 people in person in Lviv and 22 by telephone. Some people asked to be identified only by their first names or by pseudonyms for their protection., Human Rights Watch identified the location of the videos and photographs it reviewed by matching geographic details with satellite imagery and Google Street View. The approximate date and time of the attacks are based on the accounts of those interviewed and the date and time of content uploaded to social media. Human Rights Watch did not use optical resolution satellite imagery to confirm the date of the analysis due to the extensive cloud cover over Kharkiv from February 28 to March 5. The lack of satellite imagery meant that Human Rights Watch could not, in most instances, clearly identify potential military targets that may have been in the vicinity of the affected civilian areas. Human Rights Watch consulted an open-source online map to locate areas labeled as belonging to the Ukrainian military in Kharkiv. A 500-meter radius was drawn around each facility on the map and checked for its proximity to the location of each incident documented., An interactive map shows the locations of the attacks documented., Kyivsky District, Central Kharkiv, On March 4 Elena, a scientist and resident of the Kyivsky district in central Kharkiv, spoke to Human Rights Watch by phone. She said she had left her apartment at Myronosytska Street 46 due to heavy shelling in the neighborhood. “I don’t know if my building is still standing,” she said. “Last time I saw it, all the windows were blown out and the gas was turned off.”, This part of central Kharkiv was subject to intense shelling over the first week of the war. Several incidents of this shelling are described below., March 1, Two Kharkiv residents described an attack they witnessed on the morning of March 1 near an ATB supermarket in central Kharkiv, which killed a civilian., Gleb, 25, said: “I saw a large line of people outside… people were trying to buy bread and water. Something exploded and one man in the line was hit. They took the man inside the supermarket. There was a lot of blood and the ambulance came.”, Alexey said that he was standing in line when he heard a loud explosion, “I was near the entrance to the supermarket waiting to go in when the explosion happened. I saw a flash and heard the sound. It was like a snap. I don’t know if they both happened at the same time, maybe a few seconds apart. After that the staff opened the doors so we could seek refuge inside., “I rushed in and then this man was brought in. He had been standing only a few meters behind me in the line. I saw some people carry him in and put him down on the floor. He was a young guy. They called the ambulance... I didn’t see the wound, [but saw] a pool of blood next to his head and they had laid him down on his stomach. He was still alive but breathing heavily. The ambulance came quickly. They picked him up and took him away... Later we learned from the news that he was an Indian student and died in the intensive care unit.”, Indian officials confirmed that a fourth-year Indian medical student was killed in Kharkiv while standing in line to buy food., Human Rights Watch examined the area around the ATB-market on an open-source on-line map and identified a building labelled as a military recruiting office 250 meters east of where the attack took place. None of the witnesses identified other potential military targets in the area at the time of the attack. The absence of any other such targets indicates this was an apparent indiscriminate attack., March 2, On March 2, there was an attack that appeared to have been directed at the Office of the State Security Service (SBU), at Myronosytska Street 2, which is a military target. The shelling also caused extensive damage to civilian buildings in the vicinity, including the top floor of the economics department of V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, located opposite the SBU offices. In a video posted to Telegram on March 2, a fire rages as large sections of the roof fall to the ground., Another attack on March 2 in Kyivsky district, documented by Truth Hounds, the Ukrainian human rights monitoring group, occurred two blocks north at Myronosytska Street 32. A video posted on Telegram on March 2 shows the upper floors of this and at least two other multi-story buildings nearby suffered significant damage as a result of shelling., Ihor Gromov, a taxi driver from Kharkiv interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Lviv after he had evacuated, confirmed that the five-story building at Myronosytska Street 32 was severely damaged and burned in a March 2 attack. He also said that a section of the roof of his own neighboring building, at Myronosytska Street 34, was damaged in that attack., Gromov was out shopping at the time of the attack and said that he returned to find that two of his neighbors had been injured. “The first thing I saw when I rushed upstairs was the guy who lives above me on the 5th floor – his body was pierced with glass shards. I took off my shirt to try to stop the bleeding. I told him to go out, to the ambulance. His neck and chest were bleeding a lot.” Gromov said that the other person, a man also living on the fifth floor, was crushed under slabs of concrete but was able to get out., Gromov said that he did not see potential military targets in the area at the time of the attack. The absence of military targets in the immediate vicinity at the time of the attack would indicate this was an apparent indiscriminate attack., Saltivka Neighborhood, Kyivsky District, In a telephone interview on March 2, “Oxana” said on the previous day a shell had hit her four-story building with about 100 apartments at Krychevskoho Street 42, in the northern Saltivka neighborhood of Kyivsky district, entering through the window of the top floor of the building. She said many other buildings in her neighborhood had also been hit. She was speaking from her parents’ 12-story apartment building, just minutes on foot from her own, close to Horianska Street., In a subsequent interview, she said that at about 2 p.m. on March 2, a munition had hit the 10th floor of her parents’ building, setting it on fire., Oxana said she was on the third floor when the munition hit and was not harmed, but that it took four hours for firefighters to extinguish the flames. At the time of the attack, she said, more than a dozen people were in the building, including at least one family on the 12th floor. She did not know whether the family was harmed. She said that a military weapons cache, several kilometers away from the populated residential neighborhood, had been hit in the days before March 2, and she was not aware of other potential military targets in the area., Two videos and a photograph posted on Twitter and Telegram on March 1 show damage to a seven-story apartment building at Krychevskoho Street, 29, 100 meters from the building Oxana was in. A munition appears to have hit the fourth and fifth floors. The windows of other nearby apartment buildings are also damaged, as are at least two vehicles., The apparent absence of military targets near Krychevskoho Street 29 and 42 when the attacks took place indicates these were seemingly indiscriminate attacks., Just over three kilometers from Krychevskoho Street, the top floors on the southeast side of a high-rise apartment building next to Studentska metro station were hit, as seen in a photograph posted to Twitter on March 2. The impact sites bear the hallmarks of artillery shelling., Schools and a Church Damaged in Kyivsky District on February 27 and March 2, Human Rights Watch documented attacks that hit two schools in Kyivsky district; Specialized School No. 134 and Specialized School No. 17., Three videos and two photographs posted on Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook show extensive damage to Specialized School No.134, on Shevchenka Street. A video filmed from a distance and posted on February 27 on Telegram shows School 134 on fire. Another video posted to TikTok on February 28 shows extensive damage to the interior and exterior of the same school building., A video posted to Facebook on March 2 shows a hole in the wall of a second-floor classroom of Specialized School No.17 created by a shell fired from the north. A photograph posted to Telegram, also on March 2, from inside the classroom shows desks and chairs strewn across the room with a large hole in the exterior wall., At least one church in Kyivsky district was damaged in attacks on March 2., Four photographs posted to Facebook by the Kharkiv diocese account on March 2 show damage to the Church of the Holy Myrrh-Bearing Women, which was less than 100 meters from the SBU building and the economics department on Myronosytska Street. The photographs reveal damage to the interior, with the windows blown out and damaged holy objects., Saltivka Neighborhood, Moskovskyi District, Serhii, 25, said in a March 3 phone interview that the shelling of his neighborhood in Moskovskyi district, also known as Saltivka, was so intense that he, his wife, and mother-in-law had been sheltering in a basement for seven days in the freezing cold, mostly without electricity or drinking water. Approximately 100 other people were with them. “It’s been so cold in the basement that I started having seizures,” he said. “Yesterday, I went out for the first time to get some warm clothes. It is only a three-minute walk from the basement where we’ve been hiding. As I walked back, there were explosions all around me and I kept on walking, knowing that I could get hit at any second. I walked past our playground and saw a… rocket sticking out of the ground.” Serhii said that after he returned to the basement, the sounds of explosions outside intensified., Human Rights Watch analyzed four videos and one photograph posted to Telegram on March 1 that show three damaged apartment buildings on Druzhby Narodiv Street in the neighborhood Serhii was speaking from. One of these videos shows a resident pointing to an impact site on the top floor of an 11-story building as they pack a car with water bottles and belongings. Two other nearby apartments were hit, and fire and smoke are seen rising from the sites., On March 4 and 5 Saltivka neighborhood came under more intense attacks. Serhii said that on the morning of March 5, he saw several rockets hit three residential buildings in his district. One was a 16-story building at Rodnikovaya 9 and the two other buildings were next to it. He shared with Human Rights Watch three photographs of the burning and damaged residential buildings. Rodnikovaya 9 is approximately 500 meters from the apartment buildings on Druzhby Narodiv Street damaged in earlier strikes., The absence of military targets in the areas at the time of the attacks indicates that these were apparent indiscriminate attacks., Shevchenkivskyi District, Northern Kharkiv, February 28-March 1, Strike on 23 Sepnya Street, An attack on 23 Sepnya Street, on February 28 using cluster munitions killed several civilians who had reportedly come out of their shelter to collect water. Two videos posted to Telegram on February 28 show at least three bodies on the ground. Two bodies are directly outside a water dispenser with large water bottles nearby at 23. Human Rights Watch documented this attack in its reporting on the use of cluster munitions in Kharkiv on February 28., Strike at Akhsarova Street, Tatyana, 42, a mother of 2 boys, ages 8 and 10, said that a rocket landed that morning near School No. 150 on Akhsarova St, 3а, in Shevchenkivskyi district. Her children attended the school before the hostilities broke out, and she said she saw the damage when she was forced to leave her own apartment because, “Our building was on fire and we had to go to the shelter.” Human Rights Watch analyzed a video posted to Telegram on March 1, showing parts of the west side of the school’s exterior and its surroundings. The school’s windows had been blown out, as were those of an apartment block approximately 40 meters west. The walls of the apartment block, a shed, and a tree are also visibly damaged., Strike at 55 Sumskaya Street, On March 1, an artillery attack damaged a boarding school for children who are blind, at Sumskaya Street 55. Human Rights Watch documented this attack on March 7., Human Rights Watch analyzed a video posted to Telegram on March 2 that shows the outside of the school and nearby street. All of the school’s windows visible in the video have been blown out. The video pans to film south on Sumskaya Street. Debris from the buildings lie in the street. At least two multi-story residential and commercial buildings have been damaged, one on each side of the street, approximately 25 meters from the school. In another video posted to Facebook on March 4, recorded from a moving car, the extent of the damage is more visible. At least six buildings with shops on the first floor and housing on the other floors are extensively damaged. A photograph posted on Facebook on March 3 clearly shows extensive damage to the two top floors of a residential and commercial building approximately 50 meters south of the school., An open-source online map shows an area labelled as belonging to the Kozhedub Air Force University, and additional building compounds approximately one kilometer from the attacks on Sumskaya Street. Human Rights Watch has no information on any attacks directed at the Air Force University compound., The one-kilometer distance between the potential military target and the civilian objects extensively damaged in the attacks indicates a failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm or to respect the principle of proportionality and suggests an apparent indiscriminate attack., University Building and a Church Hit, Human Rights Watch spoke on March 3 to a student of V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, Ada, who said that shelling significantly damaged one of the university’s physics and technology buildings on Akademika Kurchatova Street., Airstrikes also hit the city council building and Sviato-Uspensky Ukrainian Orthodox Church on Universytets'ka Street. Human Rights Watch analyzed 15 photographs posted to Facebook by the Kharkiv diocese account on March 2. They show the impact on the church interior, including shattered windows and damaged holy objects. One image, with a partial view out of the window, shows debris in the street east of the church., Kholodnohirskyi District, Western Kharkiv, Iryna Agoyeva, 45, and her 21-year-old daughter Sofia said the apartment building at Kholodnohirska 3, where her 72-year-old female relative lived, was severely damaged in an attack on March 2 and that they saw that the upper part of her building had collapsed, “[She] lives on the fourth floor… and she was hiding in the bathroom with all of her documents.”, Agoyeva said that relatives tried repeatedly to call the woman on March 2 but that she didn’t answer and that as of March 3 they had been unable to find her. The damage to the building’s top three floors was shown in a video posted to Telegram on March 2. The video also shows at least five destroyed stalls at the Kazka market, on the corner of Kholodnohirska and Poltavskyi Shliakh streets., Kholodnohirska 3 is one kilometer northeast of the Cadet Corps State Gymnasium for Intensive Physical Training, at Poltavskyi Shliakh St. 1, a military target that was shelled on March 2., School Damaged on February 28 - March 1, On the night of February 28 or early morning of March 1, a Grad rocket attack hit the grounds of School No.108. A video posted to Telegram on March 1 shows smoke rising from the location of the strike and a rescue worker near the impact site. At 6:47 a.m. on March 1, three photographs were posted to Telegram showing rescue workers using hoses to extinguish a large fire near the impact site. Another video posted to Telegram on March 1 captures damage to the school’s fence, recreation yard, and windows., A video posted to Telegram on March 3 shows the remnants of a 122-millimeter Grad rocket in the parking lot outside the school, and at least four destroyed cars. Damage to the facades of residential buildings nearby is also visible., School No. 108 is approximately 1.5 kilometers north of the Cadet Corps building., The distance of one-to-1.5 kilometers between a military target and the civilian objects extensively damaged, indicates a failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm or to respect the principle of proportionality and suggests an apparent indiscriminate attack., Industrialnyi District, Southeastern Kharkiv, Olexandra fled Kharkiv on February 27 with her son, 11, on a train to Lviv via Kyiv. Olexandra said that on March 1 a blast wave from an explosion damaged her apartment building on Sharikova Street. She showed a Human Rights Watch researcher a video and two photographs taken from the outside that show her damaged balcony, and damage to another building on nearby Ivana Karacha Street., Xenya, 45, who lives on Ivana Karacha Street with her 2 children, ages 13 and 4, described an attack on March 1 that damaged her apartment building, another apartment building at Plitochnaya Street 19a, and two schools: School No.75 and Boarding School No. 11. “All of this happened in one wave – boom, boom, boom, boom. My neighbors are pensioners, and all their windows broke… The fence around School No. 75 melted.”, Human Rights Watch analyzed a video posted to Telegram on March 2 that shows a crater outside the main entrance to School No. 75. The walls of the school are pockmarked by shrapnel and the windows of the three-story building are damaged. In a photograph and video posted on Telegram, taken approximately 350 meters north of School No.75, a crater is visible approximately 20 meters outside Boarding School No 11. The building has visible damage to its windows., The building of a third school, Secondary School No. 118, was also damaged. A video and photograph, posted in the morning of March 2 to Telegram, shows damage to the west building of the school. The windows have been blown out and a burn mark is visible on the façade., “Anna,” an environmental activist who lives in a development in the Vostochny neighborhood of Industrialnyi district, said in an interview that several houses in the neighborhood had completely burned down after aerial strikes on February 26 and 27. “Our basement is not suitable so myself, my parents, my brother and my 85-year-old grandmother stayed in the house. We could see bright flashes and the entire house was trembling. Last night [March 2] we heard gunfire outside.”, Zhovtnevy District, Two videos and nine photographs posted to Twitter and Telegram on March 1 show extensive damage to an apartment building at Novo-Bavarskyj Av. 95 and at least five bodies of civilians. The building was approximately 130 meters from City Hospital Clinic No. 3., International Humanitarian Law, The laws of war require the parties to a conflict to take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian population and to “take all feasible precautions” to avoid or minimize civilian harm and damage to civilian objects. These precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military objectives and not civilians or civilian objects and giving “effective advance warning” to civilians when circumstances permit., The laws of war prohibit attacks directed at civilians or civilian objects, indiscriminate attacks, attacks that have disproportionate effects on civilians, as well as extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction in Ukraine to prosecute such attacks or destruction as war crimes. Previous war crimes tribunals have held that a single act, if significant in scope such as the destruction of a hospital, may suffice to constitute the offense of unlawful and wanton destruction., Under the laws of war, civilian objects are any that are not military. Military objectives are only those that by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose partial or total destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage., Ukrainian authorities are required under international humanitarian law, as far as feasible, to take “necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” To this end they should take all feasible measures to ensure that civilians have access to appropriate spaces to shelter safely during hostilities and provide as much guidance and advice as possible to civilians on options and means for safe shelter., Attacks that damage schools in Ukraine are a devastating blow in a country where conflict over the past eight years has already been detrimental to education. According to UNICEF at least 750 schools have been damaged or destroyed in eastern Ukraine since the conflict began in 2014. Russia has yet to endorse the Safe Schools Declaration, which Ukraine endorsed in November 2019, but both parties have obligations to respect and protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education personnel. Under the International Criminal Court's statute, it is a war crime to intentionally direct attacks against buildings dedicated to education. Russia should refrain from committing attacks that cause harm to students, educational staff, and institutions., Both Russia and Ukraine have obligations to ensure access for humanitarian assistance to civilians and to take all feasible steps to allow civilians who want to, to evacuate safely, whether an agreement to establish humanitarian corridors is put into effect or not. Ukraine, and Russia in the areas that it exercises effective control over or occupies, should ensure that there is adequate supply of food, water, and medicine, and that services vital for the civilian population continue., Russian and Ukrainian forces should facilitate organized evacuations of civilians in and around Kharkiv who want to leave. All parties must abide by their obligations not to carry out attacks that would target or cause indiscriminate or disproportionate harm to civilians while they are leaving, including along railway and road routes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-deadly-attacks-kill-injure-civilians-destroy-homes-enru
Some governments contemplating raids on aid funds earmarked for other crises to pay for new costs of Ukrainian support,News and Press Release,Oxfam,Humanitarian Financing,18 Mar 2022,"The global repercussions of the Ukraine crisis ―already being felt in fast-rising food, commodity and energy prices― could undermine official aid efforts to help people in other humanitarian hot-spots., Oxfam is concerned that some donor governments are already shifting aid budgets to pay for Ukrainian assistance and the costs of hosting more than 3 million people who have fled recently. Others are holding back funding approvals for other crises. Oxfam urges donors to meet Ukraine’s needs with new funding., Europe has a spotted track record. In 2015 ―when half as many refugees made their way to Europe from Syria and beyond― donor countries responded by counting on average 11 percent ($15.4 billion) of their aid commitments to pay to support them., “We must avoid a repeat where some rich countries end up effectively spending their aid budgets domestically,” said Head of Oxfam EU Office, Evelien Van Roemburg. She noted that only 3 percent of funds have so far been given to the UN’s $6 billion appeal to relieve widespread hunger happening now in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan., “The people of Yemen and Syria, all those millions now facing desperate hunger across East and West Africa, those still in camps in Bangladesh and beyond, those hit hardest by COVID and climate change ―they must not be penalized and left paying the price of our duty of care toward the people of Ukraine”., “We get it that governments’ aid budgets are finite and they need to make tough choices, but rather than cutting life-lines to other crises, we need to get creative. Every day now we hear of super-yachts and mansions being seized. Every day, billionaires of all nationalities are growing obscenely from speculation, tax dodging and skyrocketing corporate profits and share prices. After rightfully spending trillions to save their economies from the impacts of COVID-19, we reject any assertion that helping a refugee from Ukraine or a hungry Somalian farmer is a choice,” Van Roemburg said., “Well done to those donors doing the right thing. Let’s help and support all people in need by those who can afford it, as we redouble efforts to stop conflict and climate change and rebuild a global food system,” she said., Contact Information, Annie Thériault in Peru | annie.theriault@oxfam.org | +51 936 307 990

The state of affairs in Ukraine: flagrant violations of humanitarian principles,Analysis,Alternatives Humanitaires (Humanitarian Alternatives),Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Sara Germain, Stéphanie Maltais and François Audet • Canadian Research Institute on Humanitarian Crises and Aid (Montreal, Canada), Our partner, the Canadian Research Institute on Humanitarian Crises and Aid (Observatoire canadien sur les crises et l’action humanitaires – OCCAH in French), has been monitoring the humanitarian consequences of the conflict in Ukraine. A dozen researchers are working to assess and analyse the situation in order to inform the reflections of humanitarian and academic actors as well as policy makers. In this article, three of them provide an initial overview and points of attention., The violence of the war that has been going on in Ukraine since 24 February shows us that the Kremlin – the centre of power in Moscow – is not responding to any imperative to protect civilians. Civilian targets are deliberately being attacked, with a blatant disregard for the principles that govern international humanitarian law and despite the agreements regarding humanitarian corridors which were concluded as part of the peace negotiations between the two States during the various rounds of negotiations. In addition, the speed of the evolution of the conflict makes it very difficult to organise and provide humanitarian access, both to protect local populations who are close to the front lines or who are still on the move, and those who have already crossed borders. As needs increase, obstacles to civilian protection are piling up. Given the scale of the crisis, how is the humanitarian assistance provided by the “international community” organised and what challenges will countries and organisations have to face?

UNECE warns of high risks of industrial accidents in Ukraine and recalls need for prevention,News and Press Release,UNECE,Recovery and Reconstruction,18 Mar 2022,"UNECE notes with concern the attacks on industrial facilities in Ukraine since the beginning of the war and calls for a prompt end of the hostilities and the prevention of technological disasters, which could affect the population and environment of Ukraine and neighbouring countries., Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the risk of industrial accidents has been aggravated significantly. Several fuel depots and gas pipelines have been bombed, with additional reports of burning warehouses storing chemicals. For example, on 27 February, an oil depot in Vasylkiv, near Kyiv, was hit and set ablaze as a result of a missile attack. On 4 March 2022, a combined heat and power plant in Okhtyrka in the Sumy region was destroyed by an airstrike; and on 7 March a fire at the oil depots in Zhytomyr and Chernyakhiv occurred after air strikes. Moreover, in the current circumstances maintaining safety measures and scrutiny at high levels proves challenging for operators and authorities. Even in installations where scrutiny is normally high, safety may now be compromised., Ukraine is a highly industrialized country, in which – in addition to several nuclear power plants – numerous industrial facilities holding hazardous chemical substances are located, ranging from the agricultural sector to the oil and gas industry, pulp and paper, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, machine-building and mining., While Ukraine is not a Party to the UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, the assistance provided under the Convention since 2005 has allowed the country to map and better understand its industrial risks. Among the hazardous facilities in the mining sector, for example, are 465 tailings management facilities (TMFs), which store over 6 billion tons of waste arising from the extraction and processing industries as well as the energy sector., An accident at a facility holding toxic mining waste or other hazardous substances could have severe and long-term consequences, including on neighbouring and riparian countries, aggravating human suffering and causing serious environmental harm. Prevention efforts need to be placed at the forefront to avert any severe, transboundary and long-term effects of industrial accidents, the remediation of which would necessitate significant efforts in terms of human and financial resources even in times of peace., Notes to editors, For 30 years UNECE, through its Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents, has been supporting member States in the pan-European region in industrial accident prevention, preparedness and response in order to protect people and the environment. The UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents was adopted in 1992, and entered into force in 2000. Since then, countries in the pan-European region, comprising Parties and beneficiary countries of the Assistance and Cooperation Programme, have been cooperating in fostering its implementation. Today, the Convention counts 41 Parties. Countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia have benefited from activities under the Convention’s Assistance and Cooperation Programme, founded in 2004. Through the high-level commitment declaration in 2005, the majority of these countries have set out to progressively implement the Convention’s provisions and aspire towards eventual accession., The Convention applies to installations (so-called “hazardous activities”) holding hazardous substances covered by its annex I, which may cause transboundary effects. At the same time, it sets out to strengthen more broadly policymaking and governance for industrial safety and technological disaster risk reduction, in the spirit of the Sendai Framework. Among its key provisions are the identification of hazardous activities, and related information-sharing with neighbouring countries, the preparation of joint or harmonized off-site contingency plans, prompt notification in case of an industrial accident and mutual assistance to help mitigate consequences. The Convention does not apply to nuclear facilities., In 2008-2009, under the auspices of UNECE’s Joint Expert Group on Water and Industrial Accidents, Safety Guidelines and Good Practices on TMFs have been developed. In 2013, the German Environment Agency, under the auspices of the Industrial Accident Convention’s workplans, developed a checklist methodology to support application of the Safety Guidelines and supported application of this methodology in Ukraine when implementing two projects in the period from 2013 to 2017, and in selected countries of Eastern, South-Eastern Europe and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia thereafter. The Methodology has most recently been updated in 2020. UNECE, with the support of Switzerland, has been supporting related mapping efforts in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan since 2018.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unece-warns-high-risks-industrial-accidents-ukraine-and-recalls-need-prevention

Recovery and Reconstruction",18 Mar 2022,"Joint statement of heads of international financial institutions with programs in Ukraine and neighboring countries, Statement from Odile Renaud-Basso, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Carlo Monticelli, Governor of the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and David Malpass, President of the World Bank Group (WBG)., We, the heads of the EBRD, EIB, CEB, IMF, and WBG, met yesterday to discuss impacts on the global economy of the ongoing war in Ukraine and our respective and collective response to this crisis., We are horrified and deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing crisis., The attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are causing tremendous suffering, creating massive population displacements, threatening international peace and security, and endangering basic social and economic needs for people around the world., In addition to the devastating human catastrophe unfolding in Ukraine, the war is disrupting livelihoods throughout the region and beyond., The impacts will be extensive—from reduced energy and food supplies, to increases in prices and poverty and a massive undertaking of Ukraine’s reconstruction, all of which will hamper the post-pandemic recovery around the world., The entire global economy will feel the effects of the crisis through slower growth, trade disruptions, and steeper inflation, harming especially the poorest and most vulnerable., Higher prices for commodities like food and energy will push inflation up further., Countries, particularly those neighbouring Ukraine, will suffer disruptions in trade, supply chains and remittances as well as surges in refugee flows., Reduced confidence and higher investor uncertainty will impact asset prices, tighten financial conditions, and could even generate capital outflows from emerging markets., Our institutions have responded with emergency support to Ukraine and its neighbours., The EBRD has approved a “War on Ukraine – EBRD Resilience Package”, initially sized at €2 billion, to respond to the immediate needs of the people affected by the war and - when conditions permit - support the substantial reconstruction of Ukraine. The EBRD's package comprises an immediate Resilience and Livelihoods program covering the areas of energy security, nuclear safety, municipal services, trade finance support and liquidity for SMEs in Ukraine and in neighbouring affected countries. Once conditions permit, the EBRD will also be prepared to take part in a reconstruction program for Ukraine, to rebuild livelihoods and businesses; restore vital infrastructure; support good governance; and enable access to services. It envisages working with international partners including the EU and U.S., as well as bilateral donors and other international financial institutions., The EIB has prepared an emergency Ukraine Solidarity Urgent Response, encompassing the provision of immediate financial support of €668 million to Ukrainian authorities and the repurposing of infrastructure project commitments to accelerate delivery of an additional €1.3 billion. So far €329 million has been disbursed. Beyond this, EIB is fully committed to help rebuild what is being destroyed by the war, by financing new critical economic and social infrastructure. In parallel, the EIB will also support the EU Eastern and Southern Neighborhood, the EU Enlargement Region and Central Asia through an immediate response, targeting in particular countries most significantly impacted by the consequences of the refugee crisis, as well as through a medium-term resilience response to mitigate social and economic impacts. Finally, EIB has developed an action plan to help alleviate the impact of the refugee crisis on refugee-hosting EU countries., The CEB, according to its membership and special social mandate, has provided emergency grants to Ukraine’s neighbouring countries to cover immediate needs of refugees, including transportation and orientation. The CEB stands ready to also provide flexible, fast-disbursing loans to address the significant financial needs of neighbouring and other countries hosting large inflow of refugees, while remaining focused on the social sector., The IMF disbursed emergency assistance of US$1.4 billion to Ukraine on March 9 under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war. IMF staff remains closely engaged with the authorities to provide policy support as they continue to design and implement effective crisis mitigation measures. The IMF is also currently working with Moldova that has requested an augmentation of its existing IMF-supported program. The Fund stands ready to support neighboring and other countries affected by the spillovers of the war through all its instruments., The World Bank Group has already mobilized more than US$ 925 million for Ukraine, including fast-disbursing budget support to help the government provide critical services to Ukrainian people, of which US$ 350 has been disbursed. This financing is part of a $3 billion package of support planned for Ukraine in the coming months. The World Bank also set up a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) that is among the most rapid, targeted, and secure mechanisms to facilitate channeling grant resources from donors to Ukraine, with contributions of US$ 145 million thus far. The World Bank Group is also working on options to assist neighboring countries, including to support refugee populations, and will continue to provide trade finance to support the private sector., We acknowledge the importance of working together to coordinate our respective responses to support Ukraine and neighbours on the financing and policy fronts and maximise impact on the ground. We are committed to strengthening international cooperation and solidarity in the face of this enormous challenge.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/we-are-horrified-and-deeply-concerned-about-russian-invasion-enru

8998TH MEETING (PM), Children Deliberate Target, Permanent Representative Says, Accusing Russian Troops of Torture, Abductions, Extrajudicial Killings, The magnitude of the civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied, the head of United Nations political affairs told the Security Council today, demanding accountability and a thorough investigation., “Civilians are entitled to protection against the dangers arising from military operations,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, as she briefed the Council on the latest developments in Ukraine. “International humanitarian law is crystal clear.”, Daily attacks continue to batter Ukrainian cities, many reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, she said. Between 24 February and 15 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,900 civilian casualties — with 726 people killed, including 52 children, she reported, noting that most were caused by the use of wide-impact explosive weapons in populated areas., She went on to say that residents in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol who have been unable to safely evacuate now lack food, water, electricity and medical care, adding that “uncollected corpses lie on city streets”. The priority for the United Nations is to reach people trapped by the shelling. Urging safe passage for civilians out of, and humanitarian supplies into, encircled areas, she expressed gratitude to neighbouring Governments for their generosity in receiving refugees. “There will be no winners to this senseless conflict,” she said., Raouf Mazou, Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), broadly agreed, noting that in less than three weeks, the number of people fleeing Ukraine into neighbouring countries has risen from 520,000 to over 3.1 million, in what has become the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. “We are humbled by the remarkable resilience of the refugees, many of whom have left their homes with nothing but a plastic bag, and by the extraordinary hospitality of the host authorities and host communities,” he said., With close to 2 million refugees from Ukraine, Poland has quickly become one of the world’s largest host countries, he said. Another 490,000 people have fled to Romania, 350,000 to the Republic of Moldova, 280,000 to Hungary, and 228,000 to Slovakia, while others have moved to the Russian Federation or Belarus, he added. Given the current pace of refugee outflows, the capacities of the neighbouring countries are being “tested and stretched”, he noted, calling for greater support., Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), said the devastating health consequences of the war on Ukrainians will reverberate for years or decades to come. National health services have been severely disrupted by the widespread destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure — and, increasingly, health facilities. Noting that WHO has verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, he underlined that “attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law — anytime, anywhere”., Whereas WHO has established supply lines from its warehouse in Lviv to many other cities, it faces challenges, he said, noting that critical supplies are ready for United Nations joint convoys to enter difficult areas, “but so far, we have not been successful”. The convoy to Sumy, which included a WHO truck carrying medical supplies, was unable to enter, while loads ready for Mariupol remain in staging areas, he said, emphasizing: “Access to these, and other areas, is now critical.”, In the ensuing discussion, the delegates of Albania and the United Kingdom denounced the Russian Federation’s “unprovoked” and “illegal” war of aggression against Ukraine, while the representative of the United States emphasized that Moscow will be held accountable for its atrocities. “Russia, and Russia alone, bears the sole responsibility for the war, and humanitarian crisis,” Norway’s representative added., Poland’s representative described Moscow’s actions as “100 per cent a war of choice”, saying his country has seen first-hand its dramatic humanitarian consequences. Warsaw will continue to admit refugees in a spirit of solidarity, regardless of their nationality, race or religious creed, he emphasized., The Russian Federation’s representative accused Western capitals of providing Kyiv with weapons, thereby fuelling the conflict. He said that his delegation will request an emergency Council meeting on Friday to discuss biolaboratories in Ukraine, using new documents obtained during the special military operation. He went on to refute the claim that Russian forces shelled a maternity hospital and mosque in Mariupol, blaming the readiness of “Ukrainian radicals” to drag civilians in Mariupol into the grave, like the Nazis in Berlin in 1945., Ukraine’s delegate responded by saying that the 726 civilian killings confirmed by UNHCR, and the fact that 90 per cent of Mariupol’s infrastructure has been destroyed, reveal the Russian Federation’s plans to raze Ukrainian cities to the ground. “Children are a deliberate target,” he added. Accusing the Russians of breaking into houses, throwing people into the streets and taking their food, as well as engaging in torture, local abductions and extrajudicial killings, he pressed the Council to exercise its duties under Article 94.2 of the Charter of the United Nations to decide on measures related to the Russian Federation’s failure to uphold its obligations., Also speaking today were representatives of France, Ireland, India, Ghana, Gabon, Kenya, Brazil, China, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 3:03 p.m. and ended at 5:18 p.m., Briefings, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, briefed the Council, reporting that daily attacks continue to batter Ukrainian cities. Many are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, she added. Between 24 February and 15 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,900 civilian casualties, with 726 people killed, among them 52 children, and 1,174 injured, including 63 children, she said cautioning that the actual numbers are probably much higher. Most of those casualties were caused by the use of wide-impact explosive weapons in populated areas, she pointed out. She went on to state that OHCHR staff in Donetsk are closely following developments regarding the 14 March incident in which 20 civilians were reportedly killed by a Tochka-U missile that may have contained cluster munitions. All such instances must be properly investigated, she emphasized., Whereas positive signals have been reported about the ongoing direct talks between representatives of Ukraine and the Russian Federation, she noted that they have not translated into a cessation of hostilities, stressing that the situation in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol is particularly alarming. “Many of the Mariupol residents who have not been able to safely evacuate lack food, water, electricity and medical care,” she said, adding that “uncollected corpses lie on city streets”. Wednesday’s strike on the Mariupol theatre, which reportedly served as a bomb shelter for displaced civilians, adds to the list of attacks against civilian structures, she affirmed., “International humanitarian law is crystal clear,” she said, underscoring that “civilians are entitled to protection against the dangers arising from military operations”. Yet, the magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. The priority for the Organization and its partners is to reach the people trapped by the ongoing shelling, including in eastern Ukraine, she said, adding that the United Nations calls for safe passage for civilians out of, and humanitarian supplies into, encircled areas. She went on to express gratitude for the generosity of neighbouring Governments in receiving refugees and enabling the provision of assistance to Ukraine., The United Nations requests that all donors fast-track funding against their pledges towards the Ukraine Flash Appeal, she said, noting that the $1.1 billion appeal is 36 per cent funded. Citing the Secretary-General, she said dangerous ripple effects from the conflict are already being felt across the globe, pointing out that the Russian Federation and Ukraine represent more than half of the world’s supply of sunflower oil and about 30 per cent of its wheat. Food, fuel and fertilizer prices are skyrocketing, she noted, recalling that on 14 March,the Secretary-General announced the establishment of the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to lead an effort with Member States to deal with the complex fallout from the war. “There will be no winners to this senseless conflict,” she emphasized. The tremendous loss it is causing is heartbreakingly clear and there must be a meaningful, sustained political process to enable a peaceful settlement., RAOUF MAZOU, Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), noted that it has been less than three weeks since High Commissioner Filippo Grandi addressed the Council. In that short time, the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine into neighbouring countries has risen exponentially from 520,000 to more than 3.1 million today, in what has become the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, he said. With close to 2 million refugees from Ukraine, Poland has quickly become one of the largest refugee-hosting countries in the world, he said, adding that another 490,000 have fled to Romania, 350,000 to the Republic of Moldova, 280,000 to Hungary and 228,000 to Slovakia. Others have moved to the Russian Federation or Belarus., “We are humbled by the remarkable resilience of the refugees,” many of whom have left their homes with nothing but a plastic bag, he continued, also noting the extraordinary hospitality of the host authorities and host communities. That solidarity illustrates the foundations of the global refugee protection architecture and the spirit of the Global Compact on Refugees, he said. Strongly commending Governments for keeping their borders open, he also welcomed bilateral and other support extended to refugee-hosting countries and the funding committed thus far in support of the $1.1 billion Flash Appeal for the response inside Ukraine, as well as the $550.6 million directed to the UNHCR-led Regional Refugee Response Plan. With those funds, efforts are under way to help the refugee population and support host countries by providing shelter, emergency relief items, cash assistance and mental health and psychosocial support, he said., Noting that UNHCR has scaled up its response by deploying more than 200 experts and established a field presence in all countries, he said its staff on the ground are undertaking regular protection monitoring at main border crossing points, reception centres and other central locations. “However, with the current pace of refugee outflows, the capacities of the neighbouring countries are being tested and stretched,” he said, calling for greater support. Funding, while critical, is just one of the many forms of support that are urgently needed, he emphasized, hailing in that regard the recent launch of the European Union Solidarity Platform. Designed to ease the pressure on the countries neighbouring Ukraine by transferring vulnerable refugees to other member States, it is an innovative example of the responsibility-sharing outlined in the Global Compact on Refugees, he affirmed., He went on to note that 90 per cent of refugees fleeing Ukraine are women and children, stressing the heightened risk of gender-based violence and other forms of exploitation and abuse, including trafficking. UNHCR is deeply concerned about media reports of such incidents and is supporting efforts by Governments to scale up prevention and risk mitigation measures, he said, underlining the agency’s commitment to stay and deliver, and its support for those who remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict. In many locations, such as the city of Mariupol, residents face a critical and potentially fatal shortage of food, water and medicines, he warned, noting that persons living with disabilities or serious medical conditions are particularly impacted. Against that backdrop, UNHCR is closely tracking the negotiations on safe passage and preparing to send humanitarian supplies as soon as conditions allow., TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), predicted that the war’s devastating health consequences on Ukrainians will reverberate for years or decades to come. Health services and access to basic commodities have been severely disrupted as a result of the widespread destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure — and increasingly, health facilities, he said. WHO has verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers, he noted, emphasizing: “Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law — anytime, anywhere.” And yet, “that is what we are seeing in Ukraine”, he said., The disruption of services and supplies is posing an extreme risk to people with cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV and tuberculosis, he continued, describing the ailments as among the leading causes of mortality in Ukraine. Meanwhile, displacement, poor shelter and overcrowded living conditions caused by the conflict are likely to increase the risk of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and polio. Mental health services and psychosocial support are urgently needed, he said, adding that the 35,000 mental health patients in Ukraine’s psychiatric hospitals and long-term care facilities are facing severe shortages of medicines, food, heating and blankets., He said the war is also exacerbating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the decline in testing since the start of the conflict will probably lead to “significant undetected transmission”. With less than 40 per cent of adults fully vaccinated, large numbers of people risk developing severe disease, he warned. Meanwhile, critical oxygen shortages will impact the ability to treat COVID-19 patients, he said, noting that at least eight facilities for producing and storing liquid oxygen have now closed. WHO is seeking ways to both access oxygen from neighbouring countries and deliver it safely to where it is needed, he added., On the ground, the agency is working with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and partners to help the health system provide care to meet immediate needs, he continued. So far, WHO has sent 100 metric tons of medical supplies, including oxygen, insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics and blood transfusion kits — enough for 4,500 trauma patients and 450,000 primary health-care patients, for one month, he noted. Oxygen generators, electrical generators and defibrillators have also been delivered, and WHO is preparing to send a further 108 metric tons, he added. While the agency has established supply lines from its warehouse in Lviv to many other Ukrainian cities, access challenges remain. “We have critical supplies ready for United Nations joint convoys to enter difficult areas, but so far, we have not been successful,” he said, adding that the United Nations convoy to Sumy, which includes a WHO truck carrying medical supplies, was unable to enter. Loads ready for Mariupol, meanwhile, remain in staging areas and cannot proceed, he reported, stressing that access to those and other areas is now critical., He said WHO is coordinating the deployment of 20 emergency medical teams — comprising experts from many countries — to deliver care across a range of disciplines, in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, which have been generous in welcoming refugees, but are struggling to meet their own needs. “Those needs are immense,” he stressed, citing continuity of care for basic illnesses, as well as more complex issues like cancer and renal dialysis, maternal and child health, HIV and tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, as well as mental health. Refugees, and many others who remain in Ukraine, are already very vulnerable — especially women and girls, he noted, underlining the need to make their protection against abuse and exploitation of all kinds a top priority for hosting Governments and all international organizations., Urging the Security Council to work for an immediate ceasefire and a political solution, he emphasized that prolonged conflict is in nobody’s interest. “Our ability to support and supply Ukraine’s health system is dependent on being able to fund our operations,” he said, thanking donors who front-loaded WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies, which enabled WHO to deploy more than $10 million to address immediate health needs. He called upon donors to fully fund the United Nations emergency appeal so as to sustain the response. Urging the Council not to lose sight of the world’s many other crises, he pointed to Afghanistan, which is facing widespread malnutrition and a surge in measles; Ethiopia, where the blockade of 6 million people in Tigray for almost 500 days has created a catastrophic food and health crisis; Syria, where more than 12 million people require health assistance; and Yemen, where two thirds of the population — 20 million people — requires the same. “In every case, the only solution is peace,” he said., Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said more than 3 million refugees have fled Ukraine, creating a devastating humanitarian crisis. They are mostly women and children, she added. “They stuffed their lives into backpacks and left everything they knew behind.” Many of them know that their apartment buildings and streets have been bombed to rubble. On Wednesday, a Russian bomb hit a theatre in which hundreds of civilians were hiding, she recalled, noting that local officials have told families to leave their dead relatives outside on the streets because it is too dangerous to hold funerals. The Russian Federation is inflicting terror across Ukraine and will be held accountable for its atrocities, she emphasized, adding: “President Putin, stop the killing, withdraw your forces, leave Ukraine once and for all.” Noting that President Biden pledged $800 million after President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the United States Congress on Wednesday, she expressed gratitude to all allies and partners who have opened their borders and hearts to welcome Ukrainian refugees. She went on to recall the order that the International Court of Justice issued to the Russian Federation yesterday, urging that country to comply immediately. It has breached international law by violating Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, she reiterated., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) noted that three weeks into the Russian Federation’s unprovoked illegal aggression, there have been massive civilian causalities, mass graves, ruined homes, schools and hospitals, as well as lives blown away in bombardments. He said the 3 million refugees created in three weeks is greater than his country’s entire population, warning that the risks of sexual violence and trafficking continue to mount amid continued displacement. Out of 89 attacks on health systems around the world in 2022 so far, 33 have been in Ukraine, he said, adding that it is becoming a tactic of war in that country. He went on to point out the ruling by the International Court of Justice that there is no evidence to suggest that Ukraine is committing genocide in Luhansk and Donetsk. Describing the Russian Federation’s proposed humanitarian draft resolution as a mockery worthy of Guinness World Records for hypocrisy, he declared: “Russia should not shoot first and come disguised as a doctor.” The only way to minimize humanitarian consequences for the Ukrainian population is for the Russian Federation to remove its troops and go home, he emphasized. No one should get confused by a text that is called “humanitarian”, when its only aim is to provide cover for war, he said., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said three devastating long weeks have elapsed since the start of the war, with the people of Ukraine suffering constant bombardments. President Vladimir Putin’s war is also having consequences around the world as food prices spike, leading developing countries and those suffering from other conflicts to spiral further into misery. “This is an unprovoked war of aggression waged by Russia,” she stressed, adding that Moscow alone can end it. Perversely, Moscow has now tabled a resolution calling for the protection of civilians, including women and children. “This is cynical game playing in the face of human suffering,” she stressed, adding that if the Russian Federation really wanted to protect civilians in Ukraine it would withdraw its troops and cease its bombardments today., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) affirmed that the reality on the ground in Ukraine is one of war waged for three weeks by the Russian Federation, which is also spreading chaos and exacerbating food insecurity across the world. Alongside its European partners, France will continue to mobilize for the reception of refugees and has released €100 million in humanitarian aid to support Ukrainians in need, he said. Calling on Moscow to immediately stop its bloody war, he condemned in the strongest terms the siege of several Ukrainian towns, as well as its indiscriminate bombardments targeting civilians. The Russian Federation must comply with international humanitarian law, protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure, and allow the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, he emphasized. Describing attacks on hospitals as war crimes, he also condemned the targeting of journalists, stressing that they must also be protected. He went on to express concern about reported Russian use of cluster munitions, while denouncing Moscow’s cynicism, claiming in New York to be concerned about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine even as it remains solely responsible for it., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said that since the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine three short weeks ago, there has been wanton devastation in a sovereign independent nation, with no regard for human life. To date, more than 3 million people have had to become refugees in neighbouring countries, she said, pointing out that some 90 per cent of those forced out of their homes and into uncertainty are women and children. Women and girls face heightened risk of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and trafficking, she noted. With civilian casualties in the thousands, the war’s humanitarian impact is being felt around the world, she emphasized, noting that it will affect the food security of countries heavily reliant on Ukraine’s agricultural products, including some in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. “It is a damning indictment that this Council has to plead with the Russian Federation not to deprive civilian populations of food and water,” she said. “It is a damning indictment that we cannot speak with a united voice to save innocent lives in this war.” The images from a besieged Mariupol are shocking, she continued, deploring the targeting of health-care facilities. “The residents of Mariupol are melting snow or siphoning water from heating systems to quench their thirst.” Calling upon the Russian Federation to comply with its obligations to protect civilian health-care facilities, as well as medical and humanitarian personnel, she stressed that it must also facilitate the safe passage and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, including medical and food supplies. “Surely, the most basic respect for human life must mean something to the aggressor,” she said., MONA JUUL (Norway) noted that more than 3 million civilians have crossed Ukraine’s borders into neighbouring countries seeking protection, while over 1.8 million people are displaced inside the country. They are fleeing from “the destructive power of one of the world’s biggest war machines”, she said, pointing out the Russian Federation’s indiscriminate use of explosive weapons and deplorable use of cluster bombs. Encouraging countries to keep their borders open to all those seeking safety outside Ukraine, without discrimination, she emphasized that many of those fleeing are vulnerable and at risk of sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking and other forms of exploitation. The protection of civilians and humanitarian access are not a matter of choice, but legal obligations under international humanitarian law, she stressed. “Russia, and Russia alone, bears the sole responsibility for the war, and humanitarian crisis,” she said, underlining the context in which the draft resolution presented to the Council must be understood. “Make no mistake: this is not a humanitarian resolution,” she said. Rather, it is a deliberate attempt by the aggressor to cover its unlawful military invasion of Ukraine. It has no credibility and Norway will not support it, she added, underlining that political dialogue, negotiations and mediation are the only way forward., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India), echoing expressions of concern over the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, expressed support for United Nations humanitarian activities and hope that the international community will continue to respond positively to humanitarian needs, including by generously supporting the Secretary-General’s Flash Appeal and the Regional Refugee Response Plan on Ukraine. India has sent more than 90 tons of humanitarian supplies to Ukraine and its neighbours since 1 March and will continue to identify needs with a view to sending further supplies in the coming days, he said. India has also ensured the safe return of some 22,500 of its nationals and those of 18 other countries from Ukraine, he added. Emphasizing that humanitarian action must always be guided by the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence — which must never be politicized — he reiterated calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the path of dialogue and diplomacy., KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) called on the Russian Federation to ensure an unconditional and immediate ceasefire and to withdraw all its invading troops from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders. “The cessation of hostilities is critical to save lives,” she said, expressing deep concern over the disproportionate use of unconventional munitions in bombarding Ukraine’s cities and civilian areas. The parties must urgently commit to a humanitarian pause to enable the evacuation and safe passage of civilians and facilitate the delivery of food and medicine. She deplored the attacks on medical facilities and called for the protection of humanitarian workers and medical personnel. She said parties must comply with their commitments under international law, in particular, the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in the Time of War. Stressing that the Secretary-General’s good offices should be leveraged to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, she said the safety of Ukraine’s people must be at the forefront of the Council’s actions., CHRISTOPHE NANGA (Gabon) noted the intensification of fighting and the deterioration of the living and health conditions of those remaining in Ukraine. He went on to underscore his concern over the increased risk of disease because of the disruption of basic services. He called on all parties to ensure respect and protection for populations, including African nationals, as well as medical and humanitarian personnel. He reiterated the importance of opening up safe humanitarian corridors. Saving lives must come before any political consideration. All diplomatic options must be considered, he said., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya) described as “deeply concerning” the reported loss of life, forced displacement and separation of loved ones, citing the millions of refugees from Ukraine in just three weeks. Commending Ukraine’s neighbours for opening their borders to refugees of multiple nationalities and urging them to ensure that the protections sought are offered with no discrimination, particularly as related to race or religion, she condemned the targeting and destruction of residential homes, hospitals and shelters. “The parties are obliged to comply with international humanitarian law, as well as resolution 2573 (2021),” on protecting objects indispensable to the survival of civilians, she insisted. Civilians, including foreign nationals in Ukraine, are not party to the conflict and must not be a target. The imperative that humanitarian passages are open and functional at all times cannot be overstated, and she underscored the urgent need for a humanitarian resolution that reflects the Council’s unity and the resolve to assist the people of Ukraine. She urged the parties to ensure a humanitarian pause and to create room for diplomacy and dialogue, including through the Secretary-General’s good offices. “The whole world has an interest in the urgent resolution of this armed conflict,” she said, pointing to increased food, fertilizer and oil prices already being felt in multiple countries. If not quickly prevented, this trend — and the effects of unilateral sanctions — will exacerbate State fragilities and fuel conflicts, especially in the global South., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) expressed concern over the growing number of civilian casualties, including children, as well as the increasing flows of refugees and internally displaced people. Supply chains have been disrupted and access to medical facilities impaired, with medical supplies running low and stockpiles out of reach, he noted. In response to those pressing needs, Brazilians sent a donation to Ukraine last week, consisting of water purifiers, 9 tons of foods and half a ton of medical items, he reported. Describing the 31 WHO-verified attacks on health-care facilities as distressing, he said they constitute violations of international humanitarian law. He went on to reiterate Brazil’s call for an immediate cessation of hostilities as the main condition needed to guarantee the passage of civilians from conflict zones to safe areas., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the assessments of Western States are based on Ukraine’s hyped campaign of lies and disinformation, which is reaching new heights. Today, there is a new slew of accusations that the Russian Federation is not allowing refugees to leave the infamous maternity hospital in Mariupol, that it shelled the Sultan Suleiman mosque in Mariupol and that it used automatic weapons to fire at a bread line in Chernihiv, he said, emphasizing that those assertions have been repeatedly refuted. To claims by the representative of the United States that the WHO Director-General said the Russian Federation bombed 33 hospitals, he said: “Please ask him. He did not say this,” clarifying that, in his understanding, it is not within WHO rules to attribute who conducted a strike against a medical facility. In fact, the Russian Federation has many questions about who is at fault, he said., He went on to recall that, in 2014 and 2015, when “Ukrainian warmongers” threw planes and tanks against people in the east, Mariupol was a centre of resistance in the Donetsk people’s republic. Its people almost unanimously supported independence, speaking out against the Kyiv regime, he said, adding: “Ukrainian Nazis cannot forget or forgive that.” Instead, they drowned the city in blood. Meanwhile, the Mariupol airport had an infamous jail and torture centre, he asserted. “This is neo-Nazism. That is why Ukrainian radicals are clinging to the city, standing ready to drag into the grave the entire population, like the Nazis in Berlin in 1945,” he said. “They hold citizens as human shields and place heavy weapons next to residences, in violation of international humanitarian law.”, It is no surprise that Mariupol has become a lead manufacturer of “fakes”, the most egregious of which is that a Russian missile destroyed the maternity hospital, he continued, noting that his delegation conveyed information on that matter in a letter to the Secretary-General. A second fake is that the Russian Federation allegedly hit the Mariupol theatre, he said, pointing out, however, that on 13 March, widely available public information stated that Azov was holding people there and preparing a bloody provocation. Russian armed forces were informed about the situation, he said, insisting that “the theatre was never considered as a target for a strike”., He went on to describe claims that the Russian Federation is forcing the people of Mariupol and other towns into its own territory as “a bare-faced lie”, clarifying that since the start of the operation, the Defence Ministry has received 2.5 million requests for evacuation into his country, but Ukrainian authorities have been preventing the evacuations. It has ensured the evacuation of 31,000 civilians, including 89 foreign nationals, he said, adding that, of that total, only 36 people moved to the Kyiv-controlled areas of a certain oblast. The humanitarian operation was conducted by the Donetsk people’s republic and the Russian armed forces, without any participation from Ukraine, he emphasized., To Western capitals providing Kyiv with weapons, he said: “You are fuelling this conflict.” He noted with regret that Ukraine was always a pawn in the geopolitical struggle against the Russian Federation, stressing that the West “could not care less” about the suffering in Donbas. Describing the draft resolution sponsored by France and Mexico as “full of political formulas that have nothing to do with humanitarian issues”, he said the Russian Federation has submitted its own draft, which does not contain political assessments, but is being told that it is “not something that satisfies Western countries”, revealing the hypocrisy and cynicism. Noting that Council colleagues speak of arm-twisting, blackmail and threats by Western countries, he said that while his delegations is not requesting a vote on its draft, it will not withdraw the text either. Rather, it will request an emergency Council meeting on Friday to discuss biolaboratories in Ukraine, using new documents it obtained during its special military operation, he added., ZHANG JUN (China), deploring the increase in civilian casualties, called for their urgent protection and for the prevention of a larger-scale humanitarian crisis. He called for an unimpeded humanitarian corridor, emphasizing that all refugees, regardless of origin or race, must be permitted safe passage. Noting that Moscow and Kyiv have held four rounds of negotiations to date, he said that as long as talks continue, “there is a chance for a ceasefire and a peaceful future”. Urging all parties “not to add fuel to the fire”, he also warned against the wanton imposition of sanctions, stressing that they will not solve the problem but only further undermine global supply chains, harming people around the world., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) warned that the needs of people unable to leave or be evacuated from urban areas under siege, especially those lacking access to safe drinking water, food and medicines, have increased and will continue to do so. There is an urgent need to ensure safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian and medical personnel, he said, noting that WHO has recorded 43 attacks on medical installations. Emphasizing that attacking health installations is expressly forbidden under international humanitarian law, he also condemned attacks on medical personnel and the equipment they need to do their work. Noting that the International Court of Justice has ordered the immediate suspension of military operations, he said the cessation of hostilities is the fundamental premise for humanitarian assistance. The Council is unable to issue an unequivocal call for an end to hostilities, he said, stressing that such a call would be the most significant humanitarian support that the Ukraine’s civilian population could receive., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), President of the Security Council, speaking in his national capacity, said that the number of refugees is increasing at an alarming rate as civilians continue to suffer due to the obstacles hindering the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Damage to civilian infrastructure continues to exacerbate the humanitarian situation in major cities, he added. Expressing hope that the ongoing negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine will pave the way for calm and allow humanitarian organizations to meet the needs of civilians, he said concrete steps are also needed to de-escalate the situation and build trust. He also recognized the need to support countries taking in refugees, especially since the conflict entails successive waves of displacement. It is important to adhere to international law, in particular international humanitarian law, he emphasized, warning that violating it is a threat to the international order. A solution to the crisis can only be achieved by intensifying diplomatic efforts., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor for a second time, said she was momentarily pleased to hear that “the Russians were pulling down the vote on their farcical humanitarian resolution, which was doomed to fail”. She emphasized that if Moscow truly cares about the humanitarian crisis it has created, it could simply stop its attacks on the people of Ukraine. Instead, it calls for another Security Council meeting as “a venue for its disinformation and for promoting its propaganda”, she noted, reiterating that the Russian Federation is the aggressor and is creating a pretext for an attack. The Council can’t be fooled by its efforts, she stressed, pointing out that its troops “are killing people inside of Ukraine”. That is the reason for the Council to meet, not to deal with Moscow’s propaganda, she said., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) reminded the Council, including the delegate in “the permanent seat of the Soviet Union”, that President Vladimir Putin said on 16 March, three weeks after the unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, that “the operation is developing successfully and in strict accordance with plans that have been previously approved”. Questioning why the Russian Federation has behaved like the Nazi Third Reich by attacking its neighbour and plunging the region into war, he drew attention to the killing of Ukrainian children, numbering 108 innocent souls thus far. “Children are a deliberate target,” he said, citing the 16 March attack on the Mariupol theatre by a Russian aerial bomb., All civilians and foreign citizens are under threat, he said, citing the 726 civilian killings confirmed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, while emphasizing that the real figures are higher. “The plan is to raze Ukrainian cities to the ground,” he said, pointing out that 90 per cent of Mariupol’s infrastructure has been destroyed. Plans to violate the ceasefire and safe civilian passage are being carried out, he added, recalling that on 16 March, the Russian Federation shelled a convoy of civilian vehicles, killing five people. The plan was to terrorize local residents in territories seized by Russian troops, he said, accusing Russians of breaking into houses, throwing people into the streets and taking their food. They engage in torture, local abductions and extrajudicial killings, forcing some 3.2 million refugees to leave Ukraine, he said., Against that backdrop, the Russian Federation dared to submit a humanitarian resolution, he continued, describing that “outrageous” effort as “an appeal by a serial killer” while cautioning: “Never trust a dog to watch your food.” Emphasizing the urgent need for humanitarian action, he called upon countries to support efforts in the General Assembly and to join the Friends of Accountability — co-founded by Albania, Colombia, Denmark, Marshall Islands, Netherlands and Ukraine — which will act as a forum for the promotion of accountability in Ukraine following the Russian military aggression., He went on to recall that, despite the binding order by the International Court of Justice on 16 March that the Russian Federation immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine, launched on 24 February, the Kremlin stated today that it cannot take the order into account as there is no “agreement” between the two sides. Encouraging the Council to exercise its duties under Article 94.2 of the Charter of the United Nations, he urged it to decide on measures related to the Russian Federation’s failure to uphold its obligations. Its military aggression and mass atrocities, ordered by President Putin and defended by Moscow’s diplomats, will be examined for years by experts in psychiatry, theology and other disciplines, he said, asking: “Do the eyes of Ukrainian children, women and elderly killed by the Russians flash before you?” He went on to note that Italy is ready to rebuild the theatre in Mariupol., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland), noting that the Council is meeting against the backdrop of the fastest-growing humanitarian and refugee crisis since the Second World War, described the Russian Federation’s brutal actions in Ukraine as “100 per cent a war of choice”. Earlier today, he noted, Moscow rejected an order by the International Court of Justice, the highest tribunal of the United Nations, to cease its attack. Urging the Russian Federation to change its military modus operandi and allow full and unimpeded humanitarian access and relief to those in need, he spotlighted the situation in the city of Mariupol, where some 350,000 residents remain trapped as food, water and medicines dry up. Poland has seen first-hand the dramatic humanitarian consequences of the war and will continue to admit refugees in a spirit of solidarity, regardless of their nationality, race or religious creed, he said., For information media.

Update 24 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (17 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,17 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that all safety systems at the country’s largest nuclear power plant remained fully functional a day after the site lost connection to a third external power line linking it to the national electricity grid, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Two off-site power lines, including one on standby, are still available to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and there are no safety concerns, Ukraine’s regulatory authority added., The NPP has four high voltage (750 kV) power lines plus one on standby. Two of the four were damaged earlier. The Ukrainian regulator said it was still not clear what had caused yesterday’s loss of the third line, but that the two remaining ensure the safe operation of the plant. Like other NPPs in Ukraine and other parts of the world, the plant also has back-up diesel generators in case they are needed., On 4 March, Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya NPP. Of its six reactors, two are currently operating. The regulator later today said they had decreased their power generation to 500 Megawatts electric (Mwe) each – about half of their maximum capacity – after a break in an on-site power line that will be repaired for a planned reconnection at 21:00 CET this evening. The regulator did not say what had caused the break in this internal line at the site., The regulator said officials from Russia’s state nuclear power company Rosatom were still present at the NPP in southern Ukraine, but that the highly qualified Ukrainian staff continued to operate the plant. Ukraine has not requested any advisory, technical, or other support from the Russian Federation, it added., In northern Ukraine, the Chornobyl NPP remained connected to the national electricity grid three days after engineers succeeded in resuming regular power supplies to this Russian-controlled site, the regulator said. The site of the 1986 accident lost all off-site power on 9 March and turned to diesel generators for back-up power. Ukrainian specialists repaired one of the two damaged lines a few days later and external electricity deliveries resumed on 14 March., Russian forces took control of the Chornobyl NPP on 24 February. Ukrainian staff have continued to manage day-to-day operations at the site, where radioactive waste management facilities are located. They have not been able to rotate for more than three weeks., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plants, the Ukrainian regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including the two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range, it said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported earlier this week. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine., Director General Grossi said he is continuing his consultations with a view to agree a framework on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. “With this agreement in place, the Agency would be able to provide effective technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of these facilities,” he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-24-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-17-march-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",18 Mar 2022,"(Vienna, March 18, 2022) – Vital resources such as water have long been in short supply in eastern Ukraine. With the start of the war, the situation has worsened considerably. Countless water pipes have been damaged by the fighting. It is almost impossible to repair them – the danger from constant shelling is too great. Meanwhile, many places in eastern Ukraine have been completely cut off from the water supply., “In addition to the ongoing danger from attacks, Ukrainian civilians must cope with increasingly scarce vital resources. Water has become a highly contested commodity. People are dehydrated, they have to collect rainwater or resort to melting snow,” says Andrea Barschdorf-Hager, executive director of CARE Austria., CARE’s partner organization “People in Need” has sent a loaded truck full of water containers directly from the Czech Republic. More trucks will follow shortly. In many parts of the country there are wells with water, but hardly any possibilities to store the water. Therefore, containers are provided to store water from underground wells and reservoirs. In places where there are no local water sources, drinking bottles are distributed or tankers are sent., Seven trains carrying food, hygiene items, sleeping bags, mattresses and medical aid have already arrived in the city of Dnipro. Other relief supplies have been transported in trucks to Kharkiv, the Donetsk region and other places in the east. As soon as the humanitarian corridor is open, relief supplies will be sent to the hard-pressed port city of Mariupol., CARE and “People in Need” are supplying the dozens of collective shelters in the west with blankets, sleeping bags, mattresses, kitchen utensils, stoves, pots, food, baby food and hygiene kits. A psychosocial counseling center has also been established. Through it, affected people can talk to specialized personnel. A mobile counseling team is also available to visit remote locations, for example., “Many of the people in the collective shelters have experienced significant trauma. They have been forced to hide from attacks. They have said goodbye to loved ones or witnessed violence and the suffering that goes with it,” Barschdorf-Hager said., CARE in Ukraine: CARE is supporting its local partner organization “People in Need” in providing warm and safe spaces for refugees at border crossings, as well as sending durable food, sleeping bags, diapers and other essential supplies to Ukraine., For More Information:, Dorissa White

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, After three weeks of active hostilities, civilian casualties have risen to 2,032, including 780 killed, according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)., On 16 March, Mariupol’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre (Donetska oblast, east) – where more than 1,000 people have reportedly sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities, including pregnant women and children – suffered extensive damages after allegedly being hit by a bomb. Unconfirmed preliminary reports suggest that the bomb shelter withstood the powerful blast, as people are now being pulled out of the rubble., As of 17 March, in Luhanska oblast (east), active hostilities continue in the city of Rubizhne, where around 20 homes were destroyed overnight. Across the oblast, authorities report that around 35,000 users have been cut off from gas supplies, while nearly 104,000 remain without electricity., As millions of people are now on the move, forced to shelter in crowded spaces with limited sanitation facilities and access to health services, the risk of infectious disease outbreaks continues to rise. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that nearly half of all attacks on health systems across the globe so far this year –43 out of 89 – have occurred in Ukraine., In eastern Ukraine, shortages in safe drinking water have long been a problem that ongoing hostilities have only exacerbated. Damaged water infrastructure remains unrepaired as constant shelling and growing insecurity make it virtually impossible to carry out vital repair works, forcing people with limited or no access to water to resort to catching rainwater or melted snow., SITUATION OVERVIEW, After three weeks of active hostilities, civilian casualties and damage to critical infrastructure continue to accumulate as intense clashes reach new localities across the country. In traditional hotspots, like eastern Ukraine, fighting continues to escalate, leaving affected people with little respite., As of 16 March, OHCHR reports 2,032 civilian casualties, including 780 killed, figures that are likely much higher than officially reported and will only continue to grow as fighting rages on. These include854 reported casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (162 killed and 472 injured in Government-controlled areas (GCA), and 46 killed and 174 injured in nonGovernment-controlled areas (NGCA) and 1,178 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the southern city of Mariupol continues to be the biggest concern. Yesterday, 16 March, brought some respite to the city ravaged by hostilities as nearly 6,500 people, including more than 2,000 children, safely evacuated to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east). However, according to authorities, private cars attempting to evacuate Mariupol came under fire, injuring at least five civilians, including a child. This incident reinforces the need for safe and secure evacuation corridors for civilians and humanitarian goods to be agreed to and respected by both sides., Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported it has so far evacuated 283,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia, including 12,000 persons during the past 24 hours. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister/Minister for Reintegration Iryna Vereshchuk announced that humanitarian convoys stalled outside Mariupol have yet again failed to reach the encircled city with the life-saving relief supplies that hundreds of thousands of people still trapped there desperately need. Ms. Vereshchuk added that the relief supplies were unloaded in Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast) to provide much-needed support to people fleeing Mariupol. Inside the city, however, the situation continues to worsen. People still lack access to the most basic supplies, including safe water, food and essential medicines., On 16 March, Mariupol’s Drama Theatre and Neptune sports centre – where more than 1,000 people reportedly sought shelter amid ongoing hostilities, including pregnant women and children – suffered extensive damages after allegedly being hit by a bomb. As intense clashes persisted, search-and-rescue crews were unable to reach affected people in the immediate aftermath, with the entrance to the theatre’s bomb shelter blocked by piles of rubble. Unconfirmed preliminary reports suggest that the bomb shelter withstood the powerful blast, as people are now being pulled out of the rubble. At the time of writing, however, the civilian toll has yet to be confirmed by oblast authorities., In neighbouring Luhanska oblast, active hostilities continue in the city of Rubizhne, where around 20 homes were destroyed overnight. Across the oblast, authorities report that around 35,000 users have been cut off from gas supplies in more than 20 settlements, while nearly 104,000 users remain without electricity in nearly 40 settlements. In Popasna and Zolote (Luhanska oblast), water supplies have been partially disrupted, while the settlements of Novotoshkivka, Nyzhne and Nyzhne-1 (also in Luhanska oblast) remain completely cut off from access to safe water. Due to the lack of electricity and limited water supplies, centralized heating has been interrupted in Lysychansk (Luhanska oblast) – where more than 10 boiler houses are no longer operational – and in at least 180 multi-apartment buildings in Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast), as temperatures dip below freezing., In eastern Ukraine, shortages of safe drinking water have long been a problem that has only been exacerbated by ongoing hostilities. In many localities, damaged water infrastructure remains unrepaired as constant shelling and growing insecurity make it virtually impossible to carry out vital repair works, forcing people with limited or no access to water to resort to catching rainwater or melted snow. International non-governmental organization (INGO) People in Need (PIN) continues to provide safe drinking water by tanker to villages and towns whose water supply systems have been damaged while also providing jerry cans filled with water and containers for people with access to wells and reservoirs to store water., The recent escalation in hostilities across Ukraine has forcibly displaced nearly 4.9 million people, with 1.85 million new internally displaced persons (IDPs) and more than 3 million people fleeing across international borders. As millions are now on the move, forced to shelter in crowded spaces with limited sanitation facilities and access to health services, the risk of infectious disease outbreaks, including tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases, continues to rise. The prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis in Ukraine ranks among the highest across Europe, while last year’s polio outbreak in western Ukraine highlighted the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the country., With only 37 per cent of the population having received two jabs of the COVID-19 vaccine – one of the lowest rates in Europe – Doctors Without Borders warns of the possibility of a new wave of COVID-19 potentially overwhelming the health system. The continuation and expansion of vaccination campaigns, including for polio, measles and COVID-19, and strengthened surveillance for priority infectious diseases, will be critical to prevent outbreaks that could bring an alreadystrained health care system to its knees at a time when needs are greatest., WHO says that nearly half of all attacks on health systems across the globe so far this year –43 out of 89 – have occurred in Ukraine. More than 300 health facilities are located in areas experiencing active hostilities or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces, while 600 facilities are within 10 km of ongoing clashes, leaving the health system particularly vulnerable to infrastructural damages and severe interruptions in critical services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-17-march-2022-enruuk

DiCarlo: Meaningful Sustained Political Process Needed for Peaceful Settlement in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"Mister President,, Daily attacks continue to batter Ukrainian cities. Many are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure., Between 24 February and 15 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded 1,900 civilian casualties. The total consists of 726 people killed, including 52 children, and 1,174 injured, including 63 children. The actual number is likely much higher., Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools., OHCHR continues to monitor reports of civilian casualties in the whole country, including in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed “Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics”. OHCHR staff in Donetsk are closely following developments regarding the 14 March incident in which 20 civilians were reportedly killed by a Tochka-U missile that may have contained cluster munitions. All such instances must be properly investigated., It is the responsibility of all sides to fully abide by their obligations to protect the lives of all civilians everywhere., OHCHR is gravely concerned about reports of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of civilians, local authorities and civil society activists in Russian-controlled areas. We call for their immediate release., Mister President,, This week, there were positive signals reported regarding the ongoing direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives., We welcome all such engagements., However, we note that these signals have so far not translated into the cessation of hostilities that is so desperately needed., The situation in the southeastern port city of Mariupol is particularly alarming., Many of the Mariupol residents who have not been able to safely evacuate lack food, water, electricity and medical care. Uncollected corpses lie on city streets., Yesterday’s strike on the Mariupol theater, which reportedly served as a bomb shelter for displaced civilians, adds to the list of attacks against civilian structures. While early reports indicate that the worst may have been avoided, ongoing fighting is hampering the rescue work and assessment of the situation., Mister President,, The devastation and suffering in Mariupol and Kharkiv raise grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks., International humanitarian law is crystal clear. Civilians are entitled to protection against the dangers arising from military operations. Direct attacks on civilians are prohibited., Yet, the magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. This demands a thorough investigation and accountability., Mister President,, The priority for the UN and its partners is to reach the people trapped by the ongoing shelling, including in eastern Ukraine. To that end, we continue to scale-up our operations on the ground, as circumstances permit., The needs of the population are growing by the day. The UN calls for safe passage for civilians from, and humanitarian supplies into, encircled areas., We are grateful to neighbouring governments for their generosity in receiving refugees and enabling the provision of assistance to Ukraine., The UN is requesting all donors to fast-track funding against pledges made toward the Ukraine Flash Appeal. The Appeal, which seeks $1.1 billion to help 12 million people in need, is 36 per cent funded., Mister President,, UNDP projects that 90% of the Ukrainian population could be facing poverty and extreme economic vulnerability should the war continue, setting the country – and the region – back decades, and leaving deep social and economic scars., As the Secretary-General highlighted, dangerous ripple effects of the conflict are already being felt across the globe., Russia and Ukraine represent more than half of the world’s supply of sunflower oil and about 30 percent of the world’s wheat. Food, fuel and fertilizer prices are skyrocketing. Supply chains are being disrupted., All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and potentially creating instability around the globe., The Secretary-General announced on 14 March the establishment of a Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to lead an effort with Member States to deal with the complex fallout of the war. The Deputy Secretary-General will lead an inter-agency steering committee with partners to oversee this effort., Mister President,, The Secretary-General welcomes all ongoing diplomatic contacts. He remains actively engaged with leaders who are trying to bring about an end to this war., There will be no winners to this senseless conflict. The tremendous loss it is causing, on the other hand, is heartbreakingly clear. And it is going to get much, much worse the longer the fighting continues. The Secretary-General urges intensified and coordinated political efforts for an immediate cessation of hostilities., There must be a meaningful sustained political process to enable a peaceful settlement. The lives of millions of Ukrainians and the peace and security of the entire region, and possibly beyond, depend on it., Thank you, Mr. President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dicarlo-meaningful-sustained-political-process-needed-peaceful-settlement-ukraine

Ukraine: Displaced twice by war and on the road again,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"An MSF staff member in Ukraine shares his story, As dawn broke on February 24 in Kyiv, I woke to the sound of explosions and the wails of air raid sirens. Huddled in my little apartment in the city, I felt sick with anxiety. I knew instantly that, from then on, my life and the lives of so many others would never be the same. Something irreversible had just happened: the glimmer of hope which many of us had kept alive despite the rising fear of an imminent war had been violently smothered., I grew up amid the flat lands and coal heaps of what is today eastern Ukraine. A big family, in a three-room flat, we spent many laughter-filled evenings over Olivier salads and borscht. After studying at the international language school at Gorlivka, I left Ukraine for the United States. The pull of my family eventually drew me back to my country., War broke out in 2014 and I was forced to move to Kyiv, where I registered as an ‘internally displaced person’. I slowly found my feet in the city, working for civil society organizations, and later becoming active in a global coalition to fight poverty. I eventually made my way to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). With MSF’s focus on improving health care access in eastern Ukraine, I saw an opportunity to retain links with a region I remained profoundly attached to, even as I continued to live in Kyiv., The tragedy of eastern Ukraine has now befallen the whole country. In an extremely short time, millions of people have been forced to leave their homes. Many are displaced within Ukraine and some two million have become refugees in neighbouring countries. From where I am staying now, they are all around me., And now war is back—this time fiercer, more brutal, and with a force, I fear, will leave us all scarred., I now find myself displaced again. As war hit Kyiv hard with intense airstrikes and street fighting, I took the painful decision to leave. I had remained in the city as, from the very first day of war, hundreds of thousands fled. For a few days, all I could hear was the piercing sounds of shelling, rockets and artillery. Then one day, my colleagues called me, saying that one of the last humanitarian convoys would soon be leaving Kyiv. I panicked. It felt as if the city had been emptied of human life. I hurriedly stuffed a few clothes into a bag, grabbed the most important documents, took my car, and left Kyiv., I am now on the road, a tiny speck in a vast, unending caravan of people crowding into western Ukraine. I feel lost and disoriented, angry at this horrendous war, aghast at the senseless suffering inflicted on people. I dread what comes next., Still, I feel luckier than many of my colleagues in eastern Ukraine who are currently living through hell. The siege of Mariupol fills me with rage; Volnovakha is a ghost town, pummeled with shelling. Schools, hospitals and houses have suffered damages. All the progress made in eastern Ukraine in the years since the 2014 war now lies in ruins., Of late, eastern Ukraine had been working to solidify its institutions and strengthen its public services. Even aid organizations were moving away from providing humanitarian aid to offering development support. MSF had moved away from providing health services directly to supporting the health system to improve access to health care. We supported a network of community health volunteers to assist people living in remote villages—many of them elderly—receive swift diagnosis and treatment and help with getting medicines from pharmacies., In a dramatically changed landscape, the work I was doing with MSF earlier is no longer possible. Many of my colleagues find themselves in the same situation. But even in the most trying circumstances, they have been working hard to provide emergency medical assistance., I want to do more to support. But I am caught in a maelstrom, where the usual certainties of life have collapsed around me. It will take enormous resilience to recover from the sheer force of what has struck us., Aleksandr Burmin (name changed) is an MSF staff member in Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-displaced-twice-war-and-road-again
MSF helps major hospital in Kyiv prepare for potential increase in casualties,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,17 Mar 2022,"**BRUSSELS/LVIV, Ukraine, March 17, 2022—**On March 13 and 14, a surgical team from Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) visited the 750-bed Okhmatdyt pediatric hospital in central Kyiv to provide training and advice related to trauma surgery and the management of mass casualty events., An experienced MSF vascular surgeon assisted in the operating room and advised surgeons about approaches to war-trauma surgery., “Our surgeon did one quite delicate operation, and straight afterwards the surgeons in the hospital came and proactively asked to be trained on those techniques,” said Anja Wolz, MSF emergency coordinator in Ukraine. “Most of the surgeons in this hospital are specialists but they do not have trauma surgeons. So they have not had experience doing significant debridement [wound cleaning] which is essential for bullet and shrapnel wounds. If a bullet or shrapnel wound is not dealt with quickly or correctly infection can set in fast and it requires some experience to know how to approach this type of surgery—to ensure the wound is effectively cleaned and will heal properly, and to avoid further infection.”, With curfews, frequent bomb-alert sirens and staff sheltering in bunkers and having difficulties to travel to the hospital, the hospital's usual 2,000 personnel has reduced to a core team of around 200. The hospital has discharged or referred elsewhere most of the former patients and the staff are focused on the treatment of people with trauma wounds. At the time of the MSF team’s visit, the hospital staff was receiving several wounded patients per day and expected the numbers to increase., To help the hospital prepare for mass casualty events— the simultaneous arrival of multiple trauma patients—an MSF emergency room doctor provided classroom training for 40 of the hospital’s staff. The training included best practices such as changes to the way patients are received by the hospital in the event of a large influx., While assisting in the operating room, MSF’s vascular surgeon provided hands-on training in rapid lifesaving trauma stabilization and surgery, such as removal of bullets or shrapnel, preventing internal bleeding, effective wound-cleaning and other core essentials of trauma-surgery., The hospital requested advice on how to manage their supply lines and organization of the essential supplies to be able to manage high numbers of war-trauma patients over an extended period. The MSF team assessed the quantities of supplies the hospital has, and made recommendations about continued supply of war-trauma essentials., “We intend if possible to return soon to build on what we could do in the first short visit,” said Wolz. “We have not been able to fully finalize the mass casualty training and there is more to do to help map out the best patient pathways in case of simultaneous arrival of large numbers of casualties. We also want to continue looking into the hospital’s supply chains. These are some of the principal things that the hospital has asked for. We would also like to do more hands-on training and advice for the surgeons—practical bedside and operating theater training.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/msf-helps-major-hospital-kyiv-prepare-potential-increase-casualties
Ukraine: Briefing on Humanitarian Developments,News and Press Release,Security Council Report,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"This afternoon (17 March), the Security Council will hold a briefing on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The meeting was requested by Albania, France, Ireland, Norway, the UK, and the US. Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, Assistant High Commissioner for Operations at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Raouf Mazou, and Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus are expected to brief. Ukraine is expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure., This will be the fifth time that the Council has held a briefing on the situation in Ukraine since Russia launched its military assault on 24 February. Previous meetings addressed the humanitarian situation (on 28 February and 7 March), the safety of nuclear sites (on 4 March), and allegations about military biological activities (on 11 March). (For more information, see our 5** March** and 11 March What's in Blue stories.) In addition, developments in Ukraine were a significant focus of the 14 March briefing on the activities of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). (For more information, see our 13 MarchWhat's in Blue story.), Three weeks into Russia's military offensive, Ukraine faces a dire humanitarian crisis. Intensified attacks have led to a surge in casualties and humanitarian needs across the country. As at 15 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had documented 1,900 civilian casualties, including 726 deaths, while noting that true figures are likely to be considerably higher, as many reported casualties have yet to be confirmed. Most casualties have been attributed to the use of explosive weapons with a wide-impact area, such as shelling from heavy artillery, the use of multiple rocket launch systems, and air attacks., According to media reports, Russian forces have increasingly relied on long-range artillery and other forms of shelling and bombardment to circumvent Ukraine's entrenched defences. At the 14 March OSCE briefing, DiCarlo cited credible reports received by OHCHR of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas., According to a 16 March OCHA humanitarian impact situation report, heavy fighting in major cities such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv, as well as in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, has left hundreds of thousands of people without water and electricity. Food and medical supplies have become particularly depleted in cities under heavy bombardment, such as Mariupol and Volnovakha. A growing number of people have been left stranded in cities under siege, as breached ceasefires and repeated delays in establishing safe passage corridors have impeded mass evacuations in certain areas., OCHA estimates that over 350,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, despite a 15 March evacuation corridor that allowed roughly 20,000 people to flee the city. Yesterday (16 March), Russian forces bombed a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were taking shelter. Following the incident, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said that many civilians were trapped under the debris, and accused Russia of committing ""another war crime""., Since the conflict erupted on 24 February, two million people have been internally displaced and three million people---nearly half of whom are children---have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries., Russian and Ukrainian delegations continue holding virtual talks aimed at finding a negotiated solution to the crisis. According to media reports, the sides discussed a 15-point plan on 14 March. The plan reportedly contains guarantees on Ukraine's neutral status, including a pledge that it would not seek NATO membership or host foreign military bases or weaponry within its territory, in exchange for security guarantees from Ukraine's allies, including Turkey, the UK and the US. Following the 14 March meeting, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov said that there are ""specific wordings that are close to being agreed""., At today's briefing, DiCarlo is expected to reiterate the UN's call for an immediate ceasefire. She is likely to commend both parties for their continued diplomatic engagement and for securing recently brokered temporary humanitarian pauses. Noting the high human costs of the conflict, DiCarlo may stress that indiscriminate attacks, including the use of cluster munitions, are prohibited under international humanitarian law. She is also expected to provide an update on the UN's humanitarian efforts in the country and urge member states to contribute to the Ukraine Flash Appeal, which was launched on 1 March by Secretary-General António Guterres to address the most urgent humanitarian needs in Ukraine., Mazou is expected to provide an overview of the situation facing the two million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and three million refugees that have fled Ukraine since the fighting began. In this regard, he may praise Ukraine's neighbouring countries for receiving Ukrainian citizens and foreign nationals fleeing the conflict. According to UNHCR, Poland has received over 1.8 million refugees---a number equal to the population of its capital, Warsaw., Council members may be interested in hearing more about the work carried out by UNHCR and other humanitarian organisations to support refugees upon their arrival in host countries and ensure their safety. At a 14 March press briefing, Guterres noted that ""for predators and human traffickers, war is not a tragedy"" but rather an opportunity, and ""women and children are the targets"". Council members may also wish to learn from Mazou about UNHCR's efforts aimed at ensuring the safe passage of foreign nationals. Thus far, over 157,000 third-country nationals have fled Ukraine., Tedros is expected to highlight the effects of the conflict on medical services and access to those services in Ukraine and call on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, including the protection of medical personnel and critical infrastructure. Since 24 February, the WHO's Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) has documented 49 attacks on healthcare facilities. As at 11 March, the WHO had verified 46 casualties, including 12 deaths, related to such attacks. On 9 March, Tedros stressed that ""these attacks deprive whole communities of health care"". In this regard, he is likely to emphasise today that supply chains have been severely disrupted and that several stockpiles remain inaccessible because of the ongoing fighting. He may also note that medical supplies are running low and that hospitals are struggling to provide adequate care to those in need of medical assistance. Tedros is also expected to outline the WHO's efforts to provide support to the healthcare systems of refugee hosting countries., Several Council members are expected to reiterate calls for the immediate cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians and humanitarian and medical personnel, and safe and unfettered humanitarian access. Some members are likely to condemn Russia's invasion as the principal source of the humanitarian crisis. On the other hand, Russia is likely to question reports of civilian casualties and damage to healthcare facilities resulting from its military operations. It is also expected to urge Council members not to politicise the humanitarian crisis., Many Council members may raise concerns over the effects of the conflict on food insecurity and on the global economy. According to a 16 March UNDP report, the conflict in Ukraine risks reducing 90 percent of the Ukrainian population to poverty, reversing almost two decades of socio-economic progress in the country and region. At the 14 March press briefing, Guterres noted that 45 African and least-developed countries import at least a third of their wheat from Ukraine or Russia, and warned that ""we must do everything possible to avert a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system"". The conflict will affect the global economy, he said, ""especially in the developing world"", as food, fuel and fertilizer prices increase, supply chains are disrupted, and the costs and delays of transportation of imported goods reach record levels., For two weeks up until Monday (14 March), Council members had been negotiating a draft Security Council resolution proposed by France and Mexico on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. Members expressed sharply divided views on the proposed text. It seems that while many members underlined the need for the text explicitly to reference Russia's role in bringing about the humanitarian crisis and call for a ceasefire, Moscow strongly opposed such references. On 14 March, France and Mexico announced that they would instead pursue a General Assembly resolution addressing the humanitarian situation in Ukraine., On Tuesday (15 March), Russia placed in blue its own draft resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, which is expected to be voted on tomorrow morning (18 March). A separate What's in Blue story will describe developments relating to tomorrow's vote.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-briefing-humanitarian-developments

ICRC President: The suffering in Mariupol must not become the future of Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,17 Mar 2022,"The following is a statement from Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who is currently in Ukraine:, Kyiv (ICRC) – Driving toward Kyiv this week, the signs of conflict grew. First, lines of cars leaving, then bombed buildings, and finally an eerily silent capital city. We met a doctor who moved his wife and son into his hospital in Kyiv after their apartment was destroyed. The doctor continued his work as his son attended school online. New, heartbreaking images from Mariupol further underscored that the toll of conflict is heaviest on civilians., I am in Kyiv this week to make an urgent plea to the parties to this conflict. They are the ones who can act now to bring real respite to civilians and people no longer involved in the fight., I appeal to the parties to take every chance to build on small steps to alleviate suffering, like the glimmer of hope we saw this week in Sumy, when neutral humanitarians from the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and ICRC helped thousands of people – children, grandparents, patients -- leave harm's way. This glimpse of humanity is something we sorely need more of. But it saddens me that children are boarding buses into the unknown instead of boarding buses to their schools., The devastation of this conflict has been vast. Even without a ceasefire, there are practical steps that the parties must take now by respecting international humanitarian law to limit civilian suffering:, 1- Concrete agreements that would allow safe passage out of cities like Mariupol. Civilians must be able to leave areas of violence. Specific details must be agreed upon and widely shared., 2- Allow humanitarian aid in. The parties are obligated under international humanitarian law to ensure people under their control have access to assistance, or to allow aid in., 3- Ensure that those who are not part of the fight are protected, wherever they are, be it in their homes or while traveling, and whether or not they are in a so-called humanitarian corridor., 4- Spare civilian infrastructure from attack, including hospitals, schools, water facilities and electricity infrastructure., 5- Treat prisoners of war and detained civilians with dignity. They are protected against ill-treatment and exposure to public curiosity including images on social media. The Geneva Conventions also ensures the ICRC access to detainees., During my time in Ukraine I met with Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov, Minister of Infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, to discuss humanitarian needs. I also met with the dedicated team members at the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, and my colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross; I'm immensely proud of the vital assistance they provide to people in need., The ICRC has been serving people in Ukraine for eight years, helping to relieve the suffering in Donbas, which I witnessed during my last trip to Luhansk and Donetsk. That work won't stop now. We are now massively scaling up. Just this week over 200 tons of relief supplies – medical material, thousands of blankets, kitchen sets, tarpaulins arrived in the country. We have deployed dozens of additional staff to the region, among them medical workers, weapon contamination specialists, engineers, logisticians, and others who can make an immediate difference to people in need., Civilians affected by the conflict in Ukraine are terrified of what the future holds. Families huddle in unheated basements knowing their neighbourhoods are now frontlines. Women and children walk through cold in search of shelter. The crisis, which comes on top of eight years of conflict, deepens by the hour., Kyiv today is too empty, but the residents in hiding here mostly have running water, electricity, and access to medical care. In too many cities, families are trapped and struggle to find enough water and food to survive., The suffering in Mariupol must not become the future of Ukraine., For more information, please contact:, Crystal Wells (English), +41 77 963 7574 cwells@icrc.org, Jason Straziuso (English, French), +41 79 949 3512 jstraziuso@icrc.org, Chris Hanger (English, French, German) +41 79 73 10 403, changer@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icrc-president-suffering-mariupol-must-not-become-future-ukraine-enru

Ukraine Crisis: Supporting Humanitarian Response in and Outside Ukraine with the Right Data and Information Products,News and Press Release,REACH,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"As conflict in Ukraine continues, the gravity of the humanitarian situation is clear. People in areas directly affected by conflict are in immediate need of life-saving support, lacking food, energy, utilities, and facing a breakdown in the provision of basic services. They also face the risk of environmental disasters because of proximity to hazardous infrastructure (such as energy producing facilities and transit infrastructure), a risk that extends well beyond conflict-affected areas., As of 16 March 2022, more than 2.9 million people are estimated to have fled Ukraine and many more are internally displaced, including an estimated one million children. The vast majority of the displaced are women, girls and boys. Some will be staying in neighbouring countries, many more are likely to continue their journey onwards to Western Europe and elsewhere., A large humanitarian response is scaling up inside Ukraine, at border points and countries of first arrival, and throughout final destinations of refugees. Civil society, donors and international organisations scaling up are all contributing resources to help crisis-stricken populations., Information will play a key role in the coordination and planning of this large and complex humanitarian response. Both within and outside of Ukraine, the right data and information products are required by humanitarian actors in a timely and predictable manner. To contribute to a better understanding of the crisis, starting on February 25th, REACH has disseminated a number of information products on a daily basis, which are becoming central documents in the response., You will find on this page the most recent research outputs related to situation of IDPs in Central and Western Ukraine, and on the refugee humanitarian situation in neighbouring countries, For more information on the impact of the conflict on the living conditions in Ukraine and to migration trends from Ukraine, check out our IMPACT website",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-supporting-humanitarian-response-and-outside-ukraine-right-data-and
Ukraine: Cluster Munitions Repeatedly Used on Mykolaiv,News and Press Release,HRW,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"Civilians Killed, Injured in Multiple Attacks That May Amount to War Crimes, (Berlin) -- Russian forces repeatedly fired cluster munition rockets into the densely populated city of Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, during separate attacks on March 7, 11, and 13, 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. An attack on March 13 reportedly killed nine civilians, who were apparently in line at a cash machine. The attacks also injured several other civilians and damaged homes, businesses, and civilian vehicles., ""Multiple residential areas in Mykolaiv were rocked by cluster munition attacks in the span of a week,"" said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""Russian forces should stop using cluster munitions and end these clearly indiscriminate attacks."", Cluster munitions are subject to an international treaty ban because of their widespread indiscriminate effect and long-lasting danger to civilians., Human Rights Watch interviewed by phone six witnesses to the attacks and analyzed dozens of photographs and videos, shared by witnesses or posted on social media. They show damage from the attacks, four dead bodies, and remnants of the weapons that were used, including of Uragan and Smerch cluster munition rockets, as well as remnants and unexploded 9N210 fragmentation submunitions., On March 7, the first day of the attacks, a handyman and his wife and children were asleep when their neighborhood came under attack at about 5 a.m. Their home is about two kilometers from the city's port. They went to shelter in their neighbor's basement as the attacks continued. At about 10 a.m., two rockets landed next to his house, one in the yard and another behind his home. ""I heard a whistling sound and the noise of many explosions,"" he said. ""The basement was vibrating."" He later found his yard destroyed, and a team from the Emergency Service, the government body that carries out demining and clearance, told him that the rockets were both Smerch., Attacks also took place in Solyani, a northern suburb of Mykolaiv with residential neighborhoods and a military base, on the morning of March 7. A truck driver from Solyani, a member of the civilian neighborhood watch since the war began, patrolled the neighborhood after the attacks ended. He said that three civilians were wounded and that he saw what Human Rights Watch identified, based on his photographs, as four expended rocket motors and one cluster munition cargo carrier from 9M55K Smerch rockets. One rocket motor and tailfin assembly of a Smerch rocket had landed in the yard of a preschool, two rocket mortars landed between houses, and the fourth landed in the middle of a street, while the carrier assembly landed on the riverbank., The location where these rockets and carrier landed was at least one kilometer from a military base, which the truck driver identified as the only potential military target in the area., Russian forces also fired rocket artillery into the Inhulsky neighborhood, in the eastern part of the city, on March 7. A resident of Inhulsky, a sailor, said that he was awakened at 4:45 a.m. by the sound of explosions. They came closer and closer to his five-story apartment building, and then it was hit. ""I felt like my legs had been cut off,"" he said, ""and like the whole building was going to collapse."" He ran into the hallway and found an older woman bleeding from her head. He said the rocket hit the hallway, stairwell, and several kitchens on the second and third floors of the building., The sailor shared 10 videos with Human Rights Watch, including of the bleeding woman, the damage to his building, and CCTV footage of the outside of the building at the time of the attack, as well as 17 photographs of the damage to the building and cars parked outside. Multiple videos show uniform fragmentation patterns consistent with the detonation of fragmentation munitions., While not a cluster munition rocket, rocket artillery with high-explosive/fragmentation warheads can have an indiscriminate impact, and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks., On March 11 multiple attacks hit the Inhulsky neighborhood again in the early morning hours. An IT specialist living in the center of the city said she heard a wooshing sound two or three times when the attacks began. She later visited two sites that had been hit. She shared 36 photographs with Human Rights Watch, showing the damage she observed, including to the windows of a nine-story building and five cars. The photographs show impact spatters of a submunition detonation in the asphalt and on two cars. A remnant of the cargo section of a 9M27K-series Uragan cluster munition rocket is also visible., The coordinates of one photograph she shared of an unexploded 9N210/235 submunition lying on a patch of grass next to the street, places it at about 1.7 kilometers from the Zorya factory. The factory produces gas turbines, mostly for seafaring defense technology and vessels. The factory may have been identified as a potential military target, but the significant distance between the factory and the civilian objects damaged also suggests the attacks were indiscriminate., The attacks on the morning of March 11 also hit Pivnichnyy, the suburb directly north of Solyani and about 600 meters from the military base. The truck driver and neighborhood watch member from Solyani said he arrived at the site that afternoon. An Emergency Service team member told him they had destroyed one submunition that had not detonated on impact and had been lying behind the wall of a 10-story building. The Emergency Service also shared with the truck driver a photo of the munition the team took, which Human Rights Watch identified as a rocket-delivered fragmentation submunition., He said he saw that three cluster munition rocket cargo carriers had hit the boiler room of a building, the roof of a 10-story apartment block, and the yard of a preschool. The building was marked with small grooves caused by the spraying of metal fragments, which were visible as high up as the seventh story, he said. Photos he provided, which he said were taken on March 11 in Pivnichnyy, show impact spatters of a fragmentation submunition detonation in the concrete and damage to windows., On March 13 at least three areas of Mykolaiv were attacked by rocket artillery carrying submunition payloads. The handyman was in his kitchen at about 8 a.m., when a rocket motor tore through his roof, punctured an interior wall, and came to rest in the bathroom. Based on seven photographs he shared, Human Rights Watch identified the rocket motor and tailfin assembly as a Uragan 9M27K series cluster munition rocket. Though he was only meters away from the rocket motor, he was not injured, but the attack damaged his house., The truck driver said there was an attack on Solyani at about the same time. He said he heard lots of small explosions at about 8 a.m., and when he later went outside, he ""saw lots of black smoke and then a crater in the middle of the street outside of my house, and lots of smaller grooves encircling the crater."" He said he saw the Emergency Service putting out a fire in one home hit by a rocket. He and his colleagues from the neighborhood watch rescued a woman and her daughter trapped in a basement by the fire. Human Rights Watch reviewed four photos the truck driver took on March 14 and identified a cargo section for fragmentation submunitions ejected from a Smerch 9M55K cluster munition rocket., The truck driver said that on March 13 another rocket landed outside of an ATB supermarket near the military base in Solyani. The driver went there soon after the attack and saw about 20 people on the ground injured and bleeding. They were near the cash machine and appeared to have been waiting in line there. He left the area as medics arrived so did not know how many people were killed, but media reports said nine people died., Human Rights Watch verified six images posted to Telegram purporting to be of the attack, showing four bodies outside the ATB supermarket on Heroiv Stalinhradu Avenue in the northern part of Solyani close to Pivnichnyy. Human Rights Watch also confirmed on an open-source map that a militarized area containing several bases is about 280 meters to the west of the supermarket., Several rockets carrying cluster munitions hit a neighborhood in the northern part of the city, where a military installation is located. Another witness said that in the residential areas around the base, he observed five rocket motors that had apparently ejected their payloads over the neighborhood. He shared three photos that he said he took about two hours after the attack. Based on the photographs, Human Rights Watch identified the remnant of the weapon as the rocket motor and tailfin section of the Uragan 9M27K series rocket and a 9N210 submunition., Given the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians, their repeated use in Mykolaiv during these three days of attacks might amount to war crimes., ""All States party to the cluster munitions convention should unequivocally condemn these attacks and any other use of this horrid weapon,"" Wille said. ""Relevant jurisdictions should investigate and ensure that those responsible one day face justice."", Cluster Munitions in Ukraine and the Laws of War, Cluster munitions typically explode in the air and send dozens, even hundreds, of small bomblets over an area the size of a football field. Cluster submunitions often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines. Their use in areas with civilians makes an attack indiscriminate in violation of international humanitarian law., Both Russia and Ukraine stockpile the Smerch and Uragan artillery rockets equipped with a cluster munition warhead. Neither country is among the 110 parties to the international treaty banning cluster munitions., Notwithstanding the existence of a legitimate military target, an attack is indiscriminate and unlawful if it uses a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited in ways that minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects. Cluster munitions cannot be so limited., Ukrainian authorities are also required under international humanitarian law, as far as feasible, to take ""necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations."" These precautions include protecting citizens located close to military installations or other potentially legitimate targets, including by moving them out of the area if necessary, and mitigating the anticipated effects of Russian attacks., Human Rights Watch has documented the use of cluster munitions by Russian forces in multiple towns and cities across Ukraine since February 24, including in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed armed groups used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine between July 2014 and February 2015, according to independent investigations conducted by Human Rights Watch, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitoring mission, and others.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cluster-munitions-repeatedly-used-mykolaiv

En nuestro entorno más inmediato RENFE y SNCF y han llegado a un acuerdo para plazas gratuitas en trenes comerciales y trenes o vagones especiales, en algunos casos con líneas adicionales, para facilitar el traslado de las personas refugiadas, en coordinación con Cruz Roja Española y Cruz Roja Francesa., Intervención con las personas con protección temporal, Cruz Roja atiende a las personas con protección temporal procedentes de Ucrania en base a siete ejes prioritarios, con un nivel de intensidad reforzada para los perfiles de mayor vulnerabilidad; estos siete ejes atienden la cobertura personalizada de las necesidades básicas, el fortalecimiento de su bienestar emocional, la asistencia jurídica en el proceso de solicitud de Protección Internacional, el refuerzo de competencias y habilidades para la autonomía personal, la creación de itinerarios para la inserción laboral, la creación de redes con la sociedad de acogida y el fomento de una participación ciudadana igualitaria, y el refuerzo y apoyo en la escolarización para garantizar el éxito escolar., El Sistema Estatal de Acogida de Acogida e Integración de personas beneficiarias y solicitantes de Protección Internacional se articula en dos grandes fases., La primera consta de la acogida en el centro; la fase de acogida tiene un carácter estatal, y su objetivo es, garantizar tanto la cobertura de las necesidades básicas como el fortalecimiento de las competencias personales para una vida autónoma en la sociedad de acogida, mediante el apoyo social, jurídico, psicológico, laboral o de aprendizaje del idioma., La segunda parte trabaja la preparación para la Autonomía la Fase de Preparación para la Autonomía (Segunda Fase), se pone en marcha sol o cuando las personas han recibido una resolución favorable a su solicitud de Protección Internacional. En ese caso, aunque finalicen su estancia en el dispositivo de acogida, pueden seguir necesitando apoyo para la cobertura de sus necesidades básicas, el fortalecimiento de sus competencias y el seguimiento de su proceso de integración socio laboral., La situación actual, Tras la escalada en el conflicto en Ucrania, millones de personas se encuentran en una situación de necesidad desesperada de agua segura y alimentos. Con carreteras intransitables, cortes de suministros de agua y electricidad, y falta de productos básicos, la situación es extremadamente grave en algunas zonas del este del país, como la ciudad de Mariupol, donde la población lleva días sin electricidad, calefacción, acceso a agua o alimentos. Si no se toman medidas urgentes para proteger y restaurar servicios esenciales y se facilita el acceso de organizaciones humanitarias, las consecuencias humanitarias seguirán creciendo., Además de los enfrentamientos activos, las minas y la artillería sin explotar son un factor adicional de riesgo para la población civil que vive cerca de la línea de contacto con consecuencias potencialmente devastadoras. Las familias afectadas han perdido a sus personas queridas o han visto como han sido gravemente heridas, incluyendo niños y niñas, mientras trabajaban en el campo, recogían leña o simplemente jugaban en el patio. Varios centenares de personas han muerto o han resultado heridas desde el principio del conflicto en Ucrania de esta manera, y estos casos continúan hasta la fecha., Las personas voluntarias y el personal de la Cruz Roja Ucraniana están realizando una labor encomiable y heroica. Con riesgo para sus vidas, están trabajando de manera incansable para ayudar a las personas y a las comunidades afectadas: distribución de alimentos y artículos de primera necesidad, apoyo a la evacuación de personas con dificultades de movilidad, formación en primeros auxilios…, En los últimos días, más de tres mil personas se han unido a la Cruz Roja Ucraniana como voluntarias, mostrando un gran deseo para hacer algo para ayudar en su comunidad. Es necesario proteger espacio para una acción humanitaria neutral, imparcial e independiente para que las organizaciones humanitarias puedan mantener acceso a la población civil. Las oficinas de la Cruz Roja Ucraniana en todo el país están respondiendo y ayudando a las personas vulnerables., Ocho años de conflicto, sumados a las restricciones de movimiento debidas a la pandemia, han impedido a las personas ver a sus familiares en el otro lado de la línea de contacto. Como consecuencia de la escalada en el conflicto y los desplazamientos de población, el contacto con familiares y personas queridas puede verse interrumpido, lo que causa enorme incertidumbre y dolor. El restablecimiento de contactos familiares, por tanto, se convierte en una actividad esencial. Para ello, el servicio de Restablecimiento del Contacto Familiar, en coordinación con el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, tiene habilitado diferentes canales:, Dentro de la página web cruzroja.es, un formulario a disposición de la comunidad ucraniana en España, Teléfono 900 221122",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/cruz-roja-ya-ha-atendido-m-s-de-7700-personas-llegadas-desde-ucrania

Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv., On the morning of 15 March, several districts of Kyiv were shelled. In Osokorky district (south-east), debris damaged a private house; in Podilskiy district (north-center), shelling damaged and set fire to a 10-story building; in Sviatoshynskiy district (west and north-west) a 9-story building and a 16-story building were both hit, with the latter catching fire; and additional buildings were damaged in a blast near Lukyanivska metro station (center). Airstrikes also continue in the cities where there are no active hostilities: on 14 March, a missile hit the TV tower in Rivne, leaving 19 dead and nine injured while two air attacks were reported at Dnipro Airport on 15 March., As of 14 March, only seven out of ten humanitarian corridors were operational, with a total of 4,000 persons evacuated., Negotiations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation resumed on 15 March. The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. Ukraine has also invited the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to set up a special group of international observers to monitor the security situation during the delivery of humanitarian aid to the affected regions of Ukraine through the corridors agreed upon with the Russian Federation., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 16 March, over 3 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. Between 24 February and 15 March, the OHCHR recorded 1,900 civilian casualties, including 726 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., Alongside mounting humanitarian needs, the ongoing hostilities have generated significant socio-economic repercussions that are likely to affect the coping capacity and resilience of the residents of Ukraine, particularly after the multi-faceted impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on livelihoods prior to the escalation of conflict. As of March 14, it was reported that 42% of small businesses in Ukraine are currently unable to operate, thereby making humanitarian assistance in the near terms that much more essential.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-7-16-march-2022

In the worst-affected cities under attack - including Mariupol and Kharkiv - heavy fighting leaves people isolated and facing severe shortages of food, water, and energy supplies., In Mariupol, tens of thousands of people remain trapped in the city despite reports of some evacuations. Our humanitarian colleagues are particularly concerned about vulnerable groups such as older people and people living with disabilities, who may not be able to flee the conflict. Efforts continue to ensure voluntary safe passage of civilians out of areas with active fighting, as well as movement of humanitarian goods and personnel into areas where needs are most acute. Humanitarian organizations are deploying additional staff across the country and are working to move supplies to warehouses in different hubs to serve people in need., The World Food Programme said that in Kharkiv, 32.5 metric tons of bread were distributed by one of their cooperating partners to about 140,800 people. So far, about 600,000 people have been reached with some form of humanitarian assistance., Today, the UN Refugee Agency said that the number of people crossing international borders out of Ukraine has reached 3.1 million., For her part, the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, has condemned the killings of Ukrainian producer and fixer, Oleksandra Kuvshynova and Irish journalist and cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, in Gorenka, outside Kyiv on Monday.

Ukraine Legislative Update: March 2022,Situation Report,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,17 Mar 2022,"Background, In October 2014, the law on rights and freedoms of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) was adopted. It introduced the status of an internally displaced person into Ukrainian law, fully in line with the definition used in the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement1 . In November 2014, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted Resolution 509 on IDP registration according to which IDP status is confirmed through an IDP certificate. The certificate is issued by social protection departments in hosting communities. Another Cabinet of Ministers Resolution # 505 introduced a financial entitlement for IDPs, called “targeted assistance to IDPs to cover certain housing expenses including utilities”. The assistance was not time bound and could be prolonged every six months. At a later stage, the government adopted Regulation 1085-r with the list of settlements in Donetsk and Luhansk oblast which were considered to be outside of Government control. Allocation of the assistance is possible only to people who fled one of settlements mentioned in this Regulation. To prevent duplications and ensure that collection of information on IDPs is centralized, the Unified IDP Registry was established and is maintained by the Ministry of Social Policy. So, in February 2022, Ukraine is a country with the well-developed and functioning IDP registration system where authorities have knowledge and skills on how to use it., Registration of IDPs after 24 February 2022, Shocked by the Russian offensive, the Government has concentrated its efforts on defense. There were no instructions to the local social protection departments on the course of actions with regard to IDPs. Moreover, the overwhelming number of displaced individuals has resulted in a situation where local authorities are concentrating on assisting people arriving from eastern, northern and southern oblasts. In order to be able to respond to rapidly emerging needs, local authorities have started their own registration with only pen and paper. In parallel, the Ministry of Social Policy began considering the introduction of a new “status” of a “temporary relocated person”. Thanks to advocacy within the government (Ministry of Reintegration, Ministry of Digitalization) and following UNHCR intervention, through a letter to the Ministry of Social Policy and multiple authorities, including Office of the Ombudsperson, on 13 March the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a resolution concerning IDP registration after the launch of the ongoing military offensive.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-legislative-update-march-2022
The impacts of war on children with cancer – ensuring continuation of care for those whose lives depend on it [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,Health,16 Mar 2022,"As the war in Ukraine intensifies, hundreds of children with cancer have been forced to flee homes and hospital beds all over the country and undertake dangerous journeys in the hope of reconnecting with the treatments they need to survive., Undergoing chemotherapy treatment for a bladder tumour, 8-year-old Leonid was forced to leave a Kyiv hospital as the shelling escalated. He and his mother, Anna, set out in search of safety and treatment. “The road was long and scary, and Leonid was terrified of the shelling and the bombs,” Anna said., Leonid arrived safely at the Western Ukrainian Specialized Children’s Medical Centre in Lviv, near the Polish border, and resumed his cancer treatment. Unfortunately, Anna learned that her son’s tumour had grown. “We want to go to Poland as soon as possible so our son can have regular treatment,” she said. “We don’t want to wait. No one is sure what will happen.”, WHO is coordinating with partners on humanitarian health assistance, both within Ukraine and on its borders, and providing supplies, technical support and surge staff. The Organization is setting up a Ukraine support hub in Poland and working to ensure that neighbouring countries have the infrastructure and expertise to serve a massive influx of refugees. More than 3 million people have fled the country, according to United Nations estimates., To finance the response, WHO has launched a health emergency appeal for Ukraine. Local and international organizations are working against the clock to reconnect paediatric cancer patients with their treatments., Children from all over Ukraine are being stabilized at the Western Ukrainian Specialized Children’s Medical Centre, then transported by ambulance to the Unicorn Marian Wilemski Clinic in Poland for triage. From there, they are sent with family members to children’s oncology centres in Poland, elsewhere in Europe and farther afield., Yulia Nohovitsyna, working for a charitable foundation, said that about 170 children have benefitted from the referral system so far., One of those is Anastasia, a child from Kyiv. She arrived with her mother, Natalia, in Hamburg, Germany, on 7 March, and has resumed her treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Five days earlier, the mother and daughter had fled the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital, which had come under artillery fire., “It was impossible to continue treatment with the alarms, the sirens and the likelihood of the destruction of the capital,” said Natalia. “I am very grateful to everyone who arranged the evacuation of children, and those doctors who took us for treatment in Germany.”, Cancer is among the major challenges of the health emergency in Ukraine, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. Dr Tedros also pointed to lack of treatment for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and other problems., An inundation of patients Serving as Ukraine’s staging area for young cancer patients in transit, the Western Ukrainian Specialized Children’s Medical Centre is coping with dwindling supplies and a surge in ill, often traumatized patients – 6 months’ worth of admissions in 1 week., “We are preparing for the worst: securing the windows, preparing space to evacuate in the basement. But it’s not adequate for our patients,” said Dr Severyn Ferneza, one of the Centre’s physicians, who fought back tears in an interview with WHO staff. “I don’t even want to think of what would happen if this hospital ceases to be able to function. No one else could manage.”, Although chemotherapy continues, patients still have to be whisked to bomb shelters about 4 times a day when air-raid sirens sound. Many of the children have already experienced shelling in cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv, and are terrified by the sirens. A psychologist has been working with the children twice a week, but hospital staff say the need for such services is far greater., “Cancer itself is a problem, but treatment interruptions, stress and risk of infection mean that hundreds of children might die prematurely,” said Dr Roman Kizym, Head of the Centre. “We believe that these are the indirect victims of this war.”, Arthur, 6 years old, is among the newcomers to the Centre. He has acute myeloid leukaemia, a blood cancer. “We are grateful for this chance to survive and continue treatment,” said Alina Mykolaivna, the boy’s mother. “If we interrupted the treatment, then all the chemotherapy blocks that Arthur had been doing before would have been meaningless.”, Dr Kizym praised the international coordination that has already led to the evacuation and treatment of many patients. “Nevertheless, this is a difficult moment,” he said. “Some treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, which I worked so hard to make available in Ukraine, are now impossible. It is impossible to bring in donor bone marrow.”, The hospital’s transplant facility sits unused, a grand-opening ribbon hanging on the door from before the outbreak of the war., One of Dr Kizym’s patients is Leonid, the boy with the bladder tumour. He is responding well to treatment, his mother explained, but seems indifferent. “He wants to go back home,” she said. “He misses home.”, Editorial changes were made to the content of this article on 17 March 2022 to clarify Dr Roman Kizym's quote.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impacts-war-children-cancer-ensuring-continuation-care-those-whose-lives-depend-it
Update 23 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (16 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,16 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had lost connection to a third power line but that two others remained available and there was no safety concern, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus one on standby. Two of the four were damaged earlier. The Ukrainian regulator said it was not clear what had caused today’s loss of a third line. It said the remaining power line and the one on standby were sufficient to ensure that all safety systems remained fully functional without limitations. Like other NPPs in Ukraine and elsewhere, the plant also has back-up diesel generators in case they are needed., On 4 March, Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, which has six reactors. The site’s Ukrainian staff have continued to operate the plant. The site’s two operating reactors – units 2 and 4 – slightly decreased their power supplies to the grid today to adapt to the changed power line situation, the regulator said., The regulator earlier today said the Chornobyl NPP remained connected to the national electricity grid two days after engineers succeeded in resuming regular power supplies to this Russian-controlled site., The site of the 1986 accident lost all off-site power on 9 March and resorted to diesel fuel for back-up electricity. Ukrainian specialist teams repaired one of the two damaged lines linking the plant to the network, allowing the resumption of external electricity deliveries on 14 March. The emergency diesel generators were switched off the same day., Russian forces took control of the Chornobyl NPP on 24 February. Ukrainian staff have continued to manage day-to-day operations at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located. They have not been able to rotate for three weeks. “I remain gravely concerned about the extremely difficult circumstances for the Ukrainian staff there,” Director General Grossi said., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plants, the Ukrainian regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including the two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range, it said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported earlier this week. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-23-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-16-march-2022
Ukraine: Beleaguered town of Izium at breaking point after constant attack from Russian forces – new testimony,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Food and Nutrition

Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 Mar 2022,"Civilians in Izium in Kharkiv Region in eastern Ukraine are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster as Russian forces relentlessly bombard the town, new testimony gathered by Amnesty International has revealed., Residents of Izium have been under a constant siege-like situation since 28 February, and warned that diminishing food and water supplies have left them at breaking point, as remaining civilians hide in their basements., Between 9 and 12 March, Amnesty International interviewed 26 residents of Izium, immediately after their evacuation to Svyatohirsk, a town in Donetsk Region that largely remains under Ukrainian control and has been under incessant Russian fire., “Dozens of small towns and villages in Ukraine are under relentless attack, with their desperate inhabitants finding themselves caught in the crossfire or under siege by attacking Russian forces,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia., “The testimonies we have gathered from Izium reveal the terror experienced by the town’s civilian population, trapped in their basements with almost no food or water, and under constant attack., “Izium and other towns on the frontline now urgently need humanitarian corridors to enable the safe evacuation of civilians wishing to leave, and the delivery of humanitarian supplies to reach those who remain behind.”, Reports of Russian military attacks on Izium first appeared on 28 February, and the town has been exposed to constant rocket fire since 3 March., Most of the town’s residential areas are cut off from electricity, gas, heating, and mobile communication as a result of attacks. According to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office, eight civilians, including two children, were killed in strikes on 3 March, which also caused significant damage to the town’s central hospital. Further casualties have been reported since that time., ‘Everything was under fire’, Interviewees told Amnesty International that Russian forces carried out attacks that have killed and injured civilians, and destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure, including residential houses, schools, kindergartens, medical facilities, and food stores. Some of the attacks appear to have been indiscriminate, and therefore unlawful., Satellite imagery from 12 March reviewed by Amnesty International clearly showed craters and damage close to locations reported by open street maps as children’s schools and hospitals., Svitlana, a 72-year-old internally displaced person, has been living in Izium since relocating from Donetsk, which has been controlled by Russian-backed armed groups since 2014., She told Amnesty International: “When they began to bomb us, on 3 or 4 [March], we couldn’t go outside anymore. Day and night, rockets were being shot… If this continues for a few more days, the people and the town will be finished off.”, Since the attacks began and several grocery stores were closed or destroyed, Izium’s population has been completely dependent on humanitarian aid and personal food supplies. Access to electricity, gas, heating and any form of communication has been cut, and they are also suffering due to lack of sanitation and water shortage., Tetyana, who stayed in a shelter in the town with her five-month-old baby, said: “When we were leaving [evacuating], there were three five-litre containers left for 55 people. I don’t know how they are going to survive.”, Humanitarian aid and bread have been delivered to the town sporadically. However, due to shortages and the ongoing lack of communications, this has only reached some civilians, mainly those hiding in larger bomb shelters, which are often located in schools., Interviewees told Amnesty International that people who lived in residential neighbourhoods in individual family houses were struggling to access food as their neighbourhoods were among the most damaged, and most houses had no basement or just a very small basement to seek safety., Natalia, a resident of a private house, said: “We spent six days in the cellar. It’s very small, you have to stand in it, it’s impossible to lie down. As soon as there was a pause [in attacks], we would quickly run out, and get some eggs from the hens… Our child was hungry, since we hardly ate. All we had was leftover dry bread, apples from the cellar, canned pickles, and jam… We couldn’t get any other food anywhere; we couldn’t leave our house. Everything was under fire.”, Two interviewees said they were caught in crossfire as battle raged in the town’s populated urban setting. One man said that several Ukrainian fighters – who would be considered lawful targets of attack under the rules of war – were based in one of the flats in their building which came under attack. Other Izium residents told Amnesty International that there were no military bases or other military objectives in the vicinity of their bombed-out neighbourhoods., Humanitarian corridors urgently needed, On 9 March, according to local sources, constant strikes and indirect fire meant that local authorities were able to evacuate only 250 people from Izium, instead of the planned 5,000. On 10 March, a further 2,000 people were evacuated. Along with local authorities, local volunteers and activists used private cars to evacuate civilians. Many civilians, primarily older people and people with disabilities, chose to stay or were not able to leave., International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Russian forces must take all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects., Ukrainian forces should also take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control from the effects of attacks. In particular, they should avoid operating from civilian neighbourhoods, where they could draw fire that results in harm to civilians and civilian objects., Amnesty International has previously called for civilians whose homes have been destroyed and others fearing for their lives because of Russian bombardment to be granted access to safe humanitarian corridors. Amnesty International considers the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an act of aggression.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-beleaguered-town-izium-breaking-point-after-constant-attack-russian-forces

Ukraine: Mariupol Theater Hit by Russian Attack Sheltered Hundreds,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"Serious Concerns for Civilians Remaining in the City, (Dnipro) – The theater hit by a Russian attack on Mariupol on March 16, 2022 had been sheltering hundreds of civilians, Human Rights Watch said today., Pavlo Kirilenkoa, the governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, announced on March 16 that Russian forces had bombed the Donetsk Regional Theater of Drama, where hundreds of residents were sheltering in the besieged city of Mariupol. Petro Andryushchenko, an assistant to Mariupol’s mayor, told Human Rights Watch that his office did not yet know if any, or how many, civilians had been injured or killed. In satellite imagery of the theater from March 14, the Russian word for “children” clearly appears written twice in large Cyrillic script in front and behind the theater., “Until we know more, we cannot rule out the possibility of a Ukrainian military target in the area of the theater, but we do know that the theater had been housing at least 500 civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water, and heating have been almost completely cut off.”, On March 16, just hours before the attack, Human Rights Watch interviewed over a dozen Mariupol residents who had escaped the city the day before in a convoy of hundreds of private cars and had arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Two people interviewed separately mentioned civilians sheltering in the basement of Mariupol’s theater. One of them, a doctor, said she had visited the theater in the days before she left and that between 500 and 800 civilians were staying there. The other person, who had spent the past two weeks delivering food, water, and medicine to shelters across the city, said that he had delivered aid to the theater multiple times and that it was housing between 500 and 700 civilians., Human Rights Watch was unable to reach anyone in Mariupol by phone on March 16 to determine whether civilians had left the theater immediately prior to the attack. The doctor, however, shared four photographs of the theater that she said she took on the morning of March 15, on her way out of the city, including one that shows groups of people in civilian clothes cooking food on an open fire and carrying water buckets just outside of the theater. No military vehicles or personnel are visible in the photographs., Human Rights Watch verified three videos posted on March 16 to a Telegram channel that publishes videos and reports from Mariupol. One of these videos shows the building from a distance with black smoke billowing out of it. Two others, one filmed from within the park where the theater stands, show flames coming from the center of the heavily damaged building. The satellite image with the word “children” shows the theater fully intact on March 14., The laws of war require parties to the conflict to distinguish at all times between civilian objects and military objectives and each party to the conflict must do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives. If there is doubt as to whether an object normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a theater, is being used for military purposes, it shall be presumed not to be so. Directing an attack against a civilian object is strictly prohibited, as are indiscriminate attacks and attacks with disproportionate effects on civilians, and may be war crimes., Organized evacuations of civilians in Mariupol who want to leave should be facilitated, Human Rights Watch said.

OSCE human rights office alarmed by forced removal of elected officials in Ukrainian cities,News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,17 Mar 2022,"WARSAW, 16 March 2022 – After two democratically elected mayors in the Ukrainian cities of Melitopol and Dniprorudne were forcibly removed from office, kidnapped and remain at risk of torture, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) is increasingly alarmed by the impact of Russia’s military attack on the country’s democratic institutions., The detained mayors should be immediately released and their safety guaranteed, notwithstanding the distinct rules and requirements of international humanitarian law applicable in times of armed conflict. ODIHR reiterates that preserving the integrity of democratic institutions and processes is an obligation in line with the commitments made by all OSCE countries., All countries across the OSCE have committed to respect each other’s sovereignty, freedom and political independence, and have repeatedly affirmed the right of citizens to decide on their internal political affairs through representatives who are freely chosen during genuine democratic elections., Prohibitions of torture and enforced disappearances in international law are absolute, in times of armed conflict just as in times of peace. OSCE countries have also pledged to ensure that the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is also respected in the context of armed conflict., Contacts, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights

"Atrocity Alert No. 292: Ukraine, Sudan/South Sudan and Ethiopia",News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",16 Mar 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., ‘UKRAINE IS ON FIRE’ AS RUSSIA CONTINUES TO TARGET CIVILIANS AND CIVILIAN OBJECTS, As the Russian invasion in Ukraine enters its fourth week, civilians continue to suffer the devastating consequences of the violence. Despite multiple ceasefire agreements and attempts at humanitarian corridors for civilians, artillery and missile strikes have continued and are increasingly targeting civilian infrastructure. Civilians fleeing Russian occupied territory have reported that Russian troops have targeted and killed civilians, as well as looted markets and homes. On 14 March UN Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that, “Ukraine is on fire… the country is being decimated before the eyes of the world. The impact on civilians is reaching terrifying proportions. After being hit by Russian forces, roads, airports and schools lie in ruins.”, The World Health Organization has warned that Ukraine’s medical facilities are “stretched to the breaking point” and has verified at least 43 attacks on healthcare since the invasion started on 24 February. These attacks have killed at least 12 people, including healthcare workers, and have destroyed critical health infrastructure. On 9 March a Russian strike that targeted a hospital complex in Mariupol destroyed the hospital’s maternity and children’s ward, burying women and children in the rubble. Attacks on civilians, civilian infrastructure and healthcare are forbidden under international law and may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., Since the invasion, the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has verified at least 726 civilian deaths, including 52 children, while asserting the real toll is much higher. Over 3 million people have fled to neighboring countries and at least 1.9 million are internally displaced, while hundreds of thousands remain trapped by fighting. According to the UN Children’s Fund, at least one child per second is becoming a refugee due to the war., Secretary-General Guterres and others have also warned of the worldwide impact of the conflict and the strain it will impose on aid efforts globally. More than half of the World Food Programme’s wheat supply is provided by Russia and Ukraine. Increasing scarcity and costs will impede aid operations for vulnerable populations at risk of famine in Yemen and Ethiopia and those facing food insecurity elsewhere., Today, 16 March, the International Court of Justice imposed provisional measures, calling on Russia to suspend military operations and for military units to cease advancing. It also calls on both parties to refrain from actions furthering the conflict. Sarah Hunter, Communications and Digital Media Officer at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “in keeping with these provisional measures, Russia must cease hostilities and parties to the conflict should urgently agree and adhere to a cessation of hostilities allowing for the delivery of humanitarian aid and evacuations of besieged civilians.”, RENEWED INTER-COMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN DISPUTED SUDAN AND SOUTH SUDAN BORDER REGION, Since 10 February violence has renewed between the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya Arab communities in the Abyei Area – a disputed border region between Sudan and South Sudan – as a result of unresolved grievances and longstanding disputes. According to the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission and Abyei Administration, inter-communal clashes erupted on 10 February in the Anet settlement, killing 20 people and displacing 70,000. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that violence has further intensified since 5 March, with at least 36 people killed and an estimated 50,000 displaced following clashes in Agok town. Humanitarian operations have been suspended in conflict-affected areas., The UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) voiced its concern regarding the renewed violence, stating that the casualties and ongoing insecurity are “causing untold humanitarian suffering on the people as well as reversing gains made towards achieving peaceful coexistence in Abyei.”, Abyei is traditionally the homeland of the Ngok Dinka community, which has strong ties to the Dinka in South Sudan. Misseriya Arab herders and their cattle seasonally traverse Abyei in search of water and grazing land during the dry season. For decades, these communities have competed over resources, sparking cycles of violence that have been exacerbated by climate change and severe droughts. The situation in Abyei has been further affected by years of disputes and clashes between Sudanese and South Sudanese armed forces over the region’s borders and access to oil and other resources., The clashes in Abyei are occurring while inter-communal and localized violence has increased throughout South Sudan. During February the UN Human Rights Council (HRC)-mandated Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS) reported that “violence at [the] subnational level remains pervasive.” The UN Mission in South Sudan and UN Human Rights Office also recently reported on grave human rights violations perpetrated by warring groups in Western Equatoria State between June and September 2021, including at least 440 civilians killed, 74 abducted and 64 subjected to conflict-related sexual violence., In order to break the cycles of violence, the South Sudanese government should urgently address the long-standing delays in implementing the 2018 peace agreement, including the security arrangements and the permanent constitution-making process. During the current HRC session, member states must extend the full mandate of the CHRSS., The governments of Sudan and South Sudan must lend their political support to UNISFA and call for the immediate cessation of violence in the Abyei Area. The Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities should return to dialogue and peacefully settle disputes concerning the shared use of resources. During the upcoming mandate renewal for UNISFA, the UN Security Council should integrate climate-related security risks by mandating the Mission to develop climate-sensitive conflict responses., ETHNIC TARGETING ON THE RISE WHILE THE WAR IN NORTHERN ETHIOPIA CONTINUES, On Thursday, 3 March, 11 people were killed in Metekel Zone, in the Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) reported that security forces wearing federal government fatigues and members of ethnic and/or regional militias carried out the killings. According to the EHRC, the perpetrators shot dead eight ethnic Tigrayans and two ethnic Gumuz men, accusing them of orchestrating an attack on a civilian convoy a day prior that resulted in the deaths of at least 53 people. Another ethnic Tigrayan man was found by security forces and burned alive. A video of the incident prompted the Ethiopian government to respond, vowing an investigation. Ethnic profiling of Tigrayans has notably increased across the country following the outbreak of war in the Tigray region in November 2020., Inter-communal tensions and ethnically-motivated attacks have been rising throughout Ethiopia since 2018, particularly in Metekel Zone. Cycles of ethnic violence in Metekel Zone have resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities since 2018, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. Unnamed armed groups typically perpetrate the attacks, however, local ethnic Gumuz militias and other ethnic militias have at times been responsible. Ethnic Amhara and Agew civilians are frequently targeted, as well as indigenous Shinasha people. Responding to the recurrent violence, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Metekel Zone on 23 January and took over security in the area. Since then, federal security forces have been accused of killing ethnic Gumuz civilians., Meanwhile, parties to the conflict in the Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions continue to perpetrate widespread abuses that amount to possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) received over 306 reports of rape by Tigrayan forces in the Amhara region between 1 November and 5 December. According to a report released by the EHRC on 11 March, at least 750 people were killed in Amhara and Afar between September and December 2021. OHCHR also documented 300 civilians killed by the federal government’s aerial bombardments in the Tigray region between 28 November and 28 February. Over 5,700 schools and healthcare facilities in Amhara and Afar have been totally or partially destroyed., Authorities must urgently address the root causes of inter-communal and ethnic conflicts in Metekel Zone and other parts of Ethiopia. A military solution alone will not end inter-ethnic violence. All parties to the conflict in northern Ethiopia must agree to negotiations and find a resolution to prevent further suffering.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-292-ukraine-sudansouth-sudan-and-ethiopia
ICVA Statement on the Ukrainian Humanitarian Crisis – A Call for a Principled and Coordinated Response,News and Press Release,ICVA,"Coordination

Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"Deeply concerned by the war in Ukraine and its escalating consequences, ICVA calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians, and adherence to international law., With every passing day the situation in Ukraine becomes graver, with a rising toll on civilian lives and infrastructure. Sick and injured civilians trapped in active conflict zones are running out of food and water and cannot reach vital medical care. The continued destruction of civilian infrastructure, including health facilities, is impeding humanitarian response and will have severe implications for recovery. This war must stop now. Civilians must be protected and be able to safely access essential services and evacuate., ICVA calls for the respect and protection of humanitarian access and space, which will enable all people in need to access effective and principled humanitarian assistance., At the forefront of the response in Ukraine, individuals, community-based organisations and local partners are overcoming enormous challenges to ensure people’s basic needs are met. Local and national authorities, the UN, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, international and local NGOs, among whom many ICVA members, are providing essential services to civilians affected by the violence., In the face of enormous needs, ICVA members are scaling up the humanitarian response across neighboring countries. Respecting our values as a globally distributed and locally rooted network, ICVA is building upon local capacities for humanitarian assistance and investing in the coordination architecture to prevent gaps or duplication in the humanitarian response. Our members are working with refugees and host communities, and ensuring the response remains shaped by and accountable to crisis-affected populations., ICVA calls on all humanitarian responders to engage in coordination mechanisms, to be inclusive and foster participation of local and national actors and prioritise accountability to affected populations., Over 3 million people have already fled Ukraine, the majority of whom are women and children. If this conflict continues, another 2 million could flee in the weeks ahead, with millions more displaced from their homes. To escape the conflict many refugees were forced to leave loved ones behind. While deeply resilient, they are worried about the future and face new risks. There are concerns regarding safeguarding especially for children and on risks of trafficking in human beings., The response to the crisis has been tremendous. We applaud all who have welcomed and supported the refugees. We commend the solidarity shown by governments and citizens across Europe and further afield towards those fleeing from the crisis in Ukraine. The decision by the EU to apply the temporary protection directive to refugees leaving Ukraine provides the necessary legal safeguards on status and shows that together it is possible to uphold commitments to international refugee and human rights law., ICVA’s members immediately deployed to welcome and support refugees hand in hand with local communities, national civil society and authorities. ICVA members are providing food, shelter, health services, mental and psychosocial care, protection services, including child protection, anti-trafficking and protection from gender-based violence. NGOs are working hard to ensure that these services are inclusive of the needs of a broad range of individuals and diverse groups escaping the conflict, taking the significant gender, age and disability dimensions of this crisis into account and ensuring safeguards against exploitation, abuse and trafficking are in place., As we stand together in solidarity with all people impacted by the war in Ukraine, let’s extend the same welcome, guarantee the same protection and support to all those escaping conflicts, violence and other serious human rights violations, regardless of their race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status., Together we are responding to the Ukrainian crisis, but we should not divert resources and attention from millions of people in other countries across the world with enormous unmet and under-funded humanitarian needs., The war in Ukraine threatens to further disrupt the global supply of wheat and other vital crops critical to meet the needs of people across the globe. Food security experts have raised the alarm over the dire implications for countries that depend on wheat imports and food aid. Some 20 million additional people will go hungry globally due to rising food prices driven by the crisis., Compounding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate crisis, the conflict in Ukraine will further exacerbate the vulnerability of marginalized communities worldwide who are struggling to meet basic needs., ICVA calls on governments to extend the same leadership and solidarity shown in response to Ukraine across all humanitarian crises globally, ensuring aid reaches all those in most need, without discrimination, unmet humanitarian needs are financed, and adequate investment is made in preparedness and mitigation., 17th March 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icva-statement-ukrainian-humanitarian-crisis-call-principled-and-coordinated-response

Protection and Human Rights",17 Mar 2022,"Mr President, Excellencies, dear colleagues,, Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to address you today., The war in Ukraine is having devastating consequences for the health of Ukraine’s people; consequences that will reverberate for years or decades to come., There is severe disruption to health services and access to basic commodities, as a result of widespread destruction of infrastructure, including health facilities., WHO has verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers., In any conflict, attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law., They deprive people of urgently-needed care and break already-strained health systems., The disruption to services and supplies in Ukraine is posing an extreme risk to people with cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV and TB, which are among the leading causes of mortality in Ukraine., Displacement, poor shelter, and overcrowded living conditions caused by the conflict are likely to increase the risk of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and polio., Services for mental health and psychosocial support are urgently needed to help people cope with the effects of the war., There are more than 35,000 mental health patients in Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals and long-term care facilities, which are facing severe shortages of medicines, food, heating, blankets and more., The war is also exacerbating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine., With just one-third of the adult population fully vaccinated, this increases the risk of large numbers of people developing severe disease., Critical shortages of oxygen will have an impact on the ability to treat patients with COVID-19 and many other conditions., At least 8 facilities for producing and storing liquid oxygen have now closed, and we are seeking ways of accessing oxygen from neighboring countries and ways to deliver it safely to where it’s needed., WHO is on the ground, working with the Ministry of Health and partners to support health workers and the health system to provide care to meet immediate health needs., So far, we have sent about 100 metric tonnes of medical supplies, including oxygen, insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics, and blood transfusion kits – enough for 4,500 trauma patients and 450,000 primary health care patients, for one month., Other equipment, including oxygen generators, electrical generators and defibrillators have also been delivered, and we are preparing to send a further 108 metric tonnes., We have now established supply lines from our warehouse in Lviv to many cities of Ukraine, but challenges with access remain. We need unfettered access., We have critical supplies ready for UN joint convoys to enter difficult areas, but so far we have not been successful., Today, for example, the UN convoy to Sumy that included a WHO truck carrying critical medical supplies was unable to enter., Loads ready for Mariupol remain in staging areas and cannot proceed. Access to these, and other areas, is now critical., To support Ukraine’s health system, WHO is coordinating the deployment of 20 Emergency Medical Teams, consisting of experts from many countries, to deliver care across a range of disciplines, in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, which have been generous in welcoming refugees, but are struggling to meet their needs, as my colleagues said earlier., Those needs are immense, and include continuity of care for basic illnesses, as well as more complex issues like cancer and renal dialysis, maternal and child health, HIV and TB, sexual and reproductive health and mental health., Refugees, and many of those who remain in Ukraine, are already very vulnerable – especially women and girls., Protecting them from abuse and exploitation of all kinds must be a top priority for hosting governments – and for all international organizations., Mr President, today, I have three urgent requests., First, we urge the Security Council to work for an immediate ceasefire, and a political solution., Prolonged conflict is in nobody’s interests, and will only prolong the suffering of the most vulnerable., The life-saving medicine we need right now is peace., Second, we urge all donors to support the response to humanitarian needs in in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, which are immense, and escalating every day., Thanks to donors who front-loaded WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies, we were able to respond immediately, deploying more than US$10 million to address immediate health needs., These funds were supplemented by additional funding from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF., However, to sustain the response, we call on donors to fully fund the United Nations emergency appeal. As the Under Secretary-General said, it’s only 36% funded so far., We thank those donors who have already pledged funding to meet the needs of people in Ukraine., And third, although Ukraine is rightly the focus of the world’s attention, I urge you not to lose sight of the many other crises in which people are suffering., In Afghanistan, more than half the population is in need, with widespread malnutrition and a surge in measles, among many other challenges., In Ethiopia, the blockade of 6 million people in Tigray for almost 500 days has created a catastrophic food and health crisis., In the Syrian Arab Republic, more than 12 million people are in need of health assistance, almost half of them children., And in Yemen, roughly two-thirds of the population, more than 20 million people, are estimated to be in need of health assistance., Mr President, in every case, the only solution is peace. Our world needs peace more than ever., As if COVID is not enough, to have a devastating war like this is dangerous for the world., I thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-director-generals-remarks-united-nations-security-council-meeting-ukraine-17
Ukraine War Is Becoming the Fastest-Growing Humanitarian Crisis Since World War II,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Food and Nutrition
Health",16 Mar 2022,"From mental health needs to food shortages to logistical issues, the needs and challenges are greater than ever., By Andrew Schroeder, Paul M. Sherer, As of Tuesday morning, the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees reports that roughly 3 million people have fled from Ukraine into neighboring countries. The top destination country remains Poland at over 1.8 million, and Moldova based on normalized population. Recently, the influx rate from Ukraine has slowed from a peak of roughly 200,000 per day to approximately 50,000 per day., CrisisReady, a joint project of Harvard University and Direct Relief, has been analyzing mobility data from Meta, linked to an analysis of the Facebook social connectedness index. That analysis tends to indicate a pronounced westward flow of refugees towards areas of western Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. This aligns well with social connectedness, as well as congregation occurring in major cities., Warsaw and Krakow in Poland recently announced that reception of new refugees in those cities would be difficult, given the current numbers of arrivals. Increasingly Ukrainians are spreading throughout the European Union, particularly to the Czech Republic and Germany., Recently the team at REACH, a humanitarian initiative providing data to aid actors, was able to conduct interviews with displaced persons at the border checkpoints for each neighboring country. According to their research, refugees were 85 percent female and 15 percent male. Seventy-three percent of interview respondents reported traveling principally in groups of one to four, with a much smaller number traveling alone (11%) or in groups of five or more (16%). Ninety percent of respondents were Ukrainian, with 4% of Russian nationality, 1% Moldovan, and 5% another nationality., In addition, just one percent reported traveling with a pregnant or lactating woman, and 4% reported traveling with a person with a disability. Eight percent reported traveling with an elderly person over the age of 65, with 49% traveling with children under 18., According to respondents, their principal destinations outside of the neighboring countries included Germany and the Czech Republic – and 56% intended to stay with family or friends – which aligns quite well with the social connectedness analysis above., According to the Protection Cluster and the International Organization for Migration, the official number of internally displaced persons within Ukraine is approaching 2 million. Most of those people have fled from the north, east, and south of Ukraine, which are principally affected by Russian attacks and have moved towards areas bordering western Ukraine. Zakarpatska and Lvivska oblasts (districts) have received a disproportionate share of IDPs., A range of humanitarian corridors continues to be opened up for Ukrainian cities under bombardment to allow civilians to flee. As of Tuesday morning, there were officially nine such corridors open across the country. However, according to repeated reports, those corridors are coming under attack or are otherwise declared unsafe for mass evacuations., The situation in Mariupol is considered to be the most extreme, with accusations from the Ukrainian government and the Red Cross that the corridor for that city remains closed and that residents are at risk of starvation as a result., HEALTH SITUATION, According to the World Health Organization’s most recent situation report, issued on March 11, the principal public health issues facing Ukrainians remain physical trauma and conflict-related wounds. Following that concern, the WHO is calling attention to:, Non-communicable diseases, particularly insofar as supplies of insulin for diabetics, cancer medications, and other supplies for cardiovascular disease are now disrupted or in extreme scarcity,, Emergence and spread of infectious disease including polio due to the disrupted polio vaccination campaign; TB and HIV/AIDS due to disruptions of access to treatment facilities and drug supplies; Covid-19 due to low vaccination rates and the inability under current circumstances to practice most conventional infection control protocols; as well as risks of diarrheal diseases due to widespread damage to water and sanitation facilities,, Mental health impacts related to displacement and war-related trauma,, Protection issues including human trafficking and gender-based violence, and, Risks posed specifically to pregnant mothers and newborn children. WHO is estimating that 80,000 infants will be born in the next three months within Ukraine., WHO is working with Direct Relief and other humanitarian groups to solve many of the critical supply shortages for NCDs mentioned above. The organization says it has established logistical connections outside Ukraine to all major Ukrainian cities. It has also set up an emergency epidemic surveillance system, which focuses on event-based syndromic reporting, and is expanding its focus on mapping health facilities and integrating damage/status assessments into facility mapping., Medical oxygen continues to be a high-priority need. A Ministry of Health/WHO working group on medical oxygen has been established and will be calculating needs and issuing guidance on oxygen distribution across the country., The WHO is establishing its first field hospital in Lviv and planning several others throughout western Ukraine., Additionally, WHO facilities are being set up in the refugee-receiving countries to reduce pressure on the health systems in those countries. Medical supply assessments for each bordering country are ongoing and should be considered a priority., FOOD, NUTRITION, AND LOGISTICS, The World Food Programme estimates that 12 million people within Ukraine require immediate food assistance. The most immediate concern in this regard is the situation in cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kherson, and parts of Kyiv, which are at least partially encircled and besieged, reducing sharply their ability to move food and other essential supplies into those areas. In addition to the closure of logistics corridors, an estimated 750,000 people have lost access to electricity or natural gas supplies, which has reduced their ability to cook and posed significant challenges for heating during a period of frigid temperatures., Apart from the conditions within Ukrainian cities, the principal concern related to food remains the curtailment of international food shipments from both Ukraine and Russia. A couple of days ago, Russia announced that they would be suspending the export of most cereal crops, which affects a large share of the world population and depends on Russian and Ukrainian exports., In a recent piece in The Guardian, representatives from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization called attention to the severe risks posed by rising food prices throughout many of the world’s poorest regions as a result of the ongoing war. Global wheat prices recently hit all-time highs, with additional concerns regarding corn and other crops. They also called attention to the central role of Russia and Ukraine as fertilizer exporters, which in turn has a ripple effect on agricultural production throughout much of the world., While the food crisis is not a top-level issue yet, the longer the war goes on, the more serious these disruptions will become, with longer-lasting effects across the world., MEETING NEEDS AND CHALLENGES, With five million people displaced in less than three weeks, the flood of Ukrainian refugees and internally displaced persons has grown faster than any crisis since World War II. For humanitarian aid organizations and multilateral agencies, the situation requires a similarly unprecedented speed and magnitude of response., Direct Relief is doing what it does in every major disaster to which it responds, but at a much larger scale: mobilizing and delivering medicine and other medical aid to the people who urgently need it and providing support to trusted local health providers., Because the human toll of the war will be long-lasting, Direct Relief is building channels for efficiently securing and delivering large volumes of medical aid over an extended period., The organization is arranging direct deliveries from pharmaceutical manufacturers and warehouses across Europe to Ukraine, most often via Poland, securing space in pharmaceutical warehouses, including refrigerated facilities, and working closely with local logistics companies. The organization is also planning a series of chartered cargo flights from the US., At least initially, securing medicine may be less of a hurdle than the logistics of getting it to the people who need it. Direct Relief has received unprecedented pledges of support from many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical supply distributors. Enough medical material has been offered in California alone to fill multiple chartered jumbo jets, which Direct Relief is now arranging., Large aid shipments over the last two weeks have arrived safely in Ukraine. Still, with a flood of relief supplies headed to the region, there is an increasing risk of bottlenecks, including a limited supply of trucks, delays at border crossings, and security threats inside Ukraine., To date, the largest recipient of Direct Relief aid in the crisis has been Ukraine’s Ministry of Health. Poland’s Government Agency for Strategic Reserves is expected to play an increasingly important role in upcoming shipments; it coordinates incoming aid deliveries and acts as a logistics agent to receive cargo and transfer it to Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-becoming-fastest-growing-humanitarian-crisis-world-war-ii
Ukraine: Council approves swift release of cohesion resources to help refugees,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"The Council today endorsed a legislative proposal that will mobilise cohesion policy funding to assist refugees fleeing Russia’s military aggression., The measure will also reinforce member states’ ongoing efforts to tackle the extended impact of the COVID-19 pandemic., The European Union has already welcomed nearly three million displaced persons, mostly women and children, fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A place to stay, essential necessities, access to healthcare, transport, education and employment – Europe has to abide by its values for the Ukrainian people. The swift release of cohesion resources for the displaced persons will allow member states, especially those on the frontline of the crisis, to urgently allocate funding to help the displaced Ukrainians as much as possible. This was the strong commitment made by the EU leaders when they met at Versailles on 10 and 11 March, and now we are proud to live up to this commitment., Joël Giraud, French minister for territorial cohesion and relations with territorial communities, The proposal on Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) amends two legislative acts to provide for exceptional and targeted changes to the overall 2014-2020 legal framework governing the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived (FEAD)., It also introduces extra flexibility in reallocation of funding and extends by one accounting year the 100% financing from the EU budget for cohesion programmes, a measure initially introduced in 2020 to help the COVID-19 recovery., This means that member states will be able to speed up the deployment of all unprogrammed funding under the 2014-2020 period. Additionally, they can use the €10 billion 2022 tranche under REACT-EU, one of the largest post-pandemic EU public investment programmes., The main elements of the proposal include:, additional flexibility to transfer resources between programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund for addressing the migratory challenges due to Russia’s military aggression;, new flexibility to amend programmes under the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived (FEAD);, the start date for the new measures eligible for funding under CARE is set at 24 February 2022, the date of the Russian invasion;, extension of 100% financing from the EU budget for the 2021-2022 accounting year. In order to comply with the payment ceilings in years 2022 and 2023, the total additional payments will be capped at €5 billion in 2022 and €1 billion in 2023., Bearing in mind the urgency of the human and economic impact of the refugee inflow, the Council decided to endorse the text of the proposal without amendment., Background and next steps, On 8 March the European Commission proposed the CARE regulation. The proposal aims to alleviate the burden on national and regional budgets from the unprecedented migratory pressure, especially in the EU’s eastern regions, resulting from the unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine. It also takes into account the extended economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the EU as a whole., Following today’s endorsement by the Council, the European Parliament is expected to use the urgent procedure for the approval of the proposal. The legislative act is expected to be adopted in early April and will enter into force with immediate effect., Proposal as regards Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE), EU response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Press contacts

Ukraine: Council adopts negotiating mandate to unlock additional support under the home affairs funds,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"EU ambassadors today agreed the Council’s negotiating mandate on a proposal to amend the 2014-2020 home affairs funds and 2021-2027 asylum, migration and integration fund. This amendment, put forward through a fast-track process, will provide extra resources for the reception of persons fleeing the war in Ukraine., The proposed text will extend by one year the implementation period of the 2014-2020 home affairs funds and unlock access to unspent amounts in the asylum and migration fund which had previously been earmarked for other purposes. This will enable member states to urgently use the remaining funds to help address the mass influx of persons fleeing the war and is expected to release around €420 million in additional support from unused funds., The text also provides member states and other public or private donors with the possibility to make additional financial contributions under the 2021-2027 fund as external assigned revenue. This external assigned revenue will allow to finance asylum and migration activities in member states during crises, including those arising from the invasion of Ukraine., Background, On 24 February 2022, Russian armed forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a result, substantial areas of Ukrainian territory now constitute areas of armed conflict from which thousands of persons are fleeing. On that same day, the European Council condemned Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and demanded Russia’s full respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence., The EU has shown, and will continue to show, its resolute support for Ukraine and its citizens. On 4 March the Council unanimously adopted an implementing decision introducing temporary protection for persons fleeing the war. On 8 March the Commission presented, among other measures, a proposal to amend the home affairs funds to unlock extra resources for member states to ensure adequate reception facilities and effective procedures., Press contacts

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, As hostilities rage on, civilian casualties have risen to 1,900 as of 15 March – including 726 killed – according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). These figures are likely much higher as reports are still being corroborated amid increasingly intense country-wide clashes., Since 15 March, the geographic scope of the hostilities has expanded to localities previously not directly affected. In Odeska oblast (south), the villages of Bilenke, Lebedivka, Sanzheika and Zatoka – all of which are located around 30 km south of the country’s third-largest city, Odesa – have been shelled. At the same time, Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) has come under attack while people fleeing Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) arrive in the city en masse., Nearly 4.9 million people have been forcibly displaced by the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, including more than 3 million who have fled the country. Since 24 February, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says more than 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine – 75,000 on average per day. Abuse, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and trafficking risks continue to mount amid wide-scale displacement., The socio-economic impacts of the ongoing hostilities threaten to reverse decades of hard-earned development and poverty reduction gains. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) projects that in the worst-case scenario – a deepening and protraction of ongoing hostilities – an alarming 90 per cent of the Ukrainian population could face poverty and extreme economic vulnerability., On 15 March, municipal authorities in Mariupol said around 20,000 people left the city ravaged by hostilities in approximately 4,000 private vehicles. Still, around 350,000-400,000 residents remain trapped in the city as critical supplies, including food, water and life-saving medicines, continue to dry up., As millions are now on the move, forced to shelter in crowded spaces with limited sanitation facilities and access to health services, the risk of infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19, cholera, polio, tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases, continues to rise., SITUATION OVERVIEW, On 15 March, the Ukrainian Parliament approved the extension of martial law across the country until 25 April. As hostilities rage on, civilian casualties have risen to 1,900 as of 15 March – including 726 killed – according to OHCHR. These figures are likely much higher as reports are still being corroborated amid increasingly intense country-wide clashes., Since 15 March, the geographic scope of the hostilities has expanded to localities previously not directly affected. In Odeska oblast, the villages of Bilenke, Lebedivka, Sanzheika and Zatoka – all of which are located around 30 km south of the country’s third-largest city, Odesa – have been shelled, raising fears of an imminent attack on the strategic port city., Overnight on 15-16 March, air raid sirens and the sound of explosions rang out in Kyiv following the imposition of a 35-hour curfew in the capital that runs until 7 a.m. (EET) on 17 March. In Kyiv, several multiple-storey residential apartment buildings were hit by shelling again early on 16 March in the Podilskyy and Sviatoshynskyy districts, leaving at least five dead, says the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU)., In Kyivska oblast (north), six towns and villages are reportedly without centralized heating, and 12 have been cut off from the water supply due to active hostilities. The most difficult situation is in Vyshhorodskyy district and the settlement of Borodianka and nearby communities. Reportedly, a humanitarian convoy previously announced for 15 March has yet to reach these areas, yet is still unable to get to those most in need while civilians cannot leave amid active hostilities., In Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast, east), several apartments in two residential buildings were destroyed early on 16 March, killing at least two civilians, according to SESU. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (east), OHCHR reports 780 casualties (143 killed and 463 injured in Government-controlled areas (GCA), and 43 killed and 131 injured in non-Governmentcontrolled areas (NGCA) and 1,120 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., In southern Ukraine, Khersonska oblast authorities say around 31,000 people remain without electricity and water, while more than 20,300 people do not have access to natural gas supply. Across Ukraine, the Ministry of Energy reports that more than 928,000 users are now without electricity, and 259,000 users have been cut off from gas supplies. In this regard, the areas hardest hit include Chernihivska (north), Donetska, Kyivska, Mykolaivska (south) and Zaporizka oblasts., Meanwhile, early on 16 March in the northern city of Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast), at least 10 civilians were killed after being caught in the crossfire while standing in line for bread. In Vinnytsia (Vinnytska oblast, central and western part of Ukraine), a TV tower was hit on 16 March, temporarily suspending on-air broadcasting in surrounding areas. This latest targeted attack on Vinnytsia comes just ten days after airstrikes destroyed the city’s airport., The socio-economic impacts of the ongoing hostilities threaten to reverse decades of hard-earned gains made in development and poverty reduction in Ukraine. On 15 March, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced that preliminary estimates of reconstruction costs were a staggering US$565 billion. UNDP projects that in the worst-case scenario – a deepening and protraction of ongoing hostilities – an alarming 90 per cent of the Ukrainian population could face poverty and extreme economic vulnerability. UNDP, echoing calls from the UN Crisis Coordinator to promote scaledup multi-purpose cash interventions in Ukraine, says that approximately $250 million per month would be needed to cover partial income losses for around 2.6 million people expected to fall into poverty., Nearly 4.9 million people have been displaced by the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, including more than 3 million who have fled across international borders. Since 24 February, UNICEF says more than 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine – 75,000 children per day on average. According to the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, as of 16 March, more than 348 educational facilities were damaged and 63 completely destroyed, although this figure has yet to be verified., In this context, the risk of SGBV in areas experiencing ongoing hostilities and among the displaced population continues to rise. Considering that most displaced people are children and women, many of whom travel alone, the risk of abuse and trafficking remains relatively high, with increasing reports of sexual harassment and violence being received by partners., On 15 March, municipal authorities say around 20,000 people left the city of Mariupol in approximately 4,000 private vehicles. Still, around 350,000-400,000 residents remain trapped in the city as critical supplies, including food, water and life-saving medicines, continue to dry up. At the time of writing, according to Zaporizka Oblast Authorities, nearly 4,330 people, including more than 1,000 children, have safely arrived in the city of Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast) after fleeing Mariupol on 15 March. As people fleeing Mariupol arrive en masse, Zaporizhzhia came under attack for the first time yesterday., In total, on 15 March, nearly 29,000 people were evacuated through seven out of nine agreed-upon evacuation corridors, according to the Government of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reports that it has so far evacuated around 271,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia. The UN does not have the means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-16-march-2022-enruuk

Mitigating the Gendered Effects of Ukraine’s Refugee Crisis,Analysis,ICG,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",16 Mar 2022,"Simon Schlegel
Senior Analyst, Ukraine, Over three million Ukrainians have fled the Russian invasion that began on 24 February. While EU states have granted arrivals real benefits, Kyiv’s rule holding back conscription-age men increases dangers to the families leaving. States should ensure that all refugees get the help they need., More than three million refugees have left Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in the early hours of 24 February. The people fleeing are mostly women, children and the elderly, because Kyiv has forbidden men between the ages of eighteen and 60 to leave. This policy is understandable in the face of the existential threat the invasion poses to the country. But it may make the refugees' journey into the unknown more dangerous and the task of rebuilding their lives much harder. Nor does it appear yet to have contributed much to Ukraine's actual fighting capacity, since so many women and men have voluntarily stayed behind, eager to take up arms in their country's defence. In the long run, Ukraine's defence will depend as much on the morale of its troops and their willingness to fight as on sheer numbers -- though, for now, Ukraine appears unlikely to be short of volunteers any time soon. The Ukrainian government should reconsider its approach and work with partner nations to make sure that its citizens continue to be welcomed regardless of age or gender., Generally, the Ukrainians now arriving in European Union (EU) countries are finding better conditions than refugees in earlier crises. Amid an outpouring of solidarity with Ukraine throughout Europe, the European Commission on 2 March adopted a right to stay approach for the first time since the measure was developed in 2001. This legal instrument allows Ukrainian refugees to travel freely within the EU's borders, to stay where they choose, to work legally and to get access to social services. The right to stay, although limited to one year, will spare Ukrainian refugees the experience of being trapped for months in the asylum systems of the country in which they first arrive. State railway companies in many EU countries and some airlines have made Ukrainian refugees' travel easier by letting them ride for free., Only women, children and the elderly can profit from Europe's open doors., In practice, however, only women, children and the elderly can profit from Europe's open doors. The Ukrainian government declared martial law right away on 24 February, and the border guard announced, without further explanation, that it would not allow men of military age out of the country as long as martial law remains in force., These restrictions, meant to reinforce Ukraine's fighting capability, instead have deepened the unfolding humanitarian crisis. In principle, it might make sense to subordinate humanitarian considerations to the military logic that able-bodied men must be on standby should they be needed at the front. But so far, there is little indication that this logic is right. Outside Russian state media, whose reporting on the war is obviously suspect, there is no sign that Ukrainian soldiers are abandoning their positions. To the contrary, the Ukrainian ministry of defence reports that more than 60,000 citizens have returned from the diaspora to enlist. Many thousands of other Ukrainian volunteers have chosen to fight., The emphasis on men also seems outdated. Nearly a quarter of the army's work force are women, and the ratio of female soldiers in combat roles almost doubled from around 6 per cent in 2014, when war began with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, to over 10 per cent in 2019. The Territorial Defence Units, civilian reserves that signed up tens of thousands of new recruits during the first week of the present Russian attack, assign women and men the same sets of duties. From the invasion's early days, women have played a significant role in civilian resistance as well, in some cases by literally standing in the way of Russian troops. Facilitating the evacuation of women and children while making men stay behind against their will seems unnecessary., The EU's guidance on border checks suggests waiving restrictions on taking pets across the border so that refugees do not have to choose between seeking safety and leaving beloved cats or dogs behind. In contrast, due to Kyiv's travel ban for men, many Ukrainian families have faced the agonising choice between finding refuge and splitting up. Some affected families postpone this decision and remain in harm's way., For people who have to make such quick, consequential decisions, the ins and outs of travel bans and mobilisation require more transparent communication by the army. Whether and under what circumstances men can be involuntarily enlisted remains the subject of rumour. For instance, in the western border town of Uzhgorod, stories circulate that recruiters are seeking out single men staying at hotels. At a press conference on 15 March, the army's chief recruiter had to deny accusations that internally displaced men were targeted more often than locals. Even if one has sorted out the rules, the soldiers operating some fifteen military checkpoints now dotting the road from Kyiv to the western border may not agree with one's interpretation. A Kyiv man who drove his family to safety reported that every checkpoint not only creates its own traffic jam, but also comes with the fear of ending up on a conscription list., These dynamics create new vulnerabilities. In the few cases where men have been caught trying to buy their way out of Ukraine, the bribes reached $2,100, about five times the average monthly pay in the country. Those who did not get caught likely paid a higher price, meaning that the poorest men may be the most vulnerable to dubious smuggling schemes. Those who left the most dangerous cities for the relative safety of western Ukraine may lie low, hoping to avoid conscription. Amid the swelling numbers of internally displaced people, these men will struggle to find work and housing. One NGO worker who helps those displaced to small towns and villages in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region observed that internally displaced men who cannot leave the country but are not subject to mobilisation often face hostility from locals who perceive them as draft dodgers., For the women, children and elderly people allowed to leave, family separation will make it harder to start from scratch in the receiving country (although it will also help ensure they have a strong incentive to return). The separated families will need to cover living expenses in two locations, while refugee mothers will have to shoulder child care responsibilities and earn an income by themselves. On the journey to refuge, separated families are in greater peril of being targeted by thieves and other predators, in part because they are perceived as ""unprotected"" by men. Women and children arriving in a foreign country with few assets and no social network may face dangers from human trafficking, exploitation and sexual violence. As the perils of travel through a war zone are so unpredictable, many people may opt for the known risk of staying in their homes in increasingly beleaguered cities., Various ethnic and social groups face very specific challenges as they seek refuge. Many Ukrainians of Roma origin, who often suffer discrimination in Ukraine, may have no documentation of identity or citizenship. Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians of colour have reported mistreatment from both Ukrainian authorities and those in host countries as they flee. LGBTQI people risk a less warm welcome in Poland and Hungary, the two largest receiving countries. Both the Polish and Hungarian governments have adopted homophobic and transphobic legislation. Trans women are forbidden to leave Ukraine if their documents identify them as men., As the victim of an unprovoked assault, Ukraine has remained firmly on the right side of the moral narrative. Now, in the focus of the world’s attention as never before, it should guard this position. The overwhelming readiness of Ukrainian men and women to fight for their country to the best of their abilities should instil confidence in the government that it will not run out of committed defenders. Kyiv should rescind its ban on travel for men of military age. Men wanting to leave can make the country more resilient by remaining with their families and contributing to their safety and well-being. Kyiv should also do everything in its power to ensure that everyone fleeing receives equal treatment., Europe was right to lower the barriers for Ukrainian refugees. As the war intensifies, granting safe passage to civilians who want to leave should become a matter of course. As Ukrainian policymakers reverse measures leading to involuntary family separations, their counterparts in host countries should ensure that everyone arriving from Ukraine receives adequate protection, with special care for those who might face specific risks. As more refugees come to EU countries and their financial needs mount, the welcome mat may begin to wear thin. Giving those who arrive now as good a start as possible is essential in preparing for the long haul.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mitigating-gendered-effects-ukraine-s-refugee-crisis

Ukraine: Respect the Rights of Prisoners of War,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Mar 2022,"Published Footage of Captured Soldiers Violates Geneva Conventions, (Berlin) -- Ukrainian authorities should stop posting on social media and messaging apps videos of captured Russian soldiers that expose them to public curiosity, in particular those that show them being humiliated or intimidated, Human Rights Watch said today. Such treatment of prisoners of war, or POWs, violates protections under the Geneva Conventions intended to ensure dignified treatment of captured combatants on all sides., The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the main security arm of the Ukrainian government, has a Telegram account with about 868,000 subscribers where it has posted videos of captured Russian soldiers who appear under duress or are revealing their names, identification numbers, and other personal information, including their parents' names and home addresses. It shares these videos on its Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram pages with roughly 978,000 combined followers and subscribers. A Telegram channel apparently run by the Internal Affairs Ministry with over 847,000 subscribers does the same and has an affiliated website and YouTube channel., ""The obligation to protect POWs from being objects of public curiosity, as well as protecting them from intimidation or humiliation, is part of the broader requirement to ensure their humane treatment and protect their families from harm,"" said Aisling Reidy, Senior Legal Advisor at Human Rights Watch. ""The Ukrainian authorities should stop posting these videos online."", Social media platforms should also clarify whether and how videos of POWs that are incompatible with the Geneva Conventions fall under their existing policies and, if necessary, develop new policies to identify and suppress the spread of such content, Human Rights Watch said., Human Rights Watch wrote to the Security Service and Interior Ministry on March 10, 2022 to express concern about the state-run social media channels and website that were posting the images and videos and asked what steps the authorities will take to ensure that POWs are treated in compliance with the Geneva Conventions. As of March 16, Human Rights Watch was still awaiting a reply., The various Security Service accounts have posted dozens of videos of captured Russian soldiers, some of which show them being interrogated while bound. Most clearly show the prisoner's face, or the prisoners state their name or other personal information, such as their date of birth and parents' names., One video with 2.2 million views on the SBU's Telegram channel shows a captured Russian soldier on the phone with his mother, and then another POW who under interrogation gives his name, birth date, and details on his military unit. A video on the security service Facebook page with over 5.4 million views shows a POW with a battered face and bandaged leg saying that he went through Belarus to Chernobyl, 90 kilometers north of Kyiv., The Telegram channel, YouTube channel, and website apparently run by the Interior Ministry, all created on February 26, include a database with the names of Russian soldiers who were captured or killed in the war. An adviser to the Interior Ministry, Victor Andrusiv, said he is the manager of the website and affiliated channels. He said the purpose is to help the relatives identify captured and killed Russian soldiers., On these platforms, the ministry has posted hundreds of photos and videos of captured Russian soldiers, often with their passports and identification documents. Some of the soldiers are blindfolded, gagged, or masked. In some cases, the POWs are recorded while calling their family back home. In one video posted to Telegram on March 6 with 785,000 views, two POWs identified with their names and military unit are interrogated at gunpoint while blindfolded and on their knees., The platforms also show graphic images of dead Russian soldiers. The authenticity of all these photographs and videos cannot be verified., In a video posted to the ministry-run YouTube channel, Andrusiv commented on Ukraine's respect for the laws of war. ""We are committed to fulfilling the Geneva Conventions and have instructed all units to treat all prisoners with respect,"" he said. ""The general commander and the minister of internal affairs have adopted instructions based on the Geneva Conventions for all soldiers and policemen. We will monitor adherence to these instructions on a permanent basis."", The third Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I address the protection of POWs. They make clear that POWs must be treated humanely in all circumstances and protected against any act of violence, as well as against intimidation, insults, and public curiosity. This includes disclosure of photographs or videos, recordings of interrogations, private conversations or personal correspondence, and any other private data., The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has made clear that any material that allows viewers or readers to identify individual prisoners should not be transmitted, published, or broadcast. There are exemptions to the prohibition, but they are exceptional and allowed only if a compelling public interest exists, or if exposing the materials is in the prisoner's vital interest, and then only insofar as that respects the POW's dignity., The Ukrainian government should ensure that the ICRC has access to all prisoners of war and should work with the ICRC to ensure that all personal information and data on POWs is handled in accordance with the Geneva Conventions., All authorities in charge of POWs should also ensure that the official personnel are not taking photos or videos of prisoners other than for official purposes, and that official images or other personal information of prisoners are stored securely. Access to this material should only be allowed for personnel directly involved in the relevant duties. The use of these materials for any other purposes is strictly prohibited., The authorities should make all feasible efforts to identify and hold to account anyone who has posted images and videos of POWs on social media sites, particularly if they were also involved in taking or creating the images for other than official purposes, or misused images that were taken for official purposes., It is also important for the media to refrain from broadcasting or republishing material of POWs that violates the laws of war, Human Rights Watch said. Social media platforms should take steps to identify and suppress access to material that violates POWs' right to humane treatment, including protection from public curiosity., Human Rights Watch has also documented extensive laws-of-war violations and apparent war crimes by Russian forces, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians with cluster munitions and other weapons and preventing civilians from fleeing areas of fighting., ""The violations by Russian forces are pervasive and widespread, causing intense civilian harm,"" Reidy said. ""At the same time, Ukraine has clear obligations that it must uphold, including lawful treatment of POWs.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-respect-rights-prisoners-war

Due to the fighting, water pipes have been damaged. In many places, constant shelling and the threat of danger make it almost impossible to make repairs. Additionally, many places are entirely cut off from the water supply due to heavy fighting. A consequence of this is that people resort to sourcing water by catching rain or melted snow., ""Water has become a life-saving commodity in Ukraine at the moment. People are hiding in basements, shelters, garages and are dehydrated,"" says Jan Mrkvička, Director of People in Need's Humanitarian and Development Section., People in Need has sent a truckload of water containers directly from Prague. More trucks with water containers will follow shortly. In parts of Ukraine, there is water in wells. However, people often have no way to store it. Thus, PIN's provision of containers will make it possible to store water from underground wells and reservoirs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/people-need-working-get-aid-far-possible-eastern-ukraine-biggest-problem-drinking

Protection and Human Rights",16 Mar 2022,"Missionaries providing generators, food, medicines and medical supplies to those remaining in Ukraine, (MissionNewswire) Salesian missionaries around the globe are responding with aid and other support in Ukraine and the surrounding countries that are taking in refugees. More than 3 million people, mostly women and children, have already fled Ukraine, according to UNHCR, the U.N. Refugee Agency. Poland, which borders Ukraine to the west, has already taken in more than 1.8 million refugees with the number expected to climb. Salesians in Ukraine and in Poland are working on the front lines helping those in need., On the border between Ukraine and Poland, long lines of refugees form as people wait their turn to cross the border. Father Andrzej Król, delegate of youth ministry of the Poland-Krakow Province and directly involved in the field providing aid, said, ""It's cold, and it's hard here, for the mothers and children, who are the majority. Most of them don't know where to go. They go toward the unknown and they only know that once they have crossed the Polish border there are schools where they can spend their first night. We try to entertain the children, make them smile and offer them small things. I think it's important at this time."", Fr. Król added, ""Fortunately, I see small gestures of loving kindness---people who bring hot soup, sandwiches, coffee or tea and distribute them to people, who are very grateful, and you see the joy in their eyes, despite the tragic situation."", Father Krzysztof Grzendziński, economer of the Province of Poland-Warsaw, is in charge of supervising the implementation of activities, services and programs in the field in the Salesian provinces in Ukraine strongly affected by the mass exodus of civilians, as well as in Slovakia and four Salesian provinces in Poland., In addition to providing aid to refugees who are crossing the border, Salesian programs in many countries are accepting refugees into their centers, houses and programs. They are also working with local host families to accept refugees. In the Special Circumscription of Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta in Italy, Salesians have sent funding to Ukraine and identified 118 host families who are willing to take in refugees., The Don Bosco 2000 Association in Sicily, Italy, which works with the Salesians of Sicily, organized a bus trip to bring 48 women and children from Przemyśl, Poland, to Alcamo, Sicily. Some of the refugees will be housed in an association house while others will reside with 12 host families., In the Czech Republic, Salesians have taken in 200 refugees, offering meals and services. Salesians are providing economic aid, making cars available for transporting materials and people, and encouraging the inclusion of children in youth centers and schools. Salesians are also offering psychological and spiritual support., At St. Joseph's in Szczecin, Poland, 42 people are being housed in the boarding school. There are also 155 people staying in Salesian houses in the Krakow Province and 60 at the Krakow Seminary. Other Salesian centers in Poland are working to prepare for additional refugees. The Krakow Province is also sending aid directly to Ukraine. Eight buses with humanitarian aid carrying approximately 3 tons each, including 12 power generators, food, medicines and dressings, sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and hygiene products, were sent to Ukraine the week of March 7., Father Roman Sikon, with the Salesian Missionary Volunteer Service, is one of the transport drivers delivering aid to Ukraine. ""We hope our journey will be safe and we will come back soon for our next transport because our warehouses are slowly filling up."" Missionaries and their volunteers are providing generators, food, medicines and medical supplies to those remaining in Ukraine. People have been sheltering in Salesian churches and schools throughout the country., Father Andrzej Policht, a missionary in Ukraine, said, ""Our voluntary service works with various organizations and raises funds. We bring people, mainly mothers and children, from Kyiv and Zhytomyr to the border and then they are picked up at the border and are relocated to safety. We have to act and I encourage everyone to do something."", To financially support humanitarian aid and meet the needs of refugees, Salesian centers around the globe are setting up fundraising appeals and sending money to where it's needed most.

IOM warns of increased risk of trafficking in persons for people fleeing Ukraine,News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"Geneva – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is worried about the risk of trafficking in persons as well as sexual exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and the region as the number of vulnerable people fleeing the war continues to rise., Over three million people have fled Ukraine, including 162,000 third country nationals (TCNs). The deteriorating humanitarian situation and resulting large scale and complex movements correlate with an increase in threat to personal safety, putting people on the move at heightened risk of exploitation. While cases of human trafficking are less likely to be identified in the immediate aftermath of mass displacement, initial reports from within and outside of Ukraine indicate the potential for traffickers to exploit the vulnerabilities of those fleeing the war., Instances of sexual violence have already been reported and among the individuals promising onward transportation or services, there have been indications of potential exploitation. Individuals and community members providing transportation and accommodation assistance should do so in coordination with local protection agencies and should facilitate registration and share contact details, transportation routes, and accommodation locations to enable appropriate oversight and safeguarding., “IOM reports show that people fleeing Ukraine are predominately from single-headed households including women, children and older persons – some of whom are unaccompanied and separated –and third country nationals,” says IOM Director General António Vitorino., “These groups can be especially vulnerable to the risk of trafficking as they leave their homes unexpectedly and might have their usual family networks and financial security seriously disrupted.”, In 2021, IOM in Ukraine identified and assisted over 1,000 victims of trafficking. In response to the war in Ukraine, the Organization has scaled up its efforts to establish resources and interventions to prevent trafficking in persons both in Ukraine and among those on the move throughout the region., IOM is collaborating with border agencies and government partners to implement trafficking prevention mechanisms such as dissemination and inclusion of protection messaging, providing verified and safe information and raising awareness to empower refugees and third country nationals to make informed decisions and be aware of risks., The Organization has also reinforced regional hotlines to equip people on the move with important safety and resource information. IOM in Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova have developed online materials related to safe migration and counter-trafficking, which connect people fleeing Ukraine with vital accommodation, transportation, and trafficking reporting resources., We encourage States to receive arrivals from Ukraine in a non-discriminatory, gender-sensitive, and culturally sensitive manner, without bias based on nationality, ethnicity, or status of documentation. We stress the need for a collective response in terms of capacity building, appropriately collecting evidence, providing technical guidance, and above all, direct assistance to all victims and those vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and abuse., IOM also strongly recommends that third country nationals are granted protection and have access facilitated to their respective consular authorities.

Shelter and Non-Food Items",15 Mar 2022,"1. SNFI Situation Overview, The situation in Ukraine is very fluid as population movements within Ukraine are sporadic, unpredictable and difficult to track. Providing exact figures on internal displacement is not possible, however as of March 11th, the Protection Cluster estimates that there are 1.85 million internally displaced and rising, 12. 56 million estimated conflict affected people and around 6.7 million affected and at risk of displacement in the next 3 months. Additionally, over 2.5 million people have crossed international borders.
Access to Shelter and NFI support is first-line lifesaving and emergency response since people have lost their homes and belongings in the shelling and the freezing temperatures. The Flash Appeal, launched on 1 March stipulates $243 million for shelter and NFI support to 2.85 million people.
There is a lack of NFIs available in country due to logistical issues as available stocks and markets, and the purchasing capacity is insufficient to meet demand. Partners are importing stock and undertaking procurement – both options have limitations in terms of timeliness, small import volume availability and distribution challenges.

Providing exact figures on internal displacement is not possible, however as of March 11th, the Protection Cluster estimates that there are 1.85 million internally displaced and rising, 12. 56 million estimated conflict affected people and around 6.7 million affected and at risk of displacement in the next 3 months. Additionally, over 2.5 million people have crossed international borders.
Access to Shelter and NFI support is first-line lifesaving and emergency response since people have lost their homes and belongings in the shelling and the freezing temperatures. The Flash Appeal, launched on 1 March stipulates $243 million for shelter and NFI support to 2.85 million people.
There is a lack of NFIs available in country due to logistical issues as available stocks and markets, and the purchasing capacity is insufficient to meet demand.

UNHCR reports that more than 3 million refugees have already been forced to flee, with an additional 1.85 million individuals on the move inside the country. An estimated 12.65 million people live in areas worst affected by the conflict., As the need for humanitarian assistance and aid increases, JRS and the Jesuits continue to be actively involved in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries to welcome and provide assistance to those in need., Ukraine: providing a safe haven to those on the move, The Jesuit refugee house in Lviv welcomes displaced people as they look for a safe place to eat, rest, and warm up after days of travelling in dangerous conditions. It serves as a transit point, as many want to continue their journey. We provide beds, food, medicine, and access to laundry and bathrooms for all. We also accompany them with psychological and pastoral support, as many of them have relatives and friends in the area where hostilities are ongoing, which is a serious psychological burden for them., Poland: welcoming refugees where the need is the greatest, With over 1,8 million people, Poland continues to be the country receiving the highest influx of refugees, with reception capacity stretched to the maximum., Jesuit communities have opened their houses from the beginning to welcome arriving refugees and provide them with shelter and initial support, including children with cancer and other serious health concerns. To meet the growing needs, JRS is also collaborating with other religious congregations to find additional accommodation options. We want to provide hope to those whose lives have been abruptly disrupted, so we are already developing long-term plans to provide scholarships to children in Jesuit schools and kindergartens., Necessities and supplies are also being collected with support from Jesuit parishes to be sent to those in need In Ukraine., Romania: offering multidisciplinary support at the border, While at first many of the Ukrainians arriving in the country wanted to reach other destinations, more recently there has been a spike in numbers of people that want to stay in Romania. JRS continues to be present in Bucharest and at the borders to ensure accommodation, first necessities, and legal advice for those who want to seek asylum., The most urgent need remains finding appropriate accommodation for everyone, especially as we look now for medium and long-term accommodation, which is more complicated than provisional shelters. Fortunately, the response from the population has been overwhelmingly positive, with many families reaching out to our office to offer places to stay., In addition to providing essential needs like food and beds, JRS is also assisting with information and legal counselling., Hungary: building a network of hospitality, The local population continues to be very welcoming and involved, with the civil society providing accommodation and support. JRS is coordinating a network of different congregations to connect and match needs with accommodation options., The government Is gradually responding to the needs. As major reception centers are not open due to poor infrastructure, refugees are hosted in smaller facilities. Those who do not want to stay are able to quickly leave the country through organized means of transportation or established connections beyond. Railways are travelling for free all over the country., As JRS and the Jesuits continue to mobilise resources to provide aid and assistance, we join Pope Francis in calling for the immediate end of the conflict and in praying for the suffering people of Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-emergency-providing-continuous-response-humanitarian-needs-increase
"People trapped in Ukrainian cities are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, warns IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 Mar 2022,"New York, NY, March 16, 2022 — The IRC is extremely concerned about the millions of residents from Ukrainian cities affected by conflict including Mariupol, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Sumy who are now either displaced or living through the horrors of urban conflict. These people require urgent humanitarian assistance and are exposed to safety and security risks., In IRC's experience, besiegement almost always entails massive civilian suffering which has included attacks on civilians, critical infrastructure and denial of access - all violations of international humanitarian law. The IRC is doubly concerned given the violations of international law already being committed - such as the targeting of evacuation corridors and the attacks on hospitals. With a lack of clear data of how many people might be affected, the IRC is calling for immediate local ceasefires and humanitarian access to areas most affected., Bob Kitchen, Vice President of Emergencies at the IRC, said,, ""We've seen the humanitarian impact of not being able to reach people in besieged areas before and we must not allow the same to happen once again in Ukraine. During the Syria crisis, in places such as Eastern Ghouta, Yarmuk, Karaya, Foah and other hard-to-reach places, as many as 3.4 million people were without access to essential services and basic provisions due to continuing hostilities and denial of access. Whilst over 3 million refugees have already fled Ukraine, millions more remain inside the country, in need of urgent assistance., ""As in any conflict, civilians continue to bear the brunt both within Ukraine as well as those that have fled from the country. The humanitarian impact of this conflict is soaring as each day passes. 3 million people have fled Ukraine in the last 2 weeks, making this the fastest and largest displacement crisis this century. Our teams on the ground in Poland are reporting that people are crossing the border and arriving severely traumatized and freezing. We are extremely concerned for the safety and security risks for the many women and children that are arriving alone or becoming displaced within Ukraine. As urban areas increasingly fall under siege, the IRC is doubly fearful of witnessing the same cruel tactics inflicted on the populations of Aleppo and Idlib across Ukraine."", The IRC is calling for an immediate cessation of the conflict in order for humanitarian organizations to reach people in the most conflict-affected areas with critical humanitarian aid. Targeting of humanitarian corridors must cease at once - everyone seeking safety must be allowed to do so through safe and regular pathways., Through partners in Poland IRC is providing information services through an existing hotline, offering legal counseling and psychological support, and will facilitate access to services (through social workers, interpreters, and cultural assistants) to displaced people. Through partners in Ukraine IRC is also providing evacuation services and essential items to those that have become displaced according to individual needs. This could include blankets, sleeping bags, warm clothes or cash assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/people-trapped-ukrainian-cities-are-need-urgent-humanitarian-assistance-warns-irc

Civilian Harm in Ukraine,News and Press Release,PAX,"Mine Action
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Mar 2022,"PAX unequivocally condemns the invasion of Ukraine and calls for an immediate return of all Russian troops to outside Ukrainian sovereign territory. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces is a flagrant violation of international law, a crime against peace, and consequentially, Russia is primarily responsible for harm and damages caused by this unnecessary, uncalled for and violent attack. We recognise the right of Ukraine to protect its people and defend its sovereignty including its territorial integrity., We worry about the fate of all Ukrainian citizens regardless of their ethnic, religious, political or other affiliations as we see predictable patterns of civilian harm developing across Ukraine. Predictable because the repeated breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law at the hands of Russian forces and Russian backed forces that we have documented in the past decade in Ukraine and in other countries, such as Syria.[i], Fighting a war in 2022 means that evidence of what is happening, where and by whom is readily available to a global audience. Everything from advanced satellite imagery to mobile phone videos from regular civilians captures troop movements, airstrikes or the positioning of landmines, making it nearly impossible for Russian troops to obscure the harm they cause to civilians., PAX continues to work with local civilians, local civil society organisations, as well as international organisations specialising in civilian harm tracking and monitoring to independently document civilian harm, and we call on governments and international institutions to support efforts to make visible and appropriately respond to the harm done to civilians. This is important because it can:, · Give affected civilians a platform to share their experiences., · Facilitate the protection of civilians throughout Ukraine inclusively and without prejudice., · Support the efforts of civilians and first responders to act in support of civilians where possible., · Support the mapping of diverse types of harm and damages in support of future reconstruction and development of an independent and free Ukraine., · Support future efforts to hold perpetrators of violence to account for the suffering and damages they now cause., · Highlight immediate and long-term risks for an environmental disaster linked-with targeting nuclear and chemical facilities and long-term pollution that can affect lives and livelihoods., · Increase understanding of the effects of the use of certain weapons on civilians, in support of the development of international standards and norm for better protection of civilians and their environment., Growing evidence of civilian harm in Ukraine, Monitoring the conduct of hostilities in Ukraine as reported by many different sources, it is with deep sadness and great concern that we conclude that many international laws, rules of war, principles in international humanitarian law and norms of international solidarity have been purposively violated, resulting in over one and a half thousand civilian casualties, widespread damages to civilian infrastructure and millions of internally displaced persons and refugees. [ii] Our gravest concerns include, but are not limited to:, The use of explosive weapons in populated areas. PAX is extremely concerned about reported civilian deaths and injuries, and the damage to schools, hospitals, houses, electricity facilities and water installations resulting from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. Most of the casualties have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.[iii] The use of inaccurate delivery systems, multiple munitions, and/or munitions that create a large blast and fragmentation radius, should be avoided, as it carries with it a high likelihood of indiscriminate effects, as the ICRC points out.[iv] When used in populated areas, research indicates that worldwide nine out of ten casualties from explosive weapons use are civilians.[v] Negotiations on an international political declaration to prevent this harm are ongoing, under the presidency of Ireland. We call upon Russia to cease all attacks with wide area effect explosive weapons in towns and cities and the international community to better protect civilians from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas in Ukraine and elsewhere by supporting a strong political declaration., The use of cluster munitions. Russian forces have used cluster munitions in civilian areas, such as Kharkiv in Ukraine.[vi] The use of cluster munitions gravely endangers the civilian population both during and after the conflict as unexploded bomblets do not distinguish between military and civilians. Their unexploded submunitions will create de facto minefields that can kill for decades. Russia has a long history of using these weapons. In 2008, during the invasion of Georgia, the Russian military saturated much of the countryside with cluster bombs. Again, during the war in Syria there have been widespread reports of Russian cluster munitions killing civilians throughout the country.[vii] In 2008, much of the world banded together to outlaw the use of cluster munitions including most NATO states. Today, 123 states joined the treaty and only a few notable holdouts continue to use these indiscriminate killers., The use of landmines. Reports indicate corridors for civilians to flee have been mined.[viii] The purposeful mining of civilian escape routes is shocking and puts civilians at great risk. Ukraine is a party to the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT), banning anti-personnel landmines and while there are no reports of the use of these banned weapons it appears that Ukraine has used anti-tank landmines (not banned by the MBT) in its defensive posture.[ix] Video on YouTube and Twitter broadcast on 25 Feb show the emplacement of anti-tank landmines in Odessa.[x] Currently 164 nations have joined the MBT, outlawing these indiscriminate killers.[xi] Although Russia is not party to the Mine Ban Treaty, the use of any weapon in an indiscriminate way is unlawful.. Even though Anti-vehicle mines are not banned per se, their use will pose severe risks to civilians moving across or living close to areas contaminated with mines now, and in the future. Additionally, the Ukrainian forces were not observed to keep records of the locations of the mines for later removal., The use of incendiary weapons. There are reports Russia has used incendiary weapons in Ukraine. On March 5 multiple accounts on Twitter posted images of unexploded Russian incendiary bombs in populated areas in Ukraine.[xii] The use of incendiary weapons can create tremendous harm to civilians, especially when used in populated areas.[xiii] Their use is regulated in Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which restricts the use of incendiary weapons on “concentrations of civilians” and “forests or other kinds of plant cover.[xiv] The reported use in Ukraine on a populated area by Russia likely violates Protocol III on Incendiary Weapons, which Russia is a Party to.[xv], The obstruction of free passage for civilians. Russian forces have repeatedly blocked civilians attempting to move out of conflict affected zones.[xvi] The rules of war dictate that all parties to conflict take all precautions to avoid harming civilians, to always consider civilians as civilians, and in all places in the country. Safe passage for those willing and able to escape should be urgently assured across war-affected areas inside Ukraine, regardless of the existence of humanitarian corridors or ceasefires that may temporarily be put in place. In addition, we are concerned by the many reports of violence and racism civilians from Ukraine who are not ethnically Caucasian face when they try to find safety in or outside Ukraine.[xvii], The targeting of civilian structures. Multiple reports detail how Russian attacks on populated areas have resulted in direct hits on apartment buildings, shops and other civilian structures.[xviii] While it is not always clear if Russia hit those buildings on purpose or through carelessness**[xix]**, Russia must apply more stringently the principle of distinction, take every precautionary measure to avoid civilian structures, and publicly assume responsibility for targeting mistakes. Russia has no public policy on Civilian Harm Mitigation; the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by militaries to protect civilians during military operations, track civilian harm, and mitigate future harm through the application of lessons learned., The targeting of essential infrastructure and services without a military function or qualifying as a building with dual purpose use. In case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.[xx] Most concerning are the rapidly growing number of images of Russian attacks on school buildings and protected places such as hospitals.[xxi] We are gravely concerned by the attack on Ukrainian hospitals especially because of Russia’s long history of targeting hospitals and medical personnel in Syria.[xxii] The United Nations has documented numerous hospitals destroyed by Russian airstrikes in Syria.[xxiii] These grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, whether in Syria or in Ukraine must always be investigated as potential war crimes and if purposeful those involved must be brought to justice. Russia must apply more stringently the principle of distinction; take every precautionary measure to avoid damage to civilian structures; and publicly assume responsibility for targeting mistakes., The environmental risks associated with the conflict. Beyond the dire direct humanitarian consequences of the conflict, a larger ecological threat awaits. Damages to power infrastructure resulting in water pumping system failings, puts the many mines in Ukraine storing toxic and nuclear waste at risks from flooding. Attacks on water facilities create risk to the environment for the amounts of chloride normally stored in these locations may leak into the environment. Attacks on fuel depots, especially when located in civilian poses larger public health risk to civilians in case of an explosion and subsequent fire and spills that could direct impact communities. Blasts from attacks on various ammunition depots and the subsequent spread of ammunition remnants can pose acute and chronic environmental health risks from exposure to toxic munitions remnants. Attacks on several nuclear industry sites, pose risks for radiation. Damage to locations storing or processing hazardous materials such as warehouses or factories can create environmental risks in Ukraine too. All the above has been observed in Ukraine already. [xxiv], The lack of discipline shown by troops. Multiple reports indicate Russia is sending soldiers into Ukraine who are young, and not properly prepared for warfighting in the complex urban environment.[xxv] This raises concerns about the level of guidance and doctrine these soldiers receive on international law and the mitigation of civilian harm. This leads to unnecessary and disproportional violence against and exploitation of civilians., The threat of use of weapons of mass destruction. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat of use of nuclear weapons was heard, and clear.[xxvi] Any use of nuclear weapons, tactical or strategic will lead to unacceptable harmful consequences for civilians, who may be affected by the blast immediately, by radioactive fallout in the short term, and by radioactive contamination in the long run. An attack using nuclear weapons will by default violate the IHL principle of proportionality.[xxvii] Furthermore, the threat of use of nuclear weapons in any other context than self-defence in case of an existential threat, is widely considered illegal.[xxviii], The use of disinformation. The rampant misrepresentations actively disseminated by Russia and supporting entities can place civilians in harm's way by disrupting access to services or by leading them to act in ways counter to their own interests. In addition, disinformation may undermine the efforts of humanitarian organizations providing relief to beleaguered civilians. Disinformation can also cause additional psychological stress and can be traumatic, damaging and enduring.[xxix], The improper use of uniforms of the adversary. Several reports indicate that Russian troops have dressed up as Ukrainian troops and commandeered Ukrainian military vehicles to confuse Ukrainian defence forces.[xxx] This type of treachery violates IHL Customary Rule 62 on the improper use of flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of the adversary**[xxxi]**, and poses unacceptable dangers for civilians, including civilians who attempt to get to safety and have a right of safe passage., The arming of civilians. It is widely reported that some civilians have received arms from the Ukrainian military**[xxxii]** but have not received uniforms or insignia clearly distinguishing them as combatants. This poses a risk to those civilians and others. Civilians taking up arms can risk direct participation in hostilities which can make them a legitimate target for Russian invading forces, a situation Russian troops may seek to exploit to their benefit. It may also put non-armed civilians at risk. In addition, history shows us that handing out arms to civilians can lead to people exploiting the breakdown of government services for criminal activities, exploitation and other dangers for civilians., General mobilisation of all men. Men are prohibited from leaving Ukraine, separated from families and forced to stay and resist occupation.[xxxiii] While it is understandable that Ukraine considers this conflict a fight for the existence of the country, it is concerning that men of all ages, walks of life, affiliations, physical and mental health are forced to resist invasion. We call on all military forces and authorities currently operating in Ukraine to protect the individual right of every man and woman to make a conscious decision to participate in the defence of Ukraine or not., We call on Russia to immediately agree to a ceasefire, end this war of aggression, and to prepare for an immediate return of all Russian troops to outside the territory of Ukraine., We call on all parties to this conflict to protect civilians; take every precaution to minimise harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure, immediately halt use of internationally banned weapons such as anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions, show restraint, do not use explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, make every possible effort in general to fight outside populated areas, guarantee safe and unrestricted passage to humanitarian organisations and guarantee all civilians unrestricted safe and secure passage., We call on the international community to do everything possible to aid and support civilians in Ukraine as well as civilians from Ukraine seeking refuge. And to support Ukrainian civil society organizations and ministries with their work on documenting civilian harm and environmental concerns., We call on the international community to undertake and support efforts to track and monitor civilian casualties and other types of civilian harm.

Their lives have been brutally shattered from one day to another. Education Cannot Wait and our partners do what we can to provide continuous access to education. This is crucial to cope with the trauma they experience and provide some hope to which they can hold on during this extremely difficult time.’ – ECW Director Yasmine Sherif, French | Spanish | Arabic, 15 March 2022, New York – In response to the vast humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine, Education Cannot Wait (ECW) and its strategic partners announced today a US$5 million catalytic grant that will step up the global education in emergencies response to a conflict that has impacted 5.7 million school-aged children and put hundreds of thousands of lives at risk., ECW’s catalytic First Emergency Response grant also aims to help mobilize an additional US$20 million in funding to align with the needs outlined in OCHA’s Flash Appeal that was recently launched to respond to urgent humanitarian needs in Ukraine. The grant will be managed by Save the Children and UNICEF, focusing on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys. Once conditions allow, the grant will provide continuous access to education and psychosocial support for the children and adolescents impacted by the deteriorating situation following the Russian Federation military offensive that began on 24 February., The Flash Appeal targets 875,000 children and teachers impacted by the crisis, of which approximately 150,000 school-aged girls and boys are targeted by ECW’s catalytic grant. ECW and its strategic partners will adapt the response as the situation evolves as the longer-term education needs in Ukraine and bordering states remain unclear and may exceed initial projections., Over 3 million refugees have already fled to neighbouring countries, and there is significant internal displacement. Schools and education facilities in Ukraine are closed across the country, and recent reports indicate attacks on schools, hospitals and other civilian facilities. OCHA’s Flash Appeal estimates that 2.2 million children will need education assistance., “The children and adolescents of Ukraine are caught in a horrific armed conflict and forced displacement across the borders. Their lives have been brutally shattered from one day to another. Education Cannot Wait and our partners do what we can to provide continuous access to education. This is crucial to cope with the trauma they experience and provide some hope to which they can hold on during this extremely difficult time,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises., Children impacted by the crisis in Ukraine are not only being denied their right to education as a result of the conflict, they are also at grave risk of physical harm and severe emotional distress. The ability to learn is severely affected by acute and on-going exposure to conflict-related trauma and psychological stress leading to a risk of school dropout and negative coping mechanisms., In times of crises, out-of-school children face heightened risk of abuse and exploitation, trafficking, gender-based violence, early pregnancy, and recruitment into armed groups – adolescent girls are particularly at risk., “We call on all our strategic donor partners – from the public, private and philanthropic sectors – to join ECW’s efforts and step up their support to urgently fill the US$20 million funding gap to support much needed education in emergencies interventions for the children and adolescents of Ukraine who are bearing the brunt of this senseless violence,” said Sherif., ###, Note to Editors, About Education Cannot Wait (ECW):

The Development Impact of the War in Ukraine: Initial projections [EN/UK],Analysis,UNDP,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",16 Mar 2022,"Every day of delayed peace will accelerate a freefall into poverty for Ukraine, warns UNDP, Early data estimates suggest that 90% of the Ukrainian population could be facing poverty and extreme economic vulnerability should the war deepen, setting the country – and the region – back decades and leaving deep social and economic scars for generations to come., New York– In the event of a continuing, protracted war in Ukraine, 18 years of socio-economic achievements could be lost, with almost one third of the population living below the poverty line and a further 62% at high risk of falling into poverty within the next twelve months, according to an early projection released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)., “The war in Ukraine is causing unimaginable human suffering with a tragic loss of life and the displacement of millions of people. While the need for immediate humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians is of the utmost importance, the acute development impacts of a protracted war are now becoming more apparent,” said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner. “An alarming economic decline, and the suffering and hardship it will bring to an already traumatised population must now come into sharper focus. There is still time to halt this grim trajectory.”, Based on its longstanding, trusted partnership with the Government of Ukraine, UNDP has been working in all 24 oblasts (administrative districts) of Ukraine with more than 332 municipalities, 15 civil society organizations hubs, and more than 17 business membership associations across the country., As part of the coordinated United Nations Country Team’s response, UNDP is now leveraging this extensive network for immediate and scaled up support to the people of Ukraine, focusing on immediate crisis response and maintaining core government functions for emergency response management and public service delivery., “In order to avoid further suffering, destruction and impoverishment we need peace now,” said Steiner. “As part of the United Nations’ unwavering commitment to the Ukrainian people, UNDP’s primary focus is to help preserve hard-won development gains. That includes supporting the government to sustain critical governance structures and services, which constitute the bedrock of all societies.”, According to government estimates, at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and other physical assets have been destroyed. The war has caused 50% of Ukrainian businesses to shut down completely, while the other half are forced to operate well below capacity., Among the largest UN agencies on the ground in Ukraine, UNDP has remained operational throughout the conflict and is now boosting its presence with targeted, specialized deployments in key areas such as debris management, damage assessment and emergency livelihoods including cash-based assistance, and also offering operational entry points and platforms to development and humanitarian partners to channel and scale support to the Government and people of Ukraine., A series of policy measures in the coming weeks could assist and mitigate a freefall into poverty as the conflict rages on. In view of the scale of the needs and priorities, and of the country’s strong banking and financial services infrastructure, UNDP joins the UN Crisis Coordinator in promoting the use of multi-purpose cash assistance which could help reach the largest number of people in desperate need across the country. For example, UNDP’s initial estimates are that a large-scale emergency cash transfer operation, costing approximately $250 million per month, would cover partial income losses for 2.6 million people expected to fall into poverty. A more ambitious temporary basic income (TBI) that provides a basic income of $5.50 per day per person would cost $430 million a month, based on initial estimates., In neighbouring countries, and in support of the inter-agency Regional Refugee Response Plan, UNDP is working with UNHCR to ensure a strong focus on resilience and development for the millions of displaced people who have fled the violence. This joint support to refugees and host communities will focus on livelihoods, through income generation and employment., ***, About UNDP, UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change. Working with our broad network of experts and partners in 170 countries, we help nations to build integrated, lasting solutions for people and planet.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/development-impact-war-ukraine-initial-projections-enuk

Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in many major cities. The unfolding military offensive continues to expand to western Ukraine. Early on 13 March, airstrikes were reported at a military facility in Yavoriv, Lvivska oblast (west) and the airport in IvanoFrankivska oblast (west) was nearly completely destroyed by a second airstrike in three days., On 14 March, it was reported that the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine stated that the government will try to evacuate trapped civilians through 10 humanitarian corridors, including corridors from towns near Kyiv and in the eastern region of Luhansk. Reportedly, the government will try to unblock the movement of the humanitarian convoy carrying food and medicine to Mariupol from Berdiansk. The following corridors have been announced, as of 14 March: Bogdanovka and Nova Bogdanovka - Brovary; Victory - Brovary; Bobrik - Brovary; Gostomel - Belogorodka; Nemishayeve and Vorzel - Belogorodka; Dmytrivka - Belogorodka; Severodonetsk - Slavyansk; Popasna - Sloviansk and Gorske - Sloviansk. While 400 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk, evacuation of Mariupol continues to stall due to shelling., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 14 March, over 2.8 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. The Protection Cluster estimates that the Ukraine-Russian Federation war will result in the internal displacement of around 6.7 million people. Between 24 and 13 March, the OHCHR recorded 1,663 civilian casualties, including 596 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., The humanitarian consequences of the war continue to mount. Thousands of vulnerable children in Ukraine’s network of orphanages and children’s homes are stranded in the country as administrators seek to evacuate or relocate them. Before the Ukraine-Russian Federation conflict, an estimated 100,000 children were in the country's network of 700 homes. Many are unable to evacuate due to the extensive care and medical equipment needed. It is estimated that 360 staff and patients, many unable to walk, were hiding in the bomb shelter at the Oskilsky psycho-neurological boarding school as of 11 March 2022. As of 13 March, approximately 2,500 orphans have been evacuated.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-6-14-march-2022
Additional Humanitarian Assistance for the People of Ukraine,News and Press Release,US DOS,Contributions,15 Mar 2022,"PRESS STATEMENT, ANTONY J. BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE, MARCH 15, 2022, The United States is providing over $186 million in additional humanitarian assistance to support internally displaced persons and the more than three million refugees affected by Russia’s premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war in Ukraine. This will provide further support for humanitarian organizations responding to the crisis and complement the generosity of the neighboring countries that are welcoming and supporting refugees., We call for an immediate end to Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine and for Russia to facilitate unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine and safe passage for those who seek to leave the cities where they are trapped. Humanitarian aid deliveries must be allowed to continue without interference, and humanitarian workers must have safe passage to deliver aid and assistance to those in need., The United States is the largest single-country donor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including providing nearly $293 million in humanitarian assistance both inside Ukraine and in the region since late February. Our funding to-date amounts to nearly $644 million to vulnerable communities in the region since Russia first invaded Ukraine eight years ago. Our humanitarian assistance flows through independent humanitarian organizations that deliver needs-based assistance with impartiality, humanity, neutrality, and independence., The additional humanitarian assistance for refugees in Ukraine’s neighboring countries supports the provision of food, safe drinking water, protection, accessible shelter, and emergency health care through the support of our international and non-governmental partners. This funding will also help victims of this conflict maintain contact with family members who have been separated and promote family reunification when possible., The United States commends the hospitality of the neighboring countries that are hosting those fleeing Ukraine. As with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way that is consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and states’ respective obligations under international law., We welcome the contributions of other donors toward this crisis response and urge still others to generously support the immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine and the region.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/additional-humanitarian-assistance-people-ukraine
"Russia, Ukraine, and Social Media and Messaging Apps",Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"Questions and Answers on Platform Accountability and Human Rights Responsibilities, Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, companies providing social media and messaging services have taken a wide array of steps to counter harmful disinformation, to label or block state-sponsored or state-affiliated media, and to introduce extra safety measures., For over a decade, digital platforms have played an important and growing role in crises, conflicts, and war. As in Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Libya, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Syria, among others, people use platforms to document human rights abuses in conflicts, condemn atrocities, appeal to the international community for action and crowdsource relief and assistance. Platforms are also spaces where governments and others spread disinformation, incite violence, coordinate actions, and recruit fighters. The war in Ukraine is no exception., This Q&A examines what companies providing popular social media and messaging services have done during this crisis and whether that meets their responsibility to respect human rights. It explains what the companies failed to do in Ukraine prior to this war, and what they have frequently failed to do, or done poorly, in other crises around the world. And it presents what companies should do to protect human rights in crisis situations, including an investment in clear policies, content moderation, and transparency., It does not address the role of tech companies whose services, hardware, software, and infrastructure enable people to access the internet. These companies also have human rights responsibilities, and their withdrawal from Russia exacerbates the risk of isolation from the global internet for the country’s residents., What are the human rights responsibilities of companies that provide social media and messaging services?, Companies have a responsibility to respect human rights and remedy abuses under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This requires them to avoid infringing on human rights and to take steps to address adverse human rights impacts that stem from their practices or operations. Actions that companies take should be in line with international human rights standards, conducted in a transparent and accountable way, and enforced in a consistent manner., Did companies do enough to meet their human rights obligations in Ukraine before February 24, 2022?, As Human Rights Watch and many of its partners have documented for years, social media companies have chronically underinvested in responding to human rights challenges in countries around the world where people rely on their services. Ukraine is no exception., Even before Russia’s occupation of Crimea and its support for the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the authorities have deployed elaborate, state-driven propaganda through which they have disseminated malicious disinformation, invented “facts” and lies, and wild exaggerations. These include baseless claims about Kyiv being overrun by “Nazis,” and existential threats to ethnic Russians. This has played a crucial role in escalating tensions in Ukraine and fanning the flames of the conflict since it started in 2014., Since 2014, Ukraine has repeatedly urged companies to improve their efforts in Ukraine. The previous president reportedly urged Facebook to stop the Kremlin from spreading misinformation on the social network that was fomenting distrust in his (then) new administration and promoting support of Russia’s occupation of parts of Ukraine, including by posing a question to Mark Zuckerberg during a 2015 town hall meeting. In its 2021 submission to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Ukraine stated that “measures taken by the social media companies, the practices of blocking fake profiles and activities of fact-checkers were only partly effective,” and that the “effectiveness of the social media companies' activities aimed at combating disinformation is difficult to estimate and would benefit from higher level of transparency.”, In September 2021, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov held a meeting with Google officials in Silicon Valley, asking them to establish an office in Ukraine because, in his view, during military aggression it is necessary that YouTube conduct its content moderation locally instead of in Russia., There may be good reasons for companies to not have in-country staff moderating content or acting as a local representative, for example to shield them from government pressure to comply with arbitrary censorship requests or threats of imprisonment. In addition, it is crucial for companies to hire content moderators who are not just fluent in local languages, but who are attuned to local context and are able to assess content in an unbiased and independent manner. Human Rights Watch wrote to Google on March 9 inquiring whether its content moderators for Ukraine are based in Russia and whether it has an office in Ukraine. Google has not responded at time of publication., What steps have social media and messaging service companies taken since February 24?, Since February 24, companies providing social media and messaging services have taken many steps in response to the war in Ukraine, most of them aimed at countering harmful disinformation, adding labels to or blocking state-sponsored or state-affiliated media, or introducing extra safety measures. Some of these measures apply to either Ukraine or Russia, some apply in the EU only, and some apply globally. Some decisions were made in response to government requests, some in defiance of government requests, and others in response to public pressure, or at the companies’ own initiative., Both the high volume of announcements and speed of these policy changes concerning a wide range of their services since February 24 are unique. That is why Human Rights Watch and others are closely monitoring how social media companies and popular messaging apps address the evolving situation, including how they respond to government requests and sanctions. Telegram remains the outlier. (See tables below.), Blocking of Russian state-affiliated and state-sponsored media Other actions taken against Russian state-affiliated and state-sponsored media Other actions taken At the same time, many of these measures that companies have introduced are not new. In other situations, companies have adopted similar measures after more sustained government or public pressure, but in a more limited manner (See section “Are social media and messaging companies meeting their human rights responsibilities in wars and crises globally?”)., For example, the company formerly known as Facebook has a set of “break glass” measures, which Nick Clegg, Facebook (now Meta) president of global affairs said “allow us to – if for a temporary period of time – effectively throw a blanket over a lot of content that would freely circulate on our platforms.” According to Clegg, this would allow the company to “play our role as responsible as we can to prevent that content, wittingly or otherwise, from aiding and abetting those who want to continue with the violence and civil strife that we're seeing on the ground."" These measures include restricting the spread of live video on its platforms and reducing the likelihood that users will see content that its algorithms classify as potential misinformation. The company reportedly put these measures in place in what it calls “at-risk countries” such as Myanmar, Ethiopia, and Sri Lanka, and in the US ahead of the 2020 presidential election., Platforms have also removed state-affiliated media in the past in response to sanctions and terrorist designations. For example, in 2019 Instagram reportedly removed the accounts of government-owned and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-affiliated media agencies such as Tasnim News Agency, the Iran Newspaper, and Jamaran News. A company spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, said at the time, “We operate under US sanctions laws, including those related to the US government’s designation of the IRGC and its leadership.”, Google and Facebook paused political ads just ahead of election day 2020 in the US, while Twitter rolled out new features to add “friction” to the spread of disinformation. Platforms have also formed special teams to respond to crises and introduced or directed users to special account security measures in response to emergency situations, such as after the fall of the Afghanistan government in August 2021., While some of the platforms’ actions around the war in Ukraine resemble those in other situations, some are also inconsistent with their policies elsewhere. For example, Meta announced on March 11 that Facebook and Instagram users in Ukraine are temporarily allowed to call for violence against Russian armed forces in Ukraine in the context of the invasion. However, no such policy has been announced for Syria, for example, where Russia has been fighting in partnership with Syrian armed forces since September 2015, and where Human Rights Watch has documented serious violations by Russian forces that include apparent war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity., Do the steps taken by social media and messaging apps in Ukraine meet their human rights responsibilities?, It is too early to assess the adequacy of steps by tech companies since February 24 against their human rights responsibilities. Some reports indicate that their steps to counter harmful disinformation and misinformation are falling short., None of the major social media networks and messaging platforms have been fully transparent about what resources they direct toward user safety and content moderation in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch wrote to Google, Meta, and Twitter on March 9, and to Telegram and TikTok on March 10 to inquire about how many Ukrainian speakers they have moderating content, whether they have employed staff based in Ukraine that is tasked with moderating content, and how they ensure that content moderators work in an unbiased and safe manner., Meta shared a link to a newsroom post, with a consolidated set of updates on its approach and actions, which include establishing a special operations center staffed by experts, including native Russian and Ukrainian speakers, who are monitoring the platform around the clock; new safety features; and steps to fight the spread of misinformation and provide more transparency and restrictions around state-controlled media outlets. It also shared links to a summary of its “At Risk Country” work and investments. The company did not say whether Ukraine is considered an “At Risk Country” or respond to our specific questions., TikTok shared updates to its policies on state-controlled media, that it would suspend livestreams and uploading of new content in Russia to comply with Russia’s new “fake news” law and that it is promoting digital literacy and safety tools, as detailed on its website. The company also said that it had paused all advertising in Russia and Ukraine. TikTok said it would not disclose information about its operations and employees, if any, in Ukraine for the protection of the broader team, and that the company does not provide the exact locations of its moderation sites or the number of content moderators for the platform. However, it said that TikTok's content moderation teams speak more than 60 languages and dialects, including Russian and Ukrainian., At the time of publication, Human Rights Watch had not received responses from Google, Telegram, or Twitter, but will update this document to reflect any responses received., To fully assess the effectiveness of company responses in terms of respecting users’ rights and mitigating human rights risks, as well as the human rights impact of both action and inaction, there is an urgent need for the companies to provide access to data to independent researchers, including those in the fields of human rights disinformation, hate speech, and incitement to violence, among others., Many actions that social media companies have taken during the war in Ukraine, such as account takedowns, geo-blocking state-affiliated media channels, content removal, and demoting content, have implications for freedom of expression. Companies need to be able to demonstrate how their actions fit within a human rights framework—specifically, whether restrictions on freedom of expression are necessary and proportionate to a legitimate aim, and whether they are procedurally fair., Furthermore, it is important to assess whether these actions were taken as a result of clear, established, transparent processes for responding to government requests or enforcing their policies, or a result of political pressure, plus the potential unintended consequences of these actions., What steps have Ukraine and Russia taken with regard to social media companies and messaging services?, Ukraine has taken a number of actions to combat disinformation over the past few years, including restricting access to Russian TV channels and social media platforms., In 2017, former president Petro Poroshenko banned several Russian-owned internet firms, including VKontakte (VK) and Odnoklassniki, and at least 19 Russian news sites. In 2021, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a Ukrainian security council decree imposing sanctions for five years on eight pro-Russian media and TV companies for allegedly “financing terrorism.” At the time, Human Rights Watch said that “Ukraine’s government has every right to address disinformation and propaganda with serious measures. Yet there is no denying that in shutting down broadcasts, the sanctions decrease media pluralism and should be held up to close scrutiny.” In a 2021 submission to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Ukraine described its bans as “ineffective” as the channels could still operate on social media., Since February 24, Digital Transformation Minister Fedorov has issued a large number of public requests to tech companies, including those that provide internet infrastructure. Some requests, including those to Apple, Google, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, Microsoft, PayPal, Sony, and Oracle, asked companies to cease operations in the Russian Federation and, in some cases, to block content to Russia-affiliated media globally., Russia has escalated its assault on online (and offline) expression over the past year, and especially since its invasion of Ukraine. In 2016, authorities blocked LinkedIn for noncompliance with Russia's counterterrorism legislation, commonly referred to as the ""Yarovaya"" law. Telegram was banned in Russia in 2018, after the company refused to hand over user data. The ban was reversed in 2021., On February 25, Roskomnadzor, the Russian internet regulator, announced that it would partially restrict access to Facebook in Russia, in retaliation for Meta blocking four Russian state media accounts. Meta’s Clegg tweeted that on February 24, “Russian authorities ordered [Meta] to stop independent fact-checking and labelling of content posted on Facebook” by those state-owned media. After Meta refused to comply, the Russian government announced that it would restrict access to Meta services. On March 4, authorities fully blocked Facebook. Online monitoring groups confirmed issues with accessing Facebook., On February 26, Twitter announced that Russian authorities had restricted access to its services in Russia. Reports by online monitoring groups confirm that some Twitter users in Russia experienced serious interruptions in using the platform., On March 11, Roskomnadzor announced the full blocking of Instagram in Russia, to go into effect March 14. The blocking came after Meta introduced exceptions to its violent speech policies, allowing calls for violence against Russian armed forces in Ukraine. The Prosecutor General’s Office filed a lawsuit against Meta in court, seeking to ban it as “extremist.” The Investigative Committee, Russia’s criminal investigation service, opened a criminal investigation against Meta’s employees., The level of control and censorship that Russia’s measures seek to achieve deprives freedom of expression and the right of access to information of meaningful content and cannot be justified under international law even in times of war., Are social media and messaging companies meeting their human rights responsibilities in wars and crises globally?, In recent years, some social media companies have reacted to emergency or conflict situations by taking steps to reduce the spread of potential incitement to violence, hate speech, and disinformation, removing accounts that violated their policies, temporarily pausing advertising, and forming special operation centers to monitor their platforms and respond to emerging issues., At the same time, the platforms are not responding adequately to many conflicts or fragile situations, and in some places their failure to act has facilitated human rights abuses., Facebook’s own internal research, for example, shows that the company’s language capacities are inadequate to address the proliferation of global misinformation and incitement to violence, as revealed by a whistleblower disclosure that cites examples from Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, Israel/Palestine, and Arabic speaking countries. In response to the whistleblower’s allegations that internal research showed that the company is not doing enough to eradicate hate, misinformation, and conspiracy, a company representative said, ""Every day our teams have to balance protecting the right of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true."", In response to a Human Rights Watch question about the whistleblower’s allegations, Meta provided links to its approach to At Risk Countries., When companies have taken steps to respond to emergencies, crises and conflicts, they haven't always been sufficient, and they sometimes have unintended consequences. The way in which the steps have been implemented continues to raise concerns about transparency and accountability. For example, platforms understandably restrict content that unlawfully incites or promotes violence, but such content, especially during crises and conflicts, can also have potential evidentiary value that investigators, researchers, journalists, and victims can use to document violations and help hold those responsible on all sides to account for serious crimes. Research by Human Rights Watch, as well as by the Berkeley Human Rights Center, Mnemonic, and WITNESS, has shown that potential evidence of serious crimes is disappearing, sometimes without anyone’s knowledge., Digital rights organizations, including from Ukraine, sent a letter to the Telegram CEO and co-founder Pavel Durov in December 2021 urging the platform to address a range of human rights problems experienced on the platform, including around user safety and content moderation. The letter cites a lack of policy and arbitrary decision-making around content moderation and the circumstances under which the platform would share data with governments. The organizations also call for effective mechanisms to report and remedy potential abuses from other Telegram users. Telegram has not responded., Transparency and accountability in decision making from platforms is essential because their actions can have negative effects even when not intended, can disproportionately affect certain people or groups, and can set dangerous precedents that governments may seek to exploit. Clarity from a company on how it reached a certain decision, including the human rights justification for the action, can help to mitigate such risks. It also facilitates remedying harm to individual users and at a more general policy level., One example of a lack of transparency and accountability was Facebook and Instagram’s responses to the hostilities that broke out in Israel and Palestine in May 2021. The company appears to have taken steps consistent with the “break glass” measures described above – ostensibly aimed at slowing the spread of violent content, though it never stated this explicitly. Research by Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups show, however, that Facebook removed or suppressed content from activists, including about human rights abuses., The company attributed many of the wrongful takedowns and content suppression to “technical glitches” – a vague explanation that inhibits efforts to hold the company accountable for its actions and to remedy harm. Following pressure from civil society and a recommendation by the Facebook Oversight Board that Facebook conduct a thorough examination to determine whether its content moderation had been applied without bias, Facebook commissioned a human rights impact assessment, which is still underway., Human Rights Watch wrote to Facebook in June 2021 to seek the company’s comment and to inquire about temporary measures and longstanding practices around the moderation of content related to Israel and Palestine. The company responded by acknowledging that it had already apologized for “the impact these actions have had on their community in Israel and Palestine and on those speaking about Palestinian matters globally,” and provided further information on its policies and practices. However, the company did not answer any of the specific questions from Human Rights Watch or meaningfully address any of the issues raised., In Myanmar, Facebook’s late and insufficient response leading to the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya in 2017 also warrants closer scrutiny. In August 2018, a UN report concluded that Myanmar’s security forces committed abuses against the ethnic Rohingya population that amounted to crimes against humanity, war crimes, and possible genocide. It also found that the role of social media in the lead up to atrocities against the Rohingya was “significant.” Specifically, the UN report found that “Facebook has been a useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate in a context where, for most users, Facebook is the Internet.”, Soon after the report was released, Facebook removed 18 accounts and 52 pages associated with the Myanmar military, including the page of its commander-in-chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. This step came years after civil society organizations in Myanmar had flagged for the company clear examples of its tools being used to incite violence, and of the inadequate response from Facebook. Even after Facebook removed the 18 accounts, hired Burmese-speaking content moderators to monitor the platform for hate speech, and developed algorithms and AI to detect “hatred,” civil society in Myanmar continued to report seeing incitement to violence and hate speech on the platform., Following the February 1, 2021 military coup in Myanmar, in a tacit acknowledgement that it could do more, Facebook and Instagram announced a ban on remaining Myanmar military and military-controlled state and media entities from Facebook and Instagram, as well as on ads from military-linked commercial entities. It later announced that it would ban military-controlled businesses from the platform. Facebook’s decision to disable the official news page of the Myanmar military drew some criticism because it was one of the few official means of receiving communication directly from the military., What should social media and messaging platforms do to better respect human rights in conflicts and emergencies?, While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may present an unprecedented challenge in some ways, these platforms have had to deal with conflict playing out on and through their platforms for years, including in Ukraine. It’s past time they take their responsibility seriously., Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies should conduct human rights due diligence that includes identifying, preventing, ceasing, mitigating, remediating, and accounting for potential and/or actual adverse impacts on human rights. Human rights due diligence is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing process, which should enable companies to periodically evaluate new risks as they emerge., As a first and fundamental step, companies need to address their chronic underinvestment in user safety outside of North America and Western Europe. This includes publishing their terms of service and community guidelines in relevant languages, investing in responsible moderation practices both human and automated, and being transparent about where they are allocating resources and why, among other steps., Companies should align their policies with international human rights standards, carry out rigorous human rights impact assessments for product and policy development, and engage in ongoing assessment and reassessment and consult with civil society in a meaningful way., Companies should also radically increase transparency and accountability in their content moderation practices, as outlined by the Santa Clara Principles, which were created by civil society groups to set baseline standards for platforms’ content moderation practices informed by due process and human rights. Among other measures, the principles call for human rights and due process considerations to be integrated at all stages of the content moderation process; understandable rules and policies; cultural competence so that those making moderation and appeal decisions understand the language, culture, and political and social context of the posts they are moderating; and integrity and explainability of moderation systems, including both automated and non-automated components, to ensure that they work reliably and effectively., Companies should also strengthen their policies and their enforcement. Even though many platforms have policies to counter harmful disinformation, to label state or government controlled or affiliated media, and to counter platform manipulation, they still find themselves unprepared when a conflict situation arises and then introduce new policies or measures on the fly. Why does this continue to happen?, Social media platforms and other content hosts that choose to actively remove content should take care to preserve and archive removed content that may have evidentiary value of human rights abuses, including content identified by human rights organizations, while ensuring the privacy and security of vulnerable individuals associated with that content. There is also an urgent need to provide access to data to independent researchers, including those in the fields of human rights disinformation, hate speech, and incitement to violence among others, to assess the extent to which platforms are effectively mitigating or contributing to the human rights risks facilitated by their platforms and meeting their human rights responsibilities., More fundamentally, it is crucial to address the underlying business model upon which dominant platforms are based. This model relies on pervasive tracking and profiling of users that not only intrudes on people’s privacy, but feeds algorithms that promote and amplify divisive and sensationalist content. Studies show that such content earns more engagement and, in turn, profit for companies. The pervasive surveillance upon which this model is built is fundamentally incompatible with human rights, which is why surveillance-based advertising should be banned.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-ukraine-and-social-media-and-messaging-apps

IAEA and EU Senior Officials Discuss Nuclear Safety and Security in Ukraine and Further Areas of Cooperation,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,15 Mar 2022,"Senior officials of the IAEA and the European Union (EU) highlighted joint achievements and reaffirmed their cooperation on a range of nuclear activities, during the eighth EU-IAEA Senior Officials Meeting in Vienna on Tuesday. “This is a strategic meeting, a discussion about how our important relationship can maintain relevance in these challenging times”, noted Jacek Bylica, Chief of Cabinet at the IAEA who chaired the meeting from the IAEA side.”, Nuclear safety and security in Ukraine topped the agenda of the annual meeting, which was postponed since 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic., EU Special Envoy for Non-proliferation and Disarmament, Marjolijn van Deelen, conveyed the EU’s “grave concern over the growing nuclear safety and security risks in Ukraine, as a result of Russia’s military aggression and indiscriminate attacks on several nuclear sites,” and reaffirmed the EU’s full support for the initiative of IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi to ensure the safety and security of all nuclear facilities in Ukraine. “The EU remains categorically committed to defending multilateralism, especially at this time when its foundations are being questioned,” she said. “The EU’s support for the implementation of the IAEA’s mandate remains strong.”, Nuclear power, In the fight against climate change, nuclear power has a role to play in mitigation and energy security. “Climate change involves a complete shift of mindset, a complete change in our economy, and it involves a completely different way of producing energy. We need to accelerate our transition, and we need to decrease our global dependency from hydrocarbons,” Massimo Garribba, Deputy Director General of the European Commission’s Energy Directorate-General who chaired the meeting from the EU side., The IAEA and EU officials discussed the opportunities for collaboration in support of the development and deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs). The IAEA Platform on SMRs, launched last year, is a one-stop-shop for all aspects of SMR development, deployment and oversight, and the European SMR Partnership aims to support the deployment of SMRs in the EU at the beginning of the next decade., Nuclear safety, security and safeguards, The IAEA expressed its appreciation for the long-term financial and political support that the EU has been providing for the implementation of its nuclear security mandate. Van Deelen expressed interest in exploring ways to deepen the existing cooperation., During the General Conference in September 2021, the IAEA and the EU extended the 2013 Nuclear Safety Cooperation agreement that has supported the IAEA in delivering projects that have contributed to improving global nuclear safety. Both parties stated that they are in the final stages of revising the agreement to reflect new areas of cooperation, and it is expected to be signed on the margins of the General Conference this year., The EU continues to support the IAEA's peer review services, particularly the Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) and Integrated Review Service for Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Management, Decommissioning and Remediation (ARTEMIS). The recent IRRS mission in Portugal was a milestone, EU officials noted: all EU members have now received an initial IRRS peer review mission. EU representatives also noted and welcomed the IAEA’s initiative to develop an annual Nuclear Security Review to provide an overview of global trends and related priorities for the Agency., Both the IAEA and EU, as coordinator, attach great importance to the developments related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and officials reiterated the EU’s continued support of the IAEA efforts to verify and monitor Iran’s nuclear-related commitments., Flagship IAEA initiatives, Participants also discussed the IAEA’s recent initiatives in nuclear applications. “We are reminding the world that nuclear is more than nuclear power, for example, nuclear medicine,” Bylica said. Director General Grossi launched the Rays of Hope initiative in February 2021, in coordination with the World Health Organization, to support countries in improving access to diagnosis and treatment of cancer using radiation medicine. This also opens opportunities for collaboration with Euratom in the context of its SAMIRA initiative looking at reinforcing Europe’s security of supply in medical radioisotopes and improved safety and quality of medical applications using ionizing radiation., The IAEA also highlighted the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action (ZODIAC) initiative, in which EU countries have designated ZODIAC National Coordinators and ZODIAC National Laboratories. ZODIAC provides a systematic and integrated approach to strengthen the preparedness and capabilities of countries to respond to the threats of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19. NUclear TEChnology for Controlling Plastic Pollution (NUTEC Plastics) is another IAEA initiative that builds on the Agency’s efforts to address plastic pollution through recycling using radiation technology and marine monitoring using isotopic tracing techniques. In October 2021, the Agency hosted a regional NUTEC roundtable for Europe and Central Asia., As an example of successful and flexible collaboration on women’s empowerment, the IAEA Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme was highlighted. The efficient use of the EU contribution, the largest to date to this programme, has supported students in nuclear-related areas, supporting gender equality and encouraging more women to enter the nuclear field., The next Senior Officials Meeting will be hosted by the EU in 2023.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-and-eu-senior-officials-discuss-nuclear-safety-and-security-ukraine-and-further

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that in the best-case scenario, the Ukrainian economy will contract by at least 10 per cent this year., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Amid escalating hostilities across Ukraine, on 14 March, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy submitted a bill to the Ukrainian Parliament to extend martial law in the country for another month starting on 26 March. The civilian toll continues to rise, while critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, hospitals, roads and bridges, continue to be damaged and destroyed at an alarming rate, significantly disrupting everyday life and access to critical services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 13 March, the number of verified incidents of attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine has risen to 31, resulting in 12 deaths and 34 injuries., Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 14 March, OHCHR reports at least 1,834 civilian causalities, including 691 killed. The actual civilian toll in Ukraine is likely much higher than the officially reported figures from OHCHR, as many unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties continue to be corroborated., The civilian toll following a missile strike on a TV tower in Rivnenska oblast (north-west) on 14 March has now reportedly climbed to at least 28, including 19 people killed, figures that may increase in the coming hours as search-and-rescue crews continue to dig through the rubble in search of survivors., On 15 March, the sound of heavy explosions rang out across Kyiv for a second consecutive day. Residential neighbourhoods in the capital, including Darnytskyy (left bank of the Dnieper River), Podilskyy and Sviatoshynskyy districts (right bank), were reportedly hard-hit by shelling that left a number of homes and apartment buildings engulfed by flames early on Tuesday morning., Moreover, Kyivska oblast authorities report continued hostilities affecting civilian populations and housing in Borodianka, Irpin and Makariv, adding that the situation in the Ivankivska, Dymerska and Poliska hromadas (municipalites) remains critical. The settlements of Irpin and Kotsiubynske have been completely cut off from the gas supply, while Morkets and Zavorychi have been left without communications amid ongoing hostilities. Increasingly intense clashes in and around the capital led Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko to impose a curfew from 8 p.m. on 15 March to 7 a.m. on 17 March., Already intense fighting in eastern Ukraine has further escalated in recent days, with dire humanitarian consequences in the hardest-hit areas. Early on 14 March, five civilians were reportedly killed, and three others injured in Avdiivka, Kramatorsk, Petrivske and Toretsk (Donetska oblast), while the number of casualties in Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetska oblast) cannot be confirmed at the moment due to ongoing hostilities. As of 14 March, OHCHR also reports 751 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (134 killed and 448 injured in Government-controlled areas, GCA, and 39 killed and 130 injured in non-Government-controlled areas, NGCA) and 1,083 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., After consecutive delays over several days, the Mariupol City Council announced that as of 2 p.m. (EET) on 15 March, around 2,000 private vehicles left the conflict-ravaged city en route to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) where affected people will be able to get the aid they desperately need. Municipal authorities add that another 2,000 cars are parked at the entrance of the city, awaiting their opportunity to leave. Local officials say around 350,000 people are still trapped in the encircled city, most of whom are living in dire conditions. There are unconfirmed reports that aid has reached affected people in Mariupol; however, at the time of writing, the kind and quantity of relief supplies received cannot be verified., The Russian Federation reports it has so far evacuated around 259,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia, including more than 11,370 people on 14 March. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., On 14 March, airstrikes hit residential areas in Kramatorsk, according to Donetska oblast authorities. That same day, 17 apartment buildings and homes in Donetsk, Horlivka and Yasynuvata (Donetska oblast, NGCA) suffered varying degrees of damage, while 13 infrastructure facilities, including six schools, were reportedly damaged in Betmanove, Donetsk and Yasynuvata (Donetska oblast, NGCA). More than 200,000 people are now without access to water across several localities in Donetska oblast (GCA), including Bilytske, Hirnyk, Myrnohrad, Novohrodivka, Pokrovsk, Rodynske, Selydove, Ukrainsk, Vodianske and partially in Dobropillia, due to interrupted power supply at the Karlivska Filter Station., In neighbouring Kharkivska oblast, intense fighting is ongoing in Balaklia, Izium, and Derhachi. In Kharkiv – the country’s second largest city – municipal authorities report that 600 residential houses have been completely destroyed since the military offensive began on 24 February, leaving thousands of people homeless amid harsh winter conditions. Additionally, around 50 schools and several health facilities, including a maternity hospital, have been shelled in Kharkiv since 24 February., On top of the dire human costs, the ongoing hostilities are generating significant socio-economic repercussions that will affect the coping capacity and resilience of residents of Ukraine – more than 43 per cent of whom were poor in 2018 – a figure projected to have increased significantly due to the multi-faceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on livelihoods., According to a recent survey by the European Business Association, as of 14 March, 42 per cent of small businesses in Ukraine are no longer operating, and 31 per cent have temporarily suspended operations but plan to resume them when possible, with only 13 per cent managing to continue operations uninterrupted amid the current circumstances. IMF estimates that in the best-case scenario – a prompt resolution to the situation and substantial donor support – the Ukrainian economy will contract by at least 10 per cent this year, exacerbating an already-difficult socio-economic situation characterized by growing inflation, high gas import prices and the effects of the recent Omicron-driven surge in COVID-19.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-15-march-2022

In less than three weeks, some 3 million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine, while an additional 1.85 million people have been displaced internally within the country. An estimated 12.65 million people have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine., The escalation of conflict has triggered an immediate and steep rise in humanitarian needs, both within the country as well as in the neighbouring countries receiving refugees., Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines., UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and appealed to neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., UKRAINE SITUATION UPDATE, • As of midnight on 12 March, OHCHR had confirmed at least 1,663 civilian causalities, including 596 civilians killed; actual numbers are likely much higher., • The humanitarian situation in Mariupol is dire, with residents facing a critical and potentially fatal shortage of food, water and medicines. UNHCR is closely tracking negotiations for organized evacuations and is preparing to send humanitarian supplies into the city as soon as conditions allow., • The number of people without access to electricity and gas supplies across the country continues to increase.
The Ministry of Energy reports that some 960,000 families are now without electricity in the country and 264,000 families have been cut off from gas supplies., • On the morning of 13 March attacks took place in western Ukraine, including on a military facility located in Yavoriv, between Lviv and the Polish border, and on the airport in Ivano-Frankivsk, resulting in multiple fatalities., • In Odesa, authorities have requested support for general food assistance to cover the needs of some 450,000 people in the city, as well as support for medicine. UNHCR also received a request for support from authorities in Kropivnytskiy to enlarge reception capacity in the city, including 500 accommodation spaces in school facilities., • The humanitarian needs in eastern Ukraine are becoming more urgent.

The assistance will soon be delivered to locations around the country based on security conditions, access and where the needs of civilians fleeing from and enduring conflict are most pressing. A priority will be to deliver assistance to people displaced from their homes and living in shelters., The trucks are transporting:, Florian Seriex, Spokesperson for the ICRC in Ukraine said: “I’m currently in Ukraine in the city of Vinnytsia. I’m in a warehouse where we are currently offloading the content of eleven trucks, that’s about 200 tonnes of humanitarian assistance that just arrived in the country. This humanitarian assistance contains war-wounded kits, which means surgical, trauma kits, that will be distributed to hospitals. They contain blankets, mattresses. All the goods that are necessary for the people who have left their homes, who are currently stuck in shelters, and are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. Of course, we are conscious that this assistance is only a drop in the ocean of all the needs that we currently observe in Ukraine.

We have civilians in the hundreds who are trying to get on the busses and we (ICRC) will try and escort this convoy across the lines and bring them back into some kind of safety.”, The convoy left Sumy at approximately 3.30 pm CET. The ICRC hopes that this is the first of many operations and safe passages for civilians that need urgent respite from violence and humanitarian aid., An agreement between the parties to the conflict at a local level allowed today’s operation to take place; the ICRC reiterates that we are not a guarantor of such agreements, though we do assist in their implementation. It is up to the parties to agree to the terms of any safe passage agreement and then stick to the terms., People in a number of cities like Mariupol essentially remain trapped with little safe way out. People are living with no food, water, heat or electricity. They, like in other cities affected by the hostilities, desperately need to be allowed safe passage out of cities, if they choose to leave, and humanitarian assistance needs to be allowed in., Note to editors:, The ICRC has been working for the people affected by the conflict in Ukraine since 2014. Our operations in the country are among the ten largest ICRC operations worldwide with a team of over 600 staff members. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, we are increasing our response to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Our support to people includes emergency assistance such as food, water, and other essential items. We also support hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and emergency preparedness. We repair water stations and support households to rehabilitate their damaged homes. We also help families separated by the conflict reconnect. Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries.

Update 22 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (15 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,15 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had been re-connected to the national electricity grid and no longer relied on emergency diesel generators for power, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The site of the 1986 accident lost all off-site power on 9 March and was forced to resort to diesel fuel for back-up electricity. Ukrainian specialist teams succeeded on the weekend to repair one of two damaged lines linking the plant to the power network., From 16:45 CET on 14 March, this line has been providing all the required power to the NPP and the diesel generators have been switched off, Ukraine’s regulatory authority said today. It is also supplying electricity to the nearby city of Slavutich. It remains unclear whether it will be possible to repair the second high-voltage power line, the regulator added., Russian forces took control of the Chornobyl NPP on 24 February, but its Ukrainian staff have continued to manage day-to-day operations at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located., The site’s 211 technical personnel and guards have not been able to rotate since the day before the Russian forces entered the area, in effect living there for the past three weeks. Director General Grossi said they were working “under enormous stress without the necessary rest”. The regulator said there was no information whether and when a shift change would be possible., In addition, the regulator said for the first time today that information it received regarding Chornobyl was “controlled by the Russian military forces” and therefore it could not “always provide detailed answers to all” of the IAEA’s questions. This was also the case regarding the Zaporizhzhya NPP, controlled by Russian forces since 4 March., Director General Grossi has repeatedly expressed deep concern about the difficulties facing NPP staff, saying it was compromising one of seven indispensable nuclear safety pillars he outlined earlier this month, stating that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., The challenging staffing situation, together with the now addressed power cuts at Chornobyl and communication issues in recent weeks, underscores the urgency of agreeing and implementing an IAEA initiative aimed at ensuring the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, he said., The regulatory authority said staff at the Zaporizhzhya NPP confirmed reports that the Russian military had detonated unexploded munitions left on the site following events on 4 March. The staff was not informed beforehand, it added. The regulator has in recent days told the IAEA about ongoing work to detect and dispose of unexploded munitions found at the damaged training centre and elsewhere at the NPP., In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, shelling in the area forced staff to temporarily leave a new nuclear research facility that has previously been hit, the regulator said, adding that they later returned and restored power supplies to safety systems. The facility is used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Because its nuclear material is subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, the IAEA has assessed that the reported damage would not have had any radiological consequence., On the status of Ukraine’s four operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range, it said., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported earlier this week. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-22-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-15-march-2022

Many more have been injured., ""AND more than 1.5 million children have fled the country., ""Putting this last statistic another way, on average, every day in Ukraine from the start of the war, more than 75,000 children have become refugees. Every day., ""This last number is particularly shocking. Every single minute, 55 children have fled their country., ""That is, a Ukrainian child has become a refugee almost every single second since the start of the war (Feb24)., ""This refugee crisis is in terms of speed and scale, unprecedented since the Second World War, and is showing no signs of slowing down., ""Like all children driven from their homes by war and conflict, Ukrainian children arriving in neighbouring countries are at significant risk of family separation, violence, sexual exploitation, and trafficking., ""They are in desperate need of safety, stability and child protection services, especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families., ""The safest and fastest way out of this catastrophe – indeed the only way out of this catastrophe – is for this war to end, and to end now., ""Until then, attacks in civilian areas and on civilian infrastructure must stop., ""They must stop because they’re claiming lives., ""They must stop because they’re forcing people to forgo essential health services despite catastrophic needs., ""They must stop because they’re causing children to miss school., ""They must stop because millions of children remain in areas of conflict in Ukraine., ""I have just spent two weeks in Lviv, in Western Ukraine, speaking to some of the mothers, fathers and children who have fled for their lives, and some of the frontline workers trying to help them., ""When I asked pediatricians in Lviv – who had received 60 children from hospitals in Kyiv overnight – how they were preparing, they explained their training in prioritization: If large numbers of children come with wounds of war, the doctors use stickers to prioritise treatment. Green sticker – leave the child for now; yellow – the child needs medical assistance now; red – the child is critical; black sticker – they will not be able to save the child., ""UNICEF continues to have a team on the ground in Ukraine and to send in essential supplies. Over the weekend, another convoy arrived in Ukraine. This time 22 trucks with 168 tons of supplies, including midwifery kits, surgical kits, obstetric kits, oxygen concentrators, cold boxes, as well as blankets and winter clothes, water, sanitation and hygiene kits, dignity kits; early childhood education kits and adolescent Kits., ""Meanwhile, mobile child protection teams are being expanded from 9 to 47 to scale-up protection and psychosocial services for children across Ukraine., ""Our support of course stretches across borders, to some of those 1.5 million child refugees. We are setting up more and more Blue Dots safe spaces - in partnership with humanitarian partners and local authorities - to provide critical support and protection services for children and families. We have messaging on safety and unaccompanied children from chat bots in Ukraine to Facebook; we have delivered hygiene products to refugee centres., ""But we must be clear: despite tireless efforts from volunteer grandmothers to Governments, scouts to UN agencies, so long as this war continues, the situation for Ukraine’s children will only get worse."", Media contacts

Ukraine: “We receive dozens of calls from desperate people”,News and Press Release,NRC,Protection and Human Rights,15 Mar 2022,"Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) staff in Ukraine are receiving dozens of enquiries every single day from desperate people who need help getting to safety. The situation is dramatic, chaotic and confusing, and it changes from hour to hour., “Our hot-line is functioning, and people can call for information and advice. They are desperate and scared, and they have many unanswered questions,” says Ganna Dudinska, NRC’s Advocacy Manager., In addition to the hot-line, we provide critical information via our own Facebook page, and we use Viber and email to communicate and answer questions., ""Many people are wondering how to find safe escape routes out of the country for themselves and their children, and they have questions related to asylum applications,” says Ganna.., Our teams provide detailed information about roads out of war zones, train schedules and updates from the authorities., People are desperate, and many break down in tears when we talk to them. Ganna talked to a woman from western part of Ukraine:, “I cannot imagine how long it will take to rebuild our country,” the woman shared with her through tears. “But the most important thing is that the shelling and violence stops. I am afraid of the future for my children. They are so small. They haven't lived this life at all.”, Ganna Dudinska, NRC’s Advocacy Managersays that it is civilians who pay the highest price. “Hundreds of thousands of people are without water, electricity, gas and transportation. In cities such as Irpin, Bucha, Volnovaklha and Mariupol, the situation is critical. Here are people in bomb shelters and basements – without access to water or food."", We will give cash, We have now started registrations and soon we will be handing out money to those who need it the most. The first location is the Terponil region, which has become a gathering place for displaced people., “We are working with local partner organisations, using their local field capacities and our emergency aid teams to identify those who need money the most,” says Ganna Dudinska., Many of our 70 employees are currently fleeing themselves. We now have 32employees currently operational inside Ukraine., Help for 800,000 people, Our employees are working hard to bring aid to Ukraine from our crisis operations in neighbouring countries., “We are now trying to set up a supply chain from Poland and Romania to our emergency aid depots in western and central parts of Ukraine,” continues Ganna., We are also in the process of setting up an office in Poland and our emergency relief team are planning for major and long-term operations in Romania and Moldova., The goal is that over the next six months, we will be able to reach out with lifesaving help to 800,000 people inside Ukraine and neighbouring countries., “We need all the support we can get”, “The war in Ukraine has created a refugee crisis we have not seen in Europe since the Second World War. At the same time, the crisis has triggered enormous generosity,” says our Secretary General, Jan Egeland., He says that the response from both individuals and corporate companies has been enormous. “I do not think we have seen this scale of commitment since the tsunami hit in 2004,” says Egeland., “An extraordinary crisis also requires an extraordinary effort, and the support from donors will therefore be absolutely crucial for us who will provide life-saving help to the many people who are now displaced.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-we-receive-dozens-calls-desperate-people

Sporadic fighting and indiscriminate attacks on roads and infrastructure in the northwest, southwest and central Ukraine threaten the humanitarian convoys. Significant logistics constraints, including the lack of drivers or vehicles, hamper the transfer of food and other relief in general from relatively safe locations to the most hardhit areas., WFP is deeply concerned about the food security situation in Ukraine. Mariupol, Kharkiv and other cities are being encircled and continue to experience heavy shelling and hostilities leaving people isolated and facing severe shortages of food, water, and energy supplies. As insecurity persists and supply chains are disrupted, people might fall deeper into emergency levels of hunger and malnutrition., According to the protection cluster, around 1.9 million became internally displaced. Increasing numbers of displaced move to the west where humanitarian capacities are not able to cope with the mounting needs. Moreover, a daily average of 150,000 refugees and asylum seekers cross the borders to neighbouring countries, reaching over 2.8 million persons since the beginning of the crisis., In a country like Moldova, heavily dependent on Russian energy supply and under economic pressure even before the conflict, the sudden refugees ‘influx compounded by energy prices hike and potential halt take a significant toll on the resources of the country., While the Moldovan Government has been generously assisting the incoming refugees, its fragile context is likely to affect its political stability.

Starting today, 14 March, the first episode is available on the MEGOGO video platform, as well as on the digital platforms of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine and UNICEF. The project aims to help parents engage their children in educational and developmental activities thus providing them with a semblance of normality during the war., “Right now children are either staying in shelters, on the move or having to adapt to new surroundings. Parents are stressed and are not always able to organize useful leisure activities for their children. The NUMO project will help keep children connected and engaged with their education and will continue to teach preschoolers important skills for further development,” - says UNICEF., “In this extremely difficult time for Ukraine, the Ministry is working together with partners to develop platforms and communication channels to provide children with opportunities for continuous development and education. Thanks to remote education technologies, UNICEF is launching a NUMO kindergarten for preschoolers. This is a public platform where parents and teachers will be able to find all necessary education materials. It is important that despite the difficult circumstances, the education for the children of Ukraine remains accessible, useful and engaging,” - noted Serhiy Shkarlet, the Minister of Education and Science., The online kindergarten is part of the NUMO project - a platform which features useful tips, interesting exercises and games, helping preschoolers learn important skills for further development and prevent them from losing the skills they have already acquired., The online kindergarten curriculum was developed by a team of educators led by Solomiya Boykovych, an expert in preschool education. Psychologists were involved in the curriculum development ensuring the content is appropriate for children experiencing trauma. The online kindergarten is designed to help keep children connected and engaged with their education and to support their continuous development., “The first episode is already available on MEGOGO.

 On Government-controlled territory: 582 casualties (134 killed and 448 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 169 casualties (39 killed and 130 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,083 casualties (518 killed and 565 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Izium (Kharkiv region), and Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region) where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 10 a.m. (local time) 15 March, 97 children had been killed and more than 100 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-14-march-2022-enruuk
"Statement of ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, on his visits to Ukraine and Poland: “Engagement with all actors critical for effective, independent investigations.”",News and Press Release,ICC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,15 Mar 2022,"Today, I visited western Ukraine and Poland in connection with the ongoing investigation by my Office into the Situation in the Ukraine. This has allowed me to personally assess the situation on the ground, meet with affected communities and to further accelerate our work by engaging with national counterparts., During my time in western Ukraine, I met with Excellencies, Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Iryna Venediktova, Prosecutor-General of Ukraine. My message was clear: we stand ready to work with all relevant national authorities in order to obtain information, build a collective effort to establish the truth and ensure that individuals responsible for international crimes are held accountable in a court of law. I am sincerely grateful for the willingness of the Foreign Minister and the Prosecutor-General to meet at an incredibly difficult time for all those in Ukraine., I was also pleased to have the opportunity during my visit to meet virtually with His Excellency, Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. We were united in our view that every possible effort should be made to ensure that the conduct of hostilities does not give rise to breaches of international humanitarian law and that civilians are protected from the effects of conflict. I emphasised my willingness to expand collaboration with all relevant national authorities in order that we can together ensure that alleged violations of international law are thoroughly investigated., During my visit, I have also had the opportunity to meet with those who have been forced to flee due to the hostilities in Ukraine at Medyka refugee reception centre in Poland. The accounts I have heard from men, women and children have deepened my concern regarding the impact of this situation on the civilian population., I wish to send a clear message to all those participating in hostilities., If attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime that my Office may investigative and prosecute. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects, including hospitals: that is a crime that my Office may investigate and prosecute., Those taking part in these hostilities, whether as regular armed forces, militias, or self-defence groups, must know that in putting on a uniform or by carrying weapons they are not absolved of responsibility but indeed they take on extra legal obligations. For those that do not act in accordance with international humanitarian law, my Office is empowered to take action to ensure that those who have committed international crimes are held accountable in accordance with the Rome Statute. We are already actively collecting evidence in pursuit of this objective, and I believe my visit today will strengthen that work., The work of my Office in relation to the Situation in Ukraine will at all times be carried out in a manner consistent with the founding principles of the Rome Statute. We conduct our work with independence, impartiality and integrity. I have underlined that I wish to engage with all parties to the conflict., In line with this approach, I have also transmitted a formal request to the Russian Federation to meet their competent authorities and discuss the current situation as it concerns my Office's mandate. It is in my view essential that the Russian Federation actively engages in this investigation and I stand ready to meet with them., My visit to Ukraine has also underlined the significant task we face in ensuring that the full range of documentary, digital, forensic and testimonial evidence is drawn upon as part of our investigations. The scale of this investigation and the challenging environment in which it will be conducted give rise to unavoidable demands on my Office which I intend to meet with an effective response., It is therefore essential that the collective support of all States Parties is maintained as our work now moves to an important stage. I would reiterate my call to those States to provide assistance to my Office including through voluntary financial contributions and the provision of national experts on a secondment basis.

"Global Community Will Be Judged by Way It Responds to ‘Horrors’ in Ukraine, Intergovernmental Organization Chair Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,14 Mar 2022,"SC/14828, SECURITY COUNCIL
8992ND MEETING (AM), Delegate Calls Russian Federation ‘Serial Violator’ of Rules-Based World Order, The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the global community have a moral obligation to support the people of Ukraine and not to stand silent in the face of the ongoing Russian aggression against them, the Head of that regional group told the Security Council today, warning that “we will be judged by the way we respond to these horrors”., Zbigniew Rau, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland and the current Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, made the remarks during the 15-member Council’s annual meeting on the OSCE’s work across Europe — which includes support to States in counter-terrorism, cybersecurity, good governance and human rights monitoring — and on its growing cooperation with the United Nations system., “Such a close cooperation is even more needed today, when the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and international law are being flagrantly violated in the very heart of Europe,” he said, calling for every effort to stop the Russian aggression. Recalling that the “worst-case scenario became reality” on the morning of 24 February, when Moscow first launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he said the invading forces soon began targeting civilian targets in an effort to break the will of the Ukrainian population, striking schools, hospitals and kindergartens with internationally banned weapons., Responding to comments by some Russian officials that have accused him of lacking impartiality in the days and weeks since, he stressed: “Impartiality ends where blatant violation of international humanitarian law starts.” OSCE has an obligation to maintain its decency and integrity, and the international community cannot remain silent. Noting that the door to diplomacy is still open, he called on the Russian Federation to engage in dialogue to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis, stressing that the ongoing aggression poses a threat to the very existence of the rules-based international order., Calling on all sides to abide by humanitarian law and refrain from activities directed against civilian populations and infrastructure, he said OSCE stands ready to cooperate with United Nations humanitarian agencies — including in support of effective evacuation routes out of Ukraine. In that context, he welcomed a 3 March decision by the OSCE Permanent Council to invoke its Moscow Mechanism, thereby creating a group of independent experts to investigate the reported violations of humanitarian law in the context of the hostilities in Ukraine., Also briefing was Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, who spotlighted the growing partnership between the United Nations and OSCE since the establishment of the Framework for Cooperation and Coordination in 1993. Pursuant to Council resolution 2202 (2015) on the Minsk agreements, the United Nations has consistently supported the work of OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, as well as its role in the Trilateral Contact Group, which also includes Ukraine and the Russian Federation. She described the war in Ukraine as the “most severe test” OSCE has faced since its creation in 1975, adding that the Russian invasion has “shaken the foundations of the European security architecture to its core”., Council members also took the floor, with many expressing strong support for OSCE’s role in Ukraine — including the 2014 deployment of its impartial Special Monitoring Mission, in response to a request by the Government of Ukraine, which has now been suspended due to the ongoing hostilities — and its engagement in the Trilateral Contact Group. While delegates expressed diverging views on the crisis itself, most roundly demanded an end to the fighting and emphasized the need to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure., The representative of the United Kingdom said the Council is meeting as one OSCE signatory is “tearing up the rulebook” and inflicting a war against another. “This war is a threat to us all,” she warned, pointing out that people across Africa, Asia and elsewhere rely on agricultural, energy and commodity supply chains that have already been disrupted by Moscow’s invasion. Noting that the Russian Federation now stands accused of the gravest war crimes, she welcomed action taken under the Moscow Mechanism to hold it to account., Albania’s delegate echoed support for that mechanism, while also spotlighting the Council’s failure to prevent an unprovoked and unjustified act of aggression by a “serial violator” of the rules and norms of the international order. Voicing his hope that the effects of unprecedented sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation will wake its citizens up “to see reality […] and not the distorted mirror of propaganda” presented by the State, he emphasized that the international community must refuse “a world according to Russia” and instead preserve the rules-based order., The representative of India said the manifold challenges facing OSCE include ethnic tensions, violent separatism within States and the proliferation of weapons, terrorism and cyberattacks. Reiterating the importance of global counter-terrorism efforts, also noted its important role in facilitating the implementation of the package of measures across both sides of the contact line in eastern Ukraine. India remains in close touch with both Moscow and Kyiv, he said, adding that it supports the OSCE Minsk Group’s continued efforts for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan., China’s delegate, expressing his country’s strong support for strong relationships between the United Nations and such regional organizations as OSCE, said a solution to the crisis in Ukraine must take the security concerns of all interested countries seriously. A balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture is urgently needed. Stressing that the world does not need a new cold war, he said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations observed., The representative of the Russian Federation expressed regret that United Nations officials have veered away from impartiality on the situation in Ukraine, while pointing out that OSCE has long turned a blind eye to instances of neo-Nazism, shelling and other aggressions against Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region. Stressing that OSCE has a responsibility to employ “status-neutral approaches” and embrace the role of an honest broker in its attempts to facilitate dialogue, he said the Polish chairmanship has failed in such a role. Meanwhile, Western colleagues continue to prioritize the security of some countries over that of others and the Kyiv authorities are arming gangs who roam the streets of Ukrainian cities, firing upon civilians., Ukraine’s representative, sounding alarm over continued war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed in his country by Russian troops, welcomed the invocation of the Moscow Mechanism in order to explore such violations. Noting that the Russian Federation is intensifying its propaganda and disinformation campaign, he said the OSCE should pay close attention to Moscow’s false narratives. “What is happening now is not only about Ukraine’s survival […] it is about the survival of both the United Nations and the OSCE,” he said, urging the latter to play a special role in supporting a post-Putin Russian Federation on the path back to the democratic family of nations., Also speaking were the representatives of Norway, Ghana, France, Brazil, United States, Mexico, Kenya, Gabon, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 12:41 p.m., Briefings, ZBIGNIEW RAU, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, speaking in his capacity as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Chairman-in-Office, said it stands ready to continue to cooperate with the United Nations, in line with Chapter VIII of the Charter. “Such a close cooperation is even more needed today, when the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and international law are being flagrantly violated in the very heart of Europe,” he said, calling for every effort to be made to stop the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Recalling that he took up his post at the OSCE’s helm against the backdrop of growing tensions stemming from Moscow’s new, unilateral demands for security guarantees — which were fundamentally flawed — he declared: “The transatlantic community is neither enemy nor threat to Russia or its people.”, At that time, he said, OSCE was ready to consider in good faith new avenues of cooperation provided that they contributed to stability and security in the OSCE area. However, the Russian Federation was “just buying time” as it built up troops along Ukraine’s borders, casting doubt on its real intentions. “On the morning of 24 February, the worst-case scenario became reality,” he said, noting that the conviction that war in Europe “belonged to the past” was shattered. The invading Russian force began targeting civilian targets in an effort to break the will of the population, striking schools, hospitals and kindergartens with internationally banned weapons. Describing those attacks as deplorable and amounting to State terrorism, he emphasized that the international community has instruments and means to hold accountable those that commit and are complicit in war crimes., In the days and weeks since, he said, some Russian officials have accused him of lacking impartiality. To that, he responded: “Impartiality ends where blatant violation of international humanitarian law starts.” Emphasizing the OSCE’s obligation to maintain its decency and integrity, he added: “The perpetrators will be judged by their deeds, but we will be judged by the way we respond to these horrors.” The international community cannot remain silent. Noting that the door to diplomacy is still open, he called on the Russian Federation to engage in dialogue to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis, stressing that the ongoing aggression also poses a threat to OSCE’s very existence and to that of the rules-based international order. Indeed, he asked: “How effective can we be if one of the major stakeholders has repeatedly justified the use of force to win territorial and political concessions?”, While OSCE is not a treaty-based organization, he emphasized that it is deeply embedded in the notion of multilateral negotiations for security. “I still believe that it is the right platform for dialogue and the peaceful resolution of conflict,” he said, noting that its presence plays a stabilizing role in such regions as the Western Balkans and Central Asia. Outlining his plans to visit those regions as well as to the Republic of Moldova and the South Caucasus, he nevertheless warned that OSCE’s future depends on how effective it can be in reviving cooperation among all participating States., Indeed, he said, the present non-compliance is forcing OSCE to put on hold or delay some of its critical day-to-day operations. Supported by the overwhelming majority of OSCE States, the new Renewed European Security Dialogue — initiated in response to growing tensions — was meant to develop new measures of trust, transparency and confidence. “Unfortunately, despite initial interest, the Russian side has chosen the most destructive path of confronting its concerns, fears and misgivings,” he said., He noted that the changing situation on the ground is likely to determine the scope and character of the future engagement of the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, which has been active for eight years. “The recent events in Ukraine have once again shone a spotlight on the situation of civilian population in conflict-affected areas,” he added, calling on all sides of military conflicts to abide by humanitarian law and refrain from activities directed against civilian population and infrastructure., He said OSCE stands ready to cooperate closely with United Nations humanitarian agencies to facilitate and provide the necessary assistance, which must include the creation of effective evacuation routes for the civilian population. Against that backdrop, he welcomed the 3 March decision of the Permanent Council to invoke the Moscow Mechanism to create a group of independent experts to investigate the reported violation of humanitarian law in the context of the hostilities in Ukraine., ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the tragic conflict in Ukraine vividly illustrates the importance of mechanisms to maintain and strengthen European and international peace and security. Since the United Nations and OSCE established the Framework for Cooperation and Coordination in 1993, their partnership has grown in scope and substance to help address acute crises and find solutions to common peace and security challenges. Regarding Ukraine, and pursuant to Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) on the Minsk agreements, she said the United Nations has consistently supported the work of OSCE, especially the Special Monitoring Mission and the OSCE-led Trilateral Contact Group, while carrying out the United Nations humanitarian and human rights mandates on the ground., “The war in Ukraine is the most severe test the OSCE and related regional frameworks have faced since their creation. The Russian invasion has shaken the foundations of the European security architecture to its core,” she continued. Noting that Ukraine’s cities are under unrelenting shelling and bombardment, with many civilians killed daily, she stressed that indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law. Expressing deep concern about reports that Ukrainian municipal officials in Russian-controlled parts of the country have been abducted, she also noted reports of civilians, including journalists, being targeted, allegedly by Russian forces., Amid those dire conditions, the United Nations continues to scale up not only its humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine, but also its engagement with key partners like OSCE in support of an immediate ceasefire and a lasting diplomatic solution, she continued. Recalling the Secretary-General’s address to the Council in 2017 on the topic of “Conflicts in Europe”, she said he had cautioned that as serious conflicts persisted there, new threats and risks made it even more pressing for multilateral institutions and regional organizations to address dangerous challenges to the international order. His warnings then were informed in large part by the crises in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014, which demonstrated how real the risks of new outbreaks of conflict were, she added., Expressing concern about the dismantling of longstanding confidence-building measures, arms control treaties and other frameworks that were designed and agreed to sustain regional security, she noted that OSCE-led processes supported by the international community are now openly questioned by parties involved in them. It is more important than ever for all parties to recommit to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris and other landmark agreements that form the bedrock of European security architecture. Affirming the United Nations support of all efforts to restore mutual trust and respect among regional stakeholders, she reminded the Council that all have a stake in the outcome. “The challenges we face today, and those potentially ahead, demand that we work even more closely together,” she concluded., Statements, MONA JUUL (Norway) said that, with an inclusive mandate and participation, OSCE has a rich toolbox for increasing transparency, building trust and reducing tensions. Commending its work in Ukraine, she said good use should be made of its Special Monitoring Mission’s national staff on the ground, as well as its fleet of vehicles, premises and its long experience as an intermediary facilitating localized ceasefires. OSCE can also provide competence on border management and human trafficking. Condemning the Russian Federation’s illegal and unprovoked military aggression against Ukraine, which is a serious violation of international law and Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, she stressed that Moscow’s warfare in urban and populated areas and the use of heavy explosive weapons is causing terrible, long-term harm to civilians. Humanitarian actors in Ukraine must be allowed to stay and deliver, she said, also voicing concern about the increasing strain on neighbouring countries as people flee the fighting., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) noted OSCE’s commitment to finding peaceful solutions to the situations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as in the evolving situation in Ukraine. He also praised its work to address such critical issues as terrorism, antisemitism and violations of human rights on the continent. Ensuring security in Europe now requires States to renew their commitment to uphold the long-established principles of non-aggression, sovereignty and territorial integrity, upon which global aspirations for peace and development can be built. Warning against any attempts to rewrite those principles, he said OSCE’s role as an important platform for dialogue on security cooperation in Europe must be upheld and maintained. Against the current backdrop of violence, he also voiced concern over the cascading humanitarian, security and refugee crisis, calling for renewed dialogue efforts among the parties., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said the Council is meeting as one OSCE signatory is “tearing up the rulebook” and inflicting a war against another. “President [Vladimir] Putin’s war violates fundamental principles of the United Nations and the OSCE,” she said, adding: “This war is a threat to us all.” Indeed, millions of people across Africa, Asia and elsewhere rely on agricultural, energy and commodity supply chains that have already been disrupted by Moscow’s invasion. Recalling that OSCE has worked for years to support the implementation of the Minsk agreements, she noted that the Russian Federation now stands accused of the gravest war crimes and welcomed action taken under the Moscow Mechanism to hold it to account. The United Kingdom continues to support the vital roles of OSCE field missions in Central Asia and elsewhere on the continent — including its human rights instruments — as well as its efforts to facilitate peaceful solutions to such conflicts as that in Nagorno-Karabakh., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) welcomed the OSCE briefing at a time when Europe’s security faces an extremely serious threat. In February, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office proposed a renewed dialogue on European security in order to respond in particular to the security concerns expressed by the Russian Federation in recent months. Noting that France supported those efforts, he said Moscow has since flagrantly violated the Charter of the United Nations, the founding texts of OSCE, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. “It threatens multilateralism and international law, as well as the institutions that guarantee them,” notably both OSCE and the United Nations, and it undermines the interests of all States who participate in those organizations. Calling for an immediate end to the hostilities and the full withdrawal of Russian Federation troops, he also voiced France’s support for the OSCE human dimension institutions and instruments, including the Moscow Mechanism launched on 3 March and the fact-finding mechanism set up by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. “We are determined not to allow Russia to drag multilateral collective security organizations down with it,” he stressed., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the overarching divergence between the Russian Federation and the existing European security order based on international law and OSCE principles is a structural one. Noting the Council’s failure to prevent an unprovoked and unjustified act of aggression by a “serial violator” of the rules and norms of the international order, he stressed that the aggressor must pay for crimes committed. He expressed Albania’s support for the initiative to invoke the OSCE Moscow Mechanism to establish facts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, adding that its findings together with those of the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry should be presented to relevant accountability mechanisms, as well as national, regional or international courts or tribunals. Stressing that the Russian Federation’s actions should not go unchecked or unpunished, he expressed hope that the effects of unprecedented sanctions will wake up Russian citizens “to see reality ...and not the distorted mirror of propaganda.” The international community must refuse ‘a world according to Russia’, he said, urging the preservation and reinforcement of a rules-based order., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil), noting the conflict in Ukraine and its toll on human suffering, said the cessation of hostilities must be the international community’s most pressing objective, adding that all parties must fully respect international humanitarian law and adopt measures to protect civilians. He called for continued efforts to agree on humanitarian mechanisms that ensure the safe passage of civilians, as well as unhindered access of humanitarian personnel. Noting that the present conflict will also have a significant impact on commodities and energy prices, he pointed out that such effects could be further worsened by the application of unilateral sanctions. Stressing that there is no alternative to diplomatic talks, he urged all parties to engage in dialogue to find ways for a lasting peace in Ukraine and in the wider region. He expressed hope that the expertise of OSCE may be valuable in monitoring a ceasefire that will encompass a comprehensive disengagement of troops and military equipment on the ground. Turning to the ongoing crisis in Georgia, as well as the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, he noted that the dialogue process, co-chaired by the OSCE, United Nations and European Union, is an important example of United Nations-OSCE cooperation in conflict resolution. Recognizing OSCE’s work to advance the women, peace and security agenda, he said the issues of impunity for sexual and gender-based violence must be tackled. “The maintenance of peace and security in Europe is under unprecedented challenge. Close cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE is more needed than ever,” he concluded., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States), expressing outrage over the death of Brent Renaud who was killed by Russian Federation forces while covering refugees leaving a checkpoint, said his death illustrates Moscow’s willingness to silence narratives that challenge its propaganda and underscores the importance of ensuring the safety of journalists. Noting its horrific devastation unleashed against another Member State, he called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease all hostilities, withdraw its forces from Ukraine and take the path of diplomacy. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is an unprecedented challenge — a challenge to the post-Second World War European security order and to cooperation between Member States. In that regard, cooperation between the United Nations and OSCE remains as essential as ever. Unfortunately, the Russian Federation and Belarus continue to violate the foundational principles of the Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. The Russian Federation, with the support of Belarus, has shown utter contempt for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States, as well as for the human rights and freedoms of its own people. Moreover, the Russian Federation has spread disinformation, distracted the Council from its aggression, and forced domestic and foreign media outlets to suspend operations in the country or to close permanently. Expressing commitment to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, he said that despite Moscow’s efforts to impede its operations, its impartial reporting has proved invaluable to the international community’s understanding of the security situation on the ground. Urging the Council to not forget OSCE’s other important priorities, he welcomed OSCE’s continuing commitment to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Georgia and expressed regret that the Russian Federation has not fulfilled its obligations and its commitments under the 2008 ceasefire agreement. Expressing appreciation for the long-standing partnership between the United Nations and OSCE, he urged both organizations, in the face of Russian aggression, to continue to work together to advance peace, security, development and human rights., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), welcoming OSCE’s people-centred focus, advocated for efforts that prioritize the most vulnerable in any conflict. Voicing concern that, two weeks into the fighting, the Council is still unable to issue any statement condemning the Russian aggression against Ukraine, he said protecting the civilian population is the international community’s moral imperative. That was the purpose of the humanitarian text put forward on the Ukraine situation, which was recently submitted by Mexico and France. Expressing regret that some activities of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine have been suspended “just at the moment when information and true reports are most needed”, he nevertheless welcomed its redeployment to support humanitarian efforts and stressed the need for full access to populations in need. OSCE should also resume its functions in the context of the Trilateral Contact Group, as more dialogue is urgently needed. Outlining OSCE’s work in various conflicts in Europe, he underscored the decisive role played by regional and subregional organizations in supporting the Council’s work and urged the latter’s members to step up with cooperation with such bodies., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) said the present, grotesque armed conflict taking place in Ukraine is “reminiscent of age-old European wars”. Against that backdrop, it has become imperative to redesign a security architecture for Europe that is firmly grounded on such fundamental principles as respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Member States; sovereign equality between States; respect for agreements and the pacific settlement of disputes. Agreeing that OSCE offers a good platform for the region to discuss every aspect related to peace and security, he commended the organization for its preventive diplomacy efforts and its commitment to multilateralism and praised its work executing the mandate endorsed by the Council in resolution 2202 (2015) relating to the Minsk agreements package. Calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities on humanitarian ground, he also turned to other issues of concern in Europe, urging the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to work together to ensure full compliance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) noted that the “conflict prevention potential” of OSCE is being questioned given the rise of nationalism in Europe, secessionist tensions in South-East Europe, the multiple crises in Central Asia, and the numerous security threats arising from terrorism. Moreover, the numerous outbreaks of tension resulting from the splitting apart of former blocs threaten to erode numerous regions of the world and in particular continental Europe, he said. The latest events, marked by the war in Ukraine, as well as the situation in the Karabakh region, mean OSCE must question its ability to play its role as a bridge between the East and the West in its territorial competence and in its capacity to set in motion its conflict prevention mechanisms to prevent and resolve all armed conflict in its sphere of influence. Noting that Gabon has not experienced war nor taken part in an armed conflict, he said his country has always preferred dialogue over breaches and diplomatic solutions over the use of force. He called on members of the Council and the entire international community to renew their commitment to ensuring international peace and security., ZHANG JUN (China) said his country has always supported United Nations efforts to develop partnerships with regional organizations, including OSCE, to address challenges in peace and security. Noting the importance of enhancing mutual trust, he said differences among States in national interests, social systems and ideologies should not become an obstacle to dialogue or be a reason for confrontation. The world is indivisible, security is indivisible, he said, adding that that principle must be upheld and implemented under the current circumstances. The final solution to the crisis in Ukraine is to respect the reasonable security concerns of all States and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture. Stressing that the world does not need a new cold war, he said all countries must strengthen unity and work together for a shared future for mankind. Moreover, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, and the purposes and principles of the Charter observed. All efforts towards the peaceful settlement of crises must be supported, he said, adding that China, in that regard, will strengthen communication and coordination with all parties concerned and play a constructive role in promoting peace through negotiation. Expressing concern about developments in Ukraine, he said the international community must help sustain positive momentum and support the negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and to create necessary conditions to that end., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) described OSCE as an inclusive forum centred around a unique concept of comprehensive security, which has served Europe well for almost 50 years. Condemning the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified attacks on Ukraine — a sovereign and independent country — she called on Moscow to cease hostilities, unconditionally withdraw its troops and refrain from further threats or the use of force of any kind against Ukraine or any other OSCE-participating State. As OSCE is a forum for dialogue, she voiced support for the Renewed European Security Dialogue initiated by the Chairman-in-Office, as well as for the important work of the Special Monitoring Mission. She also expressed support for other OSCE activities, including efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, particularly on the long-term status of Nagorno-Karabakh, and in Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. Citing OSCE’s role in holding all participating States accountable to the organization’s principles and commitments, she also reaffirmed her support for its autonomous institutions, in particular the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) noted that the challenges confronting the OSCE community include threats to sovereignty, peace and security. These threats manifest themselves in ethnic tensions and violent separatism within States, as well as through the proliferation of weapons, terrorism and cyberattacks. Reiterating the importance of global counter-terrorism efforts, he stressed that OSCE was among the first regional organizations to strongly condemn the 2001 terrorist attack on India’s Parliament, calling for continued attention on cross-border terrorist acts and other emerging threats. Acknowledging the important role of OSCE in facilitating the implementation of the package of measures across both sides of the contact line in eastern Ukraine, he pointed out that recent developments in Ukraine and consequent deterioration of the security situation have halted the functioning of the Special Monitoring Mission. He said that up until now, more than 22,500 Indian nationals have returned home safely from Ukraine. India has been in touch with Moscow and Kyiv, he said, also noting that it supports the OSCE Minsk Group’s continued efforts for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) noted with surprise that Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo’s assessment of the situation in Ukraine, both today and last week, “went way beyond the remit of impartiality” that is required of an international civil servant. In particular, her unfounded references to cluster bombs raised doubts as to whether she is indeed a senior United Nations staffer, or a representative of a Member State. Indeed, no mediation can be discussed “when you have obviously picked a side in this conflict”, he said, noting that Ms. DiCarlo failed to mention a recent cluster bomb strike by Ukrainian armed forces in Donetsk, which killed 20 people. Meanwhile, Council members and OSCE itself continue to turn a blind eye to the continued shelling and attacks of people in Donbas, which has gone on for years., Regarding the national of the United States who was killed in Irpin, Ukraine, in recent days, he clarified that Brent Renaud was not a journalist, but a filmmaker. Moreover, Irpin is fully under the control of Ukrainian forces, and it was those forces who opened fire on his vehicle. Rejecting the unprofessional, hysterical and unacceptable tone which has been adopted in the Council, he recalled that the OSCE Chairman-in-Office visited Moscow on 15 February, at which time the Russian Federation expressed support for certain compromises. However, it maintained that OSCE must employ “status-neutral approaches” and embrace the role of an honest broker. Instead, the Polish chairmanship failed in such a role and instead initiated actions against a single signatory State., Indeed, he continued, it is not true that Moscow has refused dialogue, but only that it requires responses from the United States and individual OSCE members for such dialogue to be successful. Western colleagues continue to prioritize the security of some countries over that of others. Blaming OSCE and its current chairmanship for the current crisis, he said it prevented Ukraine from implementing the Minsk agreements — especially provisions on Donetsk and Luhansk — and ignored incidents of nationalism, neo-Nazism and aggression against Russian-speaking populations. A massive information campaign is now ongoing against the Russian Federation, with the current crisis being falsely portrayed as a result of the special operation in Ukraine. Decrying fake images of attacks against civilians as a provocation against his country, he said Ukrainian forces continue to hide behind women and children while Kyiv distributes firearms “to God knows who” and rampaging gangs of bandits fire upon civilians. He also cited instances of the use of phosphorous bombs by Ukrainian forces, warning of the further danger posed by the use of biological or chemical weapons, which will be blamed on Moscow. “If […] this provocation actually takes place, don’t say we didn’t warn you,” he said., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), President of the Security Council, speaking in his national capacity, said the international community could benefit from OSCE’s expertise and mediation efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Ukraine. The organization’s role in dealing with the repercussions of the conflict is important not only on the regional level, but also on the international level, he said, pointing out that the continuation and worsening of the crisis threaten food security. Given that Ukraine is one of the five largest exporters of wheat in the world and an important source of wheat for the World Food Programme (WFP), the situation in the country will particularly affect developing countries that depend on wheat imports. OSCE member States also have other security and political concerns, including the conflict in Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, tensions in the Balkans, as well as the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Resolving those tensions requires a balanced diplomacy that champions dialogue and aims to address existing differences, he said. In that regard, his country relies on the OSCE’s mediation role as well as the good offices of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office to find diplomatic solutions to the region’s crises, based on the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States, and maintaining regional security and stability., Mr. RAU, taking the floor again in response to members’ comments, said the international community stands at a critical juncture. In carrying out his tasks as Chairman-in-Office, he will continue to call upon all participating States to abide by their joint commitments, and he will not shy away from facilitating dialogue to resolve ongoing regional and frozen conflicts across the region. Noting that such efforts will be the focus of his upcoming trips to the Republic of Moldova, the South Caucasus, the Western Balkans and Central Asia, he noted that the ongoing non-compliance by one OSCE participating State might complicate those efforts. He went on to express unwavering support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and for efforts to keep the conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia high on OSCE’s list of priorities. He will also increase OSCE’s involvement in resolving the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, he said, urging both sides to engage in dialogue leading to stability and prosperity in the region., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), noting the Russian Federation’s flagrant violation of United Nations and OSCE principles, commended the Chairman-in-Office for his strong commitment to pursuing an end to the war on Ukraine. Stressing that Russian Federation troops continue to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, he called on the Security Council and the OSCE Chair to facilitate the release of Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov, who was detained by Russian soldiers on 11 March and is reportedly tortured due to his refusal to collaborate with the aggressor. Unfortunately, he said the Russian occupants abducted another elected official, Dniprorudne Mayor Yevhen Matveyev, on 13 March., Nonetheless, he said residents of Kherson, Berdyansk, Melitopol, Energodar and other cities and towns in occupation have no fear to take to the streets to say to the occupants: “Go away, we are Ukraine.” Describing Russian Federation attacks in various parts of his country, he stressed that countering Russian aggression must be a centrepiece of OSCE efforts to restore security in Europe. He welcomed the invocation of the Moscow Mechanism, which is important to register all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian Federation in its war against Ukraine. Moreover, there is a need to explore all OSCE tools to document Russian Federation crimes and ensure public and timely reaction by the Chairman-in-Office, special representatives and OSCE autonomous institutions. Noting that the Russian Federation is intensifying its propaganda and disinformation campaign, he said the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media must pay close attention to Moscow’s false narratives. “What is happening now is not only about Ukraine’s survival. Unlike Putin and his henchmen, Ukraine will survive the Russian invasion. It is about the survival of both the United Nations and the OSCE. And it is about de-Putinization of Russia and its gradual returning to the tenets of international law in the post-Putin era,” he said., The OSCE should play a special role in preparing to support a post-Putin Russian Federation in its future path back to the family of democratic nations, he said, calling upon the Chairman-in-Office and the OSCE autonomous institutions to start considering the modalities of work in that regard., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Mar 2022,"Mercy Corps CEO discusses our emergency response on “Masters of Scale” podcast, As the number of those fleeing Ukraine increases day by day—more than 2.8 million people to date, according to the UN—the need for humanitarian aid multiplies. Mercy Corps’ teams are on the ground in Ukraine, Romania, and Poland to assess and address the urgent humanitarian needs. From delivering medical supplies and food staples into eastern Ukraine to those who have remained in the country, to preparing to distribute emergency cash aid to those who have fled Ukraine, our teams are responding and working with local organizations that know their community needs best., “This is immense, and it's a scale that we have not seen in quite a while,” said Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, speaking with Bob Safian, from the “Masters of Scale” podcast. Tjada appeared on a recent episode to discuss our emergency response to the Ukraine crisis, how we’re innovating humanitarian aid to meet specific needs in an evolving situation, and why it’s necessary for us to be aware of biased treatment of non-white refugees seeking help at the borders of Ukraine. Listen to the episode of “Masters of Scale” here., Transcript of “On the ground in Ukraine, with Mercy Corps’ Tjada D'Oyen McKenna” Tjada: We see people trying to evacuate and get on trains out of the country, but they're overwhelmed. People showed up with nothing. They need a place to stay. Women and children arriving devastated. We also see men who are facing conscription trying to figure out how to navigate that., You'll see Africans or Indians or other people of color who are students or migrant workers being completely ignored and abandoned., The resources flowing into Ukraine are unprecedented, and they are welcome. However, what we are encouraging and actively trying to advocate for is for people to not forget what's happening in other parts of the world. We work in all these places. And Ukraine was actually part of the solution for some of these places., The world is very fragile and very interconnected, and these things are not contained in one border or one population., If you are a company with a technology or some other kinds of expertise, please reach out to us. What we do is we work with people who are suffering, and we help them to survive. But more importantly, we help them thrive., Bob: That’s Tjada McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the global aid organization quickly threw itself into meeting the needs of frightened refugees., I’m Bob Safian, former editor of Fast Company, founder of The Flux Group, and host of Masters of Scale: Rapid Response. I wanted to talk with Tjada because Mercy Corps began scenario-planning well in advance of Russia’s aggression, its people already on the ground in Poland and Romania, and now inside Ukraine too., Tjada explains that addressing crises is what Mercy Corps is designed for, deploying analytics as well as food, cash, and social services. Tjada says aid organizations have gotten smarter about optimizing resources to help more people in better ways. Still, the human costs in Ukraine are intense with long-term ramifications for the region — and knock-on impacts for other populations in need. Tjada’s positive spirit is reassuring and rallying–which it needs to be, to keep her team and all of us motivated to keep doing more., [Theme Music], Bob: I'm Bob Safian, and I'm here with Tjada McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps. Tjada, thanks for joining us., Tjada: Thank you so much for having me., Bob: So Mercy Corps is involved in humanitarian efforts all around the world through about 6,000 people in 40 countries. So addressing human needs in crisis is what you're all about, but it's hard to be prepared for something of the magnitude of what we're seeing coming out of Ukraine. Can you share with us what your team is up to, and how you're approaching this situation? What do you do first when something like this happens?, Tjada: This is immense, and it's a scale that we have not seen in quite a while. We really go in and assess needs. We've had a team on the ground for weeks as this was threatened, talking to local communities, preparing in Poland, and in Romania, and in neighboring states for people to arrive. And the first thing is to really give people the immediate support that they need. A lot of people when they think of aid, they think of people on the ground handing out blankets, and that's just not how it works these days., We are first providing cash to people. A lot of people showed up with nothing. They need a place to stay. They need a bed. So we're providing them with information on where to go. Cash to have their immediate needs met and to be able to do that in a way that also benefits the local economy., We're also there with psychosocial support, especially in this situation in the early days when men were prevented from leaving Ukraine. You saw women and children arriving devastated, and dazed and confused. And so really helping people to get to safety, connecting them with local organizations, and get their immediate needs met., Bob: You mentioned you prepared for this in advance. You were doing analysis and scenario planning, and I know you've been through these kinds of crises in other areas other times. How much does all that planning help, and how much of a crisis is sort of being reactive and having to assess what the reality is on the ground before you quite know what to do?, Tjada: Obviously a lot of it's being reactive. We have a crisis analytics team that's doing things like monitoring movements of supplies or people so that it helps us to go to where we are needed most quickly. And it also helps us to identify what those needs are when you mix in weather patterns, food patterns, all kinds of things that you can know about a population ahead of time. So that's part of our day to day work — is that crisis analytics data analysis that we’re able to do., Bob: You mentioned you had team members on the ground in Poland and other places before the invasion. Were they doing services at that time, or were they sort of setting things up?, Tjada: They were setting things up. So we're in Poland and Romania, we actually have people on the ground in Ukraine right now. So they were identifying local community organizations that would be prepared to support people, getting set up at the different entry points, working with government agencies. We were going to be prepared either way, although everyone was hoping that this would not come to pass., Bob: You have people in Ukraine now. What are they doing? And I guess: what are they hearing? What are you learning back from what's going on there?, Tjada: Ukraine has 40 million people. Right now we've seen over one and a half million people leave. The U.N. estimates that up to 10 million could leave, but more broadly, a lot of people are displaced within Ukraine. They've had to leave their homes or their cities for whatever reasons. So we are in there doing some of the things I already talked about, like providing cash, providing information, providing assistance, and also trying to help coordinate with other actors. If you think about it, all the basic systems are down. So basic things like food, water, essential health supplies, cots, a place to sleep—all those things are in need. And to the extent that we can bring those supplies if we do, but where we can support the local economy and help keep people going during this, we are doing that with cash assistance as well., Bob: There are also other organizations that are there. How do you decide what it is that you, that Mercy Corps specifically is going to try to address?, Tjada: So, there are and we coordinate very closely. I'm part of a small U.N. security assistance that coordinates with the lead U.N. agencies on emergencies. Mercy Corps, what we do is we work with people who are suffering from conflict and climate, and we help them to survive where they are now., So our focus tends to be food, water, economic opportunities, and helping people to be in community in tense situations. We're trying to work with populations, not only in a moment of crisis, but also ultimately through to a point of resilience and strength for the individuals in the communities that we work with., Bob: Your team on the ground in Ukraine went in just a couple of days ago. Are there stories about people there that you've heard back?, Tjada: We're hearing heartbreaking stories. A woman who escaped Kiev and made it to Romania told us that she didn't even remember what day it was. Her child was having nightmares, and she left her pregnant sister behind in the basement of a Kiev maternity hospital. Another woman sheltering in Kiev with her daughter and older mother told us that she couldn't get her next round of chemotherapy now that the health clinics are closed., We see people trying to evacuate and get on trains out of the country, but they're overwhelmed. We also see men who have been told to stay, who are facing conscription trying to figure out how to navigate that, and how to deal with the reality of what their life is now., Bob: Do they ask your people should I stay, or should I leave the country? Are you being asked to advise in those situations too? Because everybody's uncertain about what to do., Tjada: Certainly people are asking all those questions when they encounter us and others, and I think our guidance is to really help them assess what's the best situation for them and where there are possibilities. That's why we have our analytics to know what's possible, but it's just such a rapidly evolving situation, and everyone has a lot of difficult choices to make. So ultimately a lot of it may be sometimes just listening as people work through different scenarios in their heads., Bob: Yeah. I remember Mercy Corps had been operating in Ukraine earlier after 2014 when Russia went into Crimea, and then the organization pulled back. I realize this is before you were there, but I'm curious if you can explain why that change happened, why you pulled back, and whether there are ways that having been there and having had that experience, whether that helps you now., Tjada: The fact that we had been on the ground in Ukraine before really helps. We had relationships with organizations on the ground and some of our staff who led our operations in Ukraine in the past are still with us today and are able to come back and assist., When we went in before, I mean, it was a point of urgent conflict. We were able to reach more than 200,000 people, mostly in Eastern Ukraine by distributing cash, food, water, sanitation supplies, helping people restore their war-damaged homes, but we also work to build long term resilience in places. And so if the government is able to take over, if local organizations are functioning well. then we move those resources elsewhere., Many of the countries we work in we’re there for long periods of time, but we always celebrate when we are able to leave. Ultimately our goal is to work ourselves out of jobs. And sometimes we leave and end up going back. This situation is very different from the last time in terms of this scale. And the fact that there isn't a part of the country that's able to operate while the other part isn't., Bob: Are there relationships that you built up during that previous time that you're able to tap into?, Tjada: Yes. Absolutely. We're leveraging those relationships with governments and local organizations that we had from the past. The people that were our country directors in Ukraine are still working with us in other places and we've certainly brought them out to help us navigate., We have been doing this for a while, and for us it's about providing smart aid. A lot of ideas that people had about aid or what happens in these situations are outdated, or we've learned as a sector to do things better. So cash is always preferred over goods, right? I heard a story of a colleague of mine who was at a border crossing, and they said a truck came in kind of clogging up the line to get in just full of winter coats sent by people across Europe. And obviously this is very well meaning, but the Ukraine is a cold country itself. People already had their coats with them., And so cash really allows us to get what people need right away. It allows us to promote local economies and it also gives people in these traumatic situations the dignity to be able to provide for themselves. A critical part is working with local organizations and local staff. About 85% of our total workforce is from the communities where we serve. It's a smarter response. It's people who understand the culture. They speak the language. It also is part of that empowerment and letting people be the masters of their own destinies., We also really focus on inclusion these days, right? Even in a terrible situation like now, our biases, people's inherent biases are there and we see them at play. And it's not that people aren't well meaning, but we do need to focus on people who are marginalized within societies. Our team is seeing it firsthand. What our team in Poland is reporting is they see the trains coming in with people, and the white Ukrainians are being showered with things and support right away. And then you'll see Africans or Indians or other people of color who are students or migrant workers being completely ignored and abandoned., Same when we think about the disabled or elderly or people that can't move. So it's about being smarter, making sure that the resources go to where they're most needed and make the biggest impact that they can. Providing cash for people to shop locally, it also helps to defray the tensions from the communities that sometimes receive displaced people. Many of those communities are not wealthy themselves. And so when they see resources flowing in, they need to benefit as well for that longer term cohesion., Bob: And is the cash, is it actual cash or ATM cards, mobile cash?, Tjada: That's part of what's great about our use of technology. Especially after COVID, right? A lot of the cash distributions were in some context, you'll still see this, people on line and getting their $50 or $80 or whatever. And now a lot of it is mobile money and other things that don't require contact, but that still allow us to trace and know that the right people are getting what they need., Bob: We have a lot of those technology companies and leaders of businesses listening to this show, how can they partner and get involved? What does that kind of partnership look like?, Tjada: Part of what we do is really link up with private sector and corporations and technology companies to figure out what solutions or innovations or ideas that we can bring to bear., We've worked with companies like Cisco to not only beef up our remote access, but also to help us with our analytics. We've tested the use of crypto in certain situations. We welcome that partnership. Just reach out to us at Mercy Corps. Because we feel like we have to keep innovating because unfortunately the needs are just getting greater and greater., Bob: The crypto experiment — Is it useful?, Tjada: That's why we're testing now, right? That ability to be able to access money from different places is appealing. I don't have huge results to share now, but we feel an obligation to really lean into these things to figure out the best up to date tools, but also, work with their products to be more safer for people in situations where we work. So it is a very much two-way conversation that's really healthy to have., Bob: Before the break we heard CEO Tjada McKenna talk about how Mercy Corps is trying to meet the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Now she talks about what it takes to lead a team that, as she says, is running into burning buildings., She cautions about potential negative impacts elsewhere as troubles in Ukraine pull resources from other struggling populations. And she worries that, even in this highly publicized moment, resources won’t keep up with the needs., Bob: Mercy Corps often works in places where others don't. You're in Yemen, in Syria. You've been very active in Afghanistan, other places. With all the resources flowing to Ukraine, how is that impacting humanitarian crises elsewhere?, Tjada: The resources flowing into Ukraine are unprecedented, and they are welcome. However, there are geopolitical reasons why Ukraine is getting so many resources. The fact that a nuclear country is involved, and it's very close to the west., But what we are encouraging and actively trying to advocate for is for people to not forget what's happening in other parts of the world. You have Afghanistan on the brink of economic collapse, which puts a lot of people into poverty through no faults of their own. We have droughts in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, after a few seasons of no rain. We think up to 14 million people could end up in extreme hunger needs there. And you also have existing crises in Yemen, Myanmar, South Sudan. We work in all these places. And Ukraine was actually part of the solution for some of these places. So Ukraine was a major exporter of wheat, sunflower oil, and corn. And in fact, I've seen some estimates that Ukraine was providing like 80% of the wheat that was available in places like Yemen and Lebanon. So the ripple effects of this are quite great in terms of food insecurity in other places we serve., The world is very fragile and very interconnected. If anything good were to come from COVID, I would hope that it is that we really realize that this is a bigger us. These things are not contained within one border or within one population. I've heard stories of Ukrainian tourists being trapped in other countries, now needing support in those countries because they can't go back home., We saw that with COVID, with global supply chains, with a virus that moved. So I really hope that people see all of these, not just Ukraine, as part of a bigger us and a bigger global community that we are a part of, even when we don't want to be. And really see that it benefits all of us for economic and security and humanity reasons to be addressing these situations on all fronts., Bob: As you describe the situation, as poignant and important as the challenges are in Ukraine, in terms of the number of people who are impacted. Aside from the geopolitical issue, there are just as many people in other places that..., Tjada: Exactly, and sometimes, even more. I think the danger is that we get fatigued. So I can imagine a year from now, I hope this doesn't come to pass. We'll see how things resolve. But it's not outside of the realm of that a year from now that we're begging people to keep paying attention to the Ukraine and the needs there. Our attention spans on these things are sometimes short or something feels like it's intractable. But that's not true. A lot of individuals have been able to thrive in places that you hear about a lot, like Afghanistan and Yemen, and there are organizations like ours trying to help them do so. So we just cannot let up anywhere., Bob: You joined Mercy Corps in a time of crisis for the organization. It was during the pandemic. Before, you were Chief Operating Officer at Habitat for Humanity and at CARE, and you worked at the Gates Foundation and government. But you hadn't been a CEO before. What's different about being a CEO?, Tjada: So the COO role is fun if you are a bit of a nerd like I am, because you get to do all the technical stuff to make things work. I love the CEO role as well, because as a CEO, your job is not only to make sure things work, but your job is also to provide that vision and inspiration for people., There's definitely more stress that comes with it. But I also get to experience more of our staff. I'm so inspired by the work that they do every day. Mercy Corps is very adept at running into burning buildings, and knowing how to help, and being agile. I’m just so immensely grateful to be able to be colleagues with this team., Bob: A crisis by definition can be triage. You talked about running into burning buildings. Near term, quick responses, but not necessarily always long-term solutions. How do you think about that when it comes to the role Mercy Corps plays?, Tjada: One of the things I love about Mercy Corps is we not only address immediate needs, but we address the underlying conditions and really work for that long term resilience. So in our parlance, that means we do immediate humanitarian work. We do what we consider longer-term development work., We also do a lot of peace building work. Like doing things to train youth, to make sure that they don't get lured in by extremist groups. Or, for instance, in the Horn of Africa, we've worked with nomadic populations there that cross the borders between Somalia and Kenya to develop land and water rights so that there's not that tension with local communities and then we also go in with the modalities that help to promote peaceful thriving economies. So what's different about the Mercy Corps response in emergencies, not only do we provide the immediate needs, but we're constantly thinking about the medium and long term., The fact that we have a lot of skill and expertise in all three dimensions of that, the immediate crisis, the medium to long term, as well as the community building aspect, is what I think makes us uniquely served to help people and communities to live peaceful, thriving lives., Bob: When you say they run into burning buildings, are there particular people on your team who you're thinking about in Ukraine who have done that?, Tjada: One of our ... I won't tell you how long she's served because she might be embarrassed, but our head of security is a fabulous woman named Diego Luba. A gift to anyone would be to spend an hour talking to D as our lead of security. She's been in and out of every country we've worked, every conflict. So she has been there in Syria, in Turkey, and Afghanistan she knows really well, Yemen. She's right there on the ground, in the region right now in Ukraine and Romania., We have the teams that are the first to enter, and we have a network of people that come join us. We try to keep them in the safest positions possible, but they do take risk every day, and it's sobering., Bob: What's at stake in the Ukrainian refugee crisis for all of us and for Mercy Corps?, Tjada: On a bigger level for all of us, just that the inhumanity of the situation. We are an impartial and independent aid organization. So we always work in both government-controlled and non-government-controlled areas where possible and try to serve people's needs. But this kind of mass migration and displacement has ripple effects: huge loss in culture and community. When you think about the importance of the Ukrainian economy to the world and the fact that it was a big exporter of food, that also will cause short to medium term pain for a lot. And then the ripple effects of resources to Ukraine at the expense of other things is certainly a huge factor. And we're still living in the midst of COVID and a global pandemic. So it all compounds, and that's why I am really seized with this idea of a bigger us, and people understanding all the ways that we are wrapped up in this together., Bob: Do you think there are things that people misunderstand about the humanitarian situation?, Tjada: I think some of it is unintentional bias. I think we've seen a lot in this situation. We've seen newscasters or people say things like, ""Europeans aren't supposed to be refugees."" And I don't think people are consciously trying to be racist. They may not be used to seeing people in those situations. So bias is one and the other, I think people don't realize how evolved humanitarian assistance has become and how smart aid is really working to be most efficient with every dollar used. And so I think sometimes that contributes to fatigue. Like, well, you've been in this business all along, why haven't these things ended? But we're humans and humans are going to fight, and we're also in this world of great climate change. So I think the needs will always be there., Bob: I noticed that the New York Times listed Mercy Corps among its suggested places to give for Ukraine, and I imagine when these high profile troubles hit, it leads to a burst of giving. Are the resources coming in commensurate to the need?, Tjada: The resources never come in commensurate to the need, and so that's why we do always have to encourage people to give more, and those are resources from government as well as individual and private foundations. I really worry sometimes about the longer term resources needed, and we definitely grapple with that in places like Afghanistan or Yemen and Myanmar. When I sent an email to our team about what we were doing in the Ukraine, I got a note back from a staffer in Myanmar that basically was saying, ""Don't forget about us."" And we haven't forgotten about them for one second. That's what I worry about, is kind of some of the long term and the knock on effects of that., What's really helpful to us is when people give... Yes, we have a Ukrainian response fund, but when people give us money that's more flexibly earmarked either for disasters broadly or other things. It really helps us to invest in the infrastructure that holds up the support for all of it, like our crisis analytics teams that support multiple countries across the globe. I encourage people to think broadly about it as a system., Bob: And if our listeners here want to go help Mercy Corps in your efforts, how do they do that?, Tjada: Please join us, our website is, www.mercycorps.org. And that's M-E-R-C-Y C-O-R-P-S.org. And if you are a company with a technology or some other kinds of expertise, please reach out to us. The website will tell you how to do that as well, and we'd love to chat., Bob: You continue to lead with a smile and positivity in the thick of this serious crisis. What advice would you give to a CEO or a leader trying to lead a team through crisis?, Tjada: I am smiling and I have gotten the energy, but I think self care is really important. People read your moods, they know what's going on. They're kind of looking to you to signal that everything's going to be okay. So making sure as a CEO that you have those outlets., There's so much greatness in the people that work for us and with us. We lead, but we couldn't lead without all those people doing what they do well, and really taking time to absorb that and marvel at the talent and to appreciate it, I think also energizes me tremendously., Bob: Well, this has been great, Tjada. Thank you so much for doing this., Tjada: It was a pleasure to meet you. Thank you so much for having me.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/aid-all-ukraine-crisis

(Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 19% funded
(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, As of 13 March, civilian casualties have climbed to 1,761 – including 636 killed – according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). These figures are likely much higher as reports are still being corroborated amid increasingly intense clashes. In Mariupol alone, municipal authorities report more than 2,500 civilian deaths, up from almost 1,600 on 11 March., In Donetsk (Donetska oblast, non-Government-controlled areas, NGCA), at least 20 civilians were reportedly killed and nearly 30 others injured when a Tochka-U ballistic missile allegedly hit the city centre. These figures will likely rise in the coming hours., While fighting in Kyivska oblast (north) had previously been largely limited to the outskirts of the capital, early on 14 March, the shelling of a nine-storey residential building in the northern Obolonskyy district of Kyiv reportedly left at least one dead and 10 others hospitalized. That same morning, at least one person was reportedly killed, and six others injured when the debris of an intercepted missile fell in Kurenivka district of Kyiv., The humanitarian convoy en route from the city of Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) to Mariupol (Donetska oblast) was halted about 80 km outside the city in Berdiansk (Zaprizka oblast), as continuous shelling prevented around 100 tons of urgently needed relief supplies from reaching people in desperate need of food, water and medicines. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says an immediate ceasefire is needed to prevent the worst-case scenario. There are unconfirmed reports that evacuations are underway and humanitarian relief is beginning to flow into Mariupol., On 13 March, authorities in Popasna (Luhanska oblast, Government-controlled areas, GCA) reported that white phosphorus munitions had been used amid escalating hostilities in the area. The use of the substance – which can cause horrendous injuries – is prohibited by international law in densely populated civilian areas. The report, however, has not been independently verified., According to the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, some 150,000 people evacuated through humanitarian corridors as of 14 March. The Russian Federation reports that 250,000 people have been evacuated towards Russia. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., Humanitarian Chief, Martin Griffiths, allocated US$40 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to ramp up aid agencies’ efforts to reach the most vulnerable., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Another day of intense clashes across Ukraine has driven up the already-significant civilian toll of the ongoing hostilities. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 13 March, OHCHR reports at least 1,761 civilian causalities, including 636 killed. As of 13 March, OHCHR also reports 720 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (122 killed and 442 injured in GCA, and 26 killed and 130 injured in NGCA) and 1,041 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., The actual civilian toll in Ukraine is likely much higher than the officially reported figures from OHCHR, as many unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties continue to be corroborated. In Mariupol alone, municipal authorities report more than 2,500 civilian deaths, up from almost 1,600 reported just three days earlier on 11 March., Fighting continues to intensify closer to the heart of the capital. While fighting had previously been limited mostly to the outskirts of Kyiv, early on 14 March, shelling in the northern Obolonskyy district of the capital left the lower floors of a ninestorey residential building severely damaged. So far, at least one civilian was reportedly killed, and 10 others hospitalized, according to the Kyiv City Administration., That same morning, one person was reportedly killed, and six others injured when the debris of an intercepted missile fell in Kurenivka district of Kyiv. As Russian Federation troops inch closer to Kyiv, the military encirclement of the city remains a very real possibility. In that case, municipal authorities report there is enough food for at least two weeks to feed around two million people who have remained in the capital., Intense fighting continues to drive a surge in humanitarian needs and significantly damage critical civilian infrastructure – including homes, schools, hospitals and water and gas pipelines - in eastern Ukraine. On 13 March, Sievierodonetsk – the administrative centre of Luhanska oblast (GCA) – came under attack. In Donetsk (Donetska oblast, NGCA), at least 20 civilians were reportedly killed and nearly 30 injured when a Tochka-U ballistic missile struck near the city centre. These figures will likely rise in the coming hours., On 13 March, authorities in Popasna (Luhanska oblast, GCA) reported that white phosphorus munitions had been used amid escalating hostilities in the area. The use of the substance – which can cause horrendous injuries – is prohibited by international law in densely populated civilian areas. The report, however, has not been independently verified., Also on 13 March, the number of civilians moving through evacuation corridors picked up after limited movement in recent days. In total, nine of the 14 evacuation corridors scheduled for 13 March were carried out as planned. According to the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Iryna Vereshchuk, more than 5,500 people were evacuated from hardest-hit areas, including nearly 3,950 from Kyivska oblast and 1,600 from Luhanska oblast. Authorities in Hirske, Popasna, Shchastia (Luhanska oblast, GCA) and Polohy (Zaporizka oblast) were forced to put scheduled evacuations on hold due to constant shelling. The Deputy Prime Minister further reported that some 150,000 people evacuated through humanitarian corridors as of 14 March. The Russian Federation reports that 250,000 people have been evacuated towards Russia. The UN does not have means to verify the actual numbers of people evacuated., In Mariupol, continuous shelling in and around the city – where hundreds of thousands of people continue to face critical shortages of food, water and life-saving medicines – prevented much-needed aid from reaching people in need on 13 March. After departing the city of Zaporizhzhia on 12 March, the Government of Ukraine-led convoy carrying around 100 tons of relief supplies was blocked in Berdiansk – about 80 km from Mariupol. Government officials announced that the convoy will attempt to reach Mariupol once again today, on 14 March., ICRC says an immediate ceasefire is needed to prevent the worst-case scenario in Mariupol. ICRC urges both sides to swiftly reach a concrete and actionable agreement that will facilitate the safe evacuation of civilians looking to leave the city and allow for life-saving assistance to reach those who cannot leave or who wish to remain in their communities, adding that they stand ready to act as a neutral intermediary to facilitate dialogue., At the time of writing, preliminary reports suggest that around 160 private cars have evacuated Mariupol city en route to Zaporizhzhia oblast along the officially agreed upon evacuation corridor out of the city. However, the mayor of Mariupol said that the security of the corridor cannot be guaranteed.

Update 21 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (14 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,14 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that efforts were continuing to resume external electricity supplies to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), a day after Ukrainian specialist teams repaired one of two damaged power lines connecting the site to the grid, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Diesel generators have been providing back-up electricity to the site of the 1986 accident since it lost all off-site power on 9 March. Ukraine said on 13 March that its specialists had fixed one of the power lines and that the NPP would be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity network the following morning., However, Ukraine’s transmission system operator, Ukrenergo, earlier today said the line had again been damaged “by the occupying forces” before power had been fully restored to the NPP. Later in the day, the regulatory authority told the IAEA that at 13:10 CET external power had again been restored and that staff at the Chornobyl NPP had restarted operations to reconnect the NPP to the grid., As previously reported, the Chornobyl NPP’s disconnection from the grid last week did not have a critical impact on essential safety functions as the volume of cooling water in its spent fuel storage facility was sufficient to maintain heat removal without a supply of electricity. The regulator also last week said a safety analysis report for the spent fuel facility had concluded that there would be “no impact on essential safety systems” in the case of a total loss of power, also from diesel generators. The regulator said the current diesel reserves would last until the evening of 15 March., The power supply issues underline the urgency of agreeing and implementing a framework proposed by the IAEA to ensure the safety and security of all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, including also four operating nuclear power plants, Director General Grossi said., On the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The radiation levels at all NPPs are in the normal range, it said., The IAEA is aware of reports that Russian forces have carried out munition explosions at the site of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, and it is seeking information about the situation from Ukraine. The regulator had previously informed the Agency about ongoing work to detect and dispose of unexploded munitions found at the damaged training centre and elsewhere at the NPP following events on 4 March, when Russian forces took control of the site., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported on 13 March. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-21-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-14-march-2022-enru
DiCarlo: War in Ukraine Most Severe Test OSCE Has Faced Since Creation,News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",14 Mar 2022,"Mister President,, Thank you for the invitation to join His Excellency, Foreign Minister Rau, Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to brief the Council on UN-OSCE cooperation., The tragic conflict in Ukraine, which over the weekend has further worsened, vividly illustrates the importance of mechanisms to maintain and strengthen European and international peace and security., Born out of the Cold War, the OSCE, has been at the center of efforts to bring its unique membership, spanning from Vancouver to Vladivostok, around one overarching goal: to resolve differences peacefully., In line with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, the OSCE works in complement to the UN, including to resolve conflicts in the region., In 1993, the UN and the OSCE established a Cooperation Framework. Since then, our partnership has grown in scope and substance to help address acute crises and find solutions to common peace and security challenges., Our shared commitment to preventive diplomacy, mediation, peacebuilding, and the Women, Peace and Security agenda, was reaffirmed through the Joint Declaration between the Secretary-General and the Chairperson-in-Office in 2019., The coordination and complementarity guiding our efforts translate into action in various ways., We work together in Central Asia, most recently to implement the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy., In the Western Balkans, to advance reconciliation., And in the Caucasus, where the UN co-chairs the Geneva International Discussions on Georgia along with the OSCE and the EU., Further, the UN has sought to complement the OSCE’s leading role to address protracted conflicts regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh and Moldova., Regarding Ukraine, and pursuant to Security Council resolution 2202 on the Minsk Agreements, the UN has consistently supported the work of the OSCE, especially the Special Monitoring Mission and the OSCE-led Trilateral Contact Group, while carrying out our humanitarian and human rights mandates on the ground., I wish to pay tribute here to all OSCE staff for their important work accomplished under very challenging circumstances., Mister President,, The war in Ukraine is the most severe test the OSCE and related regional frameworks have faced since their creation. The Russian invasion has shaken the foundations of the European security architecture to its core., As we meet, the bloodshed continues to worsen. Russian forces have now launched deadly strikes in the west of Ukraine., Ukrainian cities are under unrelenting shelling and bombardment, with many civilians killed daily., As I said three days ago in this very chamber, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas. Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law., We are deeply disturbed by reports that Ukrainian municipal officials in Russian-controlled parts of the country have been abducted. There are also reports of civilians, including journalists, being targeted, allegedly by Russian forces., Mister President,, We must not allow any questioning of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Such questioning would be inconsistent with the United Nations Charter and relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions., Amid these dire conditions, the United Nations continues to scale up not only its humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine, but also its engagement with key partners like the OSCE in support of an immediate ceasefire and a lasting diplomatic solution., When the Secretary-General addressed this Council on the topic of “Conflicts in Europe” in 2017, he warned that, despite the achievements of the last 70 years, we should not take peace and prosperity in Europe for granted., He cautioned that as serious conflicts persisted in Europe, new threats and risks made it even more pressing for multilateral institutions and regional organizations to address dangerous challenges to the international order., The Secretary-General’s warnings then were informed in large part by the crises in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014, which demonstrated how real the risks of new outbreaks of conflict were., Today, a devastating war is being waged in a continent that should be equipped to prevent such catastrophes., We are concerned at the dismantling of longstanding confidence-building measures, arms control treaties and other frameworks that were designed and agreed to sustain regional security., This includes the persistent use of regional mediation mechanisms as tools not to solve conflicts, but to manage them, which only helps ensure that those same conflicts continue., OSCE-led processes supported by the international community are now openly questioned by parties involved in them., Mister President,, It is more important than ever for all parties to recommit to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris and other landmark agreements that form the bedrock of European security architecture., In this context, we take good note of the efforts by the Polish Chairperson-in-Office under Minister Rau’s leadership to initiate a “Renewed OSCE European Security Dialogue”., How the OSCE and other regional actors choose to secure the future of European security cooperation will have an impact beyond Europe., The UN supports all efforts to restore mutual trust and respect among regional stakeholders, which is essential to preserving the continent from new conflict and the world from further instability., We, therefore, all have a stake in the outcome., Mister President,, For almost 50 years, the United Nations and the OSCE have partnered to promote European peace and stability. The challenges we face today, and those potentially ahead, demand that we work even more closely together., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dicarlo-war-ukraine-most-severe-test-osce-has-faced-creation
Private sector donates over US$200 million to UNHCR’s Ukraine emergency response,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",14 Mar 2022,"As humanitarian needs continue to rise, UN High Commissioner for Refugees calls on the private sector for continued support., Following fast-growing displacement, a quickly deteriorating humanitarian situation and spiraling needs, donations from the private sector towards relief efforts for Ukraine have reached record-breaking amounts, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, said today., More than 2.8 million people have been forced to flee the country as refugees since 24 February, and at least 2 million more have been displaced within the country. UNHCR fears millions more will be displaced if the war continues., In just over two weeks, companies, foundations and philanthropists have contributed over US$200 million towards UNHCR’s Ukraine emergency response. The private sector is demonstrating its generosity and solidarity through direct contributions, while also launching creative initiatives to help engage stakeholders such as employee giving schemes and match funding. The donations come as UNHCR urgently appeals for US$510 million to provide initial emergency assistance to those displaced inside the country and for refugees throughout the region. As more people flee every day and are increasingly in need of urgent humanitarian support, UNHCR’s funding requirements are also likely to grow., “At this moment, all eyes around the world are on Ukraine. We stand in solidarity with people fleeing for their lives, whose families are being torn apart. We thank the private sector for their overwhelming generosity,” said UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Cate Blanchett., Contributions from the private sector have already enabled UNHCR to respond quickly since the start of the crisis, for example by arranging airlift and truck convoys of assistance both to refugees and displaced people inside Ukraine, and by rolling out emergency cash assistance to those in need so they can find safe shelter, warmth, and food. UNHCR is also providing protection services such as psychosocial support and targeted care to the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied and separated children, deploying scores of emergency experts to help set up reception facilities, and reinforcing operations inside Ukraine and throughout the region. , “I want to thank the companies, foundations and philanthropists from around the world for the kindness and generosity they have shown in helping the people fleeing the war in Ukraine. Millions are in desperate need of urgent assistance. As the crisis deepens, I call on the private sector to continue its support,” said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi., In response to the escalating crisis, the IKEA Foundation, UNHCR’s decade-long partner, has committed EUR€20 million to support the agency’s response to the humanitarian emergency., Per Heggenes, CEO, IKEA Foundation, said: “This is a human tragedy. We believe everyone deserves a safe place to call home and we have pledged to do all we can to help the children and families affected by the deadly war. UNHCR has been our long-standing partner and they have a proven track record. We therefore call on the world’s governments, businesses, and philanthropies to join us and increase the relief support for UNHCR and the people fleeing Ukraine.”, As the private sector rallies to support the response to the Ukraine emergency, UNHCR is also appealing to the world not to forget the many humanitarian crises that are far from the spotlight, where people forced to flee are still in dire need of support., Generous private sector donors include: IKEA Foundation, XTX Markets, CTP, Fast Retailing, Akelius Foundation, Samhällsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB, The Schörling Foundation, BNP Paribas Foundation, INDITEX, Google.org, Volkswagen, Binance Charity, Novo Nordisk Foundation, HEARTLAND, Latter-day Saint Charities, Liberty Mutual Insurance, SONY, TikTok, Zegna, Generali, Cargolux, Pernod Ricard, Kering Group, Shiseido, The Foundation at Sanofi, Chanel Foundation, La Caixa Foundation, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Mazda Motor Corporation, Deloitte, JYSK, Z Zurich Foundation, Bain & Company, Cisco, BioNtech, Royal Humanitarian Foundation of Bahrain, Fujitsu Ltd., Supercell, Ryan Reynolds & Blake Lively, NTT, Restaurant Brands International, Capcom Co., AUDI, Marks & Spencer, Banco Santander, Vodafone Foundation, Banco BBVA, Üsine Foundation, Haldor Topsoe, Software AG, Armani, BASF Foundation, Continental NEXI, Valentino, Prada Group, SAP, Boehringer Ingelheim, Toyota Motor Corporation, Kao Corporation, Adidas, Roschier, Gucci, Fujifilm, Jones Day Foundation, Ripple, Koei Tecmo Holdings., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/private-sector-donates-over-us200-million-unhcr-s-ukraine-emergency-response

Shelter and Non-Food Items",14 Mar 2022,"(New York, 14 March 2022): As humanitarian needs escalate rapidly in Ukraine, the United Nations humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, today allocated US$40 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to ramp up aid agencies’ efforts to reach the most vulnerable people., Almost 2 million people are forcibly displaced and on the move inside Ukraine. Many are unable to leave their homes because of heavy combat in cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Twenty-four attacks on health-care facilities have been verified by the World Health Organization., “Faced with this grim and escalating crisis, we are mobilizing a massive relief effort,” said Mr. Griffiths., “These funds are critical to get operations off the ground immediately. In the early days of our response, fast and flexible funding can make all the difference.”, the CERF funding will help provide life-saving health services, food and shelter to Ukrainians, and support flexible ways to get cash to people in need., UN agencies have already sent in food and urgent medical supplies to Kyiv and other cities, working through networks of bakeries, shops and health facilities to get supplies in. Where markets are functioning, aid agencies are supporting internally displaced people with cash at reception centres in western Ukraine., The UN is deploying staff to the conflict-affected east, to operational hubs and warehouses to get food and medicines closer to those in need. The injection of CERF funds also supports programmes for the most vulnerable people, including women-headed families, people with disabilities and the chronically ill., This is the second allocation since the rapid increase in hostilities in Ukraine. A $20 million injection of funds was announced on 24 February, and a humanitarian system-wide scale-up to ease the suffering of the people of Ukraine has been launched., A Flash Appeal for Ukraine was launched on 1 March in Geneva. It requires $1.1 billion in immediate funding to support 6 million of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine. Donors responded with significant initial pledges. As of today, donors have reported $219 million in funding for the appeal, or 19 per cent of the requested amount., Since its establishment 16 years ago, CERF has been one of the fastest mechanisms for providing emergency funding to people in need. The UN thanks the more than 130 Member States and observers, as well as other donors, including private individuals, who have supported the Fund through the years., For further information, please contact:, In Geneva, Jens Laerke, laerke@un.org, +41 79 472 9750

"MCC calls for peace, nonviolence in the midst of war",News and Press Release,MCC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,14 Mar 2022,"By Rick Cober Bauman and Ann Graber Hershberger, What does it mean to be people of peace in these times? It is challenging to watch people directly impacted by war in Ukraine and many other places like Colombia, Syria, Afghanistan and Ethiopia. Amid the devastation of war, how do we respond in a way that reflects Anabaptist values?, At MCC, our vision is to see communities in right relationship with God, one another and creation. This is a call to peace and active nonviolence based on our faith. Christian peacemaking starts with the belief that God has made peace with us through the gift of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection. Peacemaking is a response to Jesus’s gift of grace and peace. We all continue to sin. All of us are complicit in systems of violence and oppression. We constantly fall short in proclaiming and living out Christ’s peace. God’s grace, however, empowers us to follow Christ as active peacemakers in a spirit of humility. (You can read more about our peace position in our publication, “Pursuing Peace: The Essence of Mennonite Central Committee.”), For MCC, peace is more than a wish, it’s our work. We do this by partnering with grassroots and faith-based organizations and churches that actively work for peace and nonviolence, and with your support. We witness the power of people coming together with hope to respond to impossible situations and ensure the human dignity of all. We walk alongside communities in processes of conflict transformation and reconciliation. We experience the spaces of creativity and imagination that are opened when violence is not seen as an option., From these relationships, we have learned that peacemakers have many tools they can use to create positive change. Gathering together in prayer and worship is a powerful response. Diplomacy, dialogue, disarmament, development, conflict resolution, peace education, active nonviolence and strategic peacebuilding are only a few other nonviolent approaches available to prevent war and to work for peace during war. A refusal to be enemies is a powerful way to reduce the harm of violence and build positive peace., One way we engage in peacebuilding at MCC is through conversations with our governments. In response to the conflict in Ukraine, we ask the Canadian and United States governments to continue considering approaches that do not rely on military intervention or military support. We ask our governments to be global leaders in promoting the use of nonviolent tools such as diplomacy, disarmament, dialogue, the use of international law and support for grassroots peacemakers. We caution against the selling and providing of weapons or direct participation in military missions. We believe nonviolent leadership for peaceful resolution is a way that our countries can make a positive difference., A focus on trauma healing and assistance to meet basic needs will continue to be urgently needed. We ask our governments to provide support for the most vulnerable, including Russians who are also deeply impacted by this conflict. We encourage careful deliberation around the possible unintended negative consequences of broad sanctions., Christ invites us to step into the pain and suffering of others. The skills and tools we take into these encounters and learn along the way include: the ability to listen with care and patience, to mediate and resolve conflicts, to analyze political and historical realities, to seek out voices unheard, to support community-based actions, to be courageous allies, to imagine and create options and alternatives and to embody hope. We invite you to join us as we walk this path, together with all those impacted by wars and conflict., Rick Cober Bauman

Supply chains are being disrupted. And the costs and delays of transportation of imported goods – when available – are at record levels., All of this is hitting the poorest the hardest and planting the seeds for political instability and unrest around the globe., Grain prices have already exceeded those at the start of the Arab Spring and the food riots of 2007-2008., The FAO’s global food prices index is at its highest level ever., Forty-five African and least developed countries import at least one-third of their wheat from Ukraine [or] Russia – 18 of those countries import at least 50 percent., This includes countries like Burkina Faso, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen., We must do everything possible to avert a hurricane of hunger and a meltdown of the global food system., In addition, we are seeing clear evidence of this war draining resources and attention from other trouble-spots in desperate need., I renew my appeal for countries to find creative ways to finance increased humanitarian and development recovery needs worldwide, and to give generously and to immediately release pledged funds., My plea to leaders is to resist the temptation of increasing military budgets at the expense of Official Development Assistance and climate action., In a word, developing countries are getting pummeled., They face a cascade of crises – beyond the Ukraine war, we cannot forget COVID and the impacts of climate change – in particular, drought., Against the backdrop of these immense inter-connected challenges, I am announcing today the establishment of a Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance in the UN Secretariat., I have also asked the Deputy Secretary-General to lead an inter-agency steering committee with partners to oversee this effort., In the coming days, we will be consulting with Member States willing to champion the actions needed to carry forward the global emergency response that will be required for these looming crises., Make no mistake: everyday people, especially women and children, will bear the brunt of this unfolding tragedy., The war also shows how the global addiction to fossil fuels is placing energy security, climate action and the entire global economy at the mercy of geopolitics., Finally, further escalation of the war, whether by accident or design, threatens all of humanity., Raising the alert of Russian nuclear forces is a bone-chilling development., The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility., The security and safety of nuclear facilities must also be preserved., It’s time to stop the horror unleashed on the people of Ukraine and get on the path of diplomacy and peace., I have been in close contact with a number of countries – including China, France, Germany, India, Israel and Turkey – on mediation efforts to bring an end to this war., The appeals for peace must be heard., This tragedy must stop., It is never too late for diplomacy and dialogue., We need an immediate cessation of hostilities and serious negotiations based on the principles of the UN Charter and international law., We need peace., Peace for the people of Ukraine., Peace for the world., We need peace now., Thank you., Question: Thank you, Secretary-General. Do you support Ukraine’s calls for a no-fly zone?, Secretary-General: That is a matter that, as you know, has been analyzed by a number of countries that considered that possibility as a risk of escalation that could create a global conflict. It is based on that analysis that I think we need to be prudent, even if I understand the dramatic appeal of the Ukrainian Government., Question: Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General. Donetsk authorities reported today that a Ukrainian site was hit at the heart of the city of Donetsk by missile Tochka-U and the warhead of this missile was filled by the cluster munitions. I was following the Security Council, but I haven’t heard anything about this. Is the UN aware of this incident?, Secretary-General: I have seen the news about this incident, and I have to say that our position is very clear. Any attack on civilians or civilian infrastructure is regrettable if accidental and condemnable if done on purpose. But let’s be clear. The overwhelming majority of civilian casualties and the overwhelming majority of civilian infrastructure destruction was done in the context of the war by the Russian forces., Question: Thank you, Secretary-General. It’s Pamela Falk from CBS News. You talk about mediation, but the talks have adjourned for the day. Is there anything you have done or will do, and have you reached out to Russia’s President Putin? Thank you., Secretary-General: Yes, we are doing our best. I’ve talked with a number of leaders that are in permanent contact with President Putin.

UNFPA is also offering technical and programme advisory services to neighbouring EU Member States receiving refugees., As the war in Ukraine intensifies, people are fleeing to safety at a rapid pace. Over 2.5 million people have fled to neighbouring countries, and that figure may rise to more than 4 million by July. The majority of those fleeing are women and children who urgently need life-saving support for their physical and mental wellbeing. At the start of the war, an estimated 265,000 women were pregnant in Ukraine, and 80,000 will give birth in the coming 3 months. There continue to be heartbreaking reports of women giving birth in basements and bomb shelters without adequate medical support. There is an urgent need to prioritise health and protection services to reduce suffering, save lives and support those affected., Current UNFPA actions, UNFPA, together with partners, is focusing on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), including maternal and newborn health; and protection from gender-based violence (GBV), predominately for women and girls and the most vulnerable. As the UN sexual and reproductive health agency and lead of the gender-based violence sub cluster, UNFPA is playing a key coordination role. UNFPA is repurposing its existing health and protection programmes in Ukraine and surrounding countries to provide emergency response services to meet urgent needs. As humanitarian access expands, UNFPA will expand interventions, to increase the number of partners and locations offering health and protection services (service delivery points) in the coming days and weeks, including mobile clinics. UNFPA is using its existing network of shelters, centres and crisis rooms with GBV services, established before the start of the military offensive, to respond to the needs of women fleeing their homes. UNFPA is expanding critical health services including psychosocial support and specialist services to pregnant and other women affected by GBV who are in transit or whose services have been disrupted.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unfpa-interim-appeal-ukraine

Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops have quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in other major cities: Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south -east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south-west), Sumy (north), among other cities., A 12-hour ceasefire, agreed to by both sides of the conflict on 9 March, failed to facilitate the wide-scale evacuation of people trapped in dire conditions across Ukraine. While evacuations did commence in five of the six cities agreed upon for the safe passage of civilians, including Enerhodar (Zaporizka oblast, south) and Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east), there was limited movement of people out of the worst-affected areas, such as Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) and the satellite towns of Kyiv (north)., On 9 March, the maternity and children’s wards of a prenatal hospital in the centre of Mariupol were destroyed in an attack. Less than a kilometre away, explosions later that day damaged a university and city council building in the city, increasing the number of civilian centres and critical infrastructure destroyed thus far. Between 24 February and 10 March, the OHCHR reported 1,506 civilian casualties, including 549 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., The increasing intensity of the conflict has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 11 March, over 2.5 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. Of concern is the situation of TCNs, as there have been increasing reports of discrimination, xenophobia, and harassment against TCNs while trying to leave Ukraine as well as on the other side of the border. Consular officials and diaspora organizations are becoming increasingly involved in the evacuation of TCNs, particularly stranded students. On 10 March, for instance, the evacuation of Nigerian students stranded in Sumy began according to the country’s Diaspora Commission, with several students aboard evacuation trains to Lviv. Meanwhile, 115 Chinese students, also stranded in Sumy, successfully evacuated to Lviv on 9 March., Despite the growing operational and security challenges, IOM, UN agencies, and humanitarian partners are preparing to scale-up operations for whenever access and security allow for humanitarian operations to be rolled out in the hardest-hit areas",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-5-11-march-2022

Dr. Monzer Yazji, a Syrian American doctor, co-founder of UOSSM/UOSSM USA, and leader of the mission, has been triaging some wounded patients, stabilizing them, and providing medicines in the Lutsk medical point., The UN documented several targeted airstrike attacks on medical facilities in Syria by Russian forces, that killed countless medical workers including several UOSSM staff members. Now, the same horrors and war crimes witnessed in Syria are being documented in Ukraine, such as the bombing of the Mariupol hospital., Dr. Yazji said, ""UOSSM was a leading voice in documenting and exposing these war crimes to the world. The relentless airstrikes on cities, the opening of humanitarian corridors, and the subsequent attack of them was reminiscent of what we witnessed in Syria as well. We implore the international community to make this time different."", Dr. Yazji added, “The latest headlines are that the Syrian Regime is sending fighters to support Russia’s invasion. We want Ukrainians and the world to know that Syrians have also experienced the same barbarism, and Syrians doctors today are there to utilize everything they have learned to support their medical and relief efforts in the field."", UOSSM was founded in response to the Syrian crisis. Since 2012, UOSSM has been providing emergency care and relief, medical care and relief, mental healthcare, psychosocial support services, protection and nutrition services to millions of displaced and needy families affected by the crisis., Dr. Monzer Yazji is on the ground in Ukraine and available for interview- in person/virtual.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/arriving-kiev-after-10-years-war-syrian-doctors-travel-ukraine-help

Shelter and Non-Food Items",14 Mar 2022,"KYIV, 14 March 2022 – An estimated 100,000 children living in orphanages and institutions in Ukraine are at risk of being left behind or being permanently separated from family members as the conflict continues, Save the Children said today., Ukraine has one of the highest rates of institutional care in Europe, with about 1.3% of all children living in some form of residential care facility. Many of these children remain trapped in institutions as more cities and civilian infrastructure come under attack, including reports of an orphanage being shelled on 25 February., Save the Children is extremely concerned that the children in these institutions won’t be able to access appropriate care as the violence in Ukraine escalates and food, heating and access to education and medical care becoming more difficult. As in any crisis, children without caregivers or guardians in Ukraine are at increased risk of abuse, exploitation, trafficking and neglect., Since 24 February, more than two million people have fled the country – half of them children. The vast majority of refugee children have left for neighbouring countries with a parent or guardian., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, *“Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has triggered a million children to flee, but the majority of children in institutional care remain trapped in the country. These children are some of the most vulnerable in Ukraine and face a **heightened *risk of trafficking, abuse and other forms of exploitation., “We are extremely worried about the safety and welling of these children, especially those living with disabilities. Many children living in institutional care have living relatives able and willing to care for them. However, with the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine, we fear these children will be left behind., “Ensuring the safety of these children, their continued care and access to basic needs must be prioritized. Children in institutional care cannot be forgotten.”, Save the Children is calling on governments and organisations step up and protect children in Ukraine to prevent them from becoming permanently separated from family members, or falling victim to abuse, exploitation, trafficking and neglect. This includes ensuring children without caregivers have access to safe transportation and housing, quality health care, protection and psychosocial support. For safeguarding and family tracing and reunification, it is critical that relevant authorities and the relatives of these children are involved in their movement and subsequent placement., Save the Children is working to establish family tracing and reunification procedures with other agencies to help reunite children with extended family and friends in Ukraine, Poland and neighbouring countries, as well as to establish child protection systems and reporting mechanisms to keep children safe., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, providing humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting access to education, distributing winter and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families. Our specialists support children to overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their ability to cope with stress in their daily lives., The Children Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., ENDS, ·Save the Children staff and volunteers are distributing food, water and hygiene kits to IDPs inside Ukraine and refugees arriving at the Romania-Ukraine border and in reception centres., ·In Poland and Romania, we provide Child Protection services including targeted support for unaccompanied and separated children, psychosocial support and access to legal services., ·Save the Children works with refugee and migrant children inside and outside of Europe, aiming to support vulnerable children with the greatest needs., ·Individuals should not attempt private adoption as such services are unregulated. The best place for a child in an emergency is with their families and communities., ·About 100,000 children are estimated to be living in some form of residential care facility, about 1.3% of the total 7.5 million child population in Ukraine., *******************************************************************************************************************, For further enquiries please contact:, Samantha Halyk Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org / +44(0) 74235 19077, We have spokespeople available., Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-children-without-caregivers-risk-being-forgotten
WHO is working day and night to keep medical supply chains open and preserve Ukraine’s health system [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",14 Mar 2022,"Since Russia’s military offensive began in Ukraine on 24 February, WHO has worked around the clock to ensure a constant flow of health supplies so that neighbouring countries have the infrastructure and expertise to meet urgent needs of refugees, and to support Ukraine’s health system to meet the immediate health needs of people within Ukraine’s borders., Coordinating humanitarian health assistance for people in need, The current estimated number of people impacted in Ukraine is 18 million, of which 6.7 million are internally displaced. Nearly 3 million people have fled the country. Supply chains have been severely disrupted. Many distributors are not operational, some stockpiles are inaccessible due to military operations, medicine supplies are running low, and hospitals are struggling to provide care to the sick and wounded., WHO is coordinating with partners the provision of humanitarian health assistance, both within Ukraine and on its borders, and providing technical support and surge staff. WHO is providing support across Ukraine through the Country Office, the Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen, as well as from its headquarters in Geneva., Delivering life-saving medical supplies, As the Health Cluster Lead Agency, WHO is working with partners to alleviate shortages of life-saving equipment and medication, such as oxygen and insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics, and transfusion kits to collect, test and safely transfuse blood. Oxygen generators, generators to maintain electrical supply in affected health facilities, defibrillators, monitors, anaesthesia drugs, rehydration salts, gauze and bandages are among the medical supplies WHO and partners are shipping into Ukraine to save lives and maintain health services., On 5 March approximately 600 doses of anti-tetanus toxoid reached Kyiv, and 36 tonnes of vital medical supplies reached Lviv, from where they are being distributed to health facilities across the country., On 8 March WHO delivered 10 tonnes of trauma and emergency surgery kits to Kyiv, to be distributed to warehouses in 7 regions: Kyiv, Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Zaporizhia, Zhytomyr and Cherkasy., On 9–11 March 9 shipments of 10 tonnes each were dispatched to Kharkiv via Poltava; to Sumy via Poltava; to Dnipro; to Kherson via Dnipro; to Mariupol via Dnipro; to Mykolaiv; to Zhytomyr; to Zaporizhia; and to Cherkasy. Each shipment serves 150 trauma patients and 15 000 primary health care patients for 3 months., On 12 March 2 ventilators were delivered to hospitals in Kyiv and 14 tonnes or 52 cubic metres of trauma kits and essential medicines for primary health care reached Lviv., WHO is in constant dialogue with Ukrainian authorities. All supplies are distributed in close coordination with the Ministry of Health, based on WHO critical needs assessments, public health risk, service assessments and logistic capacity. The coming days and weeks will see a constant flow of medical supplies, as part of an effort to ensure people’s access to essential drugs and medical care., Scaling up surveillance of hazards and diseases, To support operations in and into Ukraine, a WHO support hub is being established in Poland. WHO has also scaled up surveillance and health information dissemination to detect and respond to outbreaks early and better understand needs, threats and health service availability., WHO and partners have updated the Public Health Situation Analysis for Ukraine, covering health needs and threats to the population. WHO and the Health Cluster also launched the mapping tool 3W, showing who does what and where. Event-based surveillance activities for various potential hazards are also ongoing, including through Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS)., Reporting and condemning attacks on health care, WHO’s mandate for the surveillance of attacks on health care is based on the World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 adopted in 2012, which requested WHO to provide leadership at global level in collecting and reporting information on attacks on health care. WHO created the Attacks on Health Care initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for safeguarding health care from attacks. We report through the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care., As of 12 March WHO had verified a total of 31 attacks on health care between 24 February and 11 March 2022, resulting in 12 deaths and 34 injuries, of which 8 of the injured and 2 of those killed were health workers. More attacks are being verified., WHO strongly condemns acts of violence against health care. Every single attack deprives people of life-saving services. Attacks on health care are violations of international humanitarian law and human rights., Further information:, Tetiana Dolhova

Update 20 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (13 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,13 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Ukrainian specialist teams had succeeded in repairing a power line needed to resume external electricity supplies to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), four days after they were completely lost at the Russian-controlled site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General received the news from the head of Ukraine’s nuclear power company Energoatom, Petro Kotin, who told him that the specialists had fixed one of two damaged lines and would now be able to deliver all required off-site power to the NPP, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located following the 1986 accident., Ukraine’s regulator separately informed the IAEA that the power supply line was restored at 18:38 CET by the repair personnel of Ukrenergo, the country’s transmission system operator. The Chornobyl NPP continues to work on back-up diesel generators and will be reconnected to the Ukrainian electricity grid in the morning, it said., As previously reported, the NPP’s disconnection from the grid last week did not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site as the volume of cooling water in its spent fuel facility was sufficient to maintain heat removal without a supply of electricity., “This is a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now,” Director General Grossi said. “However, I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine’s other nuclear facilities.”, Earlier today, the Ukrainian regulator informed the IAEA that staff at the Chornobyl NPP were no longer carrying out repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment, in part due to their physical and psychological fatigue after working non-stop for nearly three weeks., The staff of 211 technical personnel and guards have still not been able to rotate from the facility since the day before Russian forces entered the site on 24 February, the regulatory authority said, also voicing security concerns about transporting staff outside the Exclusion Zone set up after the accident. The regulator has no direct communication with the staff but receives information from off-site NPP management., Director General Grossi said the increasingly dire situation facing personnel at the facility – coupled with persistent issues related to communication from the site as well as the now resolved power supply problem – added further urgency to an IAEA initiative aimed at ensuring safety and security at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants., The Director General has proposed a framework that would enable the IAEA to deliver technical and other assistance for the safe and secure operation of all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, which he discussed last week with the Ukrainian and Russian Foreign Ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Sergei Lavrov, respectively., “We can’t afford to lose more time. The IAEA stands ready to act immediately, based on our proposed framework that requires agreement from the parties of the conflict before it can be implemented. We can only provide assistance to Ukraine’s nuclear sites once it has been signed. I’m doing everything I can to make this happen very soon,” he said., The IAEA is preparing detailed technical proposals for its assistance, based on the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety that the Director General earlier this month outlined at a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors., Those pillars – including the ones on the physical integrity of nuclear facilities, operating staff being able to make decisions free of undue pressure, secure off-site power supplies, and reliable communications with the regulator – have been compromised or challenged during the conflict that began on 24 February., Ukraine’s regulatory authority also informed the IAEA today that it was closely monitoring the situation in the Chornobyl NPP Exclusion Zone ahead of the annual “fire season” when spontaneous fires often occur in the area, still contaminated by radioactive material from the accident 36 years ago next month., Regarding the Zaporizhzhya NPP, controlled by Russian forces since 4 March, the regulator said the power supply situation had not changed. It has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus an additional one on standby. Two of the four have been damaged. The operator has informed the IAEA that the NPP off-site power needs could be provided with one power line available. Diesel generators were also ready to provide back-up power., Ukraine has previously informed the IAEA that regular staff have continued to operate the Zaporizhzhya NPP and carry out their day-to-day work, but that its management is under the control of the commander of the Russian forces there. In today’s update, the regulator said it had been informed by personnel at the site that at least 11 representatives of the Russian state company Rosatom were also present there, without interfering with the operation of the nuclear facilities. Director General Grossi has repeatedly emphasized that the current situation contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars, that operating staff “must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., The regulator also told the IAEA that it could no longer provide independent on-site regulatory safety oversight of the Zaporizhzhya NPP, in part because its working premises there had been damaged on 4 March. But it remained in constant contact with the site, an important element of the seven safety pillars., On the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Radiation levels remain normal and safety systems were intact, it added., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said it was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but that such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-20-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-13-march-2022-enru

As of midnight on 12 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,663 civilian causalities, including 596 killed, although the actual numbers are likely much higher., • The unfolding military offensive continues to expand to western Ukraine. Early on 13 March, airstrikes were reported at a military facility in Yavoriv, Lvivska oblast (west) and the airport in Ivano-Frankivska oblast (west) was nearly completely destroyed by a second airstrike in three days., • The humanitarian situation in the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) remains the biggest concern.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warns that if there is no respite from hostilities and increased access to basic goods, like food, water and medicine, affected people may potentially die from dehydration, hunger and lack of access to essential medicines., • Amid escalating hostilities, a potential food crisis with global implications looms on the horizon. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that ongoing hostilities could trigger an increase in international food and (livestock) feed prices between 8 and 22 per cent. The disruption of markets and food supply chains will likely have significant impacts on food security in Ukraine and beyond, including hunger hotspots like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen., • The Nutrition Cluster estimates that more than 2 million children under five and pregnant and breastfeeding women are in need of life-saving nutrition assistance in Ukraine., • The Ukrainian Energy Ministry says around 264,000 users have reportedly been cut off from gas supplies in Ukraine, mainly in Donetska, Kyivska (north) and Zaporizhzhia (south-east) oblasts, and some 960,000 are now without electricity, with Chernihivska (north), Donetska, Kharkivska (east) and Kyivska oblasts worst-affected.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-13-march-2022

Ukraine: ICRC calls for urgent solution to save lives and prevent worst-case scenario in Mariupol [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,13 Mar 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) – A worst-case scenario awaits the hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped by heavy combat in Mariupol unless the parties reach a concrete humanitarian agreement urgently, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned today., ""We call on all parties involved in the fighting to place humanitarian imperatives first. People in Mariupol have endured a weeks-long life-and-death nightmare. This needs to stop now. Their safety and their access to food, water and shelter must be guaranteed,"" said Peter Maurer, ICRC's president., Hundreds of thousands of the city's residents are now facing extreme or total shortages of basic necessities like food, water and medicine. People of all ages, including our staff, are sheltering in unheated basements, risking their lives to make short runs outside for food and water. Dead bodies, of civilians and combatants, remain trapped under the rubble or lying in the open where they fell. Life-changing injuries and chronic, debilitating conditions cannot be treated. The human suffering is simply immense., ""The sound of warfare is constant. Buildings are struck, and shrapnel flies everywhere. This is the situation every person in the city faces,"" said ICRC's operational leader in Mariupol, Sasha Volkov., To alleviate this misery and prevent further tragedy, a concrete, precise, actionable agreement is needed without delay so that civilians who wish to leave can reach safety, and for life-saving aid to reach those who cannot leave or who wish to stay., All those participating in the fighting need to agree to the modalities and timing of a ceasefire, the precise locations of the safe passage route, and then ensure that the agreement is respected. There must be enough advance notice to ensure the information is effectively disseminated through the military chain of command as well as to the civilian population, especially given that communication and power networks are unreliable or down. Importantly, the parties would also need to clear roads of any obstacle preventing safe passage. The ICRC stands ready to act as a neutral intermediary to facilitate dialogue on such humanitarian issues., The ICRC appeals to the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law. Civilians who do not take part in hostilities, civilian infrastructure, hospitals and medical personnel cannot be targeted. The parties must do everything in their power to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and protect civilians against the effects of attacks. Civilians must be allowed to escape the fighting, whether a formal safe passageway has been agreed to or not., Time is running out for the hundreds of thousands trapped by the fighting. History will look back at what is now happening in Mariupol with horror if no agreement is reached by the sides as quickly as possible., Note to editors and producers:, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries., The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014 with a team of over 600 staff members.

Protection and Human Rights",13 Mar 2022,"Joint statement from UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO, “Today, we call for an immediate cessation of all attacks on health care in Ukraine. These horrific attacks are killing and causing serious injuries to patients and health workers, destroying vital health infrastructure and forcing thousands to forgo accessing health services despite catastrophic needs., ""To attack the most vulnerable – babies, children, pregnant women, and those already suffering from illness and disease, and health workers risking their own lives to save lives – is an act of unconscionable cruelty., “In Ukraine, since the start of the war, 31 attacks on health care have been documented via the WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA). According to these reports, in 24 incidents health care facilities were damaged or destroyed, while in five cases ambulances were damaged or destroyed. These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 34 injuries, and affected access to and availability of essential health services. WHO is verifying further reports, as attacks continue to be reported despite the calls for protection of health care., “Attacks on health care and health workers directly impact people’s ability to access essential health services – especially women, children and other vulnerable groups. We have already seen that the health care needs of pregnant women, new mothers, younger children and older people inside Ukraine are rising, while access to services is being severely limited by the violence., “For example, more than 4,300 births have occurred in Ukraine since the start of war and 80,000 Ukrainian women are expected to give birth in next three months. Oxygen and medical supplies, including for the management of pregnancy complications, are running dangerously low.
“The health care system in Ukraine is clearly under significant strain, and its collapse would be a catastrophe. Every effort must be made to prevent this from happening., “International humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld, and the protection of civilians must be our top priority., “Humanitarian partners and health care workers must be able to safely maintain and strengthen essential health service delivery, including immunization against COVID-19 and polio, and the supply of life-saving medicines for civilians across Ukraine as well as to refugees crossing into neighbouring countries. Health services should be systematically available at border crossings, including rapid care and referral processes for children and pregnant women. “It is critical that humanitarian actors have safe and unimpeded access to reach ALL civilians in need wherever they may be. UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO are working with partners to scale up life-saving services and support to meet urgent health needs. We must be able to safely deliver emergency medical supplies – including those required for obstetric and neonatal care – to health centers, temporary facilities and underground shelters., “Health care and services should be protected from all acts of violence and obstruction. Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has already put health systems and health care workers under enormous strain, such attacks have the potential to be even more devastating for the civilian population. For the sake of health workers, and for all people in Ukraine who need access to the lifesaving services they provide, attacks on all health care and other civilian infrastructure must stop., “Finally, we call for an immediate ceasefire, which includes unhindered access so that people in need can access humanitarian assistance. A peaceful resolution to end the war in Ukraine is possible.”, Signatures:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/stop-attacks-health-care-ukraine-enru

This included:, a total of 636 killed (127 men, 91 women, 6 girls, and 10 boys, as well as 30 children and 372 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,125 injured (101 men, 71 women, 15 girls, and 4 boys, as well as 43 children and 891 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 720 casualties (148 killed and 572 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,041 casualties (488 killed and 553 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Izium (Kharkiv region), and Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region) where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 9 a.m. (local time) 14 March, 90 children had been killed and more than 100 injured.

Update 19 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (12 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Mar 2022,"31/2022 Vienna, Austria, Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Russia was planning to take full and permanent control of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) under the management of the state firm Rosatom, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. This was later denied by the Russian Federation., The President of Ukraine's nuclear power plant operator Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said in a letter to the Director General that around 400 Russian soldiers were ""being present full time on site"" and confirmed that the NPP remains under the control of the Russian military forces' commander., In addition, Energoatom's Kotin said plant management were required to coordinate with the Russian forces on all operational issues, including technical matters. He confirmed that staff at the NPP were regularly rotating and added that Russian experts had arrived at the site a few days ago to assess the radiation situation there., Ukraine had previously informed the IAEA that Russian military forces took over the country's largest nuclear power plant, with six reactors, on 4 March. Its regular staff have continued to operate the NPP and carry out their day-to-day work, but its management is under the control of the commander of the Russian forces there, Ukraine said. Russian forces took control of another nuclear site in Ukraine, the Chornobyl NPP, on 24 February., In a telephone call with Director General Grossi early today, 12 March, the Director General of Rosatom Alexey Likhachev confirmed that a limited number of the company's experts were present at the Zaporizhzhya NPP in south-eastern Ukraine, but he denied that Rosatom had taken operational control nor that it intended for the plant to be under Rosatom's ""management system""., In a regular technical update today, the Ukrainian regulator told the IAEA that the Zaporizhzhya NPP power supply situation had not changed in recent days. The site has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus an additional one on standby. Two of the four have been damaged. The operator has informed the IAEA that the NPP off-site power needs could be provided with one power line available. Diesel generators were also ready and functional to provide back-up power., Rosatom Director General Likhachev confirmed the site power supply situation and said work was being carried out to restore the lost power lines but in a way not to put at risk the existing supplies, and therefore additional fuel supplies for back-up diesel generators were being brought in, in case they would be needed. He added that other supplies for the plant could also be delivered., The Russian Federation separately informed the Agency formally today that, ""management and operation of the Zaporozhskaya and Chernobyl NPPs is carried out by the Ukrainian operating personnel. A group of several Russian experts provides them consultative assistance. In the framework of providing technical support, the priority needs of plants are being determined to ensure the safe and sustainable operation of nuclear power units. Thus, in particular, with the consultative assistance of Russian specialists, the restoration of the power supply of the Chernobyl NPP and the physical protection system of the Zaporozhskaya NPP is now being carried out. While implementing measures carried out at ensuring the safe and secure operation of Ukrainian NPPs the Russia side maintains close contact with the IAEA""., Director General Grossi reiterates that the current situation clearly contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars namely that ""The operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure""., Regarding the situation at the Chornobyl NPP, the Ukrainian regulator said efforts to repair the damaged power lines were continuing but external electricity supplies remain severed since 9 March. Diesel generators are continuing to provide back-up power to systems relevant for safety, including spent fuel storage facilities at the site of the 1986 accident, and additional fuel deliveries arrived on 11 March, it said., In his phone discussion today with Director General Grossi, Rosatom's Likhachev also provided information about the new diesel deliveries and said power lines could be extended from nearby Belarus to supply the Chornobyl NPP. He said some Rosatom experts were on the site., At the Chornobyl NPP, the plant's staff of 211 technical personnel and guards have still not been able to rotate, in effect living there since the day before Russian forces took control, the Ukrainian regulator said., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed the urgent need to ensure they can properly rest and rotate, saying this is also a vital element for safe and secure nuclear power operation. Adding to the difficult situation, communications between the plant and the regulator were lost on 10 March. The regulator is still in contact with off-site management and is able to provide information about the plant to the IAEA., On the status of Ukraine's operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country's 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Radiation levels remain normal, it added., Director General Grossi has from the beginning of the conflict expressed grave concern about the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear facilities. He has proposed an agreed framework to ensure the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, which he discussed in his recent meetings in Antalya, Turkey with the Ukrainian and Russian Foreign Ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Sergei Lavrov respectively. In addition, he is preparing detailed technical proposals on how the IAEA can assist in this regard, coordinating closely with all relevant parties. Director General Grossi said that the agreed framework must be concluded urgently and he added that in its absence no IAEA on-site assistance could be provided., In relation to safeguards, the Agency confirmed that it has managed to recover all of the data of the Zaporizhzhya NPP that could not be transmitted to IAEA headquarters for a few days this week. There are no new developments regarding the Chornobyl and South Ukraine sites.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-19-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-march-2022-enru

As hostilities escalate, a growing number of people are being displaced every day within Ukraine and across international borders, with 2 million having fled the country. Between 24 February and 8 March 2022, OCHA recorded 1,424 civilian casualties, including 516 recorded deaths. The actual human cost of the crisis is likely much higher., Significant damage to infrastructure as a result of military activity has impacted crucial supply chains and restricted access to vital services and goods in many parts of Ukraine, with a heavier impact on the central and eastern part of the country and sporadic damage in the western part, which to date is less affected by ongoing hostilities. Critical medical supplies are becoming increasingly scarce, including medications and oxygen, putting growing pressure on an already deficient healthcare system. Livelihoods are also seriously affected, and the upcoming crop planting season is likely to fail, threatening food security in the coming year and driving up global food prices since Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter. The large scale displacement of people and sheltering in close quarters is also raising the risk of increased spread of COVID-19. Delivery of assistance to the affected areas of the country requires a dynamic approach that can adapt to the constantly changing situation and level of accessibility., Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country, which means people crossing borders are predominately women, children, older people, people living with disabilities, and other groups facing different forms of vulnerabilities and risks. The most urgent needs identified by rapid needs assessments for people on the move include food assistance, additional reception centres, WASH materials, legal assistance, mental health and psychosocial support and delivery of humanitarian assistance to people waiting to cross borders., The affected population face different challenges based on where they are:, People in Ukraine, including displaced persons, host communities and those sheltering in place. Millions of people are directly affected by the conflict in Ukraine, and there are an estimated four million people displaced within the country, and widespread destruction of housing and facilities., People on the move, both inside and outside of Ukraine. Many are unable to access their essential needs including food, water, shelter and sanitation., People in neighboring countries and beyond who face short-term difficulties in terms of essential needs, as well as medium and long-term socioeconomic risks and recovery needs.

"Fears for the plight of around 100,000 children living in institutions across Ukraine, unable to escape the conflict",News and Press Release,CARE,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2022,"(Bucharest, Romania March 11th, 2022) – CARE International and its Romanian partners are extremely worried for the 100,000 children currently living in institutions in Ukraine who have been largely forgotten during this crisis and remain trapped inside the country., According to Bogdan Simion, Executive Director of CARE’s partner SERA and President of the Romanian Federation of Child Protection NGOs (FONPC): “These young boys and girls are among the most vulnerable in Ukraine right now, and little has been done to ensure they are being safely and successfully evacuated, despite them being some of the highest risk. So far around 150 children from these institutions have arrived in Romania and are being housed in specially prepared facilities across several sites into the Child Protection system of Romania. But there are real worries that as, and if, more and more are able to be evacuated the Romanian child protection system will be overwhelmed and ill-equipped to cope.”, Ukraine has the largest number of children in institutional care in Europe. Around half of children in institutional care are also living with special needs or disabilities and many are not necessarily without families. In Romania alone, 218 unaccompanied children were registered by authorities on Wednesday, March 9th.“If this continues, the capacity of national child protection systems in neighboring countries and across Europe are going to be critically overwhelmed. In Moldova, for example, authorities have been forced to reopen previously closed soviet-style orphanages in order to try and cope with new arrivals,” says Simion., CARE International’s Romania Response Team Leader Valentina Mirza, who has been on the Romania border with teams from CARE and FONPC notes;, “Despite requirements for all unaccompanied children to be registered by local authorities at border points there are already reports of busloads of unaccompanied children showing up in countries like Italy. We heard just recently from sources that a group of 4 children from one of these institutions inside Ukraine had been traveling for 4 days, alone, to try and reach the Romanian border, without yet managing to cross. These kinds of reports are deeply troubling. Situations like this are a trafficker’s dream, especially as many will continue to transit through bordering countries to final destinations. Everything possible must be done to stop already traumatized children being further distressed.”, She adds; “more needs to be urgently done to prioritize these vulnerable groups like children in institutions in evacuation efforts and to ensure they have safe and unhindered passage to leave the country through humanitarian corridors. Authorities inside Ukraine must work to coordinate with the relevant social services in neighboring countries to facilitate this. But ultimately, the only way to ensure their safety is an immediate and lasting ceasefire.”, Currently 30-40% of those arriving to neighboring countries from Ukraine are children under the age of 14. They face a myriad of challenges and psychological traumas, not to mention the disruption to their education. On Monday 14th March children across Ukraine are expected to return to school after the holiday break and there are very real concerns, as the conflict continues, over what will happen to their education, both in the short and longer term., CARE and FONPC will be working across Romania to ensure the delivery of emergency and protection assistance to the most vulnerable Ukrainians, including working with unaccompanied children and those arriving from institutions under the coordination of the local and central authorities., About CARE: Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE has more than seven decades of experience helping people prepare for disasters, providing lifesaving assistance when a crisis hits, and helping communities recover after the emergency has passed.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 12 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,13 Mar 2022,"Date: 13 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 12 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,663 civilian casualties in the country: 596 killed and 1,067 injured. This included:, a total of 596 killed (124 men, 85 women, 6 girls, and 10 boys, as well as 27 children and 344 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,067 injured (97 men, 69 women, 14 girls, and 4 boys, as well as 39 children and 844 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 695 casualties (137 killed and 558 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 542 casualties (111 killed and 431 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 153 casualties (26 killed and 127 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 968 casualties (459 killed and 509 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Izium (Kharkiv region), and Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region) where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 9 a.m. (local time) 13 March, 85 children had been killed and more than 100 injured.

The situation in the city is increasingly desperate., There is no drinking water and any medication for more than one week, maybe even 10 days without drinking water and medication. Also for today, there is no place where we can find food or even technical water., The folks have to search for different sources of water from the ground, and they say that they were drinking after boiling because [there are] no other source of water. People have the lack of proper food. They have to use wood to prepare fire and to cook the rare other food they have. Also, no any hygiene available, so we have just a bit of water to wash hands and that's all that we can use this water., Because the source of water [is] located very far and people have to go one or even two or three kilometers to find these sources of technical water. Another big problem is no [mobile phone] connection at all for at least one week. It's very informational vacuum: people do not know what is happening all over Ukraine and even what is happening in a neighboring district of Mariupol city. Only those who have radio, but there is a very, very few people who have radio, they can listen all the day the radio to understand what is the situation, even inside Mariupol., People lost connection with their relatives. They don't know what is happening with their relatives in other districts of Mariupol. And this already lasted for more than one week, and people are very worried about their relatives. They don't know if they're alive or if they are maybe not alive. We saw people who died because of lack of medication and there are a lot of such people inside Mariupol, and many people who were killed and injured and they're just lying on the ground and neighbors just digging the hole in the ground and putting their bodies inside.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-increasingly-desperate-conditions-mariupol

Update 18 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (11 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,11 Mar 2022,"30/2022
Vienna, Austria, Ukraine has told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines in an attempt to restore external electricity supplies to the site of the Russian-controlled Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) that were entirely cut earlier in the week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Ukraine’s regulatory authority said work that began on the evening of 10 March had succeeded in repairing one section, but off-site electrical power was still down, indicating there was still damage in other places. The repair efforts would continue despite the difficult situation outside the NPP site, it added., Emergency diesel generators have been providing back-up power to the site since 9 March, and the regulator has reported that additional fuel had been delivered to the facility. However, it remains important to fix the power lines as soon as possible, it said., Adding to the challenges in managing the Chornobyl NPP, the regulator lost communications with the site on 10 March. As a result, it cannot provide information to the IAEA about the radiological monitoring at the facility. Despite this, the regulator has continued to receive information about the situation there through senior off-site management of the plant., As reported in the IAEA’s Update 17, the diesel generators are powering systems important for safety, including those for spent nuclear fuel and water control and chemical water treatment, the regulatory authority said, adding that the operator was not able to maintain some functions such as radiation monitoring, ventilation systems, and normal lighting., Nevertheless, also as previously reported, the disconnection from the grid will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located, as the volume of cooling water in the spent fuel facility is sufficient to maintain heat removal without a supply of electricity., However, staff at the Chornobyl NPP are facing increasingly difficult conditions. The 211 technical personnel and guards have in effect been living at the site for more than two weeks, the regulator said, expressing concern also about the availability of food reserves., Elsewhere in Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhya NPP site power supply situation is unchanged from that reported in recent updates. The site has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus an additional one on standby. Two of the four have been damaged. The operator has informed the IAEA that the NPP off-site power needs could be provided with one power line available. In addition, diesel generators are ready and functional to provide back-up power., At the same NPP, work is ongoing to detect and dispose of unexploded munitions found in its damaged training centre and other places after the events there on 4 March, when Russian forces took control of Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant with six reactors, the regulator said., Staff operating the plant were rotating according to their usual schedule, without interference in their day-to-day activities, the regulator said. However, the presence of foreign forces in the area was affecting work morale and causing pressure, it added. The regulator is maintaining contact with the plant, but the IAEA is experiencing difficulties in reaching the Zaporizhzhya NPP management., In the city of Kharkiv, a new nuclear research facility that was also previously hit has suffered additional damage, the regulator said. The facility is used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Because its nuclear material is subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, the IAEA has assessed that the damage would not have had any radiological consequence., Nevertheless, it highlighted once again the risks facing Ukraine’s nuclear installations during the armed conflict, adding urgency to an initiative of Director General Grossi aimed at ensuring nuclear safety and security in the country., On the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Radiation levels at the four sites were normal, it said., Regarding the partial loss of remote data transmission from safeguards systems installed to monitor nuclear material and activities at nuclear power plants, reported in Update 16, the IAEA said it was now back online from the Zaporizhzhya NPP but still down from the Chornobyl NPP, while there were intermittent problems with data transfer from the South Ukraine NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-18-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-11-march-2022-enru
"United Nations Not Aware of Any Biological Weapons Programmes, Disarmament Chief Affirms as Security Council Meets to Address Related Concerns in Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,12 Mar 2022,"SC/14827, SECURITY COUNCIL
8991ST MEETING (AM), The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes, the High Representative of Disarmament Affairs told the Security Council at an emergency meeting this morning to address related concerns in Ukraine., “Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention,” said Izumi Nakamitsu, referring to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, which entered into force in 1975. Aware of media reports on allegations of biological weapons programmes, she encouraged States parties to the Convention — including the Russian Federation and Ukraine — to consider making use of the available procedures to resolve related issues., Meanwhile, she highlighted concerns about nuclear power plant safety and security in Ukraine, warning that “the possibility of an accident…is growing by the day”. Expressing extreme concern that four of seven International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) safety provisions are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya, she said the forces in control of these facilities must ensure their safe and secure operation, communications must be restored, and operating staff must be allowed to carry out duties free of undue pressure. Echoing the Secretary-General’s support for efforts to develop an IAEA safety framework for Ukraine’s facilities, she welcomed recent meetings in Turkey he held with the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, called for greater efforts to establish ceasefire arrangements, emphasizing that the logic of dialogue and diplomacy must prevail over the logic of war. As the war grinds on, civilians are bearing the brunt of the fighting, she said, noting that as of today, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reported a total of 1,546 casualties since the start of the invasion on 24 February, with actual numbers expected to be higher. Most casualties stem from deployed missiles and air strikes amid reports of the use of cluster munitions, she said, emphasizing that aerial bombardment of towns and villages violates international law and constitutes war crimes., When the floor opened, delegates raised concerns about the potential consequences of the use or threat of use of weapons of mass destruction against the backdrop of the ongoing, broadening war in Ukraine. Delegates called for strict adherence to the Biological Weapons Convention, and some cautioned against deploying a crescendo of false allegations in the Council amid a real conflict that is claiming lives every day., The Russian Federation’s representative said his delegation had called for today’s meeting because of facts discovered during Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine: an emergency clean-up was undertaken by the Kyiv regime of the traces of a military biological programme funded by the United States. Documents also confirm that Ukraine — with United States support — operates a network of at least 30 biological laboratories, at which dangerous experiments using synthetic biology were being conducted to strengthen the pathogenic qualities of the plague, anthrax, cholera and other lethal diseases, he said., Calling on his European colleagues to consider a “very real biological danger” of the uncontrolled spread of biological agents from Ukraine, he warned that the risks are real. Noting that his colleagues will likely say this is all fake news and propaganda, he cautioned that, in the event of any incident involving chemical weapons, the Pentagon has told its Ukrainian colleagues to immediately accuse the Russian armed forces., The United States delegate said: “There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s border or anywhere.” The United States Secretary of State has laid out what the Russian Federation would do: fabricate allegations to justify its actions in Ukraine. While Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure, making it possible to detect and diagnose such diseases as COVID-19, and the United States has provided assistance to do this safely, she said it has nothing to do with biological weapons., Given the Russian Federation’s track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations it is perpetrating, she expressed serious concern that it may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people. To the Russian Federation she said: “The world is watching. Photographic and video evidence is mounting, and you will be held to account for your actions. We will not let atrocities slide.”, Albania’s representative said the Russian Federation should not come to the Council with “fantasies and starry-eyed stories”, but with proof. He also noted that the Russian Federation has a long and well-documented record of using chemical weapons, including in attempted assassinations, and supports the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against the civilian population., Echoing this view, the United Kingdom’s delegate said the Russian Federation’s conspiracy theory is “utter nonsense”, adding that Moscow “is sinking to new depths today, but the Council must not get dragged down with it”. Similarly, France’s delegate said: “No one is fooled by Russia’s lies.” Indeed, this is not the first time that Moscow is spreading lies to cause confusion, sow fear and cover up its own responsibilities, he said, adding that it is the Russian Federation, not Ukraine, that resorted to using chemical weapons in recent years on European soil., China’s representative said that any concern about biological weapons should trigger the Council’s attention. In this vein, the Russian Federation’s concerns must be addressed adequately, with the provision of comprehensive clarification and verification., Ukraine’s delegate expressed concern that the Russian Federation is manipulating the Security Council to the detriment of the organ’s credibility. Indeed, the Russian Federation’s allegations about biological and chemical programmes in his country are dangerous, as Moscow might be contemplating further attacks using those allegations. By calling this meeting, the Russian Federation’s delegate has shot himself in the foot once again, he said, emphasizing that Ukraine runs its health systems in compliance with its international obligations., Also delivering statements were representatives of India, Mexico, Ghana, Ireland, Norway, Brazil, Kenya and Gabon. The representatives of the Russian Federation and the United States took the floor for a second time., The meeting began at 11:08 a.m. and ended at 12:59 p.m., Briefings, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said the war in Ukraine is now in its third week, and fighting continues unabated. The Russian armed forces are pursuing their offensive operations and laying siege to several cities in the south, east and north of the country, with a large concentration reportedly massed along several approaches to the capital, Kyiv. The situation is particularly alarming in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, where there is shelling of residential areas and civilian infrastructure, resulting in an increasing number of civilians killed and injured. “The utter devastation being visited on these cities is horrific,” she said., Civilians are paying the highest price for the conflict, she said, noting that as of 11 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded a total of 1,546 civilian casualties, including 564 killed and 982 injured, since the start of the invasion on 24 February. OHCHR believes the real casualty figures are likely considerably higher. Most of the recorded civilian casualties, which include children, have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., She said OHCHR has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas. Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law. Directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes. As of 10 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 26 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances, causing 12 deaths and 34 injuries. This includes the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital on 9 March, she said, condemning such attacks. “We cannot emphasize it enough: the targeting of civilians, of residential buildings, hospitals, schools, kindergartens is inexcusable and intolerable,” she said. All alleged violations of international humanitarian law must be investigated and those found responsible held accountable., Millions of people in Ukraine need urgent assistance, she said, including 2 million internally displaced people. Humanitarian aid is being scaled up in areas where security permits, with over 500,000 people now receiving assistance. The United Nations and partners have developed operational plans to meet humanitarian needs where they are most acute, she said, adding that this work needs funding. Over $1.5 billion was pledged to the appeals launched last week, she said, encouraging donors to release the funding quickly. It is critical to urgently achieve a cessation of hostilities to allow for the safe passage of civilians from besieged areas and to ensure that life-saving humanitarian supplies can reach those who remain. On 9 March, over 51,000 people were reportedly evacuated through five out of six agreed-upon safe passages. These safe passages must continue, she said, stressing that “civilians should be duly and timely informed of the possibility to leave the concerned areas on a voluntary basis and in the direction they choose”. To expand life-saving assistance and services to those most in need, humanitarian actors must also have safe, rapid, unimpeded and sustained access to all areas., Turning to the growing number of refugees from Ukraine, which has reached 2.5 million, she commended host countries. All people fleeing Ukraine, including third country nationals, need access to safety and protection, in line with the principle of non-refoulement and without any form of discrimination. “The need for negotiations to stop the war in Ukraine could not be more urgent,” she said, noting that three rounds of talks held thus far between Ukrainian and Russian delegations. Calling for such efforts to intensify, including to further secure humanitarian and ceasefire arrangements as a matter of priority, she urged the sides to build on their contacts, such as the meeting on Thursday between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in Antalya, Turkey. The logic of dialogue and diplomacy must prevail over the logic of war., The Secretary-General is grateful to the many Member States working in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to this dangerous conflict, she said, adding that he is in regular contact with regional and other leaders and his good offices remain available. She reaffirmed the United Nations commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. As the war grinds on, there is already much reflection about its implications, beyond the tragedy it represents for Ukraine. There is an increasing use of terms such as “turning point”, “defining moment”, “end of multilateralism”, she said, noting that some consequences are already being felt, economically and politically. Perhaps most alarming are the risks the violence poses to the global framework for peace and security, she said, adding that: “We must do everything we can to find a solution and put an end to this war; we must do it now.”, IZUMI NAKAMITSU, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said she is aware of reports that certain public health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict putting the safety of those facilities at risk, and appealed to all parties in the conflict to ensure the safety of all such facilities in Ukraine. The United Nations is also aware of media reports concerning allegations of biological weapons programmes, but not of any such programmes, largely thanks to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits their development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use. The Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States parties to the Convention and Moscow is also a depositary Government. Biological weapons have been outlawed since the Convention entered into force in 1975; a total of 183 States have joined the Convention and biological weapons are universally seen as abhorrent and illegitimate. As the Convention lacks a multilateral verification mechanism overseen by an independent organization, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), assessing compliance with its obligations is a task for States parties., Despite the lack of an international verification regime, the Biological Weapons Convention does contain several measures to which concerned States parties can have recourse to address concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers, she explained. Within the framework of Article V — under which States parties undertake to consult one another and to cooperate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the Convention’s application — an annual exchange of information has been established based upon the submission of “confidence-building measures”. States parties must declare information about relevant facilities and activities on their territory to “prevent or reduce the occurrence of ambiguities, doubts and suspicions” between them. The Russian Federation and Ukraine both participate annually in the “confidence-building measures”, she pointed out. The annual reports submitted by them are available to all States parties for the purposes of transparency and reassurance., Within the framework of Article V, States parties have developed procedures for “clarifying ambiguous and unresolved matters”, including the possible convening of a “formal consultative meeting” to consider such matters. Under Article VI, which states that “Any State Party to this Convention which finds that any other State Party is acting in breach of obligations deriving from the provisions of the Convention may lodge a complaint with the Security Council”, an investigation based on the complaint received could be initiated if agreed by the Council. She noted that Article VI has never been activated., While these provisions have not been regularly used, they are nonetheless internationally agreed procedures that are available to defuse tensions and to address and resolve any concerns relating to compliance with obligations under the Convention in a multilateral setting. “I would, therefore, encourage the Biological Chemical Weapons States parties to consider making use of the available procedures for consultation and cooperation to resolve these issues,” she said, adding: “Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, to operationalize and institutionalize it.” She encouraged its States parties to come to the Convention’s ninth Review Conference, scheduled to take place in Geneva later in 2022, committed to a serious overhaul of the Convention to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to deal with the challenges ahead., On the worrying issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine, she warned that an accident involving the nuclear facilities in that country could have severe consequences for public health and the environment and all steps must be taken to avoid it. “The possibility of an accident caused by failure to a reactor’s power supply or the inability to provide regular maintenance is growing by the day,” she stressed. The forces in effective control of nuclear power plants in Ukraine must ensure their safe and secure operation., She then expressed extreme concern that four of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) seven pillars for the safe and secure operation of facilities are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya. Communications must be fully restored, and operating staff must be allowed to properly carry out their duties and to do so free of undue pressure. Echoing the Secretary-General’s support for the IAEA Director General’s efforts to develop a framework to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s facilities, she welcomed the constructive meetings he held in Turkey on 10 March with the foreign ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation., Statements, VASSILY NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that “the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how vulnerable humanity is when facing biological threats”. In 1975, when the Biological Weapons Convention came into force, it helped the world get rid of those biological threats created by men, because all who signed it understood the huge risk of using such weapons. “Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that these hopes have not been fully fulfilled,” he said. He went on to underscore that his delegation convened the meeting today because during Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine, it discovered “truly shocking facts of an emergency clean-up by the Kyiv regime of the traces of a military biological programme, which is being implemented by Kyiv with the support of the United States ministry of defence”, he said. The Russian Federation Ministry of Defence has documents which confirm that Ukraine has a network of at least 30 biological laboratories in which very dangerous biological experiments were being conducted, aimed at strengthening the pathogenic qualities of the plague, anthrax and cholera and other lethal diseases, using synthetic biology. This work is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States, he said., The Russian Federation’s military became aware of a programme that has the goal of studying the possibility of spreading infections using migratory birds, including H5N1 and the Newcastle disease, he said. Another area of study looks at bacterial pathogens that can spread from bats to people. As can be seen from the project documents, the United States actively funds the projects in Ukraine. Under the pretext of curing COVID-19, blood serum from Slavic people has been sent from Ukraine to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the United States, he said, noting that there are biological agents that can selectively target specific ethnic groups. In Ukraine, there is a growing number of German measles cases. WHO has declared Ukraine at high risk for polio, he said, adding that in 2019, there was an outbreak of disease that was symptomatically close to the plague., He addressed his European colleagues, calling on them to think about a “very real biological danger” of the uncontrolled spread of biological agents from Ukraine. He underscored that a “biological threat, because of its very nature, knows no borders”, noting that “there is no region in the world today that can feel safe”. He said that he was sure his colleagues will say this is all fake news and propaganda, but the risks are very real, given the interests of the radical nationalist groups in Ukraine. In the event of any incident involving chemical weapons, the Pentagon has told its Ukrainian colleagues to immediately accuse the armed forces of the Russian Federation and say they are striking against the United States scientific and medical institutions, he said., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said what was heard just now in the Council indicates that these allegations are false, unsubstantiated and part of the Russian Federation’s usual propaganda and the disinformation, which are “conspiracy theories not worth our time”. The Russian Federation should not come to the Council with “fantasies and starry-eyed stories”, but with proof. The Russian Federation has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons, including in attempted assassinations and in poisoning its own citizens, like the jailed opposition leader, Alexey Navalny. As such, members should be very worried that in spreading such disinformation, a crescendo of allegations about weapons of mass destruction could serve as yet another pretext for the Russian Federation to prepare the ground and use chemical or biological weapons during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine while accusing others. He recalled that Moscow has accused Ukraine of genocide in Donbas of seeking to produce nuclear weapons and of bombarding its own cities, “which is preposterous”, he said. The Russian Federation continues to support the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against the civilian population. The Russian Federation’s abhorrent actions in Ukraine constitute war crimes, he said, citing such cases as cluster munition use, bombardment and assaults on health facilities. Its unprovoked, unjustified and premeditated act of aggression, with the complicity of Belarus, lacks any legal or moral ground. He also noted the European Council’s conclusions that welcomed the will of Ukraine to join the European Union., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that her country’s Secretary of State has laid out what the Russian Federation would do, such as fabricating allegations to justify its actions in Ukraine. The world is watching Moscow’s actions, she said, also denouncing China for spreading disinformation in support of the Russian Federation. “Ukraine does not have biological programmes. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s border or anywhere,” she said. Ukraine owns and operates its own public health laboratory infrastructure, which make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19, and the United States has provided assistance to do this safely. It has nothing to do with biological weapons. The Russian Federation has a long, well-documented history of using biological and chemical weapons. “It is Russia who is the aggressor,” she said, adding that it had poisoned Aleksey Navalny with nerve agents, and continues to shield the Assad regime in Syria from accountability for repeatedly using chemical weapons., Given the Russian Federation’s track record of falsely accusing other countries of the very violations it is perpetrating, she expressed serious concern that it may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people. “The intent behind these lies seems clear, and it is deeply troubling,” she said, adding that such agents could be used for assassinations, as part of a staged or false flag incident, or to support tactical military operations. To counter the Kremlin’s disinformation tactic, the United States is sharing what it knows transparently. Denouncing the Russian Federation’s attempt to use the Council to legitimize President Vladimir Putin’s choice of war, she said Ukrainians are documenting all actions of the aggressor. The Russian Federation “cannot paint over the front page” of The New York Times and deny other media reports. Ukrainian journalists are risking their lives to report on Moscow’s reckless behaviours towards nuclear plants. Russians are marching in the street to protest Putin’s war of choice. The United States did not oppose holding today’s meeting because the meeting confirms her country’s prediction was correct and exposed Moscow’s malicious lies to the world. To the Russian Federation she said: “The world is watching. Photographic and video evidence is mounting, and you will be held to account for your actions. We will not let atrocities slide.” She added that “we are confident that truth and transparency will prevail.”, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) denounced the unfounded allegations of the Russian Federation that there are biological weapon research labs in Ukraine. “No one is fooled by Russia’s lies,” he said, calling them a smoke screen and a weapon of war. This is not the first time that the Russian Federation is spreading lies to cause confusion, sow fear and cover up its own responsibilities. It is the Russian Federation, not Ukraine, that resorted to using chemical weapons in recent years on European soil. Moscow is also seeking to cover up the chemical attacks of the Syrian regime. He expressed concern that it is a prelude to the use of a chemical or biological weapon in Ukraine. The Russian Federation used premeditated aggression against a sovereign State, violated the Charter of the United Nations and pushed millions of Ukrainians into the streets, leading to the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. Neither disinformation nor the veto can mask this harsh reality, nor will the laws adopted by Moscow to muzzle the press. “Russia can fool neither Russians nor the world,” he said., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said the Russian Federation’s conspiracy theory is “utter nonsense”. There is not a shred of credible evidence that Ukraine has an offensive biological weapons programme. Ukraine is a State party to the Biological Weapons Convention in good standing. The research laboratories are established facilities set up to deal with Soviet-era biological programmes and other public health hazards. This is yet another lie in Moscow’s disinformation campaign. They said they would not invade Ukraine, and they invaded. The Russian Foreign Minister then said they had not invaded. A whole pack of lies. “Russia is sinking to new depths today, but the Council must not get dragged down with it,” she said. The Russian Federation is invading Ukraine in violation of international law. They are killing hundreds of civilians through indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities; 2.5 million Ukrainians have become refugees. One million children have been forced to flee from President Putin’s invasion. “This is a war of choice that Russia needs to end,” she said. The Security Council has important work to do. “We do not sit in this Chamber to be an audience for Russia’s domestic propaganda. And we should not allow Russia to abuse its permanent seat to spread disinformation and lies and pervert the purpose of the Security Council,” she said., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) said he has noted the recent statements from States and wider information regarding biological activities relating to Ukraine. He underlined the importance of the Biological Weapons Convention as a key global and non-discriminatory disarmament Convention which prohibits an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. “It is important to ensure full and effective implementation of the Convention in letter and spirit,” he said. Any matters related to obligations under the Convention should be addressed through consultations and cooperation between the parties concerned. He expressed his concern over the ongoing situation in Ukraine and said he hoped that dialogue will lead to the ending of hostilities. There is no other alternative except the path of diplomacy and dialogue, he said, underscoring that the dire humanitarian situation needs immediate and urgent attention., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said WHO has no knowledge of any activities by Ukraine that contravene the Biological Weapons Convention, as the High Representative just informed the Council. The Biological Weapons Convention is a fundamental instrument, and mechanisms established by it must be used, he said, recalling that Article V stipulates that States must consult with one another to address any concerns. Mexico opposes the use of biological weapons by any actor under any circumstances, he said. Condemning attacks against medical and scientific facilities in Ukraine, he called for a ceasefire and, meanwhile, a sustainable humanitarian pause without restrictions or exclusions to ensure that aid reaches those who need it., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) noted that a conclusive determination of Ukraine’s biological programmes can only be made after further assessment by relevant institutions such as WHO. He went on to urge the parties to respect the call for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire and for the Russian Federation to withdraw all its invading troops from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. The weaponization of chemical or biological agents in the war in Ukraine or anywhere else, would be wrong and that should not even be contemplated, he said, noting that his country supports the call for a verification regime for the Biological Weapons Convention. Expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he also voiced concern about the transmission of the shocks of the war within the global economy and its disproportionate impact on developing countries and small economies, many of which are already caught in the throes of the pandemic. He also called for the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers in Ukraine in accordance with the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) expressed deep regret over the Russian Federation’s decision to call for today’s meeting, done for no other reason than to advance baseless claims against Ukraine and the United States, which she described as intolerable. Prohibitions on the development and use of biological and chemical weapons must not be undermined. Given the reckless disregard for nuclear safety and security shown by Russian Forces, there are fears for chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear safety arising from the invasion. “This in no way, however, supports the claims of weapons of mass destruction development in Ukraine,” she asserted, citing the Russian Federation’s long-standing pattern of using such claims as a cover for its own transgressions. It is unacceptable to levy such claims at a State party in good standing with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction; and the Biological Weapons Convention. No evidence has been advanced to support them, she said, noting that Ireland and other countries have challenged these claims in the OPCW. She urged Moscow to cease its disinformation campaign and refrain from using the Council as a platform to spread it. Civilians must be protected, and compliance with international humanitarian law ensured. She called for safe, full and unhindered humanitarian access, urging the Russian Federation to immediately cease its hostilities, unconditionally withdraw from and refrain from any further use of force against Ukraine., MONA JUUL (Norway) reiterated condemnation of the Russian Federation’s decision to wage war against its peaceful neighbour, Ukraine. Its call for a meeting today based on a false narrative that Ukraine is developing biological weapons impacts the body’s credibility. The real threat to international peace and security is the illegal war waged by the Russian Federation against another sovereign Member State. She condemned its use of cluster munitions, confirmed today, describing the unsubstantiated claim that Ukraine was preparing aggressive action with the use of biological weapons as “intolerable”. Similar claims emerged around chemical weapons production. “There is no evidence that Ukraine has developed, or planned to use either chemical or biological weapons,” she emphasized. Norway remains a staunch supporter of the Biological Weapons Convention and condemns any use of such arms, which would constitute a clear violation of these instruments. Universal adherence and full implementation by all States parties are key. She urged the Russian Federation to uphold its international obligations “just like all” must. She expressed deep concern over the humanitarian crisis, stressing that Norway is appalled by the lack of respect for international humanitarian law demonstrated by the Russian military forces, especially to protect civilians. “Russia must end this war now,” she insisted, withdraw its forces and engage in good faith to find a diplomatic solution., ZHANG JUN (China) said that the conflict in Ukraine is rapidly evolving and now is the time to intensify diplomatic efforts to end it and prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. Peace negotiations are the only viable means to resolve the conflict. Noting multiple rounds of direct talks by Russian and Ukrainian leaders, he welcomed these positive steps towards achieving peace. Urging the international community to support these efforts, he expressed his country’s determination to play its part in de-escalating the conflict. Any concern about biological weapons should trigger the Council’s attention. The Russian Federation’s concerns must be addressed adequately, with the provision of comprehensive clarification and verification. The WHO has instructed Ukraine to destroy dangerous pathogens, he noted, seeking details on this matter. He then rejected the accusations against his country by the United States, urging Washington, D.C., to provide relevant data so that the international community can draw conclusions about the United States’ biological programmes around the world., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) stressed that any accusation regarding violations of the basic prohibitions set out by the Biological Weapons Convention are extremely serious and must be thoroughly substantiated by solid evidence. Such evidence must be presented to and confirmed by an independent and impartial authority, he said, noting that such investigation mechanisms are not strong enough at the moment. He went on to note that legitimate scientific and technological research on biosafety and biosecurity should be kept distinct and separate from possible violations of the prohibition against the development and production of biological weapons to preserve the Biological Weapons Convention regime. Research into new and dangerous pathogens should be subject to strict transparency mechanisms, he said, adding that his country has long favoured the negotiation of a multilateral verification protocol as a complement to the Biological Weapons Convention, with additional measures to guarantee protection and security against emerging biological threats., MICHAEL KIBOINO (Kenya) noted that the conflict in Ukraine continues at an unacceptable cost to that country’s people and the entire world. Expressing concern about the charges of the development of biological weapons in Ukraine, he said the Biological Weapons Convention weighs the Security Council with the responsibility to consider carrying out an investigation. He went on to note that the effects of the conflict in Ukraine are being experienced far outside the country, pointing to sanctions and counter-sanctions which are threatening the world food supply, and increasing energy costs which will drive millions more people into poverty. He reaffirmed Kenya’s recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that the Council is holding a second meeting in a context marked by the risk of the use of weapons of mass destruction. The serious accusations are valid on both sides and make clear that there is a persistent risk of the use of chemical weapons linked to the war in Ukraine. He called on the parties to abide by the relevant provisions of the Biological Weapons Convention. As a member State of the Convention, he reaffirmed Gabon’s opposition to any use of such weapons. All belligerents should abide by international humanitarian law. He called on the States concerned to return to the negotiating table and to put an end to the suffering of civilians, who have paid a heavy toll., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor for a second time, said it was expected that Western colleagues did not address the substance of the issue his delegation had put forward. His counterpart from the United States was “throwing thunder bolts” and other voices are trying to accuse the Russian Federation rather than account for their nefarious activities in Ukraine. Recalling the container held by then United States Secretary of State Colin Powell in this Chamber, he said that meeting was followed by the United States going into Iraq, whose consequences reverberated throughout the whole Middle East region and leading to the creation of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Military development is a secret enterprise, and those involved do not report to Ms. Nakamitsu about it. Recalling the attacks made by the United States-led coalition, he said this issue had been “buried”., Every day, however, mention is made of the Russian Federation using cluster bombs and bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, he said, adding that the Russian Ministry of Defence has refuted both incidents. Indeed, radicals had converted that maternity hospital into a base, he said, displaying a series of photographs. Referring to the allegedly “destroyed” hospital, he held up one photograph, describing the structure as being mostly intact, which would have not been the case had a rocket or bomb been deployed. At the same time, he said that the Russian Federation is being told about 17 people that had been wounded in the building, and not a single death was reported. Drawing attention to “a false photo” of blogger Marianna Podgurskaya taken at the maternity hospital, he said she is using “two different kinds of makeup” in various sets of photographs. Dismayed by the dirty campaign to blame the Russian Federation of attacking a civilian structure, he recalled that the conflict in Ukraine started eight years ago. Showing Council members a photograph taken in Ukraine featuring an image of a United Nations vehicle, he said his delegation will request an investigation into this., Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor again, said there is only one aggressor here and that is the Russian Federation., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) described the Russian Federation’s ambassador as the representative of the aggressor State which sits in the seat of the Soviet Union in this Council chamber. That status was recognized by the recent General Assembly resolution. Citing Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks yesterday that Moscow does not plan to attack other countries and it did not attack Ukraine, he said the Russian Federation’s officials are struggling to get the story straight about its attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol. The Russian Embassy in London tweeted that a pregnant woman was wearing makeup and playing multiple roles. A spokesperson in the Kremlin first said that the Russian Federation does not target civilian infrastructure. Then, Mr. Lavrov said, without evidence, that the hospital in Mariupol was a warranted target because it had been seized by Ukraine armed groups. He showed a photo of this woman giving birth to a girl yesterday, rejecting Russian lies about her, her family and the incident., “We need to hear directly from the mastermind of the war crimes committed so far,” he said, stating that his Russian counterpart in the Council had no idea of what is happening on the ground. Russian allegations about biological and chemical programmes in Ukraine are dangerous, he said, as Moscow might be contemplating further attacks using those allegations. By calling this meeting, the aggressor has shot itself in the foot once again. Ukraine runs its health systems in compliance with its international obligations. “Russia does not give a monkey about safety of his own citizens,” he said, expressing concern that the Security Council is now manipulated by the Russian Federation to the detriment to the organ’s credibility. The Russian Federation has hit the maternity hospital, killed more than 1,500 residents in Mariupol, and destroyed that beautiful city on the Azov Sea. Other cities were razed to the ground. The Russian Federation planned the bombing of residential areas beforehand. He then read out a statement of 194 Nobel laureates denouncing the war launched by the Russian Federation., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Mar 2022,"March 11, 2022—The humanitarian situation in Mariupol is extremely dire, as the Ukrainian city is bombarded, aid cannot enter and civilians cannot safely flee. Kate White, an emergency manager for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Geneva, gave the following statement today:, In Mariupol, our teams report that many families do not have enough water, food and medicine. For small children this can be particularly dangerous. Unlike adults, their bodies cannot withstand wide fluctuations in food and water intake, and so they are at high risk of dehydration. Contaminated water can also cause diarrhea, which in turn can set in motion a vicious circle, with diarrhea leading to further dehydration. In extreme situations, this can also result in death., Poor water quality can also lead to a number of other diseases including skin infections and scabies. On top of this, in Mariupol people are having to live in crowded conditions as they shelter from shelling and explosions and are unable to follow basic hygiene measures. This could lead to respiratory tract infections and the spread of COVID-19., Low and poor water supply can also cause outbreaks of communicable diseases. We are particularly worried about cholera. Mariupol saw an outbreak of cholera in 2011, so we know that the bacteria which causes cholera is present in the region. Moreover, Ukraine has had low vaccination coverage, so the risk of other vaccine-preventable diseases including measles and polio spreading is also high., Because there is lack of fuel, people are having to use wood for cooking in houses that are not built for this. So, the likelihood of fires is high, and people are at risk of incurring severe burns and suffering from respiratory illnesses. In a context where the health system has literally collapsed, this could be fatal., Moreover, with active warfare ongoing, people are not able to move freely, which severely limits their ability to seek health care. When peoples’ freedom, safety and their ability to seek timely health care is compromised, all this goes against the laws of war, which establish the right of civilians to seek safety and health care., More broadly, eastern Ukraine has a high proportion of elderly people as a direct consequence of the eight-year conflict. Many young people fled when war broke out in 2014. Elderly people are the least mobile so more likely to stay on. Many have underlying health conditions including hypertension and diabetes. Even if we don’t see an immediate impact on elderly people, we know this will appear., The war has disrupted community structures, which have been essential in supporting health care needs of elderly people. We had established a network of health volunteers who supported people to get timely diagnoses and treatment as well as help with getting medicines. Because of active fighting, many community health workers have left the region or are in hiding. So, this will only increase the sense of isolation among the elderly., In Mariupol today, there is hardly any safe place and the sound of gunfire, shelling and aerial bombardment is ever present. Very often, mental health consequences take years to manifest but also require immediate assistance. We will have to deal with the mental health impact of this war on a massive scale for years., MSF has been working in Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine for over eight years. Immediately before war broke out in late February, MSF teams based out of Mariupol were working with community volunteers to improve access to health care for remote, isolated populations. MSF also supported new approaches to de-centralize mental health care. Since the war began, MSF has provided donations of trauma kits to several hospitals in eastern Ukraine and is trying to ensure continuity of care of patients, especially elderly people, for whom disruptions in treatment can prove life-threatening.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-health-crisis-mariupol

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Mar 2022,"This report is produced by OCHA Ukraine in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the period from 3 p.m. (EET) 10 March to 3 p.m. (EET) 11 March., KEY FIGURES (FLASH APPEAL 2022), 12M people in need (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 6M people targeted (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), $1.1B funding required (US$) (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 11% funded (Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • The geographic scope of the conflict continues to expand, with dire humanitarian consequences. On 10 March, air strikes and explosions were reported in Ivano-Frankivsk (Ivano-Frankivska oblast, west), Lutsk (Volynska oblast, north-west) and Novokodatskyi District of Dnipro (Dnipropetrovska oblast, central and eastern Ukraine), while new clashes are reported in settlements around Brovary, east of Kyiv, and Vyshhorod, north of the capital., • In Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Luhanska oblast, as of 8 a.m. on 11 March, nearly 114,500 users across nearly 40 settlements have lost electricity, leaving nearly 2,220 users in Novotoshkivka, Nyzhne and Nyzhne-1 without access to the water supply., • Donetska oblast authorities (GCA) report more than 400 infrastructure damage incidents over the last two weeks. The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster estimates that around 2.2 million people on both sides of the “contact line” in Donetska oblast (east) receive a limited supply of water by schedule, while 650,000 people have no access at all., • In Mariupol (Donetska oblast), the status of the repeatedly delayed safe passage corridor still remains unclear. There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city.
Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply., • Every day, more and more people are being evacuated and receiving the urgent humanitarian assistance they desperately need, as Member States, UN agencies and humanitarian partners scale up response activities. As reported by the Government of Ukraine, more than 100,000 people have been evacuated in recent days. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported it has so far evacuated around 221,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia., • On 11 March, more than 50 tons of humanitarian assistance was delivered to conflict-affected people in Enerhodar (Zaporizka oblast). Moreover, the Government of Switzerland has sent more than 500 tons of relief supplies to Moldova,
Poland and Ukraine, with at least 73 tons sent directly to the western part and capital area of Ukraine to date., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Civilian casualties and displacement continue to increase significantly as the conflict intensifies. Since 24 February, around 4.4 million people have been forcibly displaced in Ukraine, including 2.5 million refugees who have fled to other countries, as reported by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and an estimated 1.9 million people internally displaced, according to the Ukraine Protection Cluster. As a growing number of displaced people head west, response capacities are being overwhelmed in Zakarpatska and Lvivska oblasts, among other western oblasts. which now host around 887,500 internally displaced persons (IDPs) – nearly a quarter of the combined population of these oblasts., Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 10 March, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,546 civilian casualties, including 564 killed. OHCHR also reports 622 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (103 killed and 378 injured in GCA, and 25 killed and 116 injured in non-Governmentcontrolled areas, NGCA) and 924 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely much higher, as many reports are still pending corroboration., Ongoing hostilities in eastern Ukraine have triggered large-scale disruptions in basic services. In Luhanska oblast (GCA), as of 8 a.m. on 11 March, nearly 114,500 users across 38 settlements have lost electricity, leaving nearly 2,220 in Novotoshkivka, Nyzhne and Nyzhne-1 without access to the water supply. In neighbouring Donetska oblast, around 2.2 million people on both sides of the “contact line” receive a limited supply of water by schedule, while 650,000 people have no access at all, according to the WASH cluster., Donetska oblast authorities (GCA) report more than 400 infrastructure damage incidents over the last two weeks, including at least 34 electricity facilities, 16 gas supply systems, nine health care and eight water facilities, two schools and 13 bridges. Meanwhile, in Kharkiv (north-east) – home to around 1.4 million people prior to the recent escalation in hostilities – intense clashes have damaged a gas pipeline, leaving some 30 per cent of residents without gas while temperatures dipped to - 20°C overnight., Another day has brought fresh fighting in new localities in Kyivska oblast on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. Oblast authorities report heavy fighting in settlements around Brovary east of Kyiv and Vyshhorod north of the capital along the Dnieper River. Active hostilities continue in Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and Makariv, with the main highway heading west toward Zhytomyr (Zhytomyrska oblast, north-west) becoming increasingly more dangerous for thousands still attempting to flee the conflict., Since 24 February, the geographic scope of the conflict has expanded and continues to do so, with dire humanitarian consequences. On 10 March, explosions were reported near the airport in Ivano-Frankivsk. In Lutsk – about 260 km north of Ivano-Frankivsk – multiple explosions have reportedly killed at least one person at a local airfield, while air strikes near a pre-school and residential apartment building in Novokodatskyy District of Dnipro (Dnipropetrovska oblast) reportedly killed at least one person, according to UN reports., On 11 March, evacuation routes were announced for four oblasts,2 with new safe passage corridors reportedly being negotiated for Chernihivska (north), Kharkivska (east) and Khersonska oblasts (south) at the time of writing. The Government of Ukraine says more than 100,000 people have been evacuated in recent days, with critical humanitarian relief supplies, like food and medicine, entering localities where safe passages have been negotiated and adhered to by sides. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported it has so far evacuated around 221,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia., In Mariupol, the status of the repeatedly delayed safe passage corridor still remains unclear as the humanitarian situation becomes increasingly more dire with each passing hour. There have been reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city. Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, while hospitals are only partially functioning thanks to fuel deliveries from municipal authorities. The food and water supplies in the city are critically low, with relentless fighting preventing civilians from moving out and much-needed relief supplies from coming into the city. The Ukrainian Red Cross provided humanitarian relief supplies to affected people, including food, clothing and hygiene products., Every day, more and more people are being evacuated and receiving the urgent humanitarian assistance they desperately need, as Member States, UN agencies and humanitarian partners scale up response activities. On 11 March, according to oblast authorities, more than 50 tons of humanitarian assistance reached conflict-affected people in Enerhodar (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) after safe passage for convoys was successfully negotiated, reinforcing the urgent need for more temporary pauses in fighting to be agreed on and respected by both sides of the conflict., Moreover, the Government of Switzerland has sent more than 500 tons of relief supplies to Moldova, Poland and Ukraine, with at least 73 tons of assistance, including medical supplies, medicines and shelter equipment, sent directly to the western part and capital area of Ukraine. The Russian Federation reported that it delivered more than 1,670 tons of cargo with first aid kits, essential goods, medicines and food to Chernihiv (north), Donetsk, Luhansk (east), Kyiv, Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south) and Zaporizhzhia (south-east) since the start of the military offensive in Ukraine. This includes a reported delivery of around 250 tons of assistance to Donetsk, Luhansk and Chernihiv on 10 March. The UN does not inspect these shipments and, therefore, has no means of verifying their contents.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-11-march-2022

Protection and Human Rights",11 Mar 2022,"Madam President,, The war in Ukraine is now in its third week. Fighting continues unabated., The Russian armed forces are pursuing their offensive operations and laying siege to several cities in the south, east and north of the country., A large concentration of Russian forces is reportedly massed along several approaches to the capital, Kyiv., The situation is particularly alarming in Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, where there is shelling of residential areas and civilian infrastructure, resulting in an increasing number of civilians killed and injured. The utter devastation being visited on these cities is horrific., The numbers bear out the conclusion that civilians are paying the highest price for the conflict. As of 11 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded a total of 1,546 civilian casualties, including 564 killed and 982 injured, since the start of the invasion on 24 February., OHCHR believes the real casualty figures are likely considerably higher, as information from locations where intense hostilities are ongoing has been delayed and reports are still pending corroboration., Most of the recorded civilian casualties, which include children, have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR has received credible reports of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas. Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law., Direct attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes., As of 10 March, the World Health Organization has verified 26 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances, causing 12 deaths and 34 injuries. This includes the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital on 9 March. We condemn such attacks without reservation. They cause not only death and destruction: they also deprive people of urgently needed care and endanger more lives., We cannot emphasize it enough: The targeting of civilians, of residential buildings, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, is inexcusable and intolerable. All alleged violations of international humanitarian law must be investigated and those found responsible held accountable., Madam President,, Millions of people in Ukraine need urgent assistance. This includes 2 million internally displaced people., We are scaling up humanitarian aid in areas where security permits. More than half a million people are now receiving assistance, including life-saving food, shelter, blankets and medical supplies., The United Nations and our partners have developed operational plans to meet humanitarian needs where they are most acute., This work needs funding. Over $1.5 billion was pledged to the appeals last week. We are grateful for this generosity and encourage donors to release the funding quickly., Madam President,, It is critical to urgently achieve a cessation of hostilities to allow for the safe passage of civilians from besieged areas and to ensure that life-saving humanitarian supplies can reach those who remain., On 9 March, over 51,000 people were reportedly evacuated through five out of six agreed-upon safe passages. These safe passages must continue. They should be implemented with clear principles and modalities. Civilians should be duly and timely informed of the possibility to leave the concerned areas and on a voluntary basis and in the direction they choose., To expand life-saving assistance and services to those most in need humanitarian actors must also have safe, rapid, unimpeded and sustained access to all areas., We commend the humanitarian actors on the ground who are staying and delivering in a highly volatile situation., Madam President,, The number of refugees from Ukraine has reached 2.5 million people These numbers continue increasing by the day., We also commend the countries that have kept their borders open to welcome and support refugees. All people fleeing Ukraine, including third country nationals, need access to safety and protection, in line with the principle of non-refoulement and without any form of discrimination., Madam President,, The need for negotiations to stop the war in Ukraine could not be more urgent. We note the three rounds of talks held thus far between Ukrainian and Russian delegations. We call for such efforts to intensify, including to further secure humanitarian and ceasefire arrangements as a matter of priority. We urge the sides to build on their contacts, such as the meeting yesterday between the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in Antalya, Turkey. The logic of dialogue and diplomacy must prevail over the logic of war., The Secretary-General is grateful to the many Member States working in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to this dangerous conflict. He is in regular contact with regional and other leaders and his good offices remain available., Madam President,, Let me reaffirm the UN’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders., As the war grinds on, there is already much reflection about its implications, beyond the tragedy it represents for Ukraine. We increasingly hear the use of terms such as “turning point”, “defining moment”, “end of multilateralism”. I believe this is not an exaggeration. Indeed, some consequences are already being felt, economically and politically. Perhaps most alarming are the risks the violence poses to the global framework for peace and security., We must do everything we can to find a solution and put an end to this war. And we must do it now., Thank you, Madam President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-logic-dialogue-and-diplomacy-must-prevail-over-logic-war-security-council

UNDP to scale up online support services to provide a lifeline to Ukrainian families,News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2022,"New York - UNDP is urgently assisting the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation to provide new digital support services for Ukrainian refugees and displaced people, as well as social and humanitarian support services for those still in Ukraine. The online system allows people to access their vital documents such as their I.D. cards and passports, and to register for accommodation and critical support services., As fighting rages across the northern, eastern, and southern parts of Ukraine, many communities remain cut off and people cannot leave their homes. At the same time millions more are on the move, displaced in Ukraine and in the surrounding countries, and are in desperate need of assistance. Building on its three decades of work in the country, UNDP, as part of the coordinated UN response, is working with government partners to rapidly scale up delivery of services online. This will allow people to access support wherever they may be, and without having to travel to official offices which may have been destroyed, or in conflict areas where their lives could be in danger., ""Travelling through Kyiv we saw residential buildings that had been just levelled, completely destroyed by the fighting,"" said Dafina Gercheva, UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine., Millions of people have had to leave their homes at a moment's notice, grabbing what few belongings they can find and fleeing for their lives., ""The online system allows people to access their vital documents such as their I.D. cards and passports, and we are now scaling up so that it signposts people who need to register for accommodation, need help with living expenses or other critical support services.

A life-saving journey - critical WHO supplies arrive in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,Health,11 Mar 2022,"This is not an ordinary cargo, it carries life-saving medical supplies destined for Ukraine., On Saturday 5 March, just over a week following the escalation of military operations in Ukraine, 3 large lorries carrying 36 tonnes of vital WHO medical supplies crossed the Polish border into Lviv, where they were stored and then distributed to health facilities across Ukraine, including to the capital Kyiv., The supply chains for medicines, medical supplies and common goods have been severely disrupted in Ukraine, creating urgent need. Many distributors are not operational, and many government and humanitarian stockpiles are inaccessible due to ongoing military operations. Life-saving and essential medicines (such as oxygen and insulin), personal protective equipment, surgical supplies, anaesthetics and safe blood products are reportedly in short supply. WHO has been working with partners to alleviate some of these shortages., Getting the supplies to Poland, Coordinating the logistics for this shipment and making sure it gets to its destination has been no small feat – taking 5–6 days from dispatch in Dubai to arrival in Lviv., Robert Blanchard, Team Leader for Emergency Operations explains: “Here at WHO’s global logistics hub, based within Dubai’s International Humanitarian City, medical supplies and equipment are prepositioned, stored, and rapidly dispatched in response to health emergencies all over the world. We are currently working around the clock to send medical supplies to Ukraine. WHO maintains a diverse array of life-saving health commodities, including trauma and emergency surgery supplies that contain items such as essential medicines, sterile surgical instruments, bandages, paracetamol and disinfectants. We also dispatch support equipment such as generators, which are critical for mounting an effective emergency response”., The supplies arrived in Poland by cargo plane on 3 March, travelling a distance of over 6200 km from the hub in Dubai. The 36 tonnes of medical aid and trauma supplies will meet the urgent needs of 1000 people requiring surgical care and provide medical provisions to help treat 150 000 people., Making sure the supplies reach those in need A priority health concern has been the worsening of conflict-related trauma and injuries, which could occur as a result of lack of access to health facilities and life-saving medicines and supplies., “We have surgical supplies to treat wounds, as well as medicines for all other diseases that do not stop for war. More supplies are expected in the coming days,” commented Flavio Salio, WHO Emergency Medical Teams Network Leader., Yet, getting these supplies to Ukrainian hospitals remains a problem, as Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, highlights: “These trauma and medical supplies must reach those who need them the most. For this to happen, we have to ensure safe passage because people’s health needs are increasing every day and every hour”., Additional shipments planned and on their way, This was the first of multiple shipments planned to support people severely affected by this humanitarian emergency. A second shipment has arrived in Lviv for distribution to other parts of Ukraine, containing cold chain elements, such as fridges, so that vaccines and other medicines can be stored safely. The Dubai-based logistics team is also preparing more health supplies for a third charter flight, which will deliver an additional 40 tonnes of trauma and emergency surgery kits to enable hospitals to continue to treat injured patients and perform operations., WHO’s continued support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, WHO has released US$ 5.2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies and will need to raise US$ 45 million for Ukraine and US$ 12.5 million to support neighbouring countries providing refugee care., Ensuring the health and well-being of all people lies at the core of WHO’s mandate and commitments in all situations. WHO is working closely with its offices in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, through government and other health partners, to rapidly respond to the health emergency triggered by the conflict and to minimize disruptions to the delivery of critical health-care services., Video -- Delivery of the medical supplies",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/life-saving-journey-critical-who-supplies-arrive-ukraine-enru

OHCHR has recorded 1,207 civilian casualties so far, with 406 deaths (including 27 children) and 801 injuries (including 42 children)., Nine child protection mobile teams providing psychosocial support (PSS) will be expanded to 47 to reach children across the country. 100 mobile education and early childhood development teams are being established., A first shipment of essential medical equipment arrived at temporary storage facilities around Kyiv, to be distributed to 20 hospitals and health care facilities in the most affected areas, ensuring access to essential medical services for 20,000 pregnant women and families with children., A humanitarian cash transfers programme is being developed to meet the basic needs of over 265,000 households with children. Social Behavior Digital content for caregivers has reached 13.5 million people with critical information including explosive ordnance risk education, immunization, breastfeeding, and PSS., Given the urgency and scale of needs, and the complexity of the crisis, on 5 March 2022 UNICEF activated its Level 3 emergency procedures to ensure adequate scale to address the increasing needs of children in Ukraine. To kick start urgent response, UNICEF mobilized an internal loan of USD 5.75 million from UNICEF’s Emergency Programme to immediately procure critical health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education and child protection supplies and dedicated to support Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and abuse (PSEA) rapid scaleup of PSEA efforts., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, After eight years of conflict that was limited to eastern Ukraine, the sudden and dramatic escalation of war in Ukraine has resulted in hundreds of thousands of children and their families being internally displaced and fleeing to neighbouring countries looking for safety. OHCHR reports that 27 children have been killed, while 42 have been injured in the conflict, with numbers likely much higher as they reflect only what was able to be verified to date. Based on preliminary reports from the Ministry of Education (MoE), as of 7 March, at least 233 educational facilities across Ukraine have been damaged and destroyed. All education facilities across Ukraine are currently closed, impacting 5.7 million school-age children. The MoE is encouraging local authorities to resume education using distance learning modalities, wherever possible, starting from next week. At least 61 health care facilities have reportedly been destroyed in eight central, eastern, and northern areas of Ukraine. Transportation of children with medical conditions has also emerged as a key concern, with reports of two children having died on 7 March because it was impossible to transport them from local hospitals to the central children’s hospital in Kyiv. Children and their families are in desperate need of safety, stability, systematic protection services and psychosocial care. Displacement and conflict have harmed families’ livelihoods and economic opportunities, leaving many without sufficient income to meet their basic needs and unable to provide adequate support for their children. As the crisis escalates, UNICEF is scaling-up its humanitarian response in Ukraine to ensure sustained delivery of WASH, immunization and health care, education, child protection and humanitarian cash assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no3-reporting-period-01-10-march-2022

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Mar 2022,"FRAN BODINE, Following months of military buildup, Russian tanks and troops invaded Ukraine on February 24th, 2022. The armed conflict is causing widespread human suffering, civilian casualties, damage to public infrastructure, and large-scale displacement. More than two million Ukrainians have fled the country already, with thousands more waiting their turn in the cold and despair of overcrowded train stations and border crossings., Russian forces have reportedly damaged or destroyed hundreds of schools and hospitals and left many municipalities without electricity, water, or heating. The military encirclement of cities across Ukraine is preventing the evacuation of women and children, and blocking the delivery life-saving supplies, including food, water, and medicine. While Western governments rush to provide military support to bolster Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion, substantial funding and aid is needed to prevent the country from spiraling deeper into a humanitarian crisis., To assess the situation on the ground in Ukraine and assist in the targeting of humanitarian relief, GeoPoll conducted a survey in the first week of March 2022. The survey addressed a number of urgent topics, including:, Preliminary insights from the survey data are detailed in this post. To view the full results of the study, filterable by question, region, gender, and age group, scroll down to the Interactive Data Dashboard., A list of organizations that are soliciting donations to help Ukrainians is included at the end of this post., The study questionnaire was developed by GeoPoll researchers and translated into Ukrainian. The survey was conducted using GeoPoll’s mobile web platform and fielded in a single day, gathering a sample size of 400 respondents, which provides a 5% margin of error and a 95% confidence interval., The diverse sample includes a gender composition of 49% females and 51% males; an age breakdown of 11% ages 18-24, 26% ages 25-34, and 63% ages 35 and older; and representation from every region (ADM1) with Ukraine. For more detailed sample breakdowns please email us at info@GeoPoll.com., To note, GeoPoll is continuing ongoing data collection in Ukraine using multiple research modes despite the access challenges., As the violence in Ukraine intensifies and spreads, the human cost of the conflict continues to rise. The United Nations rights body (OHCHR) reports more than 1,200 confirmed civilian casualties in the first few weeks of fighting alone – but warns that the actual figures are likely considerably higher., Although the fighting so far has primarily centered on the Eastern half of Ukraine, 67% of respondents in our study say they feel at least “somewhat unsafe” in their everyday life. More than one in three females (36%) feel “very unsafe” compared to 21% of males., That only 6% overall feel “very safe” in their everyday life suggests a nation under acute stress due to the conflict., One in four respondents (25%) have already personally witnessed violence. This violence and the expectation of violence help to explain why 18% have decided to flee their homes., A significantly higher percentage (79%) say they know someone who has been forced to move or flee recently due to the conflict, painting a picture of what the UN high commissioner for refugees has called, “the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.” This massive displacement is particularly dangerous for women and children who face a heightened risk of violence and exploitation., The majority of respondents in our study (59%) say most of the people they know who have fled their homes have stayed within Ukraine (internally displaced). Most Ukrainian men ages 18-60 are currently banned from leaving the country, in anticipation that they may be called to fight., At the time of our study, 63% of respondents reported experiencing shortages of necessities, such as fuel, water, or electricity in the previous few weeks. That percentage is sure to increase as escalating Russian military strikes on large cities, including the capital city, Kyiv, inflict damage to essential infrastructure., The World Food Programme (WFP) reports severe shortages of food and water in embattled areas in Ukraine and in response has ramped up its food assistance operations. As the situation deteriorates, the agency is calling on the international community for a substantial increase in funding., In our study, 84% of households say they ate less preferred and/or less expensive food at least 1 day in the past 7 days due to a lack of food or money to buy food. The largest segment (23%) say they ate less preferred food all 7 days., Almost half of respondents (46%) say they had to borrow food or rely on help from a friend or relative at least once in the past week, and more than half (60%) limited their portion sizes., Another 61% reduced the number of meals eaten at least one day in the past week, with 18% reducing the number of meals eaten every single day. Most adults (56%) restricted their food consumption so children could eat – at least one of the 7 days last week., In times of crisis, access to reliable news and information is critical. To help keep the public informed, both international war correspondents and Ukrainian journalists are putting their personal safety at risk to report on the situation on the ground. Several incidences of journalists being deliberately attacked by Russian forces in Ukraine have surfaced in the past few days., Desperate for news, most of the respondents in our study are currently relying on multiple news platforms. Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.), which offers real-time updates that users can follow from anywhere via their phones, is the most used platform at 69%. Many Ukrainian government officials and other authorities have turned to social media, primarily Telegram, as their preferred communication medium., TV comes in a close second to social media at 66%, followed by news websites at 57%., On the other side of the conflict, Russia has tightened its already strict restrictions on independent media, instead pushing out government produced misinformation and propaganda in an effort to distort reality and lower morale., Most Ukrainians in our study (73%) recognize and have witnessed the Russian government’s misinformation campaigns and news., With the Russian invasion posing and immediate threat to the lives and livelihoods of millions of Ukrainian civilians, humanitarian aid agencies are scaling up their response to the crisis., Despite reports of Russian forces blocking the delivery of supplies into encircled and embattled cities, 68% of respondents claim that humanitarian aid organizations are currently in their area to provide relief. Most (59%) have noticed an increase in aid presence in the past few weeks., So far, only 13% of respondents say they or their immediate family have received international aid in the form of food, money, water, or other supplies. As the crisis deepens, however, more and more Ukrainians are likely to find themselves in dire need of humanitarian support., Following is a list of humanitarian aid organizations that are soliciting donations to help Ukrainians., Dive deeper into the full results from this study using the interactive dashboard below. The dashboard provides responses to each question in the survey, filterable by region, age group, and gender., GeoPoll has extensive experience conducting research in vulnerable areas through remote mobile-based methodologies. In times when it is otherwise impossible to get information from people on the ground, remote data collection can play a pivotal role in capturing the sentiment and realities in hard-to-reach locations., To learn more about GeoPoll’s capabilities in Ukraine and around the world, please contact us.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/geopoll-reports-russian-invasion-ukraine

At night they are sheltering wherever they can, often exposed to the harshest of elements. Some of these children are completely alone., “For those staying put as the conflict escalates around them, there is already not enough food to eat, enough clothes to keep them warm, or resources to repair and heat their homes., “These are incredibly dangerous conditions for a child to be exposed to. Newborn babies and small children are at particular risk of getting very cold very quickly and of hypothermia, as they are still developing and less able to regulate their body temperatures. Freezing temperatures make it harder for breastfeeding mothers to produce milk, leaving babies at risk of starving., “This is before we even begin to think about the mental anguish children will already be going through trying to process what has happened to them over the past two weeks. We must see an immediate end to the violence – it is the only way to protect children.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, providing humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting access to education, distributing winter and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families. Our specialists support children to overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their ability to cope with stress in their daily lives., The Children Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., ENDS, More content available here, Notes to editors",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/millions-children-exposed-illnesses-hypothermia-big-freeze-hits-ukraine-says-save

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Mar 2022,"Friday, March 11, 2022 — Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders (MSF) fears that there is an urgent race against time to get the right medical supplies to the right places before aid can no longer reach militarily encircled towns and cities., “As hospitals in the east become overwhelmed with increasing numbers of war trauma patients, their supplies are dwindling,” says Anja Wolz, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Ukraine. “And we don’t know how long it will be before Kyiv may be cut off.”, “Destruction, aerial bombing, heavy artillery fire, tank battles, encircled towns, the beginnings of urban warfare, people sheltering in bunkers and basements running out of food, water and electricity – this is what is happening; and it is getting worse,” continues Wolz. “The humanitarian medical response needs to be at scale and at speed.”, On Saturday 05 March, MSF’s first three trucks of emergency medical supplies – 120m3 – were delivered in Ukraine. A third of it, mostly surgical and trauma material and drugs, was immediately sent on to Kyiv by train. It has been received by the Ministry of Health in Kyiv to be distributed to hospitals treating war wounded in the capital city and to hospitals in war zones further east., More emergency medical supplies have arrived at MSF’s warehouse in Ukraine in the past days, and further shipments will follow in the days and weeks to come., MSF’s main focus to date has been on surgical, trauma, ER (Emergency Room) and ICU (Intensive Care Unit) equipment and drugs. But a broader picture of other key medical items is starting to emerge: insulin for diabetes patients, and medicines for patients with other chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension or HIV. Some of these will need to be transported with the added complexity of a cold chain., Getting supplies to where they are needed in Ukraine will be a challenge. The trains are still mostly running, and this is a good option because of the volume they can take, but MSF teams are looking at multiple ways of moving medical supplies around the country safely. “We fear that it will get harder, perhaps rapidly so, to move medical supplies and medical staff to where they are needed, hence the real urgency to move fast on this now,” says Wolz., MSF teams have also begun offering training to hospitals in Lviv and Odessa to support them to manage large numbers of wounded arriving at the same time and to deal with war wounds., Beyond medical supplies, there is also a need to protect people who have fled their homes from the bitterly cold temperatures – as low as minus seven degrees Celsius. There are hundreds of thousands of people who have gathered in Lviv or are making their way onwards to the Hungarian, Polish or Slovakian borders. Temperatures this cold can kill. MSF is dispatching 160m3 of materials to help – more than 2,000 sleeping bags, more than 3,500 thermal fleece blankets, thousands of sets of thermal underwear, fleece pullovers, hats, rain jackets and other clothes, and more than 500 tents, as well as hygiene items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap and towels. These will be passed on to local civil society organisations who will distribute them to people who have fled to Lviv or are queuing at Ukraine’s borders., MSF’s first surgical team has arrived in Lviv. “Decisions to move closer to areas of active fighting to do hands-on medical work cannot be taken lightly,” says Wolz. “We are weighing up several locations and options and will be taking decisions over the coming days.”, Freija Jeppesen

"Statement by GCPEA Executive Director, Diya Nijhowne, on Attacks on Education in Ukraine",News and Press Release,GCPEA,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",11 Mar 2022,"GCPEA strongly condemns the attacks on kindergartens, schools, and universities, in Ukraine, (New York, March 9, 2022) -- Over 210 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed, since the escalation in hostilities began in Ukraine on February 24, according to the Ministry of Education and Science, although this figure has not yet been verified by the Education Cluster. Attacks included the shelling of a kindergarten and a university. Two teachers were also reported killed when a missile struck a school in Gorlovka in eastern Ukraine. The nationwide closure of schools and education institutions has affected the entire school-aged population -- 5.7 million students between 3 and 17 years old, and more than 1.5 million enrolled in higher education institutions. Special attention should be paid to ensure that the most vulnerable do not drop out of school permanently, including girls, and students with disabilities., Of particular concern, Amnesty International reported that an attack on a nursery and kindergarten in Okhtyrka, Sumy Oblast, on February 25, used cluster munitions and killed one child and two other civilians. Attacks using widely-banned cluster munitions with wide-area effects produce large blasts, which risk harming civilians and damaging civilian infrastructure, and may constitute war crimes., Even before the latest hostilities, GCPEA's Education under Attack 2020 report found Ukraine to be among the countries affected by attacks on education in recent years. According to UNICEF, since 2014 when the conflict erupted, and before the current escalation, over 750 schools had been damaged or destroyed in Eastern Ukraine., In November 2019, Ukraine made a commitment to protect education in armed conflict by endorsing the Safe Schools Declaration. Since then, at least 1,000 military officials in Ukraine have been trained to protect schools and universities from attack or military use. Russia has never endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration., Schools and universities should be safe havens. Military use of schools can convert them into military objectives and make them a target for attack by opposing forces. Attacks on education can cause immediate injury and loss of life and can also have long-lasting consequences. Damage to schools, and trauma experienced by students and teachers, can mean that some never resume their studies or return to work., Education should be kept out of the crossfire. We call on all parties to uphold and protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education personnel and refrain from military-related use of educational facilities., In particular, we call on all parties to:, Immediately cease attacks on, and threats of attacks against, schools, students, and teachers, and avoid using schools and universities for military purposes, in line with:, Resolution 2601 (2021) of the UN Security Council which states that UN Member States are to ""prevent attacks and threats of attacks against schools and ensure the protection of schools and civilians connected with schools, including children and teachers during armed conflict as well as in post-conflict phases""; and, The Safe Schools Declaration and its Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. - Avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, including near schools or universities or along routes to or from them., Recognizing the bearing education has on achieving a better future, and its role as a seed for reconciliation and transformation, donors and international development and humanitarian partners should support the principles of the Safe Schools Declaration and protect students, educators, and schools. We call on them to:, Prioritize and fund gender-responsive and inclusive programs that, in working towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4, seek to ensure that safe education can continue for all students, including children on the move; as well as programs that respond to, and mitigate the impact of, attacks on education on students and educators, taking into account the needs of the most vulnerable, such as explosive ordnance risk education, and assistance for teachers to work with displaced students;, Support the establishment of safe spaces, such as temporary learning spaces, or formal or informal community centers, where survivors of attacks on education can receive legal, medical, and psychosocial information and services, and learn of opportunities to continue their education;, Provide support to international accountability mechanisms, including the International Criminal Court (ICC), in investigating all alleged abuses and violations in Ukraine, including attacks on buildings dedicated to education, to prosecute, and hold accountable the perpetrators of these attacks;, Secure the inclusion of dedicated, child-specific documentation and investigation expertise in potential investigations by the ICC and human rights mechanisms; and - Call on all judicial and non-judicial mechanisms to collaborate and share knowledge and expertise relating to crimes against children and attacks on education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-gcpea-executive-director-diya-nijhowne-attacks-education-ukraine

Shelter and Non-Food Items",11 Mar 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has significantly stepped up its assistance in Ukraine and the neighbouring countries receiving refugees in response to acute humanitarian needs as the fighting intensifies., In Ukraine, the UN estimates that there are now at least 1.85 million internally displaced people, and an additional 12.65 million people directly affected by the conflict. They are also contending with freezing temperatures., Access to conflict-affected communities in hard-hit areas like Mariupol and Kharkiv remains very restricted due to the ongoing military activities and increased presence of landmines, exacerbating humanitarian needs by the day. Food, water, medicines and medical care, shelter, basic household items, blankets, mattresses, cash, building materials, generators and fuel are urgently needed., The UN continues to negotiate to secure access, safety and security for the delivery of lifesaving aid. UNHCR repeats its urgent call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and again thanks neighbouring countries for keeping their borders open to those fleeing., UNHCR staff are on the ground in Ukraine and -- like the civilian population -- remain caught up in the hostilities. We are committed to stay and deliver assistance when and where access and security allow. Our Office has scaled up its presence and operations in central and western Ukraine, where conditions enable more humanitarian access, and where needs are also growing as people evacuate to the west and onwards and become internally displaced. We are also coordinating with the local authorities to improve the reception conditions at the international border crossing points where people are waiting in line for hours., UNHCR in Central and Western Ukraine, Southern Ukraine, In Eastern Ukraine, Outside Ukraine, the number of refugees in neighbouring countries has exceeded 2.5 million, and UNHCR commends the efforts of hosts and the immense solidarity shown by locals, volunteers and humanitarian organizations, who have been providing support for accommodation, transport, food, and financial and material donations. In all neighbouring countries, reception and assistance is being provided by State authorities, civil society and volunteers., UNHCR is working with the authorities and partners to roll out emergency cash programmes. The payments will tide refugees over, allowing more dignity and independence, until they can work or receive social support.  It allows refugees to prioritize, while providing a boost to local businesses.  , In Poland, UNHCR, Caritas Poland and other partners, have worked to get financial assistance to refugees, with the first families receiving payments today in Warsaw. The programme will quickly expand to towns and cities hosting large numbers of refugees. The project also partners with Santander Bank, using its BLIK instant payments system. Initial one-off payments, of the same value as the social assistance in Poland, will be made available to registered refugees., In the Republic of Moldova, UNHCR, with the Ministry of Social Protection and a local partner, started emergency cash distributions on 28 February, while the mechanism for larger-scale assistance is being set up with more payments reaching vulnerable refugees in coming days. A one-off cash grant for host families is also being set up with the authorities., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-scales-those-displaced-war-ukraine-deploys-cash-assistance
