Several people were found dead while others remain missing. On 7 May, Russian Federation forces dropped a bomb on a school in the village of Bilohorivka (Luhansk region) where 90 people were taking shelter; 27 persons were rescued, two persons were confirmed dead, and over 60 were reported missing. On 9 May, the Russian Federation fired four Onyx cruise missiles at the Odesa region, while in the early hours of 11 May, two separate shelling attacks took place Luhansk region, damaging the regional boarding school for children with special needs in Gorsky (children and staff were evacuated in advance)., To address the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine, particularly allegations of aggression conducted in and/or near schools, rape and other forms of sexual violence, enforced disappearance and torture, the Human Rights Council will hold a special session on 12 May. OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 10 May, there have been 7,256 civilian casualties, including 3,496 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA). Although civilians in conflict-affected areas remain in dire need of basic goods and social services, ongoing fighting continues to deter evacuations., IOM is particularly concerned about ongoing internal and cross -border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. On 9 May, IOM released the fourth round of its Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, General Population Survey, which documented changes in displacement and mobility flows from 29 April to 3 May. Inside the country, over 8.02 million people have been displaced (63 per cent women, 37 per cent men) — an increase of 322,000 (4 per cent) compared to figures from 17 April, the previous round of the survey (IOM Displacement Report, Round IV). In addition, there is a noted increase of displaced persons originally from the east of Ukraine, now totalling 49 per cent of IDPs (an increase from 45 per cent recorded during the third round of the survey). Overall, it is estimated that a total of 13,686,000 persons have been displaced within Ukraine and across the border to neighbouring countries. As the crisis evolves, displacement and mobility patterns continue to change, requiring scaled up and integrated interventions that address both emerging and existing needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-18-12-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",13 May 2022,"Carpathian Mountains, 13 May 2022 – Sasha, Masha and Dasha* are playing hide-and-seek under the table in an accommodation centre for internally displaced persons (IDPs), where they are living with their parents, Oksana and Andrii. When the war started, Sasha had just turned one; her sisters are four and six years old., The family fled from a village in the Sumy region, only a hundred metres away from the border with the Russian Federation. For several weeks, all roads around the village were cut off by the Russian offensive. At the first opportunity, the family packed into a car and headed to western Ukraine., “We did not know what was more dangerous – to stay, or to take a risk and drive through the areas with active fighting. We managed to escape. Like many other displaced persons, we thought that we would stay away for a week or two. Now, more than a month has passed since we left, and nobody knows when it would be possible to return home. Sasha and Masha are too little to understand, but Dasha is aware that there is a war,” says Andrii., Now, the family is staying in a remote location in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains, over a thousand kilometres away from their home. They were lucky to find refuge at a shelter in a natural park. When the war started, several other national parks opened their doors to displaced Ukrainians, offering them a temporary home surrounded by the serene mountains., In partnership with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine and with funding from the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) supported these newly established collective centres for IDPs. Rooms and bathrooms were upgraded; solar-powered streetlights erected; an improved water treatment and sewage system installed; and furniture, bed linen, kitchenware, and hygiene items distributed., “Initially, we planned to open our accommodation for tourists in May – but when the war started, we had to act fast,” explains the director of the natural park, Mykhailo Nechai. “There was no appropriate sewage system, and that was our primary concern, as more and more people were arriving every day. IOM procured all equipment and helped us to install the system.”, In the kitchen, Viktoriia prepares a meal for her family. She arrived in the Carpathians with her sons, Mykola and Ivan, and her elderly mother. They fled from the town of Berdiansk in the Zaporizhia region, which is now under the control of the Russian military. Their trip took four long days. “We stayed in occupied Berdiansk as long as we could, but the situation was getting really scary. There have been reports about many people disappearing, being arrested and held in detention. I was afraid for my sons. When we left, it was a road to the unknown as we drove along the minefields and military checkpoints where we were stopped each time. My 18-year-old son was forced to take his clothes off as the Russian military were searching every man, looking for signs of affiliation to Ukrainian armed forces,” recalls Viktoriia., This sense of unknown and uncertainty stays with them. Having found a relatively safe space to live in, Viktoriia is now focused on her family’s well-being. Her sons continue their education online, and the family intends to stay in Ukraine. However, as the war has now entered its third month, their displacement might become protracted. Soon, they may need to find a longer-term housing solution., Since 24 February, the western regions of Ukraine remain the top destination for IDPs and already host up to 3 million displaced Ukrainians. Local capacities are strained. Almost half of IDPs (47 per cent) currently residing in the western regions are considering further relocation, according to IOM’s latest survey on displacement., “I am scared that Berdiansk will be left behind the curtain, if you know what I mean. We are praying for our return home. At the moment, it feels like our lives, and our mental state, have been put on pause. Hopefully, not for long. I have faith. I want to believe in this very much.”, *Names have been changed for protection reasons., Written by Iryna Tymchyshyn, IOM Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/living-life-pause-millions-ukrainians-face-protracted-displacement

Press and information team of the Delegation to UKRAINE, Today the Commission announces €1.5 million for a dedicated project to support the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in assisting women and girls in Ukraine by providing sexual and reproductive health services. Funding will target essential supplies and equipment, including emergency kits for pregnant women. In addition, two mobile healthcare units for emergency obstetric and newborn care, will be established. The funding is part of the EU's overall €243 million in humanitarian aid in response to Russia's war in Ukraine which comes on top of in-kind assistance to the country via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism., The announcement comes as Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič and Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, are meeting with the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten to discuss how to support the survivors of sexual and gender-based violence., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič said: “History has shown time and time again that women bear the brunt of wars and conflicts, and the war in Ukraine is no different. With conflict-related sexual violence on the rise, we must recognise the impact this ruthless war has on the most vulnerable populations. Together with the UN we will work hand in hand to protect women and girls in Ukraine. The EU has just signed a contract with the United Nations Population Fund to provide immediate humanitarian response for women and girls in Ukraine, including survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, with access to sexual and reproductive health response services. This also includes lifesaving medical care. Also, I want to remind Russia that using rape as a weapon of war is a violation of international humanitarian law in its gravest form, and will not go unpunished.”, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, said: *“The mounting and credible allegations of rape and sexual violence used during the Russian invasion of Ukraine are extremely alarming. We are also very worried about the increasing risks of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Such horrendous crimes can have devastating effects on the physical and mental health of the victims. This is why we are working to ensure that access to medical care for those fleeing Ukraine in the EU also includes mental health, adapted to the needs of women who have experienced trauma and gender-based violence. Through the EU's solidarity system for medical transfers we can transfer victims of conflict related sexual violence and provide them with the care they need. Our priority is to provide care for the victims, and to ensure that the perpetrators of these horrendous war crimes are brought to justice.” *, Russia's illegal invasion has caused around 7.7 million people to be internally displaced in Ukraine, and over 6 million people that fled the country, the vast majority of them being women and children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-stepping-support-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-survivors-enuk

SECURITY COUNCIL
9032ND MEETING (AM), With the devastating toll of war on Ukraine’s children becoming clearer each day, humanitarian efforts — punctuated by several “monumental” recent evacuations of trapped civilians — must continue to scale up, officials told the Security Council today, as the representatives of Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations of attacks on schools and educational indoctrination., “The war in Ukraine, like all wars, is a child protection and child rights crisis,” said Omar Abdi, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), who was one of two officials briefing the 15-member Council. In the last month, he said, the United Nations has verified nearly 100 child deaths from the fighting, with an actual figure that is likely to be considerably higher. Many more have been injured, displaced and face grave violations of their rights. Meanwhile, schools across Ukraine have been hit by heavy artillery, air strikes and other explosive weapons, or used for military purposes., Spotlighting the severe impact on education, he said schools are a lifeline for children in conflict, providing protection from harm and a semblance of normalcy. Creative, multifaceted and flexible solutions combining low- and high-tech methods are urgently needed to reach all children and minimize disruptions to their learning. However, remote learning can only be a temporary solution, he noted, emphasizing that the warring parties must honour their legal and moral obligations to protect civilians and ensure the rights of children — including the right to attend school — are upheld. In that vein, he recalled the Council’s adoption of resolution 2601 (2021), which condemned attacks on schools and stressed the critical right to education in conflict settings., Echoing those points was Joyce Msuya, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, who updated the Council on efforts to negotiate more humanitarian pauses for the safe passage of civilians trapped by the fighting in Ukraine. On 9 May, she said, the United Nations, together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), were able to evacuate another 174 civilians from the Azovstal steel plant and other parts of Mariupol, “a truly monumental feat amid the shelling and destruction ongoing in the east”. Describing the operation as a glimmer of hope, she nevertheless said the war continues to rage, with civilians paying the heaviest price., Noting that the use of landmines and wide-area explosive weapons in populated areas is having a devastating effect, she added that nearly 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, of whom 8 million are internally displaced. The United Nations and its partners have provided humanitarian assistance to over 5.4 million people, while five inter-agency convoys carrying essential medical supplies, water, food, water repair systems and generators have provided a lifeline to civilians encircled by fighting. But that is by no means enough, she said, noting that efforts are under way to discuss the further safe passage of civilians. “We must urgently take our efforts to scale,” she stressed., As Council members took the floor, many emphasized the need to adhere to the critical international legal principle of civilian protection, while spotlighting the particular plight of Ukrainian children., The representative of Brazil emphasized that schools and medical facilities should never be used for military purposes, while urging the implementation of resolution 2601 (2021) on the protection of education and the 2015 Safe Schools Declaration. Expressing alarm at the number of Ukrainian children who have become internally displaced persons and refugees, he called for support from the international community, especially to those children who are unaccompanied or separated from their families. For its part, Brazil has been granting humanitarian visas and residence permits for displaced Ukrainians and stateless persons affected or displaced by the conflict, he said., The representative of the United Arab Emirates, lamenting the costs of conflict on children across the globe, called for a redoubling of efforts and commitment to ensure educational access. Education must be a priority as the international community responds to the urgent humanitarian needs in Ukraine, she said, noting that the protection of children — and all civilians — can only be assured through a cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic resolution. In that regard, she called on both sides to remain committed to dialogue and on the international community to support efforts to end the war., More broadly, Kenya’s representative voiced concern “that the Council is settling into a familiar, tragic pattern” in the context of the Ukrainian conflict. Far too much energy and attention are being used to make and defend accusations of violations of international law. While efforts to advance humanitarian aims are critically important, he emphasized that they are not the Council’s primary responsibility and urged members to make every effort to find a path to a negotiated peace in Ukraine. He joined other speakers in condemning recent attacks on civilians, including the reported bombing of a school in Luhansk, while drawing the Council’s attention to the conflict’s impact on economies and vulnerable people around the globe — particularly in the global South., The representative of Ukraine, pointing out that Russian strikes continued even as the recent evacuation of the Azovstal steel plant was under way, described hypocrisy in many of Moscow’s public statements on the plight of civilians and children. Some 130 Ukrainian educational facilities have been destroyed and more than 1,500 damaged by Russian forces to date, he said, noting that such acts are violations of international law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Meanwhile, more than a million children have been transferred to the Russian Federation, where their safety remains unknown. Welcoming the Human Rights Council’s launch of a commission of inquiry into crimes committed by the Russian Federation, he went on to condemn Moscow’s cynical use of the victory over Nazis in the Second World War to justify its current aggression, declaring: “Today’s standards of Russian diplomacy have gone through the floor, and all masks are off.”, The Russian Federation’s representative said the Council’s focus on education is critical as Kyiv has used indoctrination and educational discrimination as tools of war against its own population for years. Between 2014 and 2022, there were more than 200 incidents of education facilities being damaged in the Luhansk People’s Republic, and today, schools are once again under attack by Ukrainian forces. Noting that Russian armed forces are making every effort to protect children in the course of their special military operation in Ukraine, he rejected allegations to the contrary and questioned the sources of such information. He also voiced concern over double standards in which humanitarian law “exists for everyone, but not Kyiv”., Also speaking were representatives of Mexico, France, Albania, Ghana, Norway, United Kingdom, Ireland, China, Gabon, India, United States, Estonia (on behalf of the Baltic States), Poland and Slovakia., The meeting began at 10:07 a.m. and ended at 12:30 p.m., Briefings, JOYCE MSUYA, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, updated the Security Council on United Nations joint efforts to negotiate more humanitarian pauses for the safe passage of civilians trapped by the fighting in Ukraine. On 9 May, the United Nations, together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), were able to evacuate another 174 civilians from the Azovstal steel plant and other parts of Mariupol, she said. This was the third operation in the past week out of Mariupol, bringing the total number of civilians evacuated from the steel plant, Mariupol and neighbouring towns to over 600. “A truly monumental feat amid the shelling and destruction ongoing in the east,” she said, calling it a glimmer of hope., Yet, the war continues on its destructive path, she said, with civilians, particularly women and children, paying the heaviest price. Noting recent reports of the shelling of a school in Bilohorivkain Luhansk oblast, where women and children were seeking shelter from the fighting, she said the use of wide-area explosive weapons in those areas comes with a very high risk of indiscriminate effects and must be avoided. Noting that landmines and unexploded ordnance significantly impacts humanitarian response and access, she pointed out that, even before the war, eastern Ukraine was one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world. Urging support for mine action to open up humanitarian space, she stressed that under international humanitarian law, the parties must respect all civilians, as well as their homes, schools, hospitals and other essential infrastructure. Constant care must be taken to spare them and allow them to leave areas of hostilities voluntarily and safely, she said, drawing attention to the needs of women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Also, any barriers to the movement of humanitarian staff must be removed to ensure the continued delivery of life-saving assistance across Ukraine., Turning to the latest figures, she said almost 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, of whom 8 million are internally displaced. A total of 227 partners, the majority of which are national non-governmental organizations, have provided humanitarian assistance to over 5.4 million people, many of those in the east. In addition to the evacuations from the Azovstal plant and Mariupol, five inter-agency convoys, including essential medical supplies, water, food rations, non-food-items, water repair systems and generators, have provided a lifeline to civilians encircled by fighting. This is by no means enough, she said. Both parties have been notified of those convoys, she said, urging them to continue their facilitation efforts so many more civilians can be reached. “We must urgently take our efforts to scale. Our recent efforts to evacuate civilians in the east have shown us that there is goodwill and common ground for us to build on between the parties,” she said., As requested by the Secretary-General, Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, is exploring ways to bring the parties together to discuss humanitarian issues including safe passage for civilians and the movement of humanitarian convoys, she said. Earlier this week, Mr. Griffiths was in Turkey where discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and Presidential Spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin focused on the country’s support to United Nations efforts towards pressing humanitarian concerns in Ukraine. All options must be explored to reach more people where needs are the greatest. “We remain firmly committed to leaving no stone unturned. To find measures — from local pauses to wider ceasefires — to save lives. The world expects this of us. The people of Ukraine deserve this,” she concluded., OMAR ABDI, Deputy Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said it has been a month since the agency last briefed the Council on the situation in Ukraine. In that time, the United Nations verified that nearly 100 children were killed, “and we believe the actual figures to be considerably higher”. Children have been injured and face grave violations of their rights, and millions more have been displaced. Schools continue to be attacked and used for military purposes and water and sanitation infrastructure impacted. “The war in Ukraine, like all wars, is a child protection and child rights crisis,” he said., “We meet again after another horrifying attack, this time on a school in Luhansk — yet another stark example of disregard for civilian lives,” he said. That attack is also a stark reminder that in Ukraine today, education is also under attack. In February, the school year came to a standstill when the war broke out. As of last week, at least one in six UNICEF-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war. Hundreds of schools across the country are reported to have been hit by heavy artillery, air strikes and other explosive weapons in populated areas, while others are being used as information centres, shelters, supply hubs or for military purposes — with long term impacts on children’s return to education., Emphasizing that such actions must stop, he said all parties must honour their legal and moral obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, to respect international humanitarian and human rights law and to ensure the rights of children are upheld. The Council recently adopted resolution 2601 (2021), which condemns attacks on schools and calls for all necessary safeguards to uphold the right to education. Meanwhile, the Safe Schools Declaration outlines what is needed to enhance protection of education in conflict. “What is needed now is the courage, discipline and political will to translate these words into action,” he said., Describing schools as a lifeline for children — especially in conflict — he said they provide protection from harm and a semblance of normalcy. As such, he called for creative, multifaceted and flexible solutions that combine low- and high-tech methods to reach all children and minimize disruptions to their learning. In mid-March, over 15,000 schools resumed education in Ukraine, mostly through remote learning or in-person hybrid options. The Ministry of Education and Science, supported by UNICEF and partners, is doing everything possible to reach Ukrainian children, including supporting online education from kindergarten through grade 11. UNICEF is also supporting an ongoing digital campaign on explosive ordnance risk education and provision of education-related supplies., However, he said, remote learning can only be a temporary solution. Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic show the importance of children learning in a school setting with their peers and teachers. Outlining educational initiatives across the broader region — including those carried out under the European Union’s Temporary Protection Directive — he said every effort must be made to reach those most at risk of being left behind. Children and parents fleeing Ukraine report “living in hell” in conditions where they were forced to go hungry, drink from muddy puddles and shelter from constant shelling and bombardments. The war has also had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable children globally, as world food and fuel prices spike to all-time highs. Emphasizing that children have already paid an unconscionably high price in the war, he declared: “We must do everything possible to help ensure it doesn’t also cost them their futures.”, Statements, ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) said attacks against schools, notably in Luhansk, are reprehensible, stressing that such attacks violate international humanitarian law. The use of explosive weapons near schools and the access routes thereto must be avoided. The war’s impact on children is “simply devastating”, she said, recalling that two thirds of children in Ukraine have been displaced by the conflict. The trauma does not discriminate. The constant bombing will have long-term effects. She underscored the need for comprehensive strategies to address this scourge, expressing concern over increased reports of sexual violence against children, while the conflict’s effects on health facilities are reducing neonatal care. She called on host countries, as well as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), to register and identify refugee minors. She also drew attention to children with disabilities, whose vulnerability is all the more acute. “Any war is a war against children,” she assured. “This is no exception.” Ukraine must be included in the next annual report on children and armed conflict in order to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism, as well as list those responsible for grave violations against children and address the situation in the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said 200 medical facilities have been destroyed while the murder of children is among the most serious violations of international law. The Secretary-General must harness all mechanisms established by the Security Council to verify the facts and establish responsibility, including through his annual report and its “infamous list”, on which those who attack children and schools belong. “These crimes will not go unpunished,” he said, underscoring that France will provide its full support to Ukrainian justice and international courts, including the International Criminal Court. “It is urgent to act,” he said. He called on the Russian Federation to respect the International Court of Justice order to end the unjustifiable war and to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Stressing that the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure is a priority, he reiterated the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and emphasized that respect for international humanitarian law is non-negotiable. He called on parties to cooperate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry. Pressing the Russian Federation to lift its blockade against Ukraine’s ports to allow for the export of foodstuffs, he pledged that France will continue to support Ukraine, with aid standing around $2 billion, as announced by President Emanuel Macron at the Warsaw Conference on 5 May., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that as the war intensifies, so too does the magnitude of suffering. The 4 million people displaced two months ago has grown to 5.8 million, with new projections soon to reach 8.3 million, requiring more support for refugees and host countries. The massive destruction of civilian infrastructure and health facilities has affected the provision of the most basic services. It is unbearable to see what was once a school reduced to rubble, he said, stressing that an average 22 schools a day have been under regular attack since the start of the war. He recalled that more than 60 people were feared dead after the Russian Federation flattened a school in Bilohorivka, in Luhansk. “There is no justification for such recklessness,” he emphasized. Reports and preliminary facts raise serious concerns of grave breaches of international humanitarian law. The recent report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Moscow Mechanism cites a range of war crimes, from rape and torture to the use of human shields, marking a step on the long road to understanding the suffering experienced during the ongoing aggression. It concludes that two blatant attacks — the bombing of a Mariupol maternity hospital and the Mariupol drama theatre — were found to have violated international humanitarian law and that those who ordered them had committed a crime. He called on the Secretary-General and the Special Representative to add Ukraine as “a situation of concern” in the 2022 annual report on children and armed conflict, given the crimes committed between 2014 and 2021 and the evidence of an alarming increase in violations since late February. Thorough investigations must be carried out and accountability ensured. “It is possible to silence the guns in the name of life, when there is the will,” he assured. The sooner the war comes to an end, the better for Ukraine, the better for Russians to get out of a self-victimization attitude, and the better for everyone, everywhere., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) echoed concerns about the lack of satisfactory progress in finding a solution to the situation in Ukraine, adding that it is disheartening that innocent children have been caught up in the conflict. Strongly condemning the bombing of a school building in Luhansk, which resulted in significant civilian casualties, she said perpetrators of such attacks must be held accountable for their actions. She sounded alarm over the devastating psychological impacts of the conflict, especially on children, and reiterated that their mental well-being and safety “should be our utmost concern” and remain at the forefront of the international community’s actions. As such, host and transit countries for Ukrainian refugees must prioritize the best interests of children, including by providing learning opportunities. She also encouraged the continued deployment of the Secretary-General’s good offices in the international endeavour to bring an end to the war and facilitate a diplomatic solution to the ongoing security and humanitarian crises., MICHAEL KIBOINO (Kenya) expressed concern “that the Council is settling into a familiar, tragic pattern” in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. Far too much energy and attention are being used to make and defend accusations of violations of international humanitarian law. “We are forced to restate the obvious — that our primary responsibility, as the Security Council, is to protect international peace and security. While efforts to advance the humanitarian aims in conflict are critically important, they are not the Council’s primary responsibility. He therefore urged the Council to make every effort to find a path to negotiating peace for Ukraine and its suffering people, and which respects and protects that country’s rights as a United Nations Member State. Condemning recent attacks on civilian objects, including the reported bombing of a school in Luhansk, he went on to stress that the war is impacting economies and vulnerable people around the world and appealed for enhanced support for humanitarian crisis, particularly in the global South., TRINE HEIMERBACK (Norway) condemned in the strongest terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which has created a “humanitarian disaster”. Stressing that Moscow is solely responsible, she said the Council’s recent joint expression of support to the Secretary-General’s effort to search for peaceful solutions is a first step towards ending the crisis. Citing devastating attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and their unacceptable impacts on children, families and communities, she condemned the use of anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions — weapons that will continue to kill and injure long after the conflict ends — as well as recent Russian attacks on schools and the civilians seeking shelter there. Those show a blatant disrespect for international humanitarian law and are clearly contrary to Council resolution 2601 (2021) on the protection of education in conflict. All civilians must have access to humanitarian assistance and safe passage for voluntary evacuation to safety, she said, adding that Norway is also concerned by increasing reports of conflict-related sexual violence., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) noted that while it will take time for the United Nations monitoring and reporting mechanism to establish the extent of the impact on children of the Russian Federation’s invasion, there is already evidence that it is committing four of the six grave violations against children in times of war in Ukraine, set forth by the Security Council. Pointing to the killing and maiming of children, targeting of schools and nurseries, credible allegations of sexual violence against children by Russian forces, and reports of forced deportations, she said reporting by OHCHR suggests that at least 238 children have been killed and 347 injured. “There is now the very real risk of a lost generation and the continuation of a cycle of violence, caused by Russia’s invasion and the devastation it has created,” she said. Urging collective action, she said all countries must endorse and implement the Safe Schools Declaration. The Russian Federation’s refusal to endorse that Declaration puts Ukraine’s children in further danger. The international community must ensure that all credible allegations of crimes on the territory of Ukraine are investigated. She expressed support for efforts to improve the collective understanding of the situation on the ground through evidence and data collection, noting that her country is proud to play a leading role in the humanitarian effort in Ukraine, delivering vital supplies and life-saving medical aid to those most in need, including children., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil), expressing concern over continued reports of child casualties due to the use of explosive weapons, mine-related incidents and explosive remnants of war, called on both parties to the conflict to avoid the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas, including near schools or universities or along routes to or from them. Underscoring that schools and medical facilities should never be used for military purposes, he urged implementation of resolution 2601 (2021) on the protection of education, adding that the Safe Schools Declaration also provides important guidelines on that matter. Stressing that family reunification should be pursued with great urgency, he expressed alarm at the number of children who have become internally displaced persons and refugees, urging support from the international community, especially to those children who are unaccompanied or separated from their parents and family members. As children can become more vulnerable to crimes, including sexual violence and exploitation, their physical integrity and well-being should be a priority to all Member States. In that regard, his country has been granting humanitarian visas and residence permits for displaced Ukrainians and stateless persons affected or displaced by the armed conflict in Ukraine. Once in Brazil, they have full access to all public services and social benefits on an equal footing with Brazilian nationals. Brazilian civil society has been forthcoming and is mobilizing to provide further specialized assistance to help local integration, he said., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland), stressing that two thirds of all children in Ukraine have fled their homes and now face the risks of trafficking and exploitation, said these violations must end and those responsible must be held accountable. Like killing, maiming and sexual violence, attacks on schools and hospitals are “listable” under the children and armed conflict agenda. If the Council is to protect children and seriously tackle impunity, it must support the integrity and the impartiality of listing on these grounds. The Council recently recognized children’s right to education during conflict with the unanimous adoption of resolution 2601 (2022). “Are our memories really that short?” she asked. “Our words must be followed by action.” The Council must address the disruption of education through the provision of education in emergency settings, psychosocial services, mental health support and health care. It should support United Nations monitors and child protection staff. She called on the Secretary-General and the Special Representative to consider adding Ukraine as a “situation of concern” in the annual report on children and armed conflict and to use all tools and mechanisms available to address any such violations taking place in Ukraine. The Council has repeatedly called for the Russian Federation to withdraw its forces and engage in true dialogue and diplomacy towards peace. However, while the conflict continues, it must comply with its obligations under international law. “We will not tire of making this call,” she said. “The children of Ukraine deserve no less from us.”, DAI BING (China) said protecting children is an obligation under international law that must be fulfilled. He called for securing children’s safety and the infrastructure on which they depend, and for prioritizing their needs during evacuations. He expressed hope that the Russian Federation and Ukraine will increase coordination on humanitarian issues and make every effort to reduce the humanitarian impact of the conflict. Citing the 7 May deadly attack on a school in Bilohorivka, he said such events are deplorable. “Schools should not be targeted or used for military purposes,” he stressed, noting that the circumstances and causes must be verified. Any accusations should be based on facts. He called on the international community to step up its relief efforts so every child in need receives assistance. He urged UNICEF, OHCHR, UNODC and others to strengthen their monitoring to help countries eliminate any violations against children, adding that warnings by the World Health Organization (WHO) of disruptions to children’s immunizations should be taken seriously. The international community should encourage parties to return to the negotiating track and create the political conditions to that end. In addition, he said sanctions will only accelerate the spillover of the crisis and spark food and other crises that will disproportionately impact children in Afghanistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. Parties must exercise restraint and make all efforts to resolve the crisis in Ukraine., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates), lamenting the costs of conflict on children in her country’s region and beyond, expressed fear that the children of Ukraine are facing that same fate. Pointing to denied education, opportunity and a positive trajectory for the future, she called for a redoubling of efforts and commitment to ensure educational access. As the international community responds to the urgent humanitarian needs in Ukraine, education must be a priority, she said, stressing that future generations must have the necessary skills to effectively contribute to their communities. Voicing concern about reports of ongoing damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure, she said educational facilities must be protected and children’s continued access to education ensured. Commending neighbouring host countries, as well as UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), for facilitating the continuation of education services for refugee children, she called on the international community to support those efforts. The protection of children, and all civilians, can only be assured with a cessation of hostilities throughout Ukraine and reaching a diplomatic solution to this conflict, she pointed out, calling on both sides of the conflict to remain committed to dialogue and on the international community and the Council to support efforts to end the war and establish peace., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that while several delegations spoke today about subjects other than children and education, he will adhere to the agenda item in his intervention. The subject of education is more than timely, because the regime in Kyiv has for years carried out a war against its population in Donbas, which included indoctrination and discrimination in education. Quoting Ukrainian officials who openly discriminated against children in Donbas as a war tactic, he said Western Council members “prefer not to notice this”. Between 2014 and 2022, there were more than 200 incidents of educational facilities being damaged in the Luhansk People’s Republic. Today, schools there are once again under attack from Ukrainian forces. More than 190,000 children have fled to the Russian Federation, which is working closely with officials in Luhansk and Donetsk to care for orphans and provide educational options, while also sending humanitarian assistance. Russian armed forces are making every effort to protect children in the course of their special military operation in Ukraine, he added, condemning all attacks against schools and other civilian facilities., Rejecting allegations made today that the Russian Federation has carried out such attacks, he described those accusations as “absurd” and questioned the sources of such information. He also voiced concern over double standards in which humanitarian law “exists for everyone, but not Kyiv”, and recounted a range of violations by Ukrainian forces, including violations of the Safe Schools Declaration. Meanwhile, Ukrainian nationalists have been recruiting children into their ranks for years and have been teaching them to “hate everything that is Russian”. Turning to the quality of education in Ukraine, he said officials in that country are working to distort history, present the Russian Federation as an enemy and paint fascist collaborationists as heroes. He also questioned assertions made in the Ukrainian national curricula which claim that many great cultures throughout history — and even Jesus Christ — have their roots in Ukraine. Against that backdrop, he expressed hope that Ukrainian children will someday be able to continue their education “under normal curricula, and will no longer be fed this drivel”., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) said half of refugees or displaced persons are children. Whether displaced within Ukraine, or elsewhere, these changes are a source of distress. She described Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) figures on the numbers of children killed or wounded, particularly in the east of Ukraine, as “chilling” and called on belligerents to respect international humanitarian law. Humanitarian personnel must never be targeted. Unhindered humanitarian aid also must be deployed to all people in need, without discrimination. She lauded countries hosting refugees and providing schooling to refugee children, encouraging agencies to work with UNICEF to limit the trauma experienced by child victims of war. Moreover, it is crucial to limit the chances for mafia networks to benefit from the chaotic situation, and she called on parties to engage in discussions aimed at finding a political solution to the crisis., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) said the conflict is severely impacting 7.5 million children across Ukraine. Citing reports that more than 900 education facilities and schools have either been damaged or destroyed, he called for international support for Ukraine’s efforts to protect schools and other learning spaces, students, and teachers. India facilitated the safe return of 22,500 Indian nationals, most of them students studying in Ukraine. It is exploring options for minimizing the impact on their education and welcomes the relaxations made by Ukraine for medical students during this academic year. India is sending medicine and relief supplies to Ukraine and its neighbours, and he voiced support for guarantees of safe passage for such deliveries, including through establishment of humanitarian corridors. Food and energy security are other serious concerns, which must be addressed through collective efforts. “No solution can be arrived at by shedding blood,” he stressed., RICHARD M. MILLS (United States), noting reported attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, expressed particular concern about the situation in Kherson, where Russian forces have reportedly installed an illegitimate pro-Russian puppet administration. In recent days, those illegitimate proxies have indicated an intention to petition the Russian Federation to annex Kherson. The Russian Federation is clearly seeking to assimilate those regions into its orbit, posing grave consequences to the children of Kherson, he said. For example, schools would be forced to adopt the Russian curriculum, with the goal of erasing all signs of Ukrainian identity and culture. In addition, Ukrainians, many of them children, have reportedly been deported to the Russian Federation and processed through “so-called filtration camps”. Drawing attention to the violence, fear and anxiety to which children have been exposed, he warned about the serious and enduring negative consequences of trauma on children’s cognitive development for years to come., He went on to stress that diplomacy and dialogue are essential to resolving the crisis. The Russian Federation should commit to silencing the guns, withdraw its forces, end its war and abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law. Moreover, all parties should urgently facilitate safe and unhindered access for medical and humanitarian workers and allow safe passage for those seeking to flee. He called on the Secretary-General and the Special Representative to add Ukraine as a situation of concern in the upcoming annual report on children in armed conflict, given the scale and nature of reported violations and abuses committed by the Russian Federation against children in eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2021 and evidence of alarming increases in violations and abuses by that country across Ukraine since February. He said Member States must work collectively to ensure that children, regardless of where they live, can live without imminent fear of death, shelling and lifelong trauma., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), recognizing the representative of President Vladimir Putin’s regime “in the permanent seat of the former Soviet Union”, said Russian occupiers are attempting to break Ukraine’s resistance day and night in Mariupol and elsewhere, with heavy bombardments. Even during the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel plant on 7 May, bombing continued, resulting in many wounded who lack access to medical supplies. Calling on the Council to continue to support the evacuation of civilians to safe locations, in line with international law, he stressed that “Russian captivity is not such a place”. He also voiced deep concern over the use of Russian “filtration camps” — a euphemism for concentration camps — emphasizing that it is unacceptable that civilians are being subjected to that practice. On 6 May, immediately after joining other Council members in condemning attacks against civilians, Moscow fired missiles on civilian targets in Kharkiv and elsewhere, demonstrating its cynicism and continuing its terror campaign., Noting that at least 220 children have been killed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine — with the actual number likely much higher — he said additional Russian airstrikes took place on schools on 7 May and just last night. Some 130 education facilities have been destroyed and more than 1,500 damaged to date. Emphasizing that such acts are violations of international humanitarian law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, he also pointed to the Russian kidnapping of Ukrainian children. More than a million children, including orphans, have been transferred to the Russian Federation, where their safety and living conditions remain unknown. Against that backdrop, he asked UNICEF to demand that Moscow grant immediate access to those children and to those living in all areas under temporary Russian control. He welcomed the launch of a Commission of Inquiry tasked with investigating war crimes committed by the Russian Federation — including arbitrary executions and the widespread use of sexual violence, torture and other violations. He also condemned Moscow’s cynical use of the victory over Nazis in the Second World War to justify its current aggression, declaring: “Today’s standards of Russian diplomacy have gone through the floor, and all masks are off.”, SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia), speaking on behalf of the Baltic countries, said in less than three months 14 million people, including two thirds of Ukraine’s children, have been forced to leave their homes. Ukraine’s Human Rights Commissioner asserts that more than 121,000 children have been forcibly deported to the Russian Federation. The forced deportations, along with the Russian Federation’s steps towards legislative changes to accelerate the adoption of children from Ukraine, in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, must be monitored by the United Nations and other relevant organizations. The Russian Federation’s actions amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as grave violations against children in conflict, including by killing and maiming, attacks against schools and hospitals, and sexual violence. The Russian Federation’s crimes are recorded, and it will be held accountable. He expressed support for the role of the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry, and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in this work. He called for the full implementation of resolutions 1612 (2005) and 2601 (2021), which the Russian Federation, a permanent Council member, has endorsed and to which it must comply. He underlined the importance of the recording, monitoring and reporting on violations against children in Ukraine to the Council, including by the Secretary-General’s Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict., JOANNA SYLWIA SKOCZEK (Poland) said more than 3.3 million people, mostly women and children, have crossed from Ukraine into her country seeking refuge. “Poland, both as a State and a society, makes every effort to meet their needs,” she said. Ensuring children continue their education is among its top priorities, as interruption to education has long-lasting effects and can prevent children from returning to learning. “We are determined to ensure each of those affected by war can continue their education,” she assured. Outlining various initiatives, she said that depending on parents’ preferences, Poland can enroll Ukrainian children in Polish schools or provide them equipment to participate in distance learning in the Ukrainian system. For children who want to pursue their education in the Polish system, her country organizes preparatory classes to help them overcome the language barrier. Noting that some 200,00 refugee children from Ukraine are in Polish schools, she said 20 per cent of them attend preparatory classes and 80 per cent attend regular classes with Polish children. In addition, an online platform offering free educational tools was created. Language courses are offered to teachers from Ukraine and for Polish teachers wanting to respond to the needs of Ukrainian refugee children., She went on to note that children with special education needs — and their parents — can benefit from psychological and pedagogical assistance in Polish kindergartens and schools, while older students can pursue their studies at Polish universities, and academic researchers from Ukraine can benefit from financial support to continue their research. In times of war, classrooms should provide children with a sense of stability and act as a safe space to learn. However, across Ukraine, hundreds of schools have been destroyed by Russian shelling. She condemned in the strongest terms attacks against civilians and their infrastructure, stressing that all perpetrators of international law must be held accountable. Over 2,000 patients from Ukraine are hospitalized in Poland, nearly half of them children. Like all children, Ukrainian children were already dealing with mental health challenges from dealing with two years of the pandemic. Now, any move towards pre-pandemic normalcy has been cruelly interrupted. The Polish people are doing the best they can, offering children from Ukraine safety within their homes and families, and a normal life, with its duties and joys. “We hope we are able to save at least part of their dreams, and their childhood,” she said., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), citing the most recent UNICEF report and the update of the OHCHR Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, said that as of 11 May, more than 230 children have been killed and more than 340 have been injured during the conflict. Instead of enjoying their childhood, millions of Ukraine’s children are witnessing the horrors of war. This is a “special achievement” of the Russian Federation’s “special military operation” — or in correct words, a child crisis of unprecedented proportions and one of the fastest large-scale displacements of children since the Second World War, caused by Moscow’s unjustified, unprovoked and senseless aggression against Ukraine, in blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Slovakia, as a neighbouring and directly affected country, is particularly alarmed by this crisis, he said, noting that since February, more than 136,00 children have entered Slovakia, and more than 30,000 have been granted temporary protection. Children fleeing Ukraine are provided with complex care, including psychological and social assistance, medical care and assistance in connecting or reuniting with their relatives and families. Together with UNICEF and UNHCR, Slovakia has agreed to develop a joint child protection, capacity-building plan. He reiterated the call on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its hostilities and unconditionally withdraw all its troops from the whole territory of Ukraine., For information media.

Sanctions and the Costs of Russia’s War in Ukraine,Analysis,IPI,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,12 May 2022,"by Erica Moret, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has wreaked havoc and devastation on Ukraine and its people, while also posing a major threat to wider European security and sovereignty. The international community's response, and that of the West in particular, has centered first and foremost around the use of autonomous (or unilateral) sanctions. All the while, the United Nations Security Council, which counts on Russia as one of its five permanent members, sits redundantly in the face of the conflict, accentuating the crisis in global governance of recent years., Concerns over international sanctions---imposed by the likes of the United States (US), the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia, Japan, and Switzerland against a growing range of Russian targets---centers around a set of key questions. Will they ""work""? What impacts will they have on the economies of Russia and others worldwide? Can they slow down, or halt, the Russian war machine? Can the more punitive aspects of these hard-hitting measures translate into concrete political change on the ground? Can their unintended consequences, such as those of a humanitarian nature, be mitigated?, Unprecedented Threat, Unprecedented Sanctions, While international sanctions against Russia have not quite (or yet) reached the breadth of some of the strictest contemporary sanctions regimes elsewhere in the world (think Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, or Venezuela), they are still unparalleled on a number of levels., First, an economy of the size of that of Russia---highly integrated into world markets, a G20 member, and a leading energy supplier---has not been targeted through sanctions to this extent before. Shockwaves are already being felt around the world in light of fuel, fertilizer, and food price rises linked to the combined impacts of sanctions and the war. Financial markets, industrial production, and supply chains have taken a severe hit. Costs are inevitable on all sides of the equation., Second, this is the first time that the central bank of a major economy has been sanctioned. While many spoke of SWIFT sanctions as the ""nuclear option""---itself a dramatic move of last resort that will deal a heavy blow to Russian economic interests into the longer term---central bank sanctions have the potential for hitting even harder, in that all banking transactions to and from the country are impacted. Likewise, the large---and growing---number of other Russian banks now designated under Western sanctions regimes also marks a relatively novel, and more punitive, direction for the tool's use. The Russian economy is expected to face the biggest fall in GDP since the collapse of the Soviet Union in spite of the raft of sanctions-proofing economic safeguards taken by President Putin. Not to mention soaring inflation, capital flight, and possible debt default. The full economic impact of the war and sanctions could take months, if not years, to reach full force., Third is the never-seen-before mass voluntary boycott of Russia by hundreds, if not thousands, of international companies. The retreat of luxury goods firms and fast-food chains deals a major public blow to the Russian government---heightening the sense of a united global political front condemning Russia's actions. Yet the withdrawal of firms dealing in technology, agricultural goods, non-essential pharmaceutical products, and remittance services, has the potential to impact a broader swathe of the Russian population in a more significant way, not just its elites. Whether this will translate to pressure exerted on President Putin by the Russian people remains to be seen., Fourth, this marks one of the rare occasions where such broad and hard-hitting sanctions are imposed against a country that is able to retaliate in a number of meaningful ways. Russia has long used its own restrictive measures (such as halts to gas exports and controls over agricultural imports as punishment to former Soviet states for closening EU or NATO ties). A continued use of Russian ""countermeasures"" is thus to be expected. The hybrid threat associated with the use of disinformation is also a key feature of the conflict, including in relation to notions of legitimacy surrounding sanctions use., More importantly, though, Russia is a country that has made documented use of retaliatory chemical weapons and cyber-attacks against adversaries, not to mention President Putin's use of veiled nuclear threats. The fact that the West is still willing to employ its favorite economic weapon with such vigor, in spite of these risks, demonstrates the severity of the situation and the strategic importance that is placed on these ever-popular tools of foreign and security policy. Indeed, doing nothing, or not doing enough, could lead to an emboldened Putin, willing to repeat his actions elsewhere in Europe., Fifth, these sanctions appear to mark a turning point for the EU in its use of sanctions. The bloc, which for over twenty years has tended to follow the US' lead in its use of autonomous sanctions, has often acted as a softer, and more dovish, counterpoint to the US' more assertive sanctions stance. This divergence in approach reached a climax under the Trump presidency; widely criticized for its more hawkish use of sanctions designed to cripple target countries' economies under the ""Maximum Pressure"" campaign. The approach---coined the ""naïve"" approach to sanctions by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung in 1967---was met by consternation and criticism by international observers, including by those in Europe. Especially as many decades of sanctions scholarship have shown that crippling sanctionsrarely, if ever, help to bring about sanctions' stated policy objectives. Instead, studies suggest that something of a middle ground in sanctions severity tends to render more favorable results., In spite of this, the EU now appears to be aligning more closely with the US' trajectory, marking a return to measures that approximate full-blown embargoes but with a modern twist. Whereas the EU formerly pushed for highly targeted sanctions regimes, some of their recent packages of restrictive measures have included broad sectoral measures, such as in the cases of Iran and Syria. Russia represents another step on this gradual path of ""re-comprehensivization"" [i] of modern sanctions regimes. Except this time, EU narratives have started to approximate Trumpian language. European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen recently spoke of ""crippling sanctions"" that ""maximize pressure"" on Russia and seek to ""solidify the complete isolation of the Russian financial sector from the global system."" Similarly, EU parliamentarian Guy Verhofstadt---frustrated at the slow pace of EU sanctions adoption---called for ""full sanctions against Russia"" (receiving 513 votes in favor, versus 22 against, and 19 abstentions)., Finally, the measures are also unusual in terms of the speed with which they have been agreed to date (a matter of weeks) and novel forms of international coordination driving their design and enforcement. The EU and G7, for example, rapidly formalized the joint Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force to coordinate financial sanctions against kleptocrats' assets. Such a move pays heed to earlier recommendations by this author in a recent article, arguing that the efficacy of autonomous sanctions could be heightened through closer joint coordination and monitoring. Also notable are recent discussions on both sides of the Atlantic on whether frozen oligarchs' assets could be used to support Ukraine. If successful, such a move would draw on similar actions, albeit with distinct legal underpinnings, in the cases of Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as drawing from law enforcement cases., Ask Not if the Sanctions ""Will Work"", The question of sanctions' efficacy is at the forefront of debates on sanctions against Russia, yet it is a challenging one to unpack. First, sanctions do not operate in a vacuum in any given crisis. As a result, it is notoriously difficult to demonstrate causation over correlation with any confidence in isolation of other factors at play. Second, we are rarely able to unravel the invisible or less visible impacts of sanctions (e.g., what decisions have been made behind closed doors in light of the pressure targets exert). Third, there are multiple purposes at play in any given sanctions regime. Studies carried out by the Targeted Sanctions Consortium, for example, suggest that they can be more useful in signaling displeasure or disapproval towards a target than bringing about a change in behavior or constraining access to vital resources., Studies that seek to assess sanctions' effectiveness suggest low ""success"" levels overall. This is not to say that they don't play a useful role in some contexts, however, particularly if combined judiciously and strategically with other areas of diplomacy and mediation. Indeed, contrary to popular misconceptions, sanctions have contributed to positive changes in a range of areas around the world, including conflict resolution, sustaining peace, human rights, counterterrorism, and dismantling criminal networks. These ""successes"" are often lower-profile, more piecemeal, or more temporary in nature, rather than the dramatic changes of behavior often anticipated by the general public, however., What does earlier sanctions scholarship teach us about trends in the Russian context? First, sanctions imposed against countries that are more integrated into the world economy tend to be more effective, as are those imposed through a large coalition of actors. Second, sanctions against countries unable to forge viable new trade or financial ties (to fill gaps that may have been left by the sanctions) can also show greater levels of success. Third, sanctions applied swiftly are also typically more effective. These factors bode well relatively for the Russian case, where a broad raft of measures have been applied with lightning speed by a large coalition of actors, in comparison to other sanctions regimes around the world, which have taken years, if not decades, to evolve to a similar level of breadth and depth., On the other side of the coin, sanctions against autocratic governments tend to be less effective, particularly when their leaders are driven by ideological motives and are able to control state media. In such cases, propaganda or disinformation can promote the idea of a common enemy and can scapegoat economic woes (such as those caused by war or exacerbated through corruption or economic mismanagement) on sanctions' impacts. Those imposed against leaders with delicate egos can also be less effective, due to the overwhelming need to save face or demonstrate an image of strength in the face of adversity. Strategic communications on sanctions are vital, therefore, including in relation to objectives and the mitigation of unintended consequences. Psychology should also play a more important role in sanctions planning, as argued by UK international relations scholar, Dr. Jamie Gaskarth, in a recent talk to the Geneva International Sanctions Network., Seeking to hit the Russian war machine where it most hurts and ensuring a strong punitive angle to the measures is currently the name of the game. Whether this translates into some form of notable change on the ground in Ukraine remains to be seen, particularly when oil and gas exports continue to generate some USD 1 billion per day for the Russian economy. But on this note, one thing is clear: economic pain does not necessarily equate to political gain and the two should not be conflated. Former North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Supreme Allied Commander, Philip Breedlove, alluded to in this in a recent interview:, ""In the West when we deal with Putin, it's almost always completely in sanctions---sanctions, additional sanctions, wider sanctions, special sanctions, extra special sanctions, magnificent, incredible sanctions... Sanctions have hurt Russia. They've hurt the Russian people. They've hurt the Russian economy, but they have never changed Mr. Putin's actions... We're going to have to do more than sanctions to change Mr. Putin's behavior... What Mr. Putin responds to is force."", This statement highlights what sanctions scholars have known for many decades: that sanctions do not serve as a cure-all solution, or a silver bullet capable of rapidly bringing about spectacular policy changes. Instead, they are but one part of a larger strategic toolkit. While sanctions can be useful in helping to achieve certain (often modest) aims, they need to be combined advantageously with other instruments (think defense, diplomacy, mediation, humanitarian action, trade, peacekeeping, and referrals to legal tribunals). Our studies on earlier US and EU sanctions against Russia (conducted by a multidisciplinary team of researchers based at the Graduate Institute, Geneva) showed that the effectiveness of the sanctions was sometimes compromised through conflicting policy actions (e.g., EU member state trade visits to Moscow at the same time as new restrictive measures were being agreed)., Advocates could argue that international sanctions adopted against Russian targets have been ""successful"" in a number of modest ways so far. They help to convey an emphatic message of disapproval and condemnation of Russian aggression in Ukraine. They contribute significantly to the raising of costs of the war and depriving the Putin government (particularly into the longer term) of vital resources required to continue engaging in the conflict. They allow for a highly visible show of unity among many in the international community, particularly in the absence of a UN-led response. Whether they will eventually allow for more ambitious political aims to be realized as well, such as halting the war, will depend heavily on the way in which other instruments of statecraft are used in parallel and whether harmful unintended consequences can be minimized., **Mitigating Unintended Economic and Humanitarian Consequences **, Safeguards are needed to mitigate domestic economic costs if political support for the measures is to remain intact. In our study exploring impacts of 2014-2016 Russia sanctions on EU economies, the results surprised us. Those member states that, at the time, most opposed the adoption or renewal of sanctions within the EU (such as Italy, Cyprus, Greece, and Hungary) [ii] were among those who lost the least in terms of reduced export revenues. In contrast, those most supportive of the measures, including the Baltic States and Poland, lost the most. Many of the initial economic shocks linked to a drop in trade with Russia were rapidly addressed through the forging of new trade links. The EU also sought to financially compensate those hardest hit, such as in the agriculture sector. The situation today is distinct in terms of the reach and breadth of the measures adopted, of course, but these early trends highlight how political support for sanctions in any given country or international organization, does not always equate to costs borne (and that some of the costs can be mitigated if addressed at an early stage as part of the sanctions design process)., Humanitarian safeguards are also essential. If normal Russians are unable to access formal banking channels, or remit funds home to their families, they will soon join other ""unbanked"" swathes of the world, unable to access certain essential goods. While political momentum and compliance complexity push companies and banks to de-risk and over-comply with sanctions, care should be taken that their mass retreat from Russia does not feed into Putin's narrative that Russia is under the attack of the West. Indeed, many of Russia's growing and impeding woes will be blamed on sanctions. Broad standing licensing exemptions and clear guidance from governments on what is and is not allowed under these multiple, overlapping, and fast-changing sanctions regimes will be key in mitigating some of these challenges, as will steps to reduce de-risking behavior that can serve to amplify financial exclusion and reduce resilience among vulnerable communities., While future outcomes remain uncertain, one thing is sure: the Russia case marks a new page in global sanctions practice yet lessons from earlier cases could help increase efficacy and minimize costs., [i] Moret, Erica (2021).

She was given psychosocial support to help her recover from the horrors she had witnessed. For over a year she struggled to cope. She is now in school living in the world’s largest refugee camp in Cox’s Bazaar., “Do not be afraid, believe in yourself. I have been through this; I can feel what is going through you. Everything will be fine and one day you will be back to your home like you used to be.

You cry from within because of the things that have happened. I have been through it. I also ran away like you and I have made it through., “I advise the children from Ukraine to forget about all the challenges they have faced … playing football, netball, and drawing or painting helps me forget about the past.”, Pete Walsh, Save the Children’s Ukraine Country Director, said:, “These stories are a powerful reminder of the devastating impact conflict has on children’s lives, not just in Ukraine but across the world. Each one has been shared in solidarity to give children in Ukraine hope, from those who have lived through the horrors of war themselves., “Hundreds of millions are living in conflict across the world, robbing them of the childhood they deserve. All children should be given the right support to recover from the pain of what they have witnessed during war.”, Save the Children staff and partners working in Ukraine and neighbouring countries are seeing the psychological and emotional impacts of war on the children they are meeting with children arriving at reception centres showing worrying signs of severe distress., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychosocial support, baby, and hygiene kits to displaced families., Save the Children has also set up safe spaces for children where they can play as well as emergency distribution tents at border crossings, transportation hubs, and reception centres in Romania, Poland, and Lithuania.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 11 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2022,"Date: 12 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 11 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 7,326 civilian casualties in the country: 3,541 killed and 3,785 injured. This included:, a total of 3,541 killed (1,300 men, 844 women, 77 girls, and 93 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,158 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,785 injured (590 men, 428 women, 90 girls, and 98 boys, as well as 167 children and 2,412 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

Human Rights Council Adopts Resolution on the Deteriorating Human Rights Situation in Ukraine and Closes Special Session,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",12 May 2022,"The Human Rights Council this afternoon closed its thirty-fourth special session after adopting a resolution on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, in which the Councilreiterated its demand for an immediate cessation of military hostilities against Ukraine and requested the Independent International Commission of Inquiry to conduct an inquiry, consistent with its mandate and international standards, and in coordination with other national and international mechanisms, to address the events in the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions in late February and March 2022, including their gender dimension, with a view to hold to account those responsible., In the resolution, that was adopted by a vote of 33 in favour, two against and 12 abstentions, the Council also urged the Russian Federation to provide representatives and staff of international human rights and humanitarian institutions, including United Nations specialised agencies, with unhindered, timely, immediate, unrestricted and safe access to persons who had been transferred from conflict-affected areas of Ukraine and were held on the territory of the Russian Federation or areas controlled or occupied by the Russian Federation, and to share with relevant parties a comprehensive list of such transferred persons and their whereabouts., In the discussion prior to the adoption of the resolution, speakers raised, among other things, the importance of ensuring accountability for all violations and abuses perpetrated in Ukraine. Justice must be served for these and all other crimes through the relevant international instruments. Russia should immediately cease its aggression, withdraw all its forces from the whole territory of Ukraine, and provide international human rights and humanitarian institutions with unhindered, immediate and safe access to persons transferred from conflict-affected areas of Ukraine and held on the territory of Russia or areas controlled or occupied by the Russian Federation., Speaking in the discussion were the representatives of Georgia, Israel, Estonia, Slovakia, Belgium and Iran., Also speaking were the Ukrainian Parliament Commission for Human Rights, as well as the following non-governmental organizations: World Organization against Torture, Article 19 - International Centre Against Censorship, International Commission of Jurists, Human Rights House Foundation, Amnesty International, International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, Ingenieurs du Monde, Lawyers’ Rights Watch Canada, United Nations Watch, Maat for Peace, Development and Human Rights Association, Human Rights Watch, International Service for Human Rights, World Federation of Ukrainian Women’s Organizations, International Program for Human Rights Law, Civicus - World Alliance for Citizen Participation, International-Lawyers.org, and Child Rights Connect., The first meeting of the special session was held this morning and a summary can be found here ., The Council’s regular fiftieth session will be held from 13 June to 8 July 2022, Discussion, In the discussion, speakers raised, among other things, the importance of ensuring accountability for all violations and abuses perpetrated in Ukraine. Summary executions of men, women and children; and sexual- and gender-based violence that could amount to war crimes; and the near-total destruction of Mariupol’s civilian infrastructure were all vitally important issues. Justice must be served for these and all other crimes through the relevant international instruments. Russia should immediately cease its aggression, withdraw all its forces from the whole territory of Ukraine, and provide international human rights and humanitarian institutions with unhindered, immediate and safe access to persons transferred from conflict-affected areas of Ukraine and held on the territory of Russia or areas controlled or occupied by the Russian Federation. The Russian actions represented violations of international law amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and it would be held accountable., With its aggression, Russia had started a tragedy that was constantly growing, and which ran counter to the principles on which the United Nations was founded. There could be no impunity, and the role of the Council was crucial in this respect. This war was fuelled by an intensified form of disinformation, in which somebody else besides Russia was the cause of the invasion, and this should be rejected and combatted. The atrocities continued to grow, showing that the creation of a Commission of Inquiry by the Council in March was only part of the necessary international human rights response to the impact of this conflict. The growth of world food insecurity and the blockade of Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea were matters of great concern for those who were vulnerable to food and energy insecurity, and this unnecessary situation must be deplored. Immediate solutions should be sought through negotiations. All parties should fully respect international humanitarian law. The actions that had fuelled the conflict must cease; there should be a peace-loving mentality. The war should not be used as an excuse to sell weapons and engage in geo-political and power politics that could only further side-line the multilateral system., During times of war, the safety of journalists and media workers was paramount, and the Russian Federation had launched abhorrent attacks against journalists who were documenting its crimes against international law, including by resorting to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, kidnapping and murders, with at least 10 reported killings of journalists since the beginning of the war. Abductions and killings of journalists were war crimes, and must be fully investigated with a view to holding those who perpetrated them to account. The Commission of Inquiry must be provided with sufficient resources to investigate and support effective accountability for the escalating crimes committed during the conflict. Human rights defenders and journalists investigating crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine required the efforts of the international community to ensure their safety alongside other particularly vulnerable groups. Equally, Russia’s repression in occupied Crimea continued with arbitrary arrests, torture, politically-motivated criminal convictions, enforced disappearances, and other gross violations of human rights., Action on Resolution on the Deteriorating Human Rights Situation in Ukraine Stemming from the Russian Aggression, In a resolution (A/HRC/S-34/L.1) as orally revised, on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression , adopted by a vote of 33 in favour, two against and 12 abstentions, the Human Rights Council reiterates its demand for an immediate cessation of military hostilities against Ukraine, and for all parties to the conflict to respect the fundamental principles and rules of international humanitarian law, including to refrain from any attacks against civilians and civilian objects, and to refrain from any human rights violations and abuses in Ukraine; and to refrain from any State-sponsored disinformation, propaganda for war or advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, related to the aggression against Ukraine; and urges the Russian Federation to provide representatives and staff of international human rights and humanitarian institutions, including United Nations specialised agencies, with unhindered, timely, immediate, unrestricted and safe access to persons who have been transferred from conflict-affected areas of Ukraine and are held on the territory of the Russian Federation or areas controlled or occupied by the Russian Federation, and to share with relevant parties a comprehensive list of such transferred persons and their whereabouts., The Council requests the Commission of Inquiry to conduct an inquiry, consistent with its mandate and international standards, and in coordination with other national and international mechanisms, to address the events in the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions in late February and March 2022, including their gender dimension, with a view to hold to account those responsible, and also requests the Commission to brief the Human Rights Council on the progress of that inquiry as part of the oral update to the Council at its fifty-first session, and to include the findings after the completion of that inquiry in its report to the fifty-second session of the Human Rights Council; and requests the High Commissioner to present an oral update on the grave human rights and humanitarian situation in Mariupol, to include an assessment of the nature and causes of violations or abuses of human rights and of violations of international humanitarian law committed there, at the fiftieth session of the Human Rights Council, under item 2 to be followed by an interactive dialogue. The Council encourages relevant thematic Special Procedure mandate holders, within their respective mandates, to continue to pay particular attention to the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, and urges all relevant parties to cooperate with those mandate holders; and decides to remain seized on the matter., The results of the vote are as follows:, In favour (33): Argentina, Benin, Brazil, Cote d’Ivoire, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mexico, Montenegro, Nepal, Netherlands, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Somalia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States., Against (2): China and Eritrea., Abstentions (12): Armenia, Boliva, Cameroon, Cuba, India, Kazakhstan, Namibia, Pakistan, Senegal, Sudan, Uzbekistan and Venezuela., Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

Protection and Human Rights",12 May 2022,"DELIVERED BY Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
AT 34th special session of the Human Rights Council on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, Distinguished President,
Excellencies,
Colleagues and Friends,
Greetings from Vienna,, Thank you for this opportunity to update the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Ukraine. This follows my last oral update to the Council on 30 March, and my briefing to the United Nations Security Council on 5 May., My Office continues to verify allegations of violations of international human rights law and of international humanitarian law, many of which may amount to war crimes. Since the fourth day of the Russian Federation’s armed attack in Ukraine, my Office has been publishing daily updates on civilian casualties. We have consistently stressed that actual figures are likely considerably higher, as our figures only refer to those cases that we have been able to verify. In areas of intense hostilities – notably, Mariupol – it has been difficult for my staff to gain access and obtain and corroborate information., The pattern of causes of civilian casualties that my Office has been recording in Ukraine has not significantly changed since the last time I briefed this body. The vast majority continue to be caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, such as shelling from heavy artillery, including multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. According to our information, while such incidents can be attributed to both parties to the conflict, most of these casualties appear attributable to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., Excellencies,, Last week, my Monitoring Mission in Ukraine visited 14 towns and villages in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions which, until the end of March, were controlled by Russian armed forces. My team heard first-hand accounts of relatives, neighbours and friends being killed, injured, detained and disappeared. This was the second OHCHR visit to these regions, and it pains me to imagine how many visits will be needed to document only a fraction of the egregious human rights violations that have occurred there., To date, over 1,000 civilian bodies have been recovered in the Kyiv region alone. Some of these people were killed in hostilities, others appear to have been summarily executed. Others still have died because of stress to their health caused by hostilities and the lack of medical aid. They have spent weeks in basements being threatened by Russian soldiers with abuse or death if they tried to leave, thereby placing these individuals at severe risk from the hostilities. In the village of Yahidne in Chernihiv region, 360 residents, including 74 children and 5 persons with disabilities, were forced by Russian armed forces to stay for 28 days in the basement of a school that they were using as their base. The basement was extremely overcrowded. People had to sit for days without an opportunity to lie down. There were no toilet facilities, water or ventilation. 10 older people died., The scale of unlawful killings, including indicia of summary executions in areas to the north of Kyiv is shocking. While we have information about 300 such killings, the figures will continue to increase as new evidence becomes available. These killings of civilians often appeared to be intentional, carried out by snipers and soldiers. Civilians were killed when crossing the road or leaving their shelters to seek food and water. Others were killed as they fled in their vehicles. Unarmed local men were killed because Russian soldiers suspected them of supporting Ukrainian forces or otherwise being a potential threat, and some were tortured before being killed. In the village of Katiuzhanka, Kyiv region, a young couple, their 14-year old daughter and a grandfather were shot by Russian soldiers while trying to drive to their house. The parents were killed, while the child received two gunshot wounds., To date we have recorded destruction or damage to hundreds of educational and medical facilities, and tens of thousands civilian houses, as a result of the hostilities. Throughout the country, at least 50 Christian, Jewish and Muslim places of worship of different denominations have been damaged; more than half of these have been severely damaged and cannot be used., Excellencies,, The city of Mariupol and its residents have suffered unimaginable horrors since the Russian Federation’s armed attack started. I am shocked at the scale of the destruction, and the numerous violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that have reportedly been committed in the city, including attacks against civilians and civilian objects. A once flourishing city lies in ruins. We estimate the civilian death toll in Mariupol to lie in the thousands, while only with time will the true scale of atrocities, casualties and damage become clear. Active hostilities are now focused on the Azovstal industrial area, with residential areas of the city now largely occupied by the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. This raises human rights concerns of a different nature than those arising in areas of active hostilities., I am relieved that over 500 civilians, including children and older persons, have now been successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant and other areas following the joint efforts of the ICRC and UN. Combatants that are hors de combat by sickness or injury must also be allowed to be evacuated to receive the medical care required by their condition., Excellencies,, My office is looking into allegations of sexual violence and has verified a dozen cases across the country. I am concerned by allegations of sexual violence that have emerged from areas in the Kyiv region that were formerly under the control of Russian armed forces. There were instances of rape and murder of victims or their relatives. Survivors are often unwilling to be interviewed because of fear and stigma. Women and girls are the most frequently cited victims; however, reports of men and boys being affected are starting to emerge., The Mission also spoke to people who are searching for their relatives and friends. It has documented some cases of Russian armed forces having detained civilians, mostly young men, and then transferred them to Belarus and then Russia, where they have been held in pre-trial detention centres. Overall, since 24 February, we have documented 204 cases of enforced disappearance (169 men, 34 women, 1 boy), the overwhelming majority of them by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Among them are public officials, journalists, civil society activists, retired servicemen of the armed forces as well as other civilians. According to information available to us, 38 of them have been released and returned home, and five (four men and one woman) were found dead. The real number of enforced disappearances is again likely higher., We have also documented ten cases of possible enforced disappearances of people considered to be pro-Russian in Government controlled territory which appear to have been committed by Ukrainian law enforcement officials. Seven of those victims have since been reportedly released. My Office is also following cases of conflict-related detainees in Government-controlled areas which raise fair trial concerns. Excellencies,, The only way to bring a stop to further violations is to end the hostilities. That must remain the primary objective. However, while hostilities continue and for as long as they last, all parties must give clear instructions to their combatants to protect civilians and persons hors de combat, as well as to distinguish between civilian and military objects., Those in command of armed forces must make it clear to their members that anyone found to have been involved in such violations will be prosecuted and held accountable., I urge both parties to the conflict to fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including to investigate all allegations of violations, and above all to commit to protecting every civilian woman, man and child and those hors de combat., Our common humanity demands no less., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-update-human-rights-council-special-session-michelle-bachelet-un-high

“We risk dying when going to work” - Ukrainian nurse shares her message on International Nurses Day [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",12 May 2022,"“When the explosions first went off on 24 February, I turned up the volume of my children’s TV cartoons, so that they wouldn’t hear the noise. I was very much in doubt whether to stay or leave, but as a medical surgical nurse, I quickly realized that my skills were needed here. So, I stayed.”, Tetiana Freishyn has been a nurse for 17 years, with most of these spent in surgery. Since the war in Ukraine started, she has been working in the trauma and orthopedics department at the city hospital in Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west of the country., On 12 May, WHO/Europe marks International Nurses Day with a call to secure the safety of nurses like Tetiana and her colleagues – everywhere. As of 8 May, WHO has confirmed 200 attacks on health care in Ukraine since the war’s outbreak, which have led to 75 deaths and 54 injuries. Attacks on health care include attacks on health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses. When people are prevented from seeking health care, either because the facilities have been destroyed or out of fear that they may become a target, they lose hope. The mental health toll wreaked by the war cannot be underestimated, affecting civilians and health workers alike., Tetiana says that, although her ward in Ivano-Frankivsk has so far been spared, the working conditions have been challenging., “The psychological burden is huge because the workload is heavier, and at the same time I am concerned for the safety of my children and my husband,” she explains., A message of peace on International Nurses Day, When faced with the choice of staying or leaving in the midst of conflict, maintaining motivation can be difficult. But being a nurse with highly needed skills is what keeps Tetiana going., “My nursing profession is my life; it’s what gets me out of bed every day; it’s the state of my soul,” she says, adding that her message to all nurses on International Nurses Day is one of peace., “No one should have to be a nurse during a conflict, and I wish for all nurses to be able to go to work with joy. The health care profession is a peaceful one, and I hope that we can all go to work peacefully. As it is now, we risk dying when going to work.”, Tetiana says the attacks have gone beyond hospitals., “We’ve seen attacks on ambulances, and quite a number of health care professionals have died in the line of duty,” she shares. “Nurses shouldn’t die while performing their medical duties.”, “We quickly need to upgrade our skills”, The realities of the war have led to a series of new professional challenges for Tetiana and her colleagues., “The recurrent air alarms mean that you never know when your work is interrupted. We get a lot of open wound fractures caused by the ongoing violence. These are quite different compared to regular leg fractures, so we quickly need to upgrade our skills.”, Of course, another consequence of the conflict has been the high number of internally displaced people., “Some of them are skilled health care professionals who come to work with us. We highly appreciate their help, and taking on new colleagues and functioning as a team adds to the number of things we need to adjust to,” Tetiana explains., Like millions of nurses all over the globe, Tetiana continues to provide lifesaving care to people in need. Nurses’ ability to practice and apply their skills is not only an opportunity to safeguard access to decent work; around the world the vast majority of nurses are female, so investment in nursing is also an investment in women and their role in global public health., ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/we-risk-dying-when-going-work-ukrainian-nurse-shares-her-message-international-nurses

Civilians – particularly women and children – are paying the heaviest price., Recent reports of the shelling of a school in Bilohorivka in Luhansk oblast – where women and children were seeking shelter from the fighting – are abominable, and the human toll must be condemned., Hostilities in populated areas are extremely destructive., The use of wide-area explosive weapons in these areas comes with a very high risk of indiscriminate effects and must be avoided., The presence of landmine and unexploded ordnance also significantly impacts humanitarian response and access., Even before this war, eastern Ukraine was one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world., Support for mine action is crucial. Demining is a priority to open up humanitarian space., Mr. President,, Under international humanitarian law, the parties must respect all civilians, as well as civilian homes, schools, hospitals and other essential infrastructure. They must take constant care to spare them., This includes allowing civilians to leave areas of hostilities voluntarily and safely. It includes having special consideration for the needs of people facing specific risks, such as women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities., I also urge parties to the conflict to remove any barriers to the movement of humanitarian staff to ensure the continued delivery of life-saving assistance across Ukraine., Mr. President,, Let me briefly update you on the latest figures., Almost 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, of whom 8 million are internally displaced., 227 partners – the majority national NGOs – have provided humanitarian assistance to over 5.4 million people, many of those in the east. This scale-up is unprecedented., As you are aware, in addition to the evacuations from the Azovstal plant and Mariupol, five inter-agency convoys – including essential medical supplies, water, food rations, non-food items, water repair systems and generators – have provided a lifeline to civilians encircled by fighting., This is by no means enough., Both parties have been notified of these convoys. I urge them to continue their facilitation efforts so we can reach many more civilians., This is also required of them under international humanitarian law., We must urgently take our efforts to scale., Mr. President,, Our recent efforts to evacuate civilians in the east has shown us that there is good will and common ground for us to build on between the parties., As requested by the Secretary-General, Martin is exploring ways to bring the parties together to discuss humanitarian issues, including safe passage for civilians and the movement of humanitarian convoys., Earlier this week, Martin was warmly received in Ankara by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, and Presidential Spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin. Their discussions focused on Turkish support to the UN’s efforts towards progress on pressing humanitarian concerns in Ukraine., We must explore all options to reach more people where needs are the greatest., We remain firmly committed to leaving no stone unturned. To find measures – from local pauses to wider ceasefires – to save lives., The world expects this of us. The people of Ukraine deserve this., Thank you, Mr. President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/assistant-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-deputy-emergency-relief-6
From Kosovo to Ukraine: Lessons from the humanitarian response to conflict and displacement in Europe,Analysis,ALNAP,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",11 May 2022,"By Margie Buchanan-Smith and Peter Wiles, Introduction, Before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the last large-scale forced migration and displacement to happen within Europe was the 1999 Kosovo crisis. The situation was described at the time as the ‘largest and fastest movement of people in Europe since World War II’ (Wiles et al., 2000), words that are now being used to describe the even larger flow of people displaced by the Ukraine crisis., While there are many differences between the two crises, not least in terms of their primary cause and the scale of the humanitarian emergencies, there are also similarities (Table 1 in the PDF), particularly in the international humanitarian response. Both crises triggered record levels of funding, especially from private donations, and most international humanitarian agencies in receipt of those donations had limited or no presence and experience in the countries affected., This paper highlights key lessons from the international humanitarian response to the Kosovo crisis that could have relevance in guiding the response to Ukraine. The lessons are drawn from the three-volume ‘Independent Evaluation of Expenditure of DEC Kosovo Appeal Funds’ (Wiles et al., 2000) and ALNAP’s meta-evaluation of the Kosovo response, from its 2001 Annual Review (Apthorpe, 2000).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/kosovo-ukraine-lessons-humanitarian-response-conflict-and-displacement-europe
High Commissioner to Special Session of the Human Rights Council on Ukraine: Many of the Allegations of Violations of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law in Ukraine May Amount to War Crimes,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2022,"The Human Rights Council this morning began its thirty-fourth special session on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, hearing the High Commissioner for Human Rights say that her Office continued to verify allegations of violations of international human rights law and of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, many of which may amount to war crimes., Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the causes of civilian casualties that the Office had been recording in Ukraine had not significantly changed since the last time she addressed the Council. The vast majority continued to be caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, such as shelling from heavy artillery, including multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. According to information, while such incidents could be attributed to both parties to the conflict, most of these casualties appeared attributable to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. The only way to bring a stop to further violations was to end the hostilities., Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Chair of the Special Procedures' Coordinating Committee, said that since 24 February, the Coordinating Committee had been receiving information about the disastrous consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Every day, this information added to a catalogue of grave violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law. The consequences of this military attack on the protection and promotion of human rights in Ukraine would be profound and long-lasting and would cause immense suffering and irreparable harm lasting for generations. The Russian Federation should immediately end its invasion of Ukraine to avoid further bloodshed and loss of life., Erik Møse, Chairperson of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said the Commission was - as stated in its mandate - independent. It had no link to any particular country, party, or entity. The Commission would continue to seek contact with the parties to the conflict, with victims, civil society and other stakeholders. It would be necessary to build upon a broad range of sources that would have to be considered together. The Commission would evaluate the evidence carefully, giving particular weight to primary evidence and seeking corroboration whenever needed. The findings of the Commission, reported to the Human Rights Council, would be based on the independent assessment of the commissioners and their analysis of the information and evidence that came out of their investigations., Russia was not present in the room to take the floor as a country concerned., Ukraine, speaking as a country concerned, said it had been 10 weeks since the Human Rights Council discussed the humanitarian and human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression. It had been 10 weeks of sheer horror and of deep suffering for every Ukrainian family. Thousands of people had lost their lives, more than 200 children among them. Russian bombing and shelling had become part of everyday life. Torture, enforced disappearances and sexual violence were among the least of the crimes committed by Russia. The Council had a moral responsibility to act., In the ensuing discussion, some speakers said it was imperative that all perpetrators of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law be held to account. Justice for victims was the foundation for future peace and reconciliation and for the prevention of further atrocities. For this, the collection and preservation of evidence was essential. Russia’s deceptions, lies and efforts at disinformation were condemned, as were the abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Russia must withdraw immediately, fully and unconditionally from Ukrainian territory. It was the responsibility of the international community, including the Council, to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes at every level were brought to justice., Other speakers said that it was incumbent upon the Council to base its judgements on an impartial assessment of the situation. All parties must take steps to de-escalate the conflict and put human lives first. Measures must be taken to avoid politicisation and avoid exacerbating the debate. It was important for the Council to continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine, and draw attention to the plight of individuals affected, irrespective of geo-political considerations. In recent years the politicisation and confrontation in the Human Rights Council had been on the rise, which had impacted credibility and solidarity, and all parties should get back to and abide by the founding principles of the Council, uphold multilateralism, and work to support the cause of human rights., At the beginning of the meeting, the Council elected Muhammadou Kah, Permanent Representative of the Gambia, to act as a Vice-President of the Council for the African group of States for the period from 1 May 2022 to 31 December 2022., Speaking this morning were the Marshall Islands on behalf of a group of countries, Estonia on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic Countries, France on behalf of the European Union, Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, United Kingdom, India, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Lithuania, France, United States of America, Republic of Korea, Paraguay, Indonesia, Mexico, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Montenegro, Finland, Netherlands, China, Nepal, Czech Republic, Eritrea, Austria, Romania, Canada, Colombia, International Development Law Organization, Australia, Peru, Ireland, Ecuador, Portugal, Latvia, New Zealand, Sovereign Order of Malta, Nicaragua, Switzerland, Albania, Moldova, Malta, Sweden, Belarus, North Macedonia, Italy, Denmark, Chile, Liechtenstein, Norway, Syria, Bulgaria, Uruguay, Turkey, Croatia, Iceland, Slovenia, Cyprus, Viet Nam, Spain, Greece, and Timor Leste., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s thirty-fourth special session can be found here., The Council is scheduled to meet again this afternoon at 3 p.m. to conclude its discussion and to take action on a draft resolution before closing its thirty-fourth special session., Keynote Statements(https://reliefweb.int/node/3846293), MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her Office continued to verify allegations of violations of international human rights law and of international humanitarian law in Ukraine, many of which may amount to war crimes. The pattern of causes of civilian casualties that the Office had been recording in Ukraine had not significantly changed since the last time she addressed the Council. The vast majority continued to be caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, such as shelling from heavy artillery, including multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. According to information, while such incidents could be attributed to both parties to the conflict, most of these casualties appeared attributable to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., Last week, the Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had visited 14 towns and villages in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions which, until the end of March, were controlled by Russian armed forces, and heard first-hand accounts of relatives, neighbours and friends being killed, injured, detained and disappeared. To date, over 1,000 civilian bodies had been recovered in the Kyiv region alone. Some of these people were killed in hostilities, others appeared to have been summarily executed. Others still had died because of stress to their health caused by hostilities and the lack of medical aid., The scale of unlawful killings, including indicia of summary executions in areas to the north of Kyiv, was shocking. While the Office had information about 300 such killings, the figures would continue to increase as new evidence became available. These killings of civilians often appeared to be intentional, carried out by snipers and soldiers. Unarmed local men were killed because Russian soldiers suspected them of supporting Ukrainian forces or otherwise being a potential threat, and some were tortured before being killed. The Office estimated that the civilian death toll in Mariupol lay in the thousands, while only with time would the true scale of atrocities, casualties and damage become clear. Active hostilities were now focused on the Azovstal industrial area, with residential areas of the city now largely occupied by the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. This raised human rights concerns of a different nature than those arising in areas of active hostilities., The Office was looking into allegations of sexual violence and had verified a dozen cases across the country. Ms. Bachelet said she was concerned by allegations of sexual violence that had emerged from areas in the Kyiv region that were formerly under the control of Russian armed forces. Women and girls were the most frequently cited victims; however, reports of men and boys being affected were starting to emerge., The Mission also spoke to people who were searching for their relatives and friends, and had documented some cases of Russian armed forces having detained civilians, mostly young men, and then transferred them to Belarus and then Russia, where they were held in pre-trial detention centres. Overall, since 24 February, it had documented 204 cases of enforced disappearance, the overwhelming majority of them by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. It had also documented 10 cases of possible enforced disappearances of people considered to be pro-Russian in Government controlled territory which appeared to have been committed by Ukrainian law enforcement officials., The only way to bring a stop to further violations was to end the hostilities. That must remain the primary objective. However, while hostilities continued and for as long as they lasted, all parties must give clear instructions to their combatants to protect civilians and persons hors de combat, as well as to distinguish between civilian and military objects. Those in command of armed forces must make it clear to their members that anyone found to have been involved in such violations would be prosecuted and held accountable., Ms. Bachelet urged both parties to the conflict to fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including to investigate all allegations of violations, and above all to commit to protecting every civilian woman, man and child and those hors de combat., VICTOR MADRIGAL-BORLOZ, Chair of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, said since 24 February, the Coordination Committee had been receiving information about the disastrous consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Every day, this information added to a catalogue of grave violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law. Special Procedure mandate holders remained collectively appalled by the aggression by the Russian Federation on the sovereign State of Ukraine that was harming its territorial integrity, and had condemned this aggression in no uncertain terms., The consequences of this military attack on the protection and promotion of human rights in Ukraine would be profound and long-lasting and would cause immense suffering and irreparable harm lasting for generations. The Special Procedures were appalled by the disturbing reports of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law which may amount to war crimes. They also remained profoundly concerned about the safety and protection of everyone in Ukraine and the well-founded fear which now pervaded the daily life of every member of that society. All attacks allegedly targeting civilians were condemned and should stop immediately., The secondary effects of the conflict and displacement on food production, which were forecast to affect the availability of food in Ukraine and also globally, were also a serious concern. With the Russian aggression, all were now facing the risk of imminent famine and starvation in more places around the word. Multiple forms of gender-based violence were being reported such as sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual violence, including conflict-related sexual violence. Women and girls on the move experienced particularly high insecurity and risk of violence, including trafficking in persons. The lives of all people of Ukraine were in danger, including ethnic, national, linguistic and religious minorities. There was serious concern about reports of people of African descent and racial and ethnic minorities being subjected to discriminatory treatment as they fled Ukraine., Mandate holders were also profoundly concerned about the safety of journalists, media workers and associated personnel in Ukraine, who were carrying out their work under unprecedented conditions, and were now at a very high risk. They also noted that the war in Ukraine had further highlighted the risks of the proliferation of disinformation, misinformation, incitement to violence and hatred, and restrictions of lawful speech on digital and social media platforms., The Russian Federation should immediately end its invasion of Ukraine to avoid further bloodshed and loss of life. The Coordination Committee strongly condemned these, and reminded all that intentional attacks against civilians and civilian objects amounted to war crimes. The Coordination Committee urged the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law. All alleged violations must be thoroughly, independently, impartially and effectively investigated with a view to establishing full accountability of all those responsible. Full light should be shed on the suffering of the people in Ukraine and responsibilities identified, and the Coordination Committee supported all the efforts being made to investigate these allegations. The parties should establish a humanitarian ceasefire and there should be meaningful negotiations for peace., ERIK MØSE, Chairperson of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said on 27 April 2022, the Commission had participated at the Security Council's Arria Formula Meeting about accountability for atrocities, to demonstrate in a visible way the Commission's availability to communicate with all stakeholders from the beginning. This week, the Commission had convened in Geneva and held meetings with a large number of Member States, non-governmental organizations based in Ukraine, and Geneva-based non-governmental organizations. It had also solicited the views of the Permanent Mission of Ukraine and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The Commission had sought contact with the Russian Federation and it remained ready to communicate with them. The Commission had exchanged views with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights’ Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights on co-ordination and co-operation within the framework of the mandate given to the Commission by resolution 49/1., The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine was - as stated in its mandate - independent. It did not link to any particular country, party, or entity. The Commission would continue to seek contact with the parties to the conflict, with victims, civil society and other stakeholders. It would be necessary to build upon a broad range of sources that would have to be considered together. The Commission would evaluate the evidence carefully, giving particular weight to primary evidence and seeking corroboration whenever needed. The findings of the Commission, reported to the Human Rights Council, would be based on the independent assessment of the commissioners and their analysis of the information and evidence that came out of their investigations., While not a strictly judicial instance, one of the Commission's tasks was to identify, where possible, individuals and entities responsible for violations or abuses of human rights or of international humanitarian law, or other related crimes. The Commission intended to take a victim-centred approach to make recommendations about the full range of accountability measures., Statement by Country Concerned, Russia was not in the room to take the floor as a country concerned., Ukraine, speaking as a country concerned, said it had been 10 weeks since the Human Rights Council discussed the humanitarian and human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression. It had been 10 weeks of sheer horror and of deep suffering for every Ukrainian family. Thousands of people had lost their lives, more than 200 children among them. Russian bombing and shelling had become part of everyday life. Millions had left their homes, becoming either refugees or internally displaced persons. Cities had been razed to the ground or become unsuitable to live in. Torture, enforced disappearances and sexual violence were among the least of the crimes committed by Russia. Ukrainians had been forcibly relocated to Crimea and imprisoned by Russian forces. People were being killed for their refusal to collaborate with the Russian-appointed administrations in the occupied areas., The Human Rights Council had a moral responsibility to act. In March it had adopted a resolution that passed with a strong majority. In March, all took an important step aimed at ensuring future accountability for criminals guilty of atrocities: now the time had come to take further steps in this direction. The areas that had been under Russian occupation had experienced the most gruesome human rights violations on the European continent in decades. Thousands of innocent civilians had been executed in the presence of their family members, women had been raped in front of their children, children had been raped in front of their parents. All these victims called to the Council to mandate a special investigation of the Commission of Inquiry into these crimes. All Member States should support the resolution that would be presented today., The situation in Crimea was overshadowed by the new wave of military aggression. Ukrainians in Crimea had been conscripted into the Russian army and forced to fight against their Motherland. They had been deprived of their rights, not allowed to use their own language, and their religious institutions had been closed. It was difficult to imagine anything worse than what had happened in now-liberated areas, but the situation in Mariupol was even more disturbing. There should be no doubt that it must be at the top of the Council’s agenda: the city had been turned into dust but refused to surrender. Food security in Ukraine appeared to be another deliberate target of Russia, with the looting of tons of grain; the blockade of shipments from ports and the mining of shipping routes harmed global food security. Over 1.7 billion people could risk poverty and famine as a result of Russia’s full-fledged, unprovoked war against all, and the world needed to stand together in solidarity to defeat this pure evil., Discussion, In the ensuing discussion, some speakers said 77 days had passed since Russia’s unprovoked, unjust and illegal invasion of Ukraine, in clear violation of international law, with indiscriminate shelling and bombing of populated areas, targeting civilian areas, including schools. There had been thousands of civilian casualties and reports of the use of torture and other ill-treatment, arbitrary killings and detention, and sexual and gender-based violence, actions that could amount to war crimes and other crimes under international law. It was imperative that all perpetrators of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law be held to account., Justice for victims was the foundation for future peace and reconciliation and for the prevention of further atrocities. For this, the collection and preservation of evidence was essential. Russia had ignored the calls of the international community, the Human Rights Council and other bodies to cease all aggression and remove its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine. Unfortunately, said some speakers, sanctions had not been enough to stop Russia and there were devastating global consequences, including for food and food security for millions. It was possible that war crimes and crimes against humanity were being perpetrated on a daily basis., Russia’s deceptions, lies and efforts at disinformation were condemned, as were the abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The work of the Independent International Commission on Ukraine was supported. The human rights violations by Russia’s forces were engraved in the memory of all and justified the special session. The suffering of children, the targeting of civilian infrastructure, the torture, the disappearances, the rapes, showed the scale of this war, and the perpetrators must be brought to justice to answer for their acts. Russia must withdraw immediately, fully and unconditionally from Ukrainian territory., Some speakers said there should be the immediate establishment of humanitarian corridors. A food and energy crisis was looming for the world, especially in least developed countries, as Ukrainian farmers could not work their land, and Russia blocked grain ships from the ports. It was the responsibility of the international community, including the Council, to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes at every level were brought to justice. The international community could not look away from the terrible human rights violations carried out in this terrible war of aggression by the Russian Federation., Russia had brutally violated the founding principles of the United Nations, and every day brought reports of more atrocities, with reports of mass transfers of civilians to Russia, and mass graves. This trail of destruction must be brought to an end. Because of the gravity of these acts and the witness accounts, the Human Rights Council must assume its responsibility and investigate all crimes and reports of crimes. All Member States should support the resolution that was being presented today: it was the responsibility of the Council and was a question of the effectiveness and the future of the multilateral system., Faced with Putin’s utter disregard for human rights and human life, some speakers said that the international community must use every appropriate tool to ensure that Russia withdrew its troops and abided by the United Nations Charter. World-wide efforts to stand up for human rights, sovereignty and territorial integrity had become a profound international movement. The Commission of Inquiry would ensure that Russia would not get away with its continued attempts to hide atrocities committed. The human rights abuses and violations must not remain unpunished, and the efforts made to preserve evidence must be supported. States and international organizations had an obligation to ensure that food security, famine and hunger must not be the outcome of this situation of war and the suffering of the Ukrainian people., The deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine was a harrowing case study of how violations against a nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity could only lead to the escalation of violence, destruction, and human rights violations. It was thus vital for all Member States to assert unwavering support towards the international legal obligation of all States to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States. Any effort to undermine these principles, not only undermined the integrity of international law, but also tarnished States’ capacities to ensure the protection of human rights. The international community, therefore, had to move in unison to strengthen respect of these time-honoured principles, as well as provide aid without regard to race, colour, religion or ethnicity., Other speakers said that it was incumbent upon the Council to base its judgements on an impartial assessment of the situation. All parties must take steps to de-escalate the conflict and put human lives first. Measures must be taken to avoid politicisation and exacerbating the debate. It was important for the Council to continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine, and draw attention to the plight of individuals affected, irrespective of geo-political considerations. All parties should jointly support the dialogue and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to bring about peaceful outcomes, fundamentally guaranteeing the rights of the people of Russia and Ukraine, and the international community should support this, rather than laying down obstacles or adding fuel to the fire and escalating tensions., In recent years the politicisation and confrontation in the Human Rights Council had been on the rise, which had impacted credibility and solidarity, and all parties should get back to and abide by the founding principles of the Council, uphold multilateralism, and work to support the cause of human rights. One speaker said that it was worth mentioning that the Council had never taken action in other similar situations. It was a matter of concern that the situation was being used as a bargaining chip in geo-political one-upmanship. Countries and institutions should refrain from a bloc mentality and should not support war, rather search for peaceful compromises. Imposing illegal unilateral coercive measures would only serve to escalate the situation and threaten Russia’s internal security, and the resolution ignored this, making it a failed recipe to address human rights issues in a fair and non-discriminatory manner., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/05/morning-high-commissioner-special-session-human-rights-council, Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

I have the pleasure of being accompanied by the two other members of the Commission, Ms Jasminka Džumhurand and Mr Pablo de Greiff., Let me first give a brief overview of our work so far. The Commission members have had numerous remote meetings including discussions of relevance to the implementation of our mandate. On 27 April 2022, the Commission participated at the Security Council's Arria Formula Meeting about accountability for atrocities. As mentioned there, our purpose was to demonstrate in a visible way the Commission's availability to communicate with all stakeholders from the beginning., This week the Commission convened in Geneva and held meetings with a large number of member states, NGOs based in Ukraine, and Geneva-based NGOs. We have also solicited the views of the Permanent Mission of Ukraine and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine. The Commission has sought contact with the Russian Federation and it remains ready to communicate with them., We have exchanged views with the OHCHR Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and with the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights on co-ordination and co-operation within the framework of the mandate given to us by the resolution 49/1. Given the Mission's presence in Ukraine since 2014, resulting in over 40 reports, we consider this of utmost importance., Considering the large number of entities that are investigating the situation in Ukraine, coordination issues were raised with several of the interlocutors that we met., The Commission is - as stated in its mandate - independent. It has no link to any particular country, party, or entity. The Commission will continue to seek contact with the parties to the conflict, with victims, civil societies and other stakeholders. It will be necessary to build upon a broad range of sources, that will have to be considered together. The Commission will evaluate the evidence carefully, giving particular weight to primary evidence and seeking corroboration whenever needed.

The Commission intends to take a victim-centred approach to make recommendations about the full range of accountability measures., We understand that the budgetary process assigning the resources to the Commission is ongoing. It is important that the Commission is provided with sufficient resources to be able to conduct its activities in full, with the necessary staff and the ability to visit Ukraine and other areas where information and evidence is available., We have noted the draft resolution to be considered today. The Commission will continue implementing its mandate in accordance with the original resolution 49/1, taking into account the seriousness of the allegations that have been reported in relation to the events under consideration by the Human Rights Council at this special session., We would like to use this opportunity to thank the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the support provided in this important process so far.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/34th-special-session-human-rights-council-deteriorating-human-rights-situation
War in Ukraine: No safe harbour,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,12 May 2022,"Just back from Odesa, the World Food Programme’s Head of Emergency Communications Jon Dumont reflects on the consequences of war for the Black Sea port and the countries that depend on its exports., On my first day in Ukraine’s historic Black Sea port city of Odesa, missiles were launched from the Caspian Sea. They flew some 1500 kilometres before blasting through the first and second floors of an apartment building a few blocks from the hotel hosting me and my colleagues from the World Food Programme (WFP). The missile strike was reported to have injured 18 people and killed a grandmother, her daughter, and baby granddaughter. The baby’s father had gone out to buy some milk, only to find three generations of his family wiped out when he returned., Two days later, burnt cars and trees still smouldered, while workers shovelled debris from the gaping hole of the building into piles below. Other crews were already stacking bricks for repairs. I spotted some family photos and a child's toy firetruck in the debris…remnants from ruined lives., Several times during the day, and frequently in the middle of the night, air-raid alarms sound a warning to people to shelter. Odesans, known to be rebellious and curmudgeonly, have begun ignoring the alerts, seemingly in spite., Piles of white sacks block roads and protect buildings near the historic Potemkin steps and by monuments to Pushkin and Catherine the Great. The bags are similar to those used by WFP around the world but, rather than being filled with wheat or beans as the printing on them suggests, they are instead filled with sand. Meanwhile, tons of food are stuck in the port of Odesa. That's the tragic irony of this conflict: Russia and Ukraine supply 30 percent of the world's wheat supply. But due to the military blockade, wheat, corn and sunflower oil overflow silos and ships stuck in Black Sea ports., In the farm fields that have not been turned into battlefields, seeds are being planted for the next harvest which starts in June. But where will it go? If the food currently held in silos in the port of Odesa and others cannot find its way out, Ukrainian farmers won't have a place to store the next harvest. Tons of food will be wasted while millions of people across the world will face starvation. To be precise, 44 million people, according to the latest WFP assessment., Almost a third of the Ukrainian population is now displaced or living as refugees in other countries. WFP has provided food assistance to almost 3.6 million people. The biggest challenge is reaching those who haven't been able to leave besieged or cut-off areas. Many are elderly -- too frail or ill to flee., Ukrainians are not the only ones affected by the conflict. Currently, half of the wheat WFP needs is stuck inside silos and in ships blocked in port, while millions of hungry people in places such as Yemen, Ethiopia, Syria, and Afghanistan are suffering the consequences of the blockade., That's why it is essential that food being produced in the war-torn country can flow freely to the rest of the world before the current global hunger crisis spins out of control. The ripple effects of the conflict on food prices will impact WFP in two ways: It will cost more to buy food and the number of people needing food assistance will increase., At a WFP food distribution site in a church, I met Alexis, a sailor who fled the fighting with his family from Khersen. While waiting to get a WFP box with pasta, canned meat, rice, oil, and salt, he told me how frustrating it was for him to be landlocked, unemployed, and registering for food rations, when he should be out on the seas helping feed the world with food that filled the ships stuck in port just a few kilometres away., There is a saying: ""Ships in harbour are safe...but that's not what ships are built for."" Until the fighting stops there won't be much smooth sailing anywhere in the Black Sea., Jon Dumont is Head of Emergency Communications at the World Food Programme",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-no-safe-harbour

Attacks were also reported in southern, south-eastern and central parts of Ukraine., On 8 May, over 170 civilians were evacuated from Mariupol (Donetska oblast) and surrounding areas as part of the third evacuation operation coordinated by the UN and ICRC., As of 3 May, the International Organization for Migration estimates that slightly over 8 million people have been displaced within Ukraine., On 7 May, the World Food Programme reported that it has supported over 3.4 million people across Ukraine with food and cash assistance since 24 February., As of 6 May, the UN Children’s Fund has supported 1.3 million people with access to safe water., Situation Overview as of 12 p.m. on 11 May, General humanitarian situation. During the past week, eastern parts of Ukraine continued to face the fiercest fighting. On 5 May, airstrikes in Kramatorsk (Donetska oblast) were reported to result in 25 civilian casualties and damages to more than 30 apartment buildings, three educational facilities and one health facility. Just a few days later, on 8 May, a school in Bilohorivka (Luhanska oblast), where an estimated 90 people had been taking shelter, came under attack, reportedly leaving dozens of people dead. UN Assistant Secretary-General and Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine Amin Awad expressed his profound shock at reports of an attack, which, he said, “is yet another stark reminder of the cruelty of this war.” Furthermore, on 10 May, local authorities in Kharkivska oblast reported that 44 bodies of civilians had been found under the rubble of a five-storey building in Izium, which is considered to have been destroyed in March. Eastern Luhanska oblast, which is currently one of the most conflict-affected oblasts in Ukraine, is now reported to be left without water, electricity and gas, as well as with disrupted mobile communications, with scores of homes and multiple civilian casualties reported during the past week. Southern and south-eastern Ukraine also continued to be affected by ground fighting and airstrikes, including one of the largest port cities in the Black Sea basin (Odesa, Odeska oblast), while central parts of Ukraine were targeted by missile attacks., The ongoing fighting largely prevented rescue efforts and evacuation of civilians from hard-hit settlements, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped with little food, water and often without access to essential services and medication. The delivery of humanitarian aid remains exceptionally challenging, with only small levels of assistance being provided in the areas currently affected by active hostilities., Despite enormous challenges, a third evacuation operation coordinated by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from Mariupol (Donetska oblast) and surrounding areas, another Ukrainian port city on the Azov Sea that has so far faced the most severe consequences of the ongoing war, was successfully completed on 8 May. Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Osnat Lubrani confirmed that over 170 civilians from the Azovstal steelworks, where hundreds of civilians had sought shelter, and from areas around Mariupol were evacuated to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east)., This brings the total number of people evacuated from Azovstal to 152 civilians; 100 of them came to Zaporizhzhia with the convoy. In addition, over 500 were evacuated from Mariupol and surrounding areas. . Following the start of the third evacuation operation, Governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine announced that all civilians, including women, children and older people, had been evacuated from the Azovstal plant. The UN, however, does not have the means to verify this information. In the meantime, the UN is committed to further working with parties to the conflict to ensure that those who want to leave have the guarantees to do so safely and in the direction of their choice., While hostilities are currently concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, directly affecting the safety and security of civilians, the mine contamination reported in residential areas in the east, as well as in the north of Ukraine previously affected by active fighting, continues to pose a threat to people’s lives. Even before the start of the war, eastern Ukraine was among the most mind-contaminated regions in the world – ranking fourth in casualties from explosive remnants of war (ERW) and mines, according to Landmine Monitor (2021).On 5 May, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi announced the launch of an International Coordination Centre for Humanitarian Demining. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine, which is to support the new coordination centre, reported that, as of 11 May, it has disposed of more than 102,000 explosive devices, including over 1,900 aerial bombs, since 24 February. At this stage, it remains hard to estimate the extent of mine contamination across Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-12-may-2022
Norwegian support for farmers in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. Norway,"Agriculture
Contributions",12 May 2022,"Food production in Ukraine is essential for the food security of people in a wide range of countries. Norway is increasing its support to Ukrainian farmers in order to facilitate continued agricultural production., 'It is vital to help the country maintain its agricultural output. Ukraine plays a key role in global food supply, and it is critical to keep the agricultural sector going where possible,' said Minister of International Development Anne Beathe Tvinnereim., Ukraine has a population of 40 million, and typically produces enough food for roughly 400 million people. The country produces half the global supply of sunflower oil and is the world's sixth-largest exporter of wheat. Ukraine also exports one-sixth of the world's corn. But now, the war in the country has severely curtailed food production., 'The spring sowing season will soon be over in Ukraine. There is still a small window of opportunity to sow the fields, but fertiliser and seed are both urgently needed,' said Ms Tvinnereim., There are 45 developing countries that import at least a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia, and 18 of these import over half. In addition, food prices have now become a serious problem in many countries. Global food prices had already reached a record high in February 2022, due in part to higher energy costs. Global food prices are expected to rise even more in the time ahead as a result of the war in Ukraine., Norway has therefore decided to allocate NOK 50 million in funding to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to help ensure that essential agricultural inputs reach farmers in time., This support comes in addition to the NOK 2 billion allocated to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and the refugee response in neighbouring countries., 'The scale of humanitarian need is enormous, and Norway has provided food and cash assistance in addition to other support through aid organisations. This is about saving people's lives now,' said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt., 'Maintaining agricultural production in Ukraine is crucial in order to safeguard global food security in both the short and the long term,' said Ms Tvinnereim., The EBRD has been active in Ukraine for many years, and still has personnel in the country despite the war. The EBRD has already taken a number of steps to support Ukraine, including an initiative to match contributions provided by donors. The support provided by Norway will thus trigger a corresponding contribution from the EBRD., 'It is important that aid provided by Norway helps to generate funding from other donors and multilateral institutions. It is through this kind of cooperation that we can achieve maximum results. We must use Norwegian aid wisely and make sure we get the most out of every dollar we spend,' said Ms Tvinnereim., Facts: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Contact: Mari Bangstad, mari.bangstad@mfa.no, mobile: +47 41 44 08 71.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/norwegian-support-farmers-ukraine

An estimated 60 people were believed to have been killed in the attack. The governor of the Luhansk region said that around 90 people – the majority of the village – had been sheltering in the school when a plane dropped a bomb, causing the building to collapse and catch fire., Following visits to the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions during May, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported on the devastating consequences of the conflict for civilians, including the wanton destruction of schools, hospitals, homes and places of worship. The HRMMU recorded that hundreds of educational and medical facilities have been destroyed or damaged. In many areas of Ukraine, both the Ukrainian and Russian armed forces have reportedly used schools as bases and have placed heavy military equipment near them., On 7 May all remaining women, children and elderly civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant, the last Ukrainian military holdout in the city of Mariupol. The city has been besieged for weeks, with direct strikes on homes, schools, healthcare centers and other buildings known to be sheltering civilians. In what may be the single most deadly incident so far, new analysis by the Associated Press estimates that at least 600 people were killed when Russian forces bombed Mariupol’s Drama Theater on 16 March., Since the invasion, the HRMMU has documented over 3,490 civilian deaths while reiterating that the real toll is thousands higher. The Head of the HRMMU, Matilda Bogner, stated that, “the high number of civilian casualties and the extent of destruction and damage to civilian objects strongly suggest violations of the principles governing the conduct of hostilities, namely distinction, including the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, proportionality and precautions.”, Tomorrow, 12 May, the UN Human Rights Council will hold a special session on the situation in Ukraine. At the special session, the Global Centre encourages member states to adopt a resolution that supports and strengthens the work of the previously-established International Independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. The resolution should also emphasize accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in Ukraine., MOUNTING EVIDENCE OF ATROCITIES BY RUSSIAN-LINKED FORCES IN CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, Between 11-12 April at least 10 civilians were killed in the villages of Gordil and Ndah, Central African Republic (CAR), during operations reportedly carried out by the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and Russian-linked forces. Eyewitness accounts reported that about 30 motorcycles were stolen and several houses allegedly burned down during the attack. On 15 April the UN announced it would investigate the incident., Similar attacks have been carried out by Russian-linked forces, alongside FACA troops, for several years. According to a report by Human Rights Watch released on 3 May, Russian-linked forces have summarily executed, tortured, arbitrarily detained and beaten civilians in CAR since 2019. Amongst these forces are a significant number of mercenaries from the Russian private military security company, the Wagner Group, which has a history of perpetrating atrocities in other conflict zones, including Syria and Libya., For nearly two years, the UN has documented systemic and grave human rights and International Humanitarian Law violations allegedly perpetrated by Russian-linked forces during operations and field deployments with near-complete impunity. The documented violations include indiscriminate killings, torture, sexual violence, forced disappearances and widespread looting. The UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in CAR has accused these forces of “systematically hindering the work of [UN] investigators” in areas where alleged crimes have occurred., The lack of accountability for previous crimes has emboldened perpetrators to commit further abuses. According to news sources, Russian-linked forces allegedly stormed a maternity clinic in mid-April, raping two women who had just given birth and a nurse at a maternity clinic located at the Henri Izamo military camp. This was not the first incident of rape by these forces. In October UN experts said they received reports that Wagner Group officers committed rape and sexual violence across the country; however, the number of victims remains unclear “because survivors are terrified to bring their cases to justice for fear of retaliation.”, All perpetrators of atrocities in CAR should be held legally accountable, regardless of their rank, affiliation or nationality. The CAR government, the Special Criminal Court in CAR, or the International Criminal Court, should investigate all credible allegations of abuse by Russia-linked forces. While attempting to combat armed groups, it is imperative that all forces supporting the CAR government uphold their responsibility to protect. CAR authorities should end all relationships with private military and security personnel, particularly the Wagner Group., “HORRIFIC” SURGE IN VIOLENCE THREATENS PEACE IN SOUTH SUDAN, On 25 April the UN Mission in South Sudan condemned the “horrific” surge of violence in Leer county, Unity State, including rapes, gang rapes, beheadings, burning civilians alive and attacks on humanitarians. At least 72 civilians were killed and 64 cases of sexual violence were recorded between 17 February and 7 April in the area., The violence in Unity State is a recent example of the deteriorating security situation in South Sudan. On 28 April the UN Security Council (UNSC)-mandated Panel of Experts monitoring the sanctions regime in South Sudan issued a report alleging that political disputes between signatories to the 2018 peace agreement continue to result in deadly subnational violence and persistent ceasefire violations. The report documented evidence of serious human rights violations and abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence, which has become a “tragic hallmark” of the conflict., Political instability and armed conflict have been pervasive in South Sudan for the majority of its almost 11 years of independence. Delays in implementing the peace agreement and ongoing political rivalries have exacerbated tensions within South Sudan’s ethnically diverse population. According to the Panel of Experts, the “gridlocked” peace agreement has “itself become a lucrative venue for elite power politics” rather than “delivering transformational change to the predatory political system of South Sudan.”, The UN Human Rights Council-mandated Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS) has similarly warned of increased political violence and polarization, leading to fragmentation and increased ethnic divisions, “in which women and girls are acutely at risk of sexual violence.” The CHRSS also cautioned that ongoing arms proliferation has not only fueled cyclic violence and human rights violations and abuses, it has also compromised any prospects of peacebuilding., The UNSC is scheduled to decide this month whether to extend South Sudan’s sanctions regime, including the arms embargo. Given the warnings from multiple UN entities, the UNSC must exert increased diplomatic pressure on all warring parties by maintaining the current arms embargo and extending targeted sanctions against those who continue to threaten peace and security in South Sudan. Parties to the peace agreement must expeditiously implement outstanding provisions, as well as address the root causes of conflict and better manage ethnic diversity in the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-300-ukraine-central-african-republic-and-south-sudan
"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (23 April - 6 May 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2022,"A number of new developments took place during the last two weeks in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Russian forces continued their invasion of Ukraine, inciting anti-war demonstrations across the region. Meanwhile, Russian regional authorities and separatist authorities in Transnistria in Moldova accused Ukraine of firing at their territory. A statement from the Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan regarding Artsakh sparked anti-government demonstrations in Armenia. Demonstrations to mark International Workers’ Day on 1 May were prevalent across the region. Demonstrations against police violence occurred in France and Germany, as French President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected for a new five-year term., In Ukraine, heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine over the past two weeks. During this period, over two-thirds of all political violence in the country was recorded in the eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv.1 The city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region remains under siege, with Ukrainian servicemen and civilians trapped in the Azovstal plant. Russian troops continue their daily bombardment of the plant and reportedly entered the plant on 4 May, instigating heavy battles (The Guardian, 5 May 2022). Russian forces also intensified attempts to advance in the Luhansk region yet failed to capture new territories. In the meantime, following clashes with Russian troops, Ukrainian forces managed to regain control over a dozen settlements in the Kharkiv region. Additionally, Ukrainian forces carried out several successful attacks on Zmiinyi Island, off the southern coast of the country, part of the region of Odesa, killing dozens of Russian soldiers (5 Kanal, 1 May 2022). These trends contribute to the 140% increase in violence in the Odesa region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker, which first warned of increased violence to come in the Odesa region in the past month., Russian missile attacks continued across Ukraine over the past two weeks, often targeting civilian infrastructure and wounding civilians. On 25 April, Russian forces carried out two deadly missile attacks in the Vinnytsia region (24 Channel, 25 April 2022). Russian shelling of frontline locations has resulted in deaths of over a hundred civilians in the last two weeks,2 including 10 people killed during the shelling of a coke plant in Avdiivka in the Donetsk region on 3 May (RFE/RL, 3 May 2022). Additionally, at least five people were killed in landmine explosions in the north and east of the country., Russian forces also continued to shell evacuation routes from occupied territories. After multiple failed attempts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, hundreds of civilians managed to leave the city last week (The Guardian, 5 May 2022). However, despite announcing a ceasefire, Russia opened fire on Ukrainian soldiers who were helping civilians to evacuate (The Times, 7 May 2022). Similarly, Russian forces shelled evacuation buses in the Luhansk and Kharkiv regions; on 4 May, Russian soldiers fired at a column of civilian vehicles evacuating from Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region, killing four people (Suspilne Media, 6 May 2022)., People continue to stage demonstrations in Ukraine against Russian military aggression and demand help from world leaders to evacuate Ukrainian servicemen from Mariupol. In the occupied city of Kherson, Russian forces used tear gas and stun grenades against anti-occupation protesters, with some protesters sustaining severe injuries (24 Channel, 27 April 2022). Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine also took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Germany., In Russia, authorities of the regions bordering Ukraine reported new explosions and shelling incidents in their territory over the past two weeks. They accused Ukrainian forces of attacking Russian border regions while also attributing some of these incidents to the Russian air force carrying out combat tasks across the border with Ukraine (Obozrevatel, 5 May 2022; Novaya Gazeta, 30 April 2022; 2 May 2022). Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi denied the involvement of Ukrainian forces in any operations on Russian territory (Kommersant, 3 May 2022). These trends contribute to the 243% increase in violence in the Belgorod border region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in Belgorod in the past month., Similarly, in Moldova, the Transnistrian region has seen multiple attacks perpetrated by unknown groups over the past two weeks, although they did not lead to casualties or significant damage to property. These attacks included a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attack on the separatist Transnistrian security ministry building in Tiraspol on 25 April, a remote explosion targeting two radio antennas near Maiac on 26 April, and an attack on an ammunition depot in Cobasna on 27 April. Additionally, unidentified groups carried out two drone attacks on former airfields in Tiraspol and Vărăncău. Transnistrian separatist authorities claim that the attacks were perpetrated by individuals coming from Ukraine and demand that the Ukrainian government start an investigation into the attacks (Reuters, 4 May 2022; IPN; 26 April 2022). Ukrainian and Moldovan authorities, however, suggest that pro-Russia groups in the region staged the attacks to incite tensions (RFE/RL, 25 April 2022; RFE/RL, 26 April 2022). On 26 April, the separatist administration introduced a 15-day-long “red terrorism alert,” canceling all public events and limiting the movement of people within and from the region (Zona de Securitate, 27 April 2022). ACLED’s Conflict Change Map first warned of increased violence to come in Moldova in the past month., In Armenia, opposition parties organized around 50 anti-government demonstration events in the past two weeks after Prime Minister Pashinyan claimed that the international community expects Armenia to scale down its demands regarding Artsakh (News Am, 13 April 2022). Members and supporters of Armenian opposition parties took to streets across the country to demand the resignation of the government and warn authorities against concessions to Azerbaijan over Artsakh. Almost half of the events were met with police intervention, with police arresting and sometimes beating participants., Across the region, labor groups organized demonstrations to mark International Workers’ Day on 1 May. Demonstrations were held in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Ukraine, Norway, Serbia, Sweden, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Events turned violent on a number of occasions in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland., Meanwhile, in France, hundreds of people gathered in Paris to demonstrate against police violence last week, after a police officer shot dead two men who tried to escape police control in Paris on 24 April (France Bleu, 4 May 2022). Police officers also staged demonstrations in dozens of locations across the country to demand the presumption of self-defense for officers accused of causing injuries to people while on duty, after their colleague was charged with intentional homicide (RFI, 2 May 2022). Demonstrations against police violence were also recorded in Germany, where a man died after being stopped by police in Mannheim on 2 May. Videos circulating online show an officer hitting the man’s head as he lay on the ground. An investigation into the man’s death is ongoing (DWM, 3 May 2022)., In France, on 24 April, French President Macron was re-elected for a five-year term, defeating far-right National Rally (RN) candidate Marine Le Pen, who conceded defeat but hailed a “shining victory” after garnering an unprecedented 41.55% of the vote (BBC News, 25 April 2022; France 24, 25 April 2022). Following the release of the results in the evening, far-left demonstrations — denouncing both Macron’s re-election, as well as the unprecedented performance of the far-right given the votes received by Le Pen — were recorded in at least a dozen cities. In Paris, Lyon, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, and Caen in Normandie, demonstrators, including anti-fascist and far-left activists, clashed with police forces. While violence in Normandie has not been common, it has become increasingly volatile, resulting in a shift from a place of ‘low risk’ to being considered an area of ‘growing risk’ in the past month by ACLED’s Volatility and Risk Predictability Index. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map first warned of increased violence to come in France in the past month.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-23-april-6-may-2022

Health
Protection and Human Rights",12 May 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, The World Food Programme (WFP) has established a remote food security monitoring system in Ukraine to inform its response. Between 10 March and 12 April 2022, a total of 4,741 respondents were interviewed through a phone survey. This report presents the results of this survey, offering a snapshot in time of household food security. Considering the highly fluid and rapidly developing context in Ukraine, the food security situation is likely to continue to evolve over time. Continuous monitoring will be carried out to capture such changes as the situation unfolds., Nationally, one third of households were found to be food insecure, based on inadequate current food consumption and eroding ability to maintain adequate consumption levels in the future:, One in five of the surveyed households had inadequate food consumption at the time of the survey., When combining this with households’ use of coping strategies such as borrowing money or leaving valuable assets behind when displacing, as well as the reliance on erratic income sources or total income loss, food insecurity estimates rise to approximately one in three., Oblasts in the eastern and southern parts of the country recorded the highest levels of food insecurity, with one in every two households being food insecure., Households that are displaced or those separated from each other were found to be the most impacted, with around one in every two such households food insecure., Households predominantly rely on cash purchases to access food; however, over a third of all respondents reported having no income or depending on assistance as the main source of income., One in four households had to borrow money to cover their essential needs, One in three were forced to abandon valuable assets during their displacement journey., This comes on a backdrop of disrupted supply chains and increasing food prices. Taken together, it suggests the current food insecurity largely arises from a lack of access and purchasing power., Households apply various strategies to cope with a lack of food or money:, Two in every three households reported relying on less preferred and less expensive food, More than one-third reduced portion sizes to stretch out available food, 29% Reported that adults restricted their consumption to allow children to eat., The three most frequently mentioned needs that respondents identified are:, 19% Health and medicine, 19% Safety, 17% Transportation/Fuel, Markets are impacted by the war, and predominantly in the east., In the northern and eastern oblasts, up to a third of people reported that shops in their local markets were partially or fully closed at the time of the survey., More than half of respondents in Kyiv city and the north, east, and south oblasts reported that some products were scarce, mentioning food stuffs such as grains, bread, dairy, and meat., However, evidence from WFP’s work along the food supply chain suggests that after an initial shock, market actors are indeed adapting to the changed circumstances where and to the extent possible, highlighting the need for continued monitoring of market dynamics.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-food-security-report-12-may-2022
Update 75 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (11 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,11 May 2022,"Remote transmission of safeguards data from Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has been fully re-established, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, said today. This resulted from the deployment of new transmission channels based on satellite technologies and of other technical work conducted by the Agency since the visit of safeguards inspectors and technicians to the Chornobyl NPP, 26-27 April 2022. This is the first time that remote data from all sites where such systems are in place in Ukraine, including all nuclear power plants and associated spent fuel storage facilities, has been transferred in full to the IAEA Headquarters since the two months interruption at the Chornobyl NPP., “This is a very important step for the IAEA to continue to implement safeguards in Ukraine,” Director General Grossi said. “However, implementing safeguards also includes in-field verification activities. The situation at Zaporizhzhya NPP continues to be challenging owing to the presence of Russian forces and Rosatom personnel at the site. Although the IAEA continues to adjust its safeguards activities, the situation is unsustainable. I have therefore proposed to lead a visit to Zaporizhzhya NPP, including safeguards inspectors and nuclear safety and security experts, after the necessary consultations and at the earliest possible opportunity,” he added., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four NPPs, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-75-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-11-may-2022
Intense and Lasting Harm: Cluster Munition Attacks in Ukraine [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2022,"End Cluster Munition Attacks in Ukraine, Russia, Ukraine Should Join International Ban Treaty, Russian armed forces have used at least six types of cluster munitions in attacks in Ukraine, and Ukrainian forces also appear to have used them at least once., Cluster munitions spread multiple explosive submunitions or bomblets over a wide area and leave dangerous duds that can kill and maim, like landmines, for years or even decades., Russia and Ukraine should immediately end their use of cluster munitions and both countries should join the international ban treaty., (Geneva, May 12, 2022) – Russian forces have repeatedly used cluster munitions in attacks that killed hundreds of civilians and damaged homes, hospitals and schools since its invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces appear to have used cluster munitions at least once. Both countries should cease their use of this banned weapon and commit to joining the international treaty prohibiting cluster munitions., The 20-page report, “Intense and Lasting Harm: Cluster Munition Attacks in Ukraine,” details how Russian armed forces have used at least six types of cluster munitions in the international armed conflict in Ukraine., “Russian forces’ repeated use of cluster munitions in populated neighborhoods in Ukraine causes immediate and long-term civilian harm and suffering and needs to stop,” said Mary Wareham, arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “Ukraine should also stop using these brutal weapons before more civilians are harmed.”, Human Rights Watch has documented several cluster munition attacks by Russian forces in populated areas in the cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Vuhledar. The exact number of cluster munition attacks in the 2022 conflict is not known, but hundreds have been documented, reported, or alleged., In Mykolaiv, for example, Russian forces launched cluster munition rockets into populated areas on March 7, 11 and 13, killing civilians and damaging homes, businesses and civilian vehicles. One of the March 13 attacks killed nine people who were waiting in line at a cash machine, local media reported., Russia has not denied using cluster munitions. It alleged that Ukrainian forces used cluster munitions in the city of Donetsk on March 14, but this has not been independently confirmed., The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces apparently used Uragan cluster munition rockets in an attack on Husarivka in Kharkiv oblast on March 6 or 7, when the village was under Russian control. Ukraine has not denied using cluster munitions in the current conflict but said that “the Armed Forces of Ukraine strictly adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law.”, Cluster munitions can be fired from the ground by artillery systems like rockets and projectiles or dropped from aircraft. They typically disperse in the air, spreading multiple submunitions or bomblets indiscriminately over an area about the size of a city block. Many fail to explode on initial impact, leaving dangerous duds that can kill and maim, like landmines, for years or even decades unless cleared and destroyed., The cluster munitions currently used in Ukraine are launched from the ground in rockets and missiles with the exception of the RBK-series cluster bomb, which is delivered by aircraft. The cluster munitions were all manufactured in Russia, some as recently as 2021, or in its predecessor state, the Soviet Union., According to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service a total of 98,864 items of unexploded ordnance including submunitions and landmines have been cleared and destroyed in the war, as of May 9. During the first seven weeks of the conflict, 29 workers were reportedly killed while doing demining and related work, and 73 were injured. On April 17, three people working for Kharkiv’s emergency services were killed while clearing cluster munition remnants., Previously, both Ukrainian government forces and Russia-backed armed groups used cluster munitions in eastern Ukraine between July 2014 and February 2015, based on investigations by Human Rights Watch and others., Russia and Ukraine have not joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions – the 2008 treaty banning cluster munitions – which requires destruction of stockpiles, clearance of areas contaminated by explosive cluster munitions remnants, and assistance to victims. The convention has 110 states parties., The convention obligates each state party to make their “best efforts to discourage” the use of cluster munitions. At least 36 countries have condemned the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, including the United Kingdom as the current president of the Convention on Cluster Munitions., Human Rights Watch cofounded and chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition, the global coalition of nongovernmental organizations working to ban cluster munitions. Human Rights Watch will present its report to countries attending intersessional meetings of the convention at the United Nations in Geneva on May 16 and 17., “Most of the world rejected cluster munitions years ago due to their widespread indiscriminate effects and long-lasting dangers,” Wareham said. “Condemning the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine will strengthen the global stigma against these weapons and help ensure that civilians are protected from them in future.”, “Intense and Lasting Harm” will be presented at the intersessional meeting of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which opens at the United Nations in Geneva on May 16.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/intense-and-lasting-harm-cluster-munition-attacks-ukraine-enru
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 10 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,11 May 2022,"Date: 11 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 10 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 7,256 civilian casualties in the country: 3,496 killed and 3,760 injured. This included:, a total of 3,496 killed (1,268 men, 821 women, 76 girls, and 93 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,169 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,760 injured (537 men, 407 women, 87 girls, and 94 boys, as well as 167 children and 2,468 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 3,793 casualties (1,865 killed and 1,928 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 3,216 casualties (1,750 killed and 1,466 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 577 casualties (115 killed and 462 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,463 casualties (1,631 killed and 1,832 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 9 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 10 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 10 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-10-may-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: EU coordinates a convoy of firefighting trucks from Italy to Ukraine,News and Press Release,ECHO,Logistics and Telecommunications,6 May 2022,"Russia’s war in Ukraine has led to the unfathomable destruction of infrastructure and critical equipment. The EU is coordinating and co-financing deliveries of material assistance from Europe to Ukraine, ranging from immediate relief items like medicine and food, to more strategic equipment such as mobile hospitals and fire engines., This week, a large convoy of 45 vehicles is on its way to Ukraine. This crucial firefighting equipment offered by Italy via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism includes 41 trucks, 3 special-use vehicles, and 1 trailer., On 2 May, the fire engines were loaded on trains in Italy, and they have now arrived at the EU’s logistics hub in Slovakia. The cargo was accompanied by 15 Italian firefighters and 3 representatives of the Italian Civil Protection Department, who will hand over the vehicles to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service which urgently needs such equipment., The official handover will be carried out today in the presence of the Italian Ambassador in Slovakia, Ms Catherine Flumiani, the Head of the Representation of the European Commission in Slovakia, Mr Vladimír Šucha, and the Head of the State Fire and Rescue Brigade of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in the Transcarpathian region, Mr Yurii Chopei., This fire engine convoy is part of the largest-ever operation coordinated via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. All EU countries, plus Norway and Turkey have already offered life-saving items to Ukraine via the Mechanism., As the amount of assistance has reached unprecedented levels, the EU has set up logistics hubs in neighbouring countries to facilitate the aid delivery. As of today, over 26,000 tonnes of aid, including medical supplies, mobile hospitals, shelter, ambulances, food and energy equipment has been shipped to Ukraine via the logistics hubs in Poland, Romania and Slovakia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-coordinates-convoy-firefighting-trucks-italy-ukraine
War in Ukraine: A living nightmare for displaced families,News and Press Release,WFP,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",11 May 2022,"Less than three months into the conflict in Ukraine, nearly 14 million people are on the move in the world’s fastest-growing humanitarian crisis. The World Food Programme (WFP) is providing food assistance inside the country through direct food rations and cash assistance, reaching 3.6 million people., 11 May 2022, Reem Nada, POLTAVA, Central Ukraine - When Olexander and Liubov Arseniev’s house came under heavy shelling, they grabbed their two boys and rushed to the basement where they spent the entire night. “We came out of the basement in the morning,” says Liubov. “When we saw what our backyard looked like, what it turned into, we left instantly.”, Many families in Moskovskyi district, in northeast Kharkiv, had already left. The Arsenievs stayed on for 50 days, with no electricity, very little food, and almost no money., “The factory I worked at closed on 24 February, the day war started,” says Olexandr. He has not earned any income since. Liubov, who worked at a nursery school, also lost her income. They had some hope that things would get better, but they never did. They had to leave., “We could only take our documents and very little clothing,” says Liubov. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has seen some of the worst bombardments since the start of the conflict in Ukraine., The family now lives in a student dormitory in Poltava in central Ukraine, where it is relatively safe. In the dorm room are four beds, four chairs, and a few clothes hanging up to dry. About 100 other families live in university housing that has been converted into a shelter for displaced people. The university staff, who volunteered to help, said classes had continued online. But they have no idea when the university or the dormitory will go back to business as usual. Nothing in the country is business as usual., WFP provides a food ration of 17.5 kg for each family member per month. The food – distributed through WFP partner Association Іnternationale de Сoopération Medicine – includes pasta, canned meat, rice, and vegetable oil., Across Ukraine, there are 8 million people who left their houses with next to nothing. Many of them have lost their jobs and their homes. None of them know when they will be able to return to their homes and whether they will still be standing when they get there., WFP has so far reached 3.6 million people across the country through monthly rations - food boxes like those provided to the Arseniev's family - immediate food rations, -daily meals- and cash assistance. This money is given to vulnerable people who can use it to buy what they most need in their local markets., WFP is also distributing wheat flour to bakeries in semi-encircled areas, such as in Kharkiv itself, to ensure these businesses continue to run, to support food systems and to provide food for people in the most hard-hit areas., Food and drinking water are already running out in encircled and semi-encircled cities in east Ukraine. And in some areas, going out to the food store – if it even has any stocks – is an uncalculated risk., “When the war broke out, everything closed, groceries and pharmacies were shut,” says Liubov. “There were a lot of volunteers who brought food for families with children as well as the elderly and people with disabilities.” She says that grocery stores and pharmacies are slowly opening, but they are “half empty.”, But against all odds, the Arseniev children - Egor, 12, and Ilia, 7 - still do their school work. The boys say they miss their home and everything it means to them - their friends, their memories, and their lives. “We left everything and just ran for our lives,” says Liubov., “We know the boys are suffering. They keep asking what is going to happen next, and if we are going to go back home,"" she says. “I’m explaining to them that we should stick together, we will overcome it, and the war will not last forever. Eventually, it will end.”, Liubov says they cannot lie to the children or tell them they know when they will return home. Like millions of Ukrainians, they are living with uncertainty every day. Finally, she adds: “I want this to be just a nightmare. I want to wake up in our home.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-living-nightmare-displaced-families
Rule of Law and Human Rights,News and Press Release,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,11 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, Stronger rule of law institutions and human rights protections are critical for Ukraine’s continued development as an independent, democratic, and prosperous country, pursuing deeper integration with its European neighbors. Progress in these areas is particularly threatened by Russia’s full-scale invasion, which aims to erase three decades of democratic progress and in which members of Russia’s armed forces have committed grave human rights abuses and war crimes, including attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. Human rights abuses have been a significant challenge since 2014, prior to the current phase of the war, most notably due to Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and its support for the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine and have intensified since., USAID support for the rule of law and human rights in Ukraine focuses on increasing judicial independence, accountability, and transparency while responding to the human rights challenges arising from Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine and the attempted annexation of Crimea. The work has promoted an effective, transparent, and independent judiciary, strengthened Ukraine’s efforts to reduce and deter corruption, supported the Government of Ukraine’s “lawfare” against the Russian Federation, and helped ensure justice for conflict‐affected civilians., PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, OUR ACTIVITIES, Justice for All, USAID works closely with Ukrainian counterparts to: (1) strengthen the independence, accountability, and effectiveness of Ukraine’s justice systems and institutions; (2) enhance the accessibility and quality of people-centered justice services; and (3) equip and empower civil society and active citizens to hold the justice system and justice services accountable and advocate for meaningful judicial reform. The Justice for All activity supports a network of seven community justice centers across Ukraine that provide legal aid to internally displaced persons. Under the activity, USAID is supporting Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Office of the Prosecutor General to more effectively respond to legal and human rights issues stemming from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. The activity also includes technical assistance to key Ukrainian rule of law institutions including the Legal Reform Commission under the President of Ukraine, the Ethics Council, the Selection Commission, the Supreme Court, and the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC). This assistance supports capacity building and implementation of key reforms, including Ukraine’s Strategy on the Development of the Justice System and Constitutional Proceedings for 2021 to 2023., Human Rights in Action, USAID promotes stronger human rights protections in Ukraine through a partnership with the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union (the “Helsinki Union”), a coalition of 26 domestic human rights organizations. USAID assistance supports the Helsinki Union’s efforts to strengthen accountability for human rights abuses, crimes against humanity, and war crimes arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including the full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. This work includes: (1) human rights monitoring and advocacy; (2) strategic litigation; (3) awareness raising and citizen empowerment regarding human rights issues; and (4) legal assistance to survivors of torture, war crimes, and conflict through 22 legal aid centers located across the country. The Helsinki Union also partners with the two domestic coalitions, the Ukraine 5AM Coalition, and the Global Initiative “Breaking the Vicious Circle of Russia’s Impunity for Its War Crimes” (Tribunal for Putin) to collect evidence of human rights abuses, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and work with domestic and international institutions to bring the perpetrators to justice. Since 2014, Human Rights in Action has helped Ukraine protect the rights of more than 26,000 conflict-affected persons and train more than 2,000 legal practitioners and human rights activists. It also supported the Government of Ukraine in standardizing documentation of human rights abuses as well as launching both the National Center for Peacebuilding and the Crimea Platform., Countering Trafficking in Persons, USAID is working in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Government of Ukraine, and local civil society organizations (CSOs) to counter trafficking in persons and support a sustainable, nationwide response to the issue. USAID’s work in this area has the following key objectives: 1) promote an effective state-led counter-trafficking response at the national and local levels; 2) enhance efforts to mitigate the risks of trafficking, gender-based violence (GBV), and children’s vulnerability to rights violations, while responding to the increased vulnerabilities caused by Russia’s aggression; and 3) increase access to comprehensive and sustainable assistance as well as economic opportunities for survivors of trafficking and GBV, migrants subject to violence, children with limited access to rights, as well as vulnerable internally-displaced persons and others affected by conflict. Notably, USAID’s efforts to counter trafficking in persons includes funding for the Medical Rehabilitation Center in Kyiv, which treats trafficking and GBV survivors. The center’s operations are critical amid Russia’s full-scale invasion and the trauma it has inflicted on communities near Kyiv. The center can provide housing and care for up to 24 persons at any given time and is staffed by a psychologist, psychotherapist, gynecologist, and nurse., Ukraine Civil Society Sectoral Support, USAID launched the Ukraine Civil Society Sectoral Support activity in 2019 to build the capacity of Ukraine’s civil society organizations and improve the legal environment in which they operate. The activity is implemented by the Initiative Center to Support Social Action (ISAR) Ednannia in consortium with the Ukrainian Center for Independent Political Research (UCIPR), and the Center for Democracy and Rule of Law (CEDEM). Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the activity has provided rapid response grants to nine local CSOs, enabling them to support internally-displaced persons, provide legal assistance to people in need, and raise funds for much-needed food and medicine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rule-law-and-human-rights
Trafficking in Persons,News and Press Release,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,11 May 2022,"THE CHALLENGE, Ukraine has been a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking since the early 1990s. Men, women, and children are trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and begging and sexual and other forms of exploitation. The main countries of destination for trafficked Ukrainians have been the Russian Federation, Poland, and Turkey, as well as internal human trafficking within Ukraine. The problem has been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022., Even before Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was already facing an increase in the scale of human trafficking caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing displacement from conflict-affected eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. The population is extremely vulnerable, an issue severely exacerbated by Russia’s invasion and the need for millions of people to leave their homes for safety in Ukraine and abroad. Fraudulent labor intermediaries/recruiters may take advantage of the war to exploit at-risk people., Prior to Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine(link is external)[1] estimated that more than 300,000 Ukrainians had suffered from human trafficking since 1991. An estimated 46,000 Ukrainians were trafficked during 2019-2021; 29,000 abroad and 17,000 in Ukraine., OUR PROGRAMMING, To fight this form of modern-day slavery, USAID is working in partnership with the IOM, the Government of Ukraine, and local civil society organizations (CSOs) to counter trafficking in persons. USAID’s Countering Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) Activity, implemented by the IOM, works with key stakeholders to increase their capacity to identify, assist, advocate for, and raise awareness about victims of trafficking (VOTs)., Advocacy: USAID, IOM, and our civil society partners are working closely with the Ministry of Social Policy and National Social Service of Ukraine to provide expert analysis and input into Ukraine’s Law on Counter-Trafficking in Persons, the National CTIP Referral Mechanism, and the draft State CTIP Program for 2021-2025. USAID’s partners are actively engaged in advocacy to ensure that policies, regulations, and legislation adhere to the CTIP principles of prevention, protection, and partnership., Awareness Raising: USAID’s partners raise awareness about the risks of trafficking through creative and innovative campaigns at the grassroots and national levels, using peer-to-peer approaches, art, and media. In recent years, USAID-supported outreach efforts have reached an annual audience of more than 15 million Ukrainians. In 2021, the EVEN YOU large-scale national information campaign used metro station billboards to reach an additional 80,000 people with trafficking prevention messages., Prevention: Responding to the prevalence of young adult victims, USAID’s trafficking prevention efforts focus on outreach to younger audiences. USAID continues supporting targeted prevention projects among vulnerable Ukrainians, reaching more than 34,000 people in 17 oblasts with information about safe migration and employment., USAID continues to support a toll-free National Counter-Trafficking and Migrant Advice Hotline 527, which provides advice and referrals to more than 22,000 callers annually. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the hotline played a critical role providing thousands of Ukrainians each week with information about safe migration., Capacity Building: USAID works in 12 regions of Ukraine to build local capacity to implement Ukraine’s National Referral Mechanism. This assistance has helped more than 6,000 representatives of local governments, CSOs, and other stakeholders to learn to identify, refer, and assist VOTs. USAID also supports the 31-member strong Ukrainian NGO Coalition against Human Trafficking to empower it to advocate for improved prevention, prosecution, and protection of VOTs., Reintegration: Since 2004, USAID has assisted more than 6,000 VOTs to reintegrate into their communities and economies. In 2021, USAID directly supported 658 VOTs (of them 203 women and 455 men) with psychological and legal assistance, family support, education, vocational training, and income-generating equipment. Since 2006, almost 600 VOTs have taken advantage of self-employment and micro-enterprise opportunities offered by the CTIP activity. USAID also supports the operation of the Medical Rehabilitation Centre for trafficking survivors, which is a unique facility in Ukraine providing free-of-charge medical and psychological consultations to VOTs and addressing their complex health issues in a safe and confidential manner., Partnerships: New public-private partnerships fostered by IOM strengthened CTIP efforts in the country, empowering former VOTs to start their own businesses and access networking opportunities. USAID bolsters pilot activities focusing on community development and support to returning migrants as a means of targeted prevention at the community level. The main objective of this activity is to support newly amalgamated communities (NACs) formed in the framework of Ukraine’s robust decentralization reforms through hands-on, community-driven development projects aimed at socio-economic revitalization. A total of six NACs received support to build or renovate socially oriented infrastructure such as kindergarten, youth development centers, and community hubs that provide local residents with high-quality services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/trafficking-persons
Civil Society and Media,News and Press Release,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,11 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, Ukraine is home to robust civil society and independent media sectors that actively engage with policymakers and state institutions, provide citizens with information about pressing political and social issues, and empower society to advance reform and solve community problems. The country also has a growing culture of volunteerism, demonstrating the commitment of Ukraine’s citizens to improving conditions in their communities and in the country at large. This work is critical as Ukrainian society resists Russia’s aggression and strives to strengthen its political and rule of law institutions and advance its Euro-Atlantic integration. Civil society organizations (CSOs) advocate for the needs and interests of Ukrainians and empower citizens to become more civically active, while independent media is a critical source of information and a counterweight to pervasive disinformation that aims to undermine public confidence in democratic processes. These sectors have become even more important in the face of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. CSOs are providing critical support to people affected by the war, while independent media outlets are ensuring that Ukrainians and the outside world have accurate information about Russia’s invasion., Despite notable progress, civil society and media organizations often lack the financial sustainability, influence, and training to effectively function at the national and local levels. Due to undeveloped domestic funding sources, these sectors are still largely dependent on international funding. Greater domestic funding would strengthen local ownership and increase public confidence in Ukraine’s civil society and independent media sectors. This is exacerbated by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has increased the need for community-level action while eroding the domestic resource base. To address these challenges, USAID funds activities to promote financial independence, increase organizational capacity and effectiveness, and further empower civil society and independent media to contribute to Ukraine’s independent, democratic, and European future., OBJECTIVES, OUR ACTIVITIES, MEDIA, USAID’s Media Program strengthens the independent media sector’s ability to promote civic engagement and democratic processes by expanding citizens’ access to fact-based information about key social and political issues. Notably, USAID assistance strengthens the public service broadcaster, promotes accountability in the media sector, and helps media outlets create high-quality, fact-based content that educates audiences and contributes to public debate on critical issues. USAID also supports efforts to increase media literacy, including by making it part of the national school curriculum at all levels. This activity largely focuses on eastern and southern Ukraine, which are particularly vulnerable to Kremlin disinformation narratives. This activity has supported Ukraine’s journalists to report from the frontlines of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the activity has provided more than 200 journalists with protective gear such as flak jackets and helmets as well as training on how to report from a conflict environment. During the war, USAID has also provided financing, cybersecurity support, and technical assistance to 66 local media outlets in southern and eastern Ukraine. The assistance includes helping media outlets promote their reporting via Telegram, a key channel for reaching people during the war., TRANSFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS, Russia’s war against Ukraine includes a disinformation campaign aimed at undermining Ukraine’s national unity and commitment to its democratic future. USAID’s Transformation Communications Activity counters Kremlin disinformation narratives through collaboration among government, commercial media, the creative sector, and civil society. The activity helps these Ukrainian actors create and disseminate high-quality, fact-based content targeted to the audiences most vulnerable to disinformation. By addressing social issues and countering disinformation through positive narratives, this activity aims to shift the national conversation away from division and toward optimism about Ukraine’s democratic development and civic equality., CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, USAID supports Ukraine to build a stronger, more people-centered democracy by empowering CSOs and citizens to engage in democratic processes and advocate for policy reforms. USAID’s Enhance Non-Governmental Actors and Grassroots Engagement activity promotes greater civic participation by enhancing civic education, supporting civic initiatives, and building the organizational capacity of CSOs. These efforts advance Ukraine’s democratic development and cultivate grassroots approaches to addressing development challenges., CSO INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT, USAID’s Ukraine Civil Society Sectoral Support Activity strengthens the self-reliance of the civil society sector. Under the activity, USAID builds the organizational capacity of CSOs and activists (including by helping them continue to operate amid Russia’s invasion), supports civil society to advocate for Ukrainian interests abroad, strengthens the legal enabling environment for civil society, and promotes research and learning in the sector. Specific actions to build organizational capacity focus on institutional governance, financial management, strategic and contingency planning, fundraising, and resilience. USAID also promotes advocacy campaigns and legislative initiatives to strengthen civil society. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the activity has provided rapid response grants to nine CSOs and established three regional platforms that allow CSOs to work together to support the Ukrainian people during the war. It has also helped nearly 100 CSOs strengthen their cybersecurity and shift their activities toward meeting the needs of internally displaced persons., YOUTH EMPOWERMENT, Ukraine’s young people have actively supported their communities and wider society amid Russia’s full-scale invasion. Youth engagement also forms an important base for Ukraine to build upon following the war. USAID’s Ukraine National Identity Through Youth (UNITY) activity empowers youth and cultivates a sense of ownership in Ukraine’s independent, democratic, and European future. The activity mobilizes youth leaders to further strengthen a values-based Ukrainian identity grounded in pluralism, equality, and civic engagement.

Sexual violence as weapon of war in Ukraine cannot go unpunished,News and Press Release,Govt. Belgium,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",11 May 2022,"Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, responsible for Foreign and European Affairs, had a meeting today with Nadia Murrad, the Yezidi human rights activist who was awarded the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize along with Dr. Denis Mukwege for her efforts against sexual violence as a weapon of war. During the discussion, Prime Minister De Croo emphasized that the acts of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine cannot go unpunished., Alexander De Croo: ""Sexual violence in conflicts is still widespread. In the war in Ukraine today, too, we see sexual violence being used as a weapon of war. The stories of brutal rapes of Ukrainian women and girls by Russian soldiers are horrifying and sickening. It should be clear to the perpetrators: this sexual violence will not go unpunished. Sexual violence against civilians is a crime against humanity and punishable by the International Criminal Court. It is important that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine collects as much evidence and testimony as possible about the sexual violence so that effective prosecution can take place."", Priority for Belgium, The Women, Peace and Security Agenda is a key priority in Belgian foreign policy. Belgium itself has just adopted a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (2022-26), where one of the six pillars is dedicated to the fight against conflict-related sexual violence to improve the situation of women and girls in (post-)conflict situations., Belgium also continues to systematically put the issue of sexual violence during conflict on the agenda during bilateral meetings and in multilateral forums. Belgium's commitment has also resulted into support for Nadia's Initiative and the Global Survivor's Fund, among others., In addition, Belgium also contributes to the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence during Conflict, Ms. Pramila Patten, and to other UN initiatives such as the UN Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict and the UN Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sexual-violence-weapon-war-ukraine-cannot-go-unpunished

Protection and Human Rights",11 May 2022,"War in Ukraine and its effects on export capacity, fuel and fertilizer shortages, as well as landmine contamination, have ravaged agricultural systems and sent shockwaves through global markets. World food prices reached their highest ever levels in March and could rise by up to 20% this year, pushing up to 13 million more people into hunger., Mike Young, Mercy Corps' Ukraine Response Director, says:, ""The destruction of infrastructure, closed borders with Russia and Belarus, blocked seaports, mass migration, a reduction in purchasing power, mine contamination, and disruption to the agricultural planting season have cut the Ukrainian market in half., ""Every day that fighting continues the humanitarian situation worsens, bringing with it new threats and exacerbating existing ones."", Significant barriers to resumption of farming, Across Ukraine, the prices of seeds, plant protection agents, fertilizers and fuel have increased by an average of 35-45%. According to FEWSNET, agricultural production in Ukraine---both winter and spring crops---could decline by as much as 25-50% or more., In addition to spiking prices of seeds and other agricultural inputs, and limited availability with suppliers closed, farmers face the loss of nursery transplants planted in January and February, and poor access to water supply in areas with no power., Almost a quarter of the Chernihiv oblast population, 17% of Sumy oblast and 9% of Kyiv oblast work in the agricultural sector. Chernihiv and Sumy produce cash-crops, mostly corn and wheat. As of April 20, only 210 sq.km had been cultivated out of a projected 7000 sq.km in Chernihiv oblast, compared to 10,000 sq.km last year., Ukraine still needs to export 20 million tons of last year's crops, with the new winter crop harvesting in June-July. Unable to sell last year's crops, farmers do not have enough financial resources to invest in the new season and replace damaged equipment. Destruction of railways will even further limit export capacity., Mine contamination poses a significant risk to aid and agricultural efforts, Landmine contamination poses a significant risk to delivering humanitarian assistance and resuming agricultural activities. Half the country's territory needs to be demined., Mine-contaminated woodland and pastures may significantly affect the livelihoods of rural communities. Agricultural land is not among the top priorities for demining, so farming activities may be impeded. Farmers may have to finance demining activities on their lands -- funds for which will be unobtainable for many small and medium-sized businesses., *Mercy Corps is on the ground in Ukraine, Romania, and Poland, currently funding local organizations that know their community needs best and providing assistance to Ukrainians inside the country as well as those who have had to cross borders into neighboring countries. Local organizations we're supporting are distributing items like medical supplies and food staples, including into eastern Ukraine. *By the end 2022, Mercy Corps and our partners aim to reach at least 500,000 vulnerable Ukrainians and other people in the region affected by war with life saving humanitarian aid.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/news-alert-conflict-demolishes-ukraine-s-agricultural-infrastructure-ahead-critical
The impact of the Ukraine crisis on the world of work: Initial assessments [EN/RU],Analysis,ILO,"Education

Protection and Human Rights",11 May 2022,"Nearly 5 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine since the start of the Russian aggression, says ILO, Amid the humanitarian crisis sparked by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, labour markets are being disrupted both in the country and in neighbouring states., GENEVA (ILO News) – An estimated 4.8 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine since the start of the Russian aggression, according to a new brief by the International Labour Organization (ILO)., The study estimates that if hostilities were to escalate employment losses would increase to seven million. However, if the fighting was to cease immediately a rapid recovery would be possible, with the return of 3.4 million jobs. This would reduce employment losses to 8.9 per cent, according to the brief, The impact of the Ukraine crisis on the world of work: Initial assessments ., The Ukrainian economy has been severely affected by the Russian aggression. Since it began, on 24 February, more than 5.23 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries. The refugees comprise mainly women, children, and persons over the age of 60. Of the total refugee population, approximately 2.75 million are of working age. Of these, 43.5 per cent, or 1.2 million, were previously working and have lost or left their jobs., In response to this disruption the Government of Ukraine has made considerable efforts to keep the national social protection system operational by guaranteeing the payment of benefits, including to internally displaced persons, through the utilization of digital technologies., Regional and global crisis, The crisis in Ukraine may also create labour disruption in neighbouring countries, mainly Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. If the hostilities continue, Ukrainian refugees would be forced to remain in exile longer, putting further pressure on the labour market and social protection systems in these neighbouring states and increasing unemployment in many of them., The significant economic and employment disruption affecting the Russian Federation are having significant ripple effects on Central Asia, especially countries whose economies depend on remittances from the Russian Federation, such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan., These four states are among the top ten countries of origin for migrants in the Russian Federation, and many of these migrants send a significant share of remittances back to their home countries. If the hostilities and the sanctions against the Russian Federation lead to job losses for migrant workers in the Russian Federation and these migrant workers return to their countries of origin, there will be severe economic losses in Central Asia as a whole., The aggression in Ukraine has also created a shock for the global economy, further complicating the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. This is likely to affect growth in employment and real wages and put additional pressure on social protection systems., In many high-income countries, which have recently witnessed signs of a stronger labour market recovery, the fallout from the Ukraine crisis may worsen labour market conditions and reverse some of the gains made. The situation is particularly hard in low- and middle-income countries, many of which have been unable to fully recover from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Immediate actions In March, the ILO’s Governing Body passed a resolution calling on the Russian Federation to “immediately and unconditionally cease its aggression” against Ukraine. It expressed its grave concern at reports of civilian casualties and attacks on civilian facilities and the severe impact on workers and employers who were risking their lives to continue working., To mitigate the impact of the crisis on the Ukrainian labour market the ILO recommends several immediate measures, including to: Facilitate the initiatives of employers’ and workers’ organizations so they can play an important role in providing humanitarian support and ensuring the continuation of work, where possible. The individual and collective efforts of the social partners can contribute positively to cohesion and foster inclusive economic, social and political development. Provide targeted employment support in the comparatively safe areas of Ukraine, including by building on the continuing government-sponsored programme to relocate workers and enterprises. ILO-supported Local Employment Partnerships (LEPs) can help create job opportunities. Support the social protection system in Ukraine to ensure that it continues to pay benefits, including newly-established cash transfers, to (past and new) beneficiaries. Prepare for a post-conflict reconstruction strategy that encourages the creation of decent and productive jobs through employment-intensive investment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-ukraine-crisis-world-work-initial-assessments-enru

Distinguished Members of the Security Council,
I thank Council members for the opportunity to brief you this morning., I am aware of reports that certain public health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict putting the safety of those facilities at risk., I appeal to all parties in this conflict to ensure the safety of all such facilities in Ukraine., I am aware of media reports regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes. The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes., That is largely thanks to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons. The Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States Parties to the Convention. In addition, the Russian Federation is a Depositary Government under the Convention. All States Parties to the Convention have undertaken “never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain” biological weapons., Biological weapons have been outlawed since the BWC entered into force in 1975. A total of 183 States have now joined the Convention and biological weapons are universally seen as being abhorrent and illegitimate., The BWC lacks a multilateral verification mechanism overseen by an independent organization such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Therefore, assessing compliance with its obligations is a task for its States Parties., Madam President,, Despite the lack of an international verification regime, the Biological Weapons Convention does however contain several measures to which concerned States Parties can have recourse in order to address situations in which States Parties have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers., For example, Article V of the Convention states that ""The States Parties to this Convention undertake to consult one another and to co-operate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of the provisions of, the Convention."", Within the framework of Article V, States Parties have established an annual exchange of information based upon the submission of “confidence-building measures”. States Parties must declare information about relevant facilities and activities on their territory in order to “prevent or reduce the occurrence of ambiguities, doubts and suspicions” between them., The Russian Federation and Ukraine both participate annually in the “confidence-building measures”. The annual reports submitted by the Russian Federation and Ukraine are available to all BWC States Parties for the purposes of transparency and re-assurance., In addition, and also within the framework of Article V of the Convention, States Parties have developed procedures for ""clarifying ambiguous and unresolved matters"", including the possible convening of a ""formal consultative meeting"" to consider such matters., Article VI of the Convention states that “Any State Party to this Convention which finds that any other State Party is acting in breach of obligations deriving from the provisions of the Convention may lodge a complaint with the Security Council”. If agreed by the Security Council, an investigation on the basis of the complaint received could be initiated. Article VI of the Convention has never been activated., While these provisions have not been regularly used, they are nonetheless internationally agreed procedures that are available to be used to defuse tensions and to address and resolve any concerns relating to compliance with obligations under the BWC in a multilateral setting., I would therefore encourage BWC States Parties to consider making use of the available procedures for consultation and cooperation in order to resolve these issues., Madam President,
Distinguished Members of the Security Council,, Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the BWC, to operationalize it and to institutionalize it. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage its States Parties to come to the Convention’s Ninth Review Conference, scheduled to take place in Geneva later in 2022, committed to a serious overhaul of the Convention to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to deal with the challenges ahead., Madam President,
Distinguished Members of the Security Council,, To conclude my statement, I would like to take this opportunity to address the worrying issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. An accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment and all steps must be taken to avoid it. The possibility of an accident caused by failure to a reactor’s power supply or the inability to provide regular maintenance is growing by the day., The forces in effective control of nuclear power plants in Ukraine must ensure their safe and secure operation. I am extremely concerned that four of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) seven pillars for the safe and secure operation of facilities are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya. Communications must be fully restored, and operating staff must be allowed to properly carry out their duties and to do so free of undue pressure., I would like to echo the Secretary-General’s support for IAEA Director-General Grossi’s efforts to develop a framework to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s facilities and welcome the constructive meetings he held in Turkey on 10 March with the foreign ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation.
I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-representative-s-briefing-security-council-threats-international-peace-and-0
Regional Economic Prospects Report (May 2022): The Return of Runaway Prices - Dealing with expensive food and energy,Analysis,EBRD,"Food and Nutrition
Recovery and Reconstruction",10 May 2022,"War to cause Ukraine economy to shrink nearly a third this year - EBRD report, By Vanora Bennett, Russia’s war on Ukraine will cause the latter’s economy to shrink by nearly a third this year, the latest forecast from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development shows., Ukraine’s GDP will suffer negative growth of 30 per cent in 2022, a downward revision of ten percentage points compared to the Bank’s projections released as recently as March., The Russian invasion has brought to an abrupt halt an economic recovery that had begun in that country last year, the EBRD’s Regional Economic Prospects (REP) published today show., GDP growth in Ukraine is forecast to bounce back to 25 per cent next year but this assumes that substantial reconstruction work is by then already underway. How long the hostilities last, the shape of any post-war settlement, the extent of reconstruction and how many refugees return home will also influence the recovery’s speed., With the 3.4 per cent GDP growth recorded in 2021 no more than a distant memory, the war is putting Ukraine’s economy under enormous stress, with the heavy devastation of infrastructure and production capacities., It is estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of businesses have stopped their operations completely, causing about half of all employees to lose their jobs and income. Approximately 10 per cent of the pre-war population has fled Ukraine and an additional 15 per cent are displaced within the country. All this is severely weakening companies’ finances, thus exposing the banking sector to a drastic deterioration of asset quality., To preserve macroeconomic stability, on 24 February, the day of the invasion, the National Bank of Ukraine fixed the exchange rate, limited cash withdrawals and introduced capital controls by preventing most cross-border transactions. However, huge production and logistical disruptions have caused inflation to rise 13.7 per cent year-on-year in March 2022, and it is likely that inflationary pressures will persist throughout the year., Plummeting tax revenues, combined with government spending way above the budget, have opened a fiscal gap of at least US$ 5 billion a month. Yet, because the fiscal gap is accompanied by a substantial external gap as well, it is clear that war bonds purchased by domestic banks and monetary financing of fiscal deficit allowed under Martial Law could plug only a small portion of the gap., In March, the external gap was largely covered by IFI lending, but more sustainable financing predominantly based on grants is needed. Several multi-donor accounts are being created in the IMF, World Bank and European Union. A Multi-Donor Administered Account created in the IMF is intended as a secure vehicle for donors to channel grants and loans for Ukraine. Funds will be used for balance of payments and budgetary needs., The war on Ukraine also raises the spectre of worsening food security globally, because Ukraine is a significant food exporter, accounting for almost 10 per cent of global wheat exports, as well as 14 per cent of corn and 37 per cent of sunflower oil exports., Wheat and sunflower are mostly grown in the south-east of Ukraine, where war damage is the most significant. The Kharkivska, Dnipropetrovska, Khersonska, Zaporizka, Luhanska and Donetska regions together account for 36 per cent of the country’s wheat production and 38 per cent of its sunflower seed output. Corn and soybean production is mostly concentrated in the north-east of the country which has also experienced large-scale war damage. These regions account for 28 per cent of the country’s corn production and 20 per cent of soybean production., Aside from direct war damage, agricultural production is hampered by lack of fuel, access to seeds, fertiliser and equipment. According to estimates of the Food and Agricultural Organization, only 20 per cent of agribusinesses have sufficient fuel to start planting this spring, and around 20 to 30 per cent of agricultural land in Ukraine is expected not be planted or harvested this year.

Syrian Doctors Risking Their Lives to Support Ukrainian Doctors and Patients,News and Press Release,UOSSM,Health,10 May 2022,"Edinburg, TX - UOSSM has been responding to the crisis in Ukraine by providing expertise gained from over 10 years of war in Syria through medical missions and training. On April 2 -12, UOSSM, in partnership with British renowned war doctor, Dr. David Nott of the David Nott Foundation, led a surgical medical mission, providing training workshops to doctors, and critical surgeries to patients affected by the war in Ukraine. Dr. David Nott, Dr. Monzer Yazji, Dr. Ahmad Dbais and Dr. Mohammed Zaidiye all contributed and coordinated in the surgical medical mission., Throughout the 10 days, the medical mission team visited seven major hospitals throughout several geographical locations in eastern, central, and western Ukraine, where complex reconstructive and plastic surgeries were performed on victims of attacks. 40 doctors observed and received trainings during the surgeries. In addition, three workshops were provided to over 37 doctors with different surgical specialties. The workshops taught doctors about damage and impact on the human body from different types of weapons during war, different types of trauma resulting from these weapons, and response handling these injuries including damage control, emergency surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery., A new surgical medical mission: Hostile Environment Surgical Training (HEST), is being planned for early June, where 40 surgeons will be targeted to receive HEST training over five days and will be among several workshops/trainings planned over the next few months., Dr. David Nott wrote on his foundation page about his visit in Ukraine, “Now having seen the devastation, it feels like the exact same tactics as in Syria. When I was in Aleppo in 2016, the whole region was completely and utterly destroyed. What we’re seeing in cities like Mariupol – the destruction – feels very similar to what I witnessed in Aleppo.”, UOSSM Ukraine was established in Ukraine with an office in Lutsk and two medical clinics, one in Lviv and one in Lutsk, providing urgent medical care to displaced Ukrainians and vital trainings to doctors and medical staff., Dr. Monzer Yazji, co-founder of UOSSM USA said, “As Dr. Nott and I were visiting hospitals in Ukraine, we witnessed very similar severe injuries to the ones we witnessed in Syria. It was harrowing to see this type of history repeat itself and victims with the same types of horrible injuries. Our duty is to help the innocent civilians by providing them with urgent medical care, and support doctors by providing medical training on handling war-related injuries that they desperately need. The duty of the international community is to ensure that these types of attacks are never repeated again, anywhere in the world.”, About UOSSM : Since 2012, UOSSM has been providing emergency medical relief and healthcare services to the Syrian people affected by the crisis, working primarily inside Syria and with Syrian refugees in Turkey., In 2021 UOSSM Provided:
– medical services to almost 1.4 million people in Syria and Turkey
– protection services to over 55,000 people
– nutrition services focused on women and children to over 184,000 beneficiaries

After a baseline round of data collection (‘Rapid Needs Assessment’), REACH launched a second round of data collection, focused specifically on conflict-affected areas in the East and South, as well as a selection of IDP-hosting settlements along evacuation routes or in key arrival hubs., Data collection was conducted between April 13th and April 20th through 223 telephone interviews with NGO and local authority key informants (KIs). 44 settlements (towns or villages) were selected for data collection. Settlement selection criteria included being the highest populated settlements within 100 km of conflict lines, along train evacuation routes, or with reported presence of IDPs. Enumerators aimed to interview 5 different KIs per settlement. KI responses were aggregated at settlement level. This brief provides key findings in conflict affected oblasts in the South and East of Ukraine as well as along evacuation routes and in key IDP arrival hubs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-may-2022
Plight of civilians in Ukraine,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,10 May 2022,"Press briefing on Ukraine by Matilda Bogner - Head of UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 24 February, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been documenting violations of international humanitarian law and violations human rights law which have been occurring in the country. Many of these allegations concern violations that may amount to war crimes., Today is the 76th day since the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine. 76 days of destroyed lives, and cities, hospitals, schools and houses., Last week, my colleagues and I visited 14 towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions that were occupied by Russian Armed Forces until the end of March., People told us of relatives, neighbours and friends killed, injured, detained and disappeared. In Makariv, a family of five was shot at by Russian armed forces as they tried to leave with their neighbours by car. Sadly, only two members of the family survived., In the village of Yahidne in Chernihiv region, we met a 70 year-old man who spent 24 days in the basement of a local school. He told us with tears in his eyes that he shared a 76 square meter room with 138 people - the youngest was just two months old. The space was so crowded that he had to sleep standing up and so tied himself to wooden rails so as not to fall down., Another person from Bucha told us that each time he left the house to find food and water, he was not sure whether he would return alive., In Bucha and other settlements to the north of Kyiv that were occupied by Russian armed forces, we have reports of the unlawful killing of over 300 men, women and children. Unfortunately, these numbers will continue to grow as we visit more areas., Overall, to date we have corroborated 7,061 civilian casualties, with 3,381 killed and 3,680 injured across the country since the beginning of the armed attack by the Russian Federation. The actual figures are higher and we are working to corroborate every single incident., Each civilian death is a tragedy. Depending on the circumstances, the death of a single civilian or someone hors de combat may constitute a war crime, as they are protected persons under international humanitarian law. Such killings may also violate the right to life under international human rights law., Let me share a quote of a woman from Yahidne village in Chernihiv region. “We had such a beautiful calm village, everyone planted flowers, our houses were tidy. Now everything is destroyed. Who will rebuild all of this?” she asked us., Schools, hospitals, private houses and multi-storey residential buildings were destroyed in many of the areas that I visited. To date we have recorded hundreds of educational and medical facilities destroyed or damaged in areas affected by hostilities across the country., We note with concern that we have received information that in many areas armed forces – from both sides – have been using schools as their bases and have placed heavy military equipment in the vicinity of schools., Throughout Ukraine, at least 50 Christian, Jewish and Muslim places of worship of different denominations have been damaged as a result of the hostilities. More than half of the buildings have sustained severe damage and cannot be used., The high number of civilian casualties and the extent of destruction and damage to civilian objects strongly suggest violations of the principles governing the conduct of hostilities, namely distinction, including the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks, proportionality and precautions., The right to health has been severely affected across the country. In areas under intense hostilities, we have seen that mortality rates increased because people were not able to access medical care. Often it was too dangerous for people to leave their homes or shelters to seek medical assistance. For example, in Yahidne village, we were told about 10 older people who died in the school basement after spending days or in some cases even weeks unable to leave. Older persons and persons with disabilities are two of the groups that have suffered disproportionately from the effects of the conflict, often depending on others and lacking access to the medication and treatment they need., We continue to receive allegations of rape, including gang rape, attempted rape, forced nudity, threats of sexual violence against civilian women and girls, men and boys. Women and girls are the most frequently cited victims. During my recent visit to towns north of Kyiv, we documented a number of cases of sexual violence. In one town that we visited a woman was raped and killed allegedly by a Russian soldier. The same soldier then attempted to rape her neighbour. This woman’s husband intervened, but was then shot by the soldier. He later died., In general, however, we found that victims of sexual violence and their families and friends are reluctant to speak due to stigma. The wishes of victims, who are usually women and girls, must be respected. Over time the scale of these violations will become clearer., We also spoke to people who are searching to find their relatives and friends. We documented some cases where Russian armed forces had detained civilians, mostly young men, and transferred them to Belarus and then Russia, where they have been held in pre-trial detention centres. Overall, since 24 February, we have documented 204 cases of enforced disappearance (169 men, 34 women, 1 boy), the overwhelming majority of them by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by Ukrainian Armed Forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. We continue to see the publication of videos, which show inhumane treatment, including prisoners from both sides being coerced to make statements, apologies and confessions, and other forms of humiliation. This violates fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. Ukraine and Russia must promptly and effectively investigate all allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war. They must also effectively control and instruct their forces to stop any further violations from occurring., Those in command need to provide clear instructions to combatants to protect civilians and persons hors de combat, clearly prohibiting the killing, ill-treatment, and arbitrary detention of such individuals. They must be ordered to distinguish between civilian and military objects. Those who do not follow such instructions must be immediately removed from active combat and held accountable., The best way to end the violations that we have been documenting will be to end the hostilities. However, while they are ongoing and for as long as they last, parties must in the conduct of operations take constant care to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects and commit to protecting every civilian woman, man and child and those hors de combat that fall under their control.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/plight-civilians-ukraine
Statement: Odesa port strike / global hunger,News and Press Release,Action Against Hunger UK,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",10 May 2022,"Yesterday the Black Sea export port of Odesa was struck by Russian missiles. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the international community to end the blockade of his country’s ports, in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. The Port of Odesa or Odesa Sea Port—located near Odesa—is the largest Ukrainian seaport and one of the largest ports in the Black Sea basin, with a total annual traffic capacity of 40 million tonnes., Reacting to this news, Jean-Michel Grand, CEO of Action Against Hunger has issued the following statement:, “We utterly condemn the bombing of the export port in Odesa. This is a defining moment in the conflict in Ukraine – the port has been blockaded by Russian warships for weeks, but the ultimate destruction of the port will have long-lasting impacts on global food supply. As countries across the world struggle with food shortages, millions of people are facing catastrophic levels of hunger. The destruction of the port of Mariupol will further impact rising food prices, starving the rest of the world of vital food stuffs., Food prices are already at an all-time high, 26 million children are suffering from wasting and the UN is predicting skyrocketing child malnutrition. We cannot sit by and watch as millions of people starve to death., Parties to the conflict must fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and ensure that hunger is not used as a weapon of war. It is our duty to act now – without hesitation- committing urgent funding to stave off the worst effects of the global food crisis.”, Jean-Michel Grand is available for interview., Notes to editors:, Action Against Hunger  is the world’s leading charity in the fight against child hunger, treating more young children for life-threatening hunger than any other charity.

Bunker kits provide lifeline for families sheltering in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",10 May 2022,"Children sheltering for their lives inside bomb shelters in Ukraine are running low on critical supplies and have little opportunity to play, with Save the Children delivering bunker kits to support vulnerable families., The war in Ukraine has killed or injured at least 559 children since 24 February, with many children and parents too scared to go outside in areas with active fighting. More than 11 million people are believed to have fled their homes since the start of the conflict, including more than two-thirds of the country’s children., In parts of Ukraine, thousands of children remain trapped underground in metro stations, school basements and other forms of bunkers while violence, shelling and bombing continue., Save the Children is working with local partner Pomagaem to alleviate supply shortages and ensure children sheltering in bunkers can still be kids. The bunker kits contain toys, games and arts and crafts to promote play and learning. The kits also include mental health activities to help children manage their stress and find ways to communicate how they are feeling., The bunker kits will be delivered with food, blankets, warm clothes, water, medicine and other lifesaving essential goods in areas with active fighting and anticipating violence., Pete Walsh, Save the Children Ukraine Country Director, said:, “Can you imagine being a child trapped in a bunker for weeks at a time while fighting and indirect fire from missiles and artillery continues outside?, “Bunkers offer limited lighting, no outside play areas, little food and water, and poor access to online learning – all of which are essential to a child’s wellbeing. These conditions can lead to significant physical and psychological harm to children., “All children have rights to play, learn and be protected from violence – these rights don’t end just because there is a war. These bunker kits will not replace what childhood should be, but they offer tools for children and their caregivers to maintain their psychological wellbeing under extreme adversity.”, Save the Children is also delivering more than 60,000 trauma kits with partner Crown Agents to the Ministry of Health for distribution to hospitals and other first responders. The trauma kits contain supplies used to control bleeding and treat injuries sustained in emergencies, and include scissors, gauze, tourniquets and other essential first aid items., Children are at greater risk from injuries in conflict zones than adults due to their specific vulnerabilities and need to be treated differently. Children have weaker necks and torsos than adults, and in warzones, head injuries are common in young children, with patients under seven years old twice as likely to present a head injury than those aged over seven., The Ukrainian Ministry of Health has named trauma kits as one of its most critical needs to treat rising numbers of casualties., Save the Children is calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities as the only way to protect children from violence and other violations of their rights. The aid agency condemns attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, and the use of ballistic missiles and other inaccurate explosive weapons, which are causing civilian casualties, and violate international humanitarian law., Save the Children is working through local partners in Ukraine to provide shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychosocial support, baby, and hygiene kits to displaced families. Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families., Note to Editors, For further enquiries please contact:, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/bunker-kits-provide-lifeline-families-sheltering-ukraine
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 9 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,10 May 2022,"Date: 10 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 9 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 7,172 civilian casualties in the country: 3,459 killed and 3,713 injured. This included:, a total of 3,459 killed (1,254 men, 806 women, 76 girls, and 93 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,161 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,713 injured (529 men, 401 women, 85 girls, and 93 boys, as well as 169 children and 2,436 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 3,735 casualties (1,834 killed and 1,901 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 3,170 casualties (1,721 killed and 1,449 injured), On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 565 casualties (113 killed and 452 injured) In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,437 casualties (1,625 killed and 1,812 injured) Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 8 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 9 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 9 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available andnumbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-9-may-2022-enruuk

""Since the beginning of the war, Ukraine and all of Europe are changing their approaches to many processes and structures,” she said. “The format of cooperation in many areas will soon change. Nobody is interested in fighting for the sake of battle without visible results in all spheres – including the environment.”, The environmental consequences of war are often widespread and devastating with cascading effects. The use of explosive ordnance in urban areas, for example, creates vast quantities of debris and rubble, which can cause air, water, and soil pollution. Damage to light industry and environmentally sensitive infrastructure such as water treatment plants and water sanitation utilities could create problems that can take years to remediate. Depleted uranium, a toxic chemical that is hazardous to human and animal life, is often used for tank armor, armor-piercing bullets, and as weights to help balance aircrafts., Background, Four United Nations agencies are implementing the United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP): the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.

Around two-thirds of Ukraine’s children are now displaced, terrified, in shock and desperate for safety., UNICEF is on the ground, providing around 3 million children with a renewed sense of stability through online education, thanks to the Ministry of Education and Science., However, many are struggling, amid the escalating violence and upheaval., In the Vinnytsia apartment where Arseniy and his family currently live after fleeing their home in Kyiv, Arseniy sometimes struggles to concentrate. Space is so limited that Ivanka, his nine-year-old sister, studies on the floor in the hallway., ""It is difficult to concentrate in such conditions,” says Antonina. “Especially when you get disconnected every ten minutes.”, Arseniy has good marks, but he misses home and school desperately., ""I want the war to end and I to return to normal life.”, Ivanka studies online three times a week and also spends time with a private tutor. She was forced to leave her prized school books behind in Kyiv., ""I asked other parents to take photos of their workbooks, process the pages in Photoshop and print them so that my daughter could do homework on them,"" says Antonina., Marianna, who is 10 years old, also fled Kyiv without her workbooks. While she values the classes, she misses her friends, cocoa breaks and her favorite taekwondo and sewing classes., ""The class chat has become a way to send photos of textbook pages,” says Natalia, her mother. “But that is also a good thing – my child has mastered a simple photo editor and writes answers for maths in Paint.”, Six-year-old Myroslava, who is also displaced in Vinnytsia, now attends an online kindergarten., The kindergarten, launched by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and Science in cooperation with the Ptashenya Children's Space and with the support of MEGOGO, offers leisure activities, educational and developmental videos and, crucially, a sense of normality., ""This is great Ukrainian content — educational, entertaining,” says Myroslava’s mother, Natalia. “Myroslava willingly listened to the fairy tale, learned about space and performed tasks.”, The online kindergarten is part of the NUMO preschool project. Videos are available through the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, UNICEF, MEGOGO, YouTube Kids and other platforms. The latest episodes have received over 450,000 views., UNICEF and its partners are doing everything possible to scale up life-saving programmes for children, including facilitating access to temporary learning. Over the past week, 1,380 recreation kits, 376 school-in-a-box kits and 54 early childhood development (ECD) kits have been delivered to areas with large concentrations of displaced families, including the Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk and Zakarpattia regions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/online-learning-helps-ukraine-s-children-stay-school-enuk
Eurojust: Council adopts its mandate on new rules allowing the agency to preserve evidence of war crimes [EN/RU],News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,6 May 2022,"Today the Permanent representatives to the EU adopted a mandate on new rules to allow Eurojust to preserve, analyse and store evidence relating to core international crimes, such as war crimes., Following Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, there is a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been and are being committed in Ukraine. The EU will take, as a matter of urgency, all necessary measures to ensure that those who committed those crimes in Ukraine are held accountable., Prosecution services at the International Criminal Court and in several member states, as well as in Ukraine, have started investigations concerning these events. Coordination and exchange of evidence between prosecuting authorities in different jurisdictions is important to ensure the effectiveness of these investigations. In addition, due to the ongoing hostilities there is a risk that evidence related to war crimes cannot be safely stored on the territory of Ukraine and therefore it is appropriate to establish a central storage at a safe place., The draft new rules will allow Eurojust to:, store and preserve evidence related to war crimes, including satellite images, photographs, videos, audio recordings, DNA profiles and fingerprints process and analyse this evidence, in close cooperation with Europol, and share it with the relevant national and international authorities, including the International Criminal Court Next steps On the basis of this position, an agreement will now need to be reached with the European Parliament so that this regulation can be adopted and enter into force as soon as possible., Background, At the beginning of March, all EU member states, together with other partner states, decided to collectively refer the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 4 March, ministers encouraged Eurojust to fully exercise its coordinating role and to make itself available as required to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court., Apart from the investigation by the ICC prosecutor, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine has opened an investigation, and the authorities of several member states have opened national investigations. A Joint Investigation Team has also been established by the judicial authorities of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, with the support of Eurojust and the participation of the office of the prosecutor of the ICC., A number of other initiatives to support the collection of evidence of possible war crimes have been developed, including financial and operational support for the ICC and various types of support for the Ukrainian authorities., In its conclusions of 24-25 March, the European Council reiterated that Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians. Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects, including hospitals, medical facilities, schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately. Those responsible, and their accomplices, will be held to account in accordance with international law.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eurojust-council-adopts-its-mandate-new-rules-allowing-agency-preserve-evidence-war

Shelter and Non-Food Items",9 May 2022,"CHERNIVTSI/LUTSK, Ukraine -- They are called ""crisis rooms"": temporary accommodation for women and their children, with a kitchen, furniture, utensils and food, operated by local social welfare centres. This network of safe spaces was created to help women escaping domestic violence, offering a place to live in safety and dignity. Today, these crisis rooms are filled with women and children escaping a different kind of violence -- that of war., Over the past two months, millions of Ukrainian women with children have been forced to flee as bullets and bombs rained on their communities. Often, they left with few belongings and no clear plan for reaching safety. With their towns turned into battlefields, the most vulnerable people -- single mothers, women with infants, women with disabilities and elderly women -- faced some of the greatest risks., Olena, 39, is one such single mother. She was living in the city of Severodonetsk (Luhansk region), in a mother and child centre, when the shelling began. ""At first the explosions weren't heavy, but within a week the walls began to shake."" Whenever she heard the blasts of artillery, she ran with her baby boy to the basement or took shelter in a hallway, as recommended by the government., Many Ukrainian women and children rushed to flee the country, but Olena says, ""I did not manage to get my new passport."", They lost water, gas and electricity after the shelling began. With no way to bathe or cook, Olena knew it was time to leave. She secured a seat on an evacuation bus to Sloviansk, but en route, the bus broke down. The women riding in it had to push it along the road. Still, Olena considers herself lucky. ""My friends told me that after I left, sheer terror began in Severodonetsk. The houses were literally razed to the ground."", She left Sloviansk by evacuation train to Lviv, a trip that lasted a day and a half. She ended up in a crisis room in Chernivtsi. Finally, she says, she feels she and her son have a safe place to call home., Hope for a new life, The crisis rooms were created last year in Lutsk, Ternopil and Chernivtsi with support from the UNFPA Equality Springboard Project and funding from the Government of Sweden., Olga, 26, is a single mother with two boys, one aged 4 and one 7 months old. She had been living in Mykulychi Village, Kyiv region, when the tanks rolled in. ""We were scared. Shots were heard from time to time on the street,"" she described. ""We immediately hid in the cellar."", She evacuated, along with other women, to Vyshneve, where they slept on the floor of a temporary shelter until a priest connected her with a local social welfare centre in Lutsk. Now, at the crisis room, she is able to give some sense of normality to her children., ""We get much help here with everything we need... The apartment where we live has a kitchen and utensils. Finally, I feel safe with my children,"" Olga said., She has been at the crisis room for three weeks. About two weeks ago, she learned that her father had been killed. Now, she says, the thought of ever returning to Mykulychi is simply too painful. She wants to stay and build a life in Lutsk., ""I took a course in manicure and nail design, so now I can earn a living for myself and my children,"" she said., Preparing for more violence, The crisis rooms offer a critical resource to women in need. But what about those they were originally intended for -- survivors of intimate partner and domestic violence?, The shelters remain open to them, said Victoria Yalovska, a legal and social services expert working with UNFPA. Ms. Yalovska, who has been helping domestic violence survivors for more than 25 years, says that specialists and programmes continue to operate, but under constraints. Many support personnel have themselves been forced to flee, for example., Still, she said, “no shelter, no crisis room is closed… Those who remain are on duty around the clock.”, She and her colleagues are concerned women are facing barriers to reporting domestic violence. “We are currently unable to analyze appeals to the police on these issues… The police were those who had to stop the violence and redirect the woman to an asylum [site] with a hidden address.” Today, she said, police are focused on war-related security needs, even though “the experience of other countries shows that amid the war and post-war times, the issue of domestic violence and violence against children is as relevant as ever.”, UNFPA is working with local partners to anticipate the future needs of women who may experience physical or sexual violence, whether in a domestic setting or as a result of conflict conditions. UNFPA has recently launched mobile teams that include psychologists, social workers and others who can visit women and families in their homes to provide critical services., “We are now working ahead of a curve,” Ms. Yalovska said., – Olena laba",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-rooms-created-survivors-domestic-violence-now-house-survivors-war

While 30 people have been rescued, grave fears remain for the 60 people reported to remain trapped under the rubble., Pete Walsh, Save the Children Country Director, said:, ""This news is absolutely horrifying. Protecting schools and other civilian infrastructure must be a priority -- they should be respected as inviolable safe spaces for children and educational staff., *""It is not yet clear how many children may have been killed or injured in this latest bombing. **However, all children must be protected from the horrors of this war. *More than 200 innocent children have already lost their lives since this conflict escalated two months ago, showing once again that children are paying the heaviest price of this war., ""As fighting continues to intensify, the most vulnerable families and their children are being forced to shelter in bunkers and basements. It is difficult to imagine the fear experienced by a child trapped in a bunker, while shelling and gunfire rages above them., ""Save the Children once again calls for hostilities to cease and for civilians to be protected, in accordance with international humanitarian law. Education is a fundamental human right that is crucial to allow children to fulfil their full potential. We must stop this war on children, their schools and their future."", According to government authorities, 126 education institutions have been destroyed and 1,509 damaged in Ukraine since on 24 February., With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychosocial support, baby, and hygiene kits to displaced families.

Executive summary, Since the recent escalation of the conflict in Ukraine (24 February 2022), neighbouring countries have seen the massive displacement of over five million refugees - mostly women, children, and the elderly., Local government, organisations, volunteers, and communities continue to support people fleeing the conflict, but the resources to continue are becoming strained., Poland is receiving most of the refugees from Ukraine; currently over three million refugees have entered Poland (UNHCR, 29 April). It is estimated that 50% have moved on to other parts of Europe, but a large caseload of refugees will stay in Poland due to the proximity to Ukraine, existing Ukrainian community (more than one million were already in Poland) and possibilities to connect with family members who are still in Ukraine, or until they can eventually return home. Moreover, a significant number of Ukrainian refugees are staying near the border to be close to friends, family, and property, or because of a lack of options/plans for relocating elsewhere., The main findings and recommendations in this report are based on NRC’s visits to border areas in April 2022. The commendable response at the border points and transit sites is being led by local municipalities and volunteers, however, these networks and resources are becoming strained and additional support is required to ensure these sites meet and maintain protection and safeguarding standards. NRC’s findings echo those in recent assessments by other actors, namely, the need to strengthen service provision and capacities of sites to be protection sensitive. However, the findings in this report place greater emphasis on strengthening protection and other services in transit sites close to and on main border crossings, to reach and respond to the greatest number of refugees., Key findings, • Not all refugees who cross the border pass through the transit sites and reception centres where services are available, • Medyka border crossing has the highest number of refugees in transit but the least developed infrastructure, • Provision of information on access to services, legal information and counselling, and capacities for safe identification and referral are limited at border points and transit sites",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rapid-assessment-selection-transit-centres-south-eastern-poland-ukraine-border

Between 29 April and 3 May, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted the fourth round of a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro regions (West, East, North, Centre, South and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random-digit-dial (RDD) approach, and 2,000 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed.

Ukraine Crisis: Making Connections Wherever You Are,News and Press Release,Medair,Health,9 May 2022,"Lucy Bamforth, Providing mental health and psychosocial support in Ukraine and Poland, In a moment, everything can change., Families in Ukraine and in many other parts of the world where we work know this all too well. One day, life is as it always has been. The next, you and your family may have lost everything in a natural disaster, or are on the run as conflict engulfs your community. You may find yourselves displaced in a camp or community shelter. Your children might be asking you when you’ll go home, or when they can go back to school. Life can become unimaginably stressful., Providing mental health and psychosocial support to people affected by emergencies like the one unfolding in Ukraine is critical. Mental health interventions can help people affected by disasters to identify ways to manage stress and cope with the new reality of their everyday lives. That’s why the provision of mental health and psychosocial support services is one of our key areas in our response to the crisis in Ukraine., In Ukraine, we've partnered with Trauma Support Ukraine (TSU), a collaboration between three organisations: Trauma Company, Sounds of Change, and Safe & Sound. These organisations have over a decade of experience in providing long-term and specialised training in trauma-sensitive support in acute crisis situations. Working with TSU, we're providing weekly focus groups and professional development webinars to psychologists and mental health professionals inside Ukraine., By providing support directly to psychologists, we're able to ensure that trauma-informed support is still available to people despite the ongoing crisis -- and, more importantly, is available through psychologists who want to continue working, who speak Ukrainian and know the culture, and who understand what their clients are experiencing. Once a month, support is given directly to the psychologists themselves., Each training is delivered online, using platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp to connect with psychologists across Ukraine., ""Being online means we can be flexible in our way of connecting. The psychologists we are supporting, they can connect wherever they are - in a shelter, in a house, on their way to a neighbouring country. It's such a good way of connecting and sharing knowledge,"" says Anne van den Ouwelant, a specialist in trauma psychology and a founder member and trainer with Trauma Company. ""They always come with specific questions - things like, 'When the sirens go off, children start vomiting. What should we do?' or, 'Should we try talking to children about the conflict? How would we do that?'"", The training, says Anne, is delivered in a way to makes the information easy to remember and easy to use., ""When we give them knowledge and information, we do it in a very practical and easy-to-remember way, because concentration capacities often suffer under tension and in very stressful situations. We give them short pieces of information and we give them a lot of techniques that they can use right away - both for themselves and with the people they serve."", Those techniques include things like tapping, strong breathing techniques, and imagination exercises, as well as music, art, and movement activities to help people cope with overwhelming emotions and physical sensations, strengthen their resilience, give them a sense of control, and prevent as much as possible the development of trauma-related symptoms., ""In cases where the acute traumatic situation continues for weeks, we have to create moments in which the alarm bell is not ringing - however small those moments are,"" says Anne. to help keep clients grounded and calm even as things around them continue to change., ""The great thing about being able to work online,"" she adds, ""is that we can easily reach many people. Right now, we are reaching 150 psychologists. Let's say each one has five clients. So, 125 times five - that's a big reach."", Our teams are busy in Poland as well, providing Psychological First Aid training to volunteers who are directly supporting refugees from Ukraine, and ensuring that volunteers are aware of their own mental health as well., “In crises like this, we tend to underestimate our own needs and compare ourselves to others,” says Riёt Kroeze, Medair Senior Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Advisor. “But mental health and psychosocial support must also be available for volunteers, for people hosting newcomers, and for anyone working on this response.”, “That’s why we’re dedicated to ensuring that psychologists have access to mental health support, supervision and training, and that volunteers have the skills needed to manage their own mental health as well as provide that basic psychosocial support to others as well.”, In addition to mental health and psychosocial support, Medair’s Global Emergency Response Team is working in Poland and Ukraine to address gaps in primary health care, and support relief efforts by supporting and sustaining volunteer organisations. We also hope to provide repairs to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, water systems, and collective shelters.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-making-connections-wherever-you-are

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 May 2022,"Overview of the Data Landscape, Key Takeaways*, The overall information landscape for the Ukraine crisis is challenging, with massive population movements both internally and to neighbouring countries. There is a clear lack of current data on the number of people in need, the severity of those needs and the living conditions of both those displaced and those in conflict-affected areas. However, it should be noted that Ukrainian local authorities are likely to have a much clearer picture of the situation in their areas of jurisdiction., Definitive demographics figures, disaggregated per age and gender are missing for all affected groups, with continued displacement, returns and a lack of adequate central registration systems, although in some countries, more detailed refugee data is provided by local authorities. Estimates that are available provide IDPs by macro-region, and origin of displacement, along with pre-conflict population data, is used to calculate those remaining in conflict-affected areas. Information on the number of refugees who have moved on to other countries is also patchy., Assessments and reports have been limited to either the country/macro region level, or to specific locations. This provides a broad overview of the needs of affected groups, or some local indicative findings. However, the scale and severity of needs per sector are not specified. In addition, information on the numbers and needs of people displaced (or forcibly moved) to the Russian Republic is missing., Information on the overall humanitarian conditions of the populations remains insufficient. Assessments provide a good understanding of the impacts on facilities in Ukraine (mainly health structures and schools), and data such as those without access to electricity or gas. Data on damage to other infrastructure (railways, airports, bridges etc.) is widely reported in local press and ISW updates, but an overall central database is not available. Although there is some idea of the prevalence of vulnerable groups within the affected populations, critical data such as the number of people with chronic diseases that lack access to health, IDPs with no income sources, the use of negative coping mechanisms or children unable to access remote schooling are not available.
Protection risks are also highlighted for all populations’ groups and with specific risks highlighted for those living in conflict-affected areas and a somewhat different set of risks for displaced people.
However, the number of those at risk, or those without access to services is hard to verify., Within Ukraine, operational and security challenges are limiting humanitarian actors’ capacity to conduct assessments. Remote assessments are implemented but telecommunication is restricted in some areas, posing further issues. The large and continuing displacement restricts the ability to understand their rapidly changing needs.

WHO continues to call on the Russian Federation to stop the war.”, “As we work on the immediate response, WHO is here to support Ukraine’s recovery, continue its halted health reforms and ensure that the health system comes out of the war stronger than ever,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine., “I am deeply impressed and grateful to our doctors for their heroism, which they show every day, saving the lives of Ukrainians under fire.

We are in touch with the regional office almost around the clock. But as the Minister of Health of Ukraine, I have asked and will ask you to reconsider the termination of the Russian Federation's membership in the WHO Executive Committee and the transfer of the regional office for noncommunicable diseases from Moscow to Kyiv.

On 23 February, their final lesson was a history class. The next day, the 14-year-old boys woke up not to their alarm clock, but to the sound of explosions., Now, the walls of their school – once a grand three-storey building with the motto “Success in learning – success in life” inscribed above the entrance – are black from explosions.

Protection and Human Rights",7 May 2022,"Your Excellency Mr Viktor Liashko,, Members of the media,, Good evening, and thank you all for joining us this evening., I have spent the last two days in Ukraine and have been deeply moved by what I have seen and what I have heard., I have also had the honour of meeting with Prime Minister Schmyhal, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dzhaparova, and others., We discussed the health situation in Ukraine, and how WHO can best support the Ministry of Health to deliver care in conflict areas, as well as to sustain care for those who need it throughout Ukraine., My time here has affected me very personally. As someone – myself, who grew up in a warzone myself, I understand only too well how the people of Ukraine feel – the worry for family and friends, the fear, the sense of loss and so on., Because I know the impact, I know the devastation of war firsthand. And I felt very, very sad when Russia invaded Ukraine because I know its impact and devastation., However, I have seen extraordinary resilience – people who have suffered loss and destruction but have not given up., They have kept going, repairing essential services to stop that destruction making a deeper hole in their lives., I have seen the damage inflicted on health structures, and listened to accounts of the harm – physical and mental – inflicted on health workers., These are people whose primary motivation is to protect health and life., WHO has now verified 200 attacks on health care in Ukraine since the war began. These attacks must stop. Healthcare is never a target., While I saw and learned of great suffering, I also saw bravery, humour, kindness and heard stories of spontaneous, often ingenious ways people have found to help and protect one another., Some of those I am talking about are our own WHO staff, who, although they have lost their homes, fear for their families, deal with daily uncertainty, and have kept working to support the health needs of the people of Ukraine., Our team in Ukraine was working hard to support the country to build an ever-stronger health system before the war. And that work will continue., Since Russia invaded Ukraine, WHO has delivered trauma and emergency supplies for use in over 15,000 surgeries and enough medicines and healthcare equipment to serve 650,000 people., We have also provided 15 diesel generators to provide electricity to hospitals and health facilities – some in the newly accessible areas in Kyiv Oblast which I just visited this afternoon and we are handing over 20 ambulances tomorrow., WHO has also supported or coordinated more than 50 Emergency Medical Teams in Ukraine and neighbouring countries hosting refugees, and in past months we have trained thousands of Ukrainian healthcare providers on how to handle mass casualties., This includes training on hospital blood transfusions in conflict settings, traumatic limb injuries, emergency nursing care, and essential burns care., We have also established three health hubs in western Ukraine to support medical evacuations, and ensured safe medical evacuation of patients, including those suffering from cancer, for treatment outside Ukraine., These are just a few examples of the work we are doing., I have been very moved by the resilience of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of Ukraine’s health workers, the dedication of our own WHO staff, and the commitment of the Ministry of Health under the Minister’s leadership and the Government of Ukraine to protecting health in these terrible circumstances., My message to all the people of Ukraine, is that WHO stands with you. We will do everything we can to support the Government in its efforts to treat the injured, maintain health services, and to repair and strengthen Ukraine’s health system., But there is one medicine that WHO cannot deliver, and which Ukraine needs more than any other, and that is peace., So we continue to call on the Russian Federation to stop this war., Thank you.

Protection and Human Rights",7 May 2022,"Highlights, WFP reached nearly 3.46 million displaced and conflict-affected people with food and cash throughout Ukraine., WFP and the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding to scale up cash transfers to half a million people across the country., WFP’s Ukraine emergency response is currently funded at 51 percent. Timely funding is urgently needed to avoid immediate pipeline breaks., Situation Update, Preliminary results from WFP’s latest food security assessment show that over one third of Ukraine’s population is food insecure, resulting from inadequate food consumption, harmful coping strategies and income losses.
The ongoing conflict continues to reduce access to food and markets throughout the country, particularly in southern and eastern parts. Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine registered the highest prevalence of food insecurity., Over a third of all respondents reported that they had no income, or that they relied on assistance as their main source of income. Moreover, more than two-thirds of households relied at least once in the previous week of the assessment on consumption-based coping strategies to cope with food shortages. On average, one in two families were eating less preferred food daily. One in five households, on almost a daily basis, were reducing meal portion, the number of meals eaten, or restricting adult consumption so children can eat.
The use of these coping strategies is more prevalent in the eastern, southern and northern areas of the country.
Furthermore, one in four of the households reported having to borrow to cover their essential needs., Oblasts receiving internally displaced people (IDPs) were increasingly recording acute food needs. Almost one third of IDPs had to abandon their valuable assets as a result of displacement.
Supply chain disruption, induced by ongoing fighting, has reduced the availability of food and rendered market functioning unpredictable. Prior to the conflict, 98 percent of grain exports from Ukraine were transported via the Black Sea. Alternative export routes have insufficient infrastructure to be an immediately viable replacement., WFP continues to appeal to all parties to allow food exports from seaports, which is necessary to move food in and out of the country, increase food access, while also maintaining Ukraine’s economy and people’s livelihoods. In addition to disrupting food access inside Ukraine, the conflict also curbs food availability, impacting millions of acutely food-insecure people worldwide.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-situation-report-16-7-may-2022

A total of 268,417 children have also benefited from learning interventions with supplies provided by UNICEF and 158,824 children have been engaged in formal or nonformal education since 24 February., • As of 20 April, UNICEF has provided assistance to over 9,000 people evacuated from Mariupol and frontline locations, including 115 people (40 children) evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant on 3 May; the evacuees have been provided with over 30,000 litres of water, 5 metric tons of medical supplies, 1,200 hygiene kits, recreational items, emergency food for children, counselling, and psychosocial support activities., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, The war in Ukraine continues to have unprecedented impacts on the lives of families and children. Since 24 February, at least 227 children have been killed and 322 have been injured.2 The situation is particularly dire in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine where active fighting and attacks continue adversely impacting the civilian population and civilian infrastructure. Also, sporadic/occasional strikes have been reported in western Ukraine. Of special concern is the situation in Mariupol where joint efforts between the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have allowed successful evacuations of civilians. Nevertheless, many more remain in the cut-off city, living in extremely precarious conditions. Schools and kindergartens, which should provide a safe space for children, have not been spared from the destruction. At least one in every six UNICEF-supported schools in eastern Ukraine has been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war., As revealed by the latest Rapid Gender Analysis, the multisectoral impact of the crisis in Ukraine is affecting women disproportionally. Women constitute the majority of those displaced and face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict-related sexual violence, are reportedly increasing, but services for survivors are not provided in full. Protection, physical health, mental health care, and safe shelter have been identified as priority needs for women interviewed by the study.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-11-27-april-3-may-2022
"Statement of ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, at the Arria-Formula meeting of the UN Security Council on “Ensuring accountability for atrocities committed in Ukraine” [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,ICC,Protection and Human Rights,27 Apr 2022,"First, I would like to start by thanking the permanent missions of Albania and the Republic of France for convening this session. And it's a real honour, albeit in desperately sad circumstances, to share this platform with the very distinguished panelists and all of the Ambassadors and ministers in the room today., We are by any metric in a time of massive uncertainty; massive uncertainty for the people of Ukraine. Massive uncertainty for the people in the region. And I think it's not hyperbole to say the world is holding its breath. What direction are we going in? Are we heading towards peace or more violence, more tears and more suffering? It is a moment the events, particularly since the 24th of February, I think, some have thought, well, what's the point of international law? What's the point of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or the “Court)? What's the point of all these conventions, all these conferences that many in this room have attended and taken part in, the wonderful drafting, the high, lofty ideals of the preambles? What's the point of it all when people are suffering in so many parts of the world?, And yet, in that moment of otherwise despair, I think something unique is happening. It is a dawning realization that the rule of law is not a passive spectator, but as an intrinsic part, an intrinsic buckle to keep us together., 43 states have referred to the Situation in Ukraine to the ICC. And that's the first time such a number have done such a thing. I think it is really important to realize, and I think, we're seeing it, the young green springs of hope in the wasteland that we otherwise survey, that the law is more relevant now than ever., Not only to stop us drifting further apart, but to prevent us colliding with more brutality against one another. I've stated repeatedly since my first statement when I was in Cox's Bazar on the 25th of February, that the law applies equally to all sides, all parties to the conflict, whether Ukraine or the Russian Federation, whether the state actors or non-state actors, have certain clear obligations., We heard from the High Commissioner for Human Rights about the principles of proportionality, the principles of distinction, the types of weapons, munitions and events that are in the public space of discussion. This is nothing new. This has been known since Nuremberg. This has been known for a long time. The issue is not a misunderstanding or confusion about the law. It is a greater or acute realization that the law has to be applied if we are to continue going forward as a species, as communities, as civilization and as states. I do take the opportunity to really call both to thank or appreciate Ukraine's declaration under article 12(3) of the Rome Statute, because that's the only reason we have jurisdiction. And also to call upon Ukraine, with all due dispatch, to pass the necessary cooperation law so that the obligations that arose under 12(3) declaration can be properly implemented. At the same time, and I've said it before, but I think it's really important to emphasize in this forum and I acknowledge also the representative of the Russian Federation and pleased the Russian Federation is in this room along with the Government of Ukraine and so many others., But this is a time when we need to mobilize the law and send it into battle, not on the side of Ukraine against the Russian Federation or on the side of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, but on the side of humanity to protect, to preserve, to shield people who are children, who are women and who are men, who have certain basic rights. And at that age, whether they are Russian or whether they're Ukrainian is absolutely irrelevant. Their families and their lives are being torn apart. So if this moment is not a moment for us to define and strain our sinews and come together, what moment will we wait for and will we be alive to see it?, You know, when we look at the parties to the conflict in Ukraine, when we look at the Russian Federation and Ukraine, I think bad though things are, we should pause and look back. You know, as a young child, we are all taught history, and we love to study it. And what is absolutely staggered by the tremendous suffering that the people of the USSR in today's Russia and today's Ukraine suffered at the hands of National Socialism. Millions upon millions. And in the midst of that particularly bleak catastrophe, we saw perhaps some unparalleled heroism and courage. It was in 1943, in the city of Kharkiv that 30,000 people were killed. And the then USSR decided that accountability was not politicized, it was something necessary; it wasn’t a summary execution - three Germans and one Russian were brought to justice in Kharkiv for the people that were killed and for the crimes that were committed. I think all of us, and the world is not perfect, no individual is perfect, my office is certainly not perfect. But we need to realize, I think, that we should treat others as we want to be treated., We should conduct ourselves in the way we would like other others to conduct themselves. And perhaps looking back at the events of eighty years ago, we should think, do we want to behave in the way that we prosecuted individuals that were pushing forward the pogroms and the crimes of National Socialism? Or do we wish to hold ourselves to the standard that we held them, those years ago? This is a moment of absolute collective unity. And if we don't grasp the moment, I think, we will not only be answerable from a moral perspective, I think things bad though they are, could get worse. We will conduct independent investigations. We will try to hold out the hands of partnerships with states, with civil society, with other organizations, and then subject whatever we receive to proper independent forensic scrutiny. We don't want to be sold to that. We want to get to the bottom of the matters. But at the same time, nobody can be a spectator., The day before yesterday, I did something that has not been done in the life of the ICC before, in the life of the Office that I now lead. I signed an agreement to join a joint investigation team (JIT) with Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania. There are nine other structural investigations underway, and I'm really pleased that the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Iryna Venediktova will be speaking today. And we have other high-level representatives, and I look forward to working together., I've been to Ukraine twice, to Lviv and to Kiev. I've been to Bucha and Borodianka. The team have been more widely forensic scientists, lawyers and investigators, and we will keep on partnering with anybody but subjecting it, whatever we receive, as I've said to impartial analysis., I have sent three communications to the Russian Federation. I have not received a reply, but I will keep on trying because I want to say very clearly, and I hope it is relayed however welcome or otherwise message may be. I think we have a duty to convey messages that my Office and myself have no agenda, no political agenda other than to get to the truth. And to the extent there is fake news, to the extent there is collusion, or there are attempts to deceive the world, what better way to expose a lie than subject it to independent investigations and analysis? So my door is open. I will also keep knocking on the door, and I hope for the sake of our own responsibilities, for the sake of our international legal obligations, for the sake of humanity at large, and the principles of the UN Charter in whose building we sit, we work with more deliberation, more sincerity, more effectiveness, and try to build trust because trust can be built even in a battlefield., We see on TV screens and I've spoken to victims and survivors, pictures that are not fake. I've seen refugees, largely women and children. This caravan of people with their plastic bags and their bags crossing on foot into Poland. I've seen individuals in Borodianka completely non scripted walking around without any supervision, surrounded, sitting around a blackened cattle in very, very cold temperatures because that's their current existence at the moment. And of course, I've seen body bags and other evidence of killings, and we need to find out how did people die and who did it and then insist on accountability., But people have lost everything. People have fled with nothing. So are we to be so self-indulgent as an international community to talk politics when people are scared and children are shivering on all sides. And it doesn't matter if a child is in the Russian controlled area or if a child is in the Ukrainian controlled area, or if it’s a woman. We should view them as our children. We should view them as our family. And unless we have these basic principles permeating our spirit, I really think it is a terrible tragedy. But of course, the law is there because certain issues are not just of morality. They incur legal responsibility., I think, in short, it's not an overstatement to say that this is a singular moment. It's a critical juncture. The implications, as I said at the outset, are profound in Ukraine, but they extend beyond Ukraine. It's a time to cling to the law. It is a time to uphold the law. If we don't cling with the greatest of respect to the law, in this moment, we will be left with nothing to cling to except despair, except suffering, and individually, we cannot allow that to happen. Collectively, we must not rest until it stops. And that sanity and justice prevails on all sides., Thank you so much., Source: Office of the Prosecutor | Contact: OTPNewsDesk@icc-cpi.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-arria-formula-meeting-un-security-council
‘He’s Not Coming Back’: War Crimes in Northwest Areas of Kyiv Oblast,Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,6 May 2022,"Ukraine: Russian forces must face justice for war crimes in Kyiv Oblast, Russian forces must face justice for a series of war crimes committed in the region northwest of Kyiv, Amnesty International said today in a new briefing following an extensive on-the-ground investigation., The briefing, ‘He’s Not Coming Back’: War Crimes in Northwest Areas of Kyiv Oblast, is based on dozens of interviews and extensive review of material evidence. Amnesty International documented unlawful air strikes on Borodyanka, and extrajudicial executions in other towns and villages including Bucha, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka and Vorzel., An Amnesty International delegation, led by the organization’s Secretary General, has been visiting the region in recent days, speaking with survivors and families of victims, and meeting with senior Ukrainian officials., “The pattern of crimes committed by Russian forces that we have documented includes both unlawful attacks and wilful killings of civilians,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “We have met families whose loved ones were killed in horrific attacks, and whose lives have changed forever because of the Russian invasion. We support their demands for justice, and call on the Ukrainian authorities, the International Criminal Court and others to ensure evidence is preserved that could support future war crime prosecutions., “It is vital that all those responsible, including up the chain of command, are brought to justice.”, In Borodyanka, Amnesty International found that at least 40 civilians were killed in disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, which devastated an entire neighbourhood and left thousands of people homeless., In Bucha and several other towns and villages located northwest of Kyiv, Amnesty International documented 22 cases of unlawful killings by Russian forces, most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions., During 12 days of investigations, Amnesty International researchers interviewed residents of Bucha, Borodyanka, Novyi Korohod, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka, Vorzel, Makariv and Dmytrivka, and visited sites of numerous killings., In total, they interviewed 45 people who witnessed or had first-hand knowledge of unlawful killings of their relatives and neighbours by Russian soldiers, and 39 others who witnessed or had first-hand knowledge of the air strikes that targeted eight residential buildings., UNLAWFUL AIR STRIKES IN BORODYANKA, On 1 and 2 March, a series of Russian air strikes hit eight residential buildings in the town of Borodyanka, approximately 60 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, which were home to more than 600 families., The strikes killed at least 40 residents and destroyed the buildings, as well as dozens of surrounding buildings and houses. Most of the victims were killed in the buildings’ basements, where they had sought shelter. Others died in their apartments., On the morning of 2 March, a single strike killed at least 23 people in Building 359 on Tsentralna Street. The victims included five of Vadim Zahrebelny’s relatives: his mother Lydia, his brother Volodymyr and wife Yulia, and her parents Lubov and Leonid Hurbanov., Vadim told Amnesty International: “We [Vadim and his son] left Building 359 just after 7am. However, my mother and my brother and his wife and her parents insisted on staying in the basement because they were afraid of getting shot by Russian soldiers if they went out on the streets. About 20 minutes after we left, Building 359 was bombed and they were all killed, together with other neighbours.”, Vasyl Yaroshenko was close to one of the buildings when it was hit. He said: “I left my apartment to go do some work in the garage, as my wife was about to take a couple of older neighbours down to the basement. When I reached the garage, about 150 metres from the building, there was a huge explosion. I ducked behind the garage. When I looked, I saw a large gap in the building. The whole middle section of the building had collapsed – exactly where residents were sheltering in the basement. My wife Halina was among those killed. I still see her by the door of our apartment, the home where we lived for 40 years.”, On 1 March, a series of air strikes targeted six other buildings nearby. At least seven people were killed in Building 371 on Tsentralna Street, including Vitali Smishchuk, a 39-year-old surgeon, his wife Tetiana, and their four-year-old daughter Yeva., Vitali’s mother Ludmila told Amnesty International: “As the situation deteriorated, it became too dangerous to move from one part of the town to another. There were tanks on the streets… People were frightened to be outside., “I was speaking to my son and telling him to leave, but he was worried about going outside. They sheltered in the basement for safety – but the bomb destroyed the middle section of the building, where the basement was.”, No fixed Ukrainian military targets are known to have been located at or around any of the buildings which were struck, though at times armed individuals supporting Ukrainian forces reportedly fired on passing Russian military vehicles from or near some of those buildings. Knowingly launching direct attacks on civilian objects or disproportionate attacks constitute war crimes., Amnesty International has created a new interactive 360-degree representation of the extensive damage caused by the air strikes in Borodyanka, which can be viewed here., UNLAWFUL KILLINGS NORTHWEST OF KYIV, The town of Bucha, approximately 30 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian forces in late February. Five men were killed in apparent extrajudicial executions by Russian forces in a compound of five buildings set around a courtyard close to the intersection of Yablunska and Vodoprovidna streets, all between 4 and 19 March., Yevhen Petrashenko, a 43-year-old sales manager and father-of-two, was shot dead in his apartment on Yablunska Street on 4 March., Yevhen’s wife Tatiana told Amnesty International that she was in their building’s basement, while Yevhen had remained in their apartment. He had gone to help a neighbour when Russian soldiers were conducting door-to-door searches. Tatiana lost contact with Yevhen, whose body was then found in his apartment by a neighbour the next day., At her request, Russian soldiers allowed Tatiana to visit the apartment. She said: “Yevhen was lying dead in the kitchen. He had been shot in the back, [near his] lungs and liver. His body remained in the apartment until 10 March, when we were able to bury him in a shallow grave in the courtyard.”, Amnesty International researchers found two bullets and three cartridge cases at the scene of the killing. The organization’s weapons investigator identified the bullets as black-tipped 7N12 armour-piercing 9x39mm rounds that can only be fired by specialized rifles used by some elite Russian units, including units reported to have been operating in Bucha during this time., A collection of Russian military papers recovered in Bucha, which Amnesty International researchers analysed, gives further indications as to the units involved. They included conscription and training records belonging to a driver-mechanic of the 104th Regiment of the VDV, the Russian Airborne Forces. Notably, some VDV units are equipped with specialized rifles that fire the armour-piercing 9x39mm round., On 22 or 23 March, Leonid Bodnarchuk, a 44-year-old construction worker who lived in the same building as Yevhen Petrashenko, was also killed. Residents who were sheltering in the basement told Amnesty International that Russian soldiers shot Leonid as he was walking up the stairs, then threw a grenade into the stairwell. They later found his maimed body slumped in a pool of blood on the stairs., Amnesty International researchers found large blood stains over several steps on the stairs leading to the basement, as well as burn marks and a pattern of damage on the wall consistent with a grenade explosion., In neighbouring towns and villages, Amnesty International collected further evidence and testimony of unlawful killings, including apparent extrajudicial executions: some victims had their hands tied behind their back, while others showed signs of being tortured., In the village of Novyi Korohod, Viktor Klokun, a 46-year-old construction worker, was killed. Olena Sakhno, his partner, told Amnesty International that some villagers brought her Viktor’s body on 6 March. She said: “His hands were tied behind his back with a piece of white plastic, and he had been shot in the head.”, Oleksii Sychevky’s wife Olha, 32, and father Olexandr, 62, were killed when the car convoy they were travelling in was fired upon by what they believed were Russian forces., Oleksii told Amnesty International: “The convoy was all fleeing civilians. Almost all of the cars had kids inside. When our car had just reached a line of trees, I heard shots – first single shots, then a burst of gunfire., “The shots hit the first vehicle in the convoy, and it stopped. We were the second vehicle and we had to stop, too. Then we were hit. At least six or seven shots hit our car. My dad was killed instantly by a bullet to the head. My wife was hit by metal shrapnel, and my kid [son] was also hit.”, Amnesty International researchers who visited Bucha, Borodyanka and other nearby towns and villages in April, after victims had been exhumed (either from the rubble of collapsed buildings, or from the shallow, temporary graves in which many had been buried), found that many family members were unhappy with treatment of victims’ remains. Family members were concerned that the processing of remains was chaotic, that they were not kept properly informed, and that remains in some cases were not being correctly identified., PURSUING JUSTICE FOR WAR CRIMES, Extrajudicial executions committed in international armed conflicts constitute wilful killings, which are war crimes. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks carried out with criminal intent are also war crimes., All those responsible for war crimes should be held criminally responsible for their actions. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, hierarchal superiors – including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers and heads of state – who knew or had reason to know about war crimes committed by their forces, but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible, should also be held criminally responsible., Any justice processes or mechanisms should be as comprehensive as possible, and ensure that all perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression in Ukraine, from all parties to the conflict, are brought to justice in fair trials, without recourse to the death penalty. In addition, the rights of victims must be at the forefront of investigating and prosecuting international crimes, and all justice mechanisms should adopt a survivor-centred approach., Amnesty International’s documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here., STOP THE AGGRESSION AND PROTECT CIVILIANS IN UKRAINE, Right now, people in Ukraine are facing a catastrophic human rights crisis. People are dying, including children, and many thousands of lives are at risk. Take action to demand that the Russian authorities stop this act of aggression and protect civilians now., ACT NOW",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/he-s-not-coming-back-war-crimes-northwest-areas-kyiv-oblast

Water Sanitation Hygiene",5 May 2022,"SITUATION ANALYSIS, Description of the emergency, More than 5.6 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24. Most of those fleeing Ukraine have entered immediate neighbouring countries, primarily Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Moldova (see map below for estimated figures). The number of people moving into neighbouring countries continues to be much lower than at the start of the conflict. At the same time, tens of thousands are reported to be returning to Ukraine every day. IFRC is closely monitoring the flow of people to anticipate needs and situations, which change daily., A further 7.7 million are estimated to be internally displaced within Ukraine, approximately half of whom have fled to western Ukraine. Critical infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, including more than 1,071 educational facilities and 150 health facilities. Pharmacies are closed, and stocks of medicines are low, leaving people without access to health care and life-saving medicines. Hundreds of thousands of people are living without access to basics such as water, food, and electricity., Severity of humanitarian conditions, Significant damage to infrastructure in Ukraine. Military activity has impacted crucial supply chains and restricted access to vital services and goods in many parts of Ukraine, with a heavier impact on the central and eastern parts of the country and sporadic damage in the western part, which to date is less affected by ongoing hostilities. Direct infrastructure damage is estimated to be at over 790 billion CHF., Critical medical supplies are becoming increasingly scarce in the areas affected by the conflict, including medications and oxygen, putting growing pressure on an already deficient healthcare system. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the health system in Ukraine has been severely disrupted, with around 300 health facilities situated in areas affected by hostilities and 1,000 health facilities in changed areas of control., The shortage of agricultural labourers and inputs, destruction of food systems assets and infrastructure and the reduced access to arable land will likely limit domestic production and food availability in Ukraine markets over the coming few months. Some rural households are likely to have above-average levels of food stocks and/or financial resources, which will provide some buffer as livelihoods and incomes are disrupted by the conflict. However, if the war continues and spreads, there will be increased pressure until food from the next harvest becomes available in the summer, assuming planting can occur., 1.4 million people are currently without running water across eastern Ukraine. Hostilities-related damage to infrastructure and power cuts put an additional 4.6 million people across Ukraine at risk of losing access to piped water., Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country, which means people crossing borders are predominately women, children, older people, people living with disabilities, and other groups facing different vulnerabilities and risks. In times of conflict, there are increased risks of conflict-related sexual violence, trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexual exploitation and abuse of vulnerable groups, and pre-existing and increased displacement related risks of violence., The conflict in Ukraine is also unleashing a three-dimensional crisis in food, energy, and financial markets. Soaring staples prices, energy price hikes and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide in the poorest countries, likely to push up to 323 million people into acute levels of food insecurity. The Russian Federation and Ukraine produce around 30 per cent of the world’s wheat and barley, one-fifth of its maize, and over half of its sunflower oil. In addition, the Russian Federation is the world’s top natural gas exporter and second-largest oil exporter. Belarus and the Russian Federation also export around a fifth of the world’s fertilizers. Preliminary analysis suggests that as many as 1.7 billion people in 107 economies are exposed to at least one of three risks, mostly in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean., Neighbouring countries’ capacities to provide long-term and safe shelter is getting stretched a month into the conflict. In Poland, where nearly half of all arrivals from Ukraine have arrived, shelter is being provided primarily by citizens in their private homes. But local officials in Poland are increasingly concerned the goodwill toward refugees/displaced people will begin to decline and temporary housing capacities are uncertain., Estimates suggest that half of those who have fled Ukraine are children. While some educational activities for displaced children continue, neighbouring countries’ capacities to absorb children into the formal education system are varied and language abilities pose great challenges. The special nature of this crisis, where long term plans and needs of the affected population are ever-changing, education access and continuity for children will remain complex.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-and-impacted-countries-emergency-appeal-n-mgr65002-operation-update-report-n
Children bear psychological scars of war in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,7 May 2022,"Weeks spent sheltering from the war left 11-year-old Polina feeling hopeless. However, psychological support is helping her to heal., Eleven-year-old Polina has little to remind her of her life in Mariupol, Ukraine. The hospital where she was born, the kindergarten where she played and the school where she studied have all now been destroyed., While once she was class president, with high grades, close friends and an ever-growing list of hobbies, now, after sheltering in a basement for much of March, Polina is terrified of being left alone in her room., One day of the war, in particular, still strikes fear into her heart., “I was in the basement and my mother and grandmother were on the ground floor,” the young girl recalls. “There was such a strong explosion that it deafened me. Everything fell from the ceiling and I started screaming. The other girls were also screaming and crying, and there was one girl who we couldn't calm down at all, even when it was over.”, Polina and her friends would perform concerts to distract themselves while they sheltered in the basement. But it soon became too much to bear., In late March, Polina, her mother Tetiana and grandmother Natalia finally fled Mariupol, eventually finding shelter in the Vinnytsia region. Polina is now studying and socialising with classmates remotely. To help her daughter to overcome her fear of being alone, Tetiana has approached UNICEF for support., “Psychological trauma is like a wound, so you can't neglect its treatment,” says Tetiana, a psychologist from Vinnytsia regional interdisciplinary mobile team., Since April, a regional interdisciplinary mobile team has been working in the Vinnytsia region with the support of UNICEF and the Ukrainian Public Health Foundation. Anyone who needs social, medical, psychological or legal advice may contact the team free of charge by phone +380678857107 or +390965241741. Adults should ensure that their children have daily routines, with a predictable sequence of learning, exercise and rest., “Games that concentrate on being in a safe place here and now, pulling from the inner world of experiences into the outer world will also be helpful,” says psychologist Tetiana. “For example, a game of ‘three things’ that a child can feel, taste and smell.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/children-bear-psychological-scars-war-ukraine-enuk

Update 74 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (06 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,6 May 2022,"Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about continuing operational challenges at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) due to the Russian occupation of the site between 24 February and 31 March, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Five weeks after Russian forces withdrew from the Chornobyl NPP, Ukraine said several facilities at the site still cannot operate normally because of, for example, disrupted logistical routes for the supply of equipment and spare parts, and lack of safe access for the necessary number of personnel to ensure safe operation. As a result, the regulatory body has been taking regulatory action including suspending some of the licences at this site., “This demonstrates that there is still much to do to restore Chornobyl to normal operation. The IAEA is supporting Ukraine in its efforts to ensure nuclear safety and security at this site and the country’s other nuclear facilities,” Director General Grossi said. He met the head of Ukraine’s regulatory body, Oleh Korikov, in Vienna on Thursday and also last week at Chornobyl, when the IAEA delivered safety-related equipment, conducted radiological measurements and restored transmission of safeguards data., On a positive note, the Director General said he welcomed Ukraine’s re-establishment of regulatory control of the Chornobyl NPP, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located after the 1986 accident., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four NPPs, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, following last week’s visit of IAEA inspectors and technicians to the Chornobyl NPP, data from all unattended monitoring systems installed at the site has now been fully recovered. Also, as a result of the deployment of new transmission channels based on satellite technologies, the remote transfer of the safeguards data to the Agency’s Vienna headquarters has been fully restored with the exception of one facility for which technical work is still required. The transmission from the Chornobyl NPP had been interrupted for two months. For the other NPPs in Ukraine, remote data continues to be transferred to the IAEA.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-74-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-06-may-2022

Protection and Human Rights",6 May 2022,"GENEVA (5 May 2022) - UN human rights experts* and the Global Protection Cluster Coordinator are alarmed by the scale of displacement in Ukraine and call for urgent action to protect internally displaced people. They issue the following statement:, “Since 24 February, nearly 12.8 million people are estimated to have been displaced in Ukraine, most of whom have not left the country. According to the most recent estimates, 7.7 million people are internally displaced as a result of the conflict, which is equivalent to 17.5 percent of the entire population. These are people who have had to leave their homes and everything behind in a desperate attempt to escape death and destruction. They are traumatised and need urgent protection, including psychosocial support., This conflict has been causing extreme human suffering, with thousands of civilians killed and injured, and countless others living through daily bombardment and violence. Homes, schools, hospitals, care institutions and entire cities have been destroyed. Mines and explosive remnants of war continue to pose alarming threats to civilians, including those remaining in their homes and those fleeing the conflict. We are appalled by the disturbing reports of violations of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law which may amount to war crimes., The humanitarian situation is dire. Internally displaced people, the majority of whom are women and children, have lost everything they had – their homes and belongings, their livelihoods, their support networks, and in many cases their loved ones. Many of them face shortages of food, water, basic items and energy, and lack access to health services and medication. We are also worried about the secondary effects of the conflict and displacement on food production which are forecast to affect the availability of food in Ukraine and also globally., Multiple forms of gender-based violence are being reported such as sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual violence, including conflict-related sexual violence. Women and girls on the move - at border crossing points or transit and collective centres and in bomb shelters - experience particularly high insecurity and risk of violence, including trafficking in persons. Numerous families have been separated during displacement, and unaccompanied and separated children are particularly vulnerable to the risks of trafficking, violence, abuse and exploitation., We are also concerned by the appalling humanitarian situation of older people and people with disabilities. They are often among the last to flee conflict zones and face many challenges during displacement, living in poorly equipped temporary shelters and struggling with chronic health conditions without access to proper health care and rehabilitation centres. Many of them are still in conflict zones because of mobility limitations or reliance on others for care, and face challenges in accessing bomb shelters or safe areas. We are especially concerned about those persons with disabilities, including children, living in institutions for persons with disabilities who face barriers to access humanitarian assistance and evacuation on an equal basis with others., Alongside internally displaced people in Ukraine, the estimated 13 million people who are stranded in areas affected by the conflict are experiencing acute risks as well. Their lives and security are threatened, and they are largely unable to access life-saving assistance due to ongoing attacks and insecurity., We urge the establishment of more humanitarian corridors with satisfactory security guarantees for the delivery of humanitarian aid and safe passage for the evacuation of civilians, as well as evacuation centres whose civilian character must be respected., While local and international humanitarian organisations as well as government authorities are providing humanitarian assistance to the best of their ability, they must be given as much support as possible. Access to life-saving protection, child protection, mental health and gender-based violence services is more critical than ever. We call on the international community and donors to provide sustained and increased support for the response to internal displacement and the Ukraine Flash Appeal, and other critical efforts to protect the human rights of all civilians who remain in Ukraine., We urge the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law to protect civilians.

"Ukraine: Bachelet urges protection of civilians, renewed efforts to agree on a ceasefire",News and Press Release,OHCHR,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2022,"DELIVERED BY Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
AT Briefing to the United Nations Security Council
LOCATION New York, Mme. President,, For over eight years, since 15 March 2014, my Office – through the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine – has been monitoring the situation in Ukraine. To date, we have released close to 50 periodic and thematic reports., On 24 February 2022, we quickly adapted to a very different working environment. Like millions of Ukrainians, the staff of my Office relocated to other regions of the country, but, and I am very proud to say, have not paused their work for a single day. Currently, the Mission has staff on the ground in Uzghorod, Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, Donetsk and Odesa, and conducts field visits to various parts of the country, including Kyiv and Chernihiv regions just last week., The Mission continues to verify allegations of violations of international human rights law and of international humanitarian law in the context of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine., Many of these allegations concern violations that may amount to war crimes., Based on the Mission’s work, my Office updated the UN Human Rights Council at the end of March, and will present a report on the human rights situation in Ukraine covering the period from 24 February to 15 May at the next session of the Council in June. My press statement on Ukraine of 22 April summarized our most recent findings., It pains me to say that all our concerns remain valid, and the situation keeps deteriorating., Mme. President,, Today is the seventy-first day of the escalation in hostilities, expanding the already eight-year long conflict to all regions of the country., Reports of deadly incidents, such as attacks on hospital No 3 and the drama theatre in Mariupol, on the railway station in Kramatorsk, on residential areas in Odesa, have become shockingly frequent. There seems to be no end in sight to the daily reports of civilian deaths and injuries., My team on the ground conveys the palpable trauma and shock experienced by the people they speak with, the vast majority of whom have either personally witnessed a violation or are victims themselves., Rather than try to describe what victims are going through, let me use their words. Residents of Mariupol set up a Telegram channel to share information about their relatives who perished in the city:, I quote: “he was killed in front of his wife and children”; “her body remained under the debris of her house, we could not even bury her”; “my uncle died from loss of blood after sustaining fragmentation injuries, I only know he was buried in a collective grave”., I could share many more such messages., Last week, on 28 April, when the UN Secretary-General was visiting Kyiv to meet the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the city was hit by two missiles. At least one woman, a journalist, was killed, and four civilians were injured in the attack. An OHCHR team was in Kyiv on that day too, preparing to visit Bucha. On the same day, we corroborated 22 civilian deaths and 40 civilian injuries in other places of Ukraine., Members of the Council,, In Ukraine, my Office has recorded 6,731 civilian casualties since the Russian armed attack started on 24 February. We know the real figures are considerably higher., As my Office consistently reports, most of these casualties have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, such as shelling from heavy artillery, including multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., My Office is also documenting the devastating consequences of the conflict on other human rights. In areas around Kyiv, from late February for about 5 weeks, Russian forces targeted male civilians, who they considered suspicious. Men were detained, beaten, summarily executed and, in some cases, taken to Belarus and Russia, unbeknownst to their families, and held in pre-trial detention facilities. My staff met with families who are searching for their missing male relatives, desperate to know where they are, if they are alive, and how they can get them back. Families were shot at as they tried to escape in convoys. In some areas, it was dangerous to cross the street, with snipers or soldiers shooting at anyone who tried. Local authorities are compiling lists of dead and missing, continuing exhumations, taking DNA from relatives, while also trying to reconnect these districts to electricity and water., In other areas controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups such as Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, we continue to document arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearances of representatives of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists, retired servicemen of the armed forces, and other civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. As of 4 May, my Office had documented 180 such cases, of which five victims were eventually found dead. We have also documented eight possible enforced disappearances of people considered to be pro-Russian in Government controlled territory., My staff heard about cases of women having been raped by Russian armed forces in areas that were under their control, as well as other allegations of sexual violence by both parties to the conflict. And yet, the stigma around rape and sexual violence continues to prevent victims and their families from feeling safe to report. This only highlights the importance of ensuring adequate and safe support services for victims., Grim evidence of torture, ill-treatment, and summary executions of prisoners of war committed by both parties to the conflict is surfacing. My Office is collecting such evidence, which will be included in its future reporting., The only way for these horrors to stop is for armed forces to fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law., It is vital that all parties give clear instructions to their combatants to protect civilians and persons hors de combat, as well as to distinguish between civilian and military objects., Those in command of armed forces must make it clear to their members that anyone found to have been involved in such violations will be prosecuted and held accountable. Accountability demands that evidence be preserved, and that mortal remains be treated with decency., Mme President, Members of the Council,, The list of gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law continues to grow each day. We cannot let the number of victims continue to rise., A one-day ceasefire alone would spare the lives of at least 50 civilian children, women and men, including many older persons., A one-day ceasefire would prevent 30-70 civilians from being injured, and a dozen from becoming disabled., A one-day ceasefire would allow several thousand civilians to safely leave areas where they are currently trapped in hostilities., Most importantly, a ceasefire will show that the horror in Ukraine can be stopped. It is of the most fundamental importance that the ongoing hostilities cease, once and for all., Mme President,, Advocating for accountability is a cornerstone of my Office’s work., If the perpetrators of violations against civilians and persons hors de combat are brought to justice, potential perpetrators will think twice before unleashing similar unlawful attacks or acts of violence and creating new victims., Accountability also contributes to the healing process for the victims, their families and society at large., National justice systems are the most crucial. I urge the parties to the conflict to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law allegedly committed by their armed forces, and I welcome Ukraine’s efforts in this regard., My Office is fully committed to supporting those systems and the work of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine and to cooperating with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and other international justice mechanisms, in accordance with our established UN frameworks., Let us commit to putting a stop to this senseless conflict. We must be steadfast in our efforts for peace and resolute that justice will be done.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-bachelet-urges-protection-civilians-renewed-efforts-agree-ceasefire

Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9027TH MEETING (PM)
SC/14882, Members Hear Briefings on Humanitarian, Human Rights, Civil Society Situations, A third humanitarian operation is under way to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol in war-torn Ukraine after two successful convoys saved nearly 500 people in that area, the United Nations chief told the Security Council today., “We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes,” Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized, as he briefed members of the 15‑member Council on his recent visits to the Russian Federation and Ukraine., Recalling his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow, he said that he stressed the imperative of enabling humanitarian access and evacuations from besieged areas — Mariupol, first and foremost. [Soon after the Secretary‑General strongly urged the opening of a safe and effective humanitarian corridor to allow civilians in the Azovstal plant to reach safety, he received confirmation of an agreement in principle, and his team immediately followed up with intense preparatory work with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as well as Russian and Ukrainian authorities]., He noted that the United Nations and the Red Cross are leading a humanitarian operation of great complexity — both politically and in terms of security. In the first operation, completed on 3 May, 101 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant alongside 59 more from a neighbouring area. In the second, concluded last night, more than 320 civilians were evacuated from the city of Mariupol and surrounding areas, he added., “Throughout my travels, I did not mince words,” he emphasized, recalling that, in both Moscow and Kyiv, he repeated exactly what he had said in New York: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations. It must end for the sake of the people of Ukraine, Russia and the entire world.”, Also briefing the Council was Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, who said the United Nations and its more than 217 humanitarian partners have scaled up at record speed, with more than 1,400 United Nations personnel deployed across Ukraine. They are operating out of eight hubs beyond Kyiv, with staff, warehouses and supplies in 30 locations, and reaching more than 4.1 million people with some form of assistance, he added., The United Nations and its partners, he continued, are assisting and protecting displaced people and restoring basic services while also prepositioning supplies to forward operating bases and increasing preparedness in areas to which the war might shift next. They are also engaged “every single day” in pushing the parties for the movement of aid to civilians, or in negotiating to help civilians leave for safer places., In a third briefing, Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said her office has recorded 6,731 civilian casualties since the Russian invasion began in late February. “We know the real figures are considerably higher,” she added, pointing out that most of those casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide effects in populated areas., She reported that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is documenting the devastating consequences of the conflict on other human rights, including incidents of families shot as they tried to escape in convoys and the arbitrary detention and possible forced “disappearing” of civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., Furthermore, evidence of torture, ill-treatment and summary execution of prisoners of war committed by both parties is surfacing, she added. While affirming that her office is collecting evidence, she stressed that the only way to stop such horrors is for armed forces to fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law., Bringing civil society’s voice to the Council, Tetiana Luzan, Advocacy Coordinator for the non-governmental organization Right to Protection, said the number of those internally displaced reached 7.7 million at the end of April, noting: “They all carry the same heavy burden of displacement.” The international community must ensure that those willing to return, or travel to other countries, have the possibility to do so, she emphasized., Calling on the international community to help the Government of Ukraine establish and enforce appropriate investigative and prosecutorial measures, she stressed: “Each life is priceless, and relatives deserve to know the truth.” Furthermore, stateless persons and third‑country nationals previously finding refuge in Ukraine must also be protected alongside Ukrainian citizens, she said., Council members and non-members also participated in the discussion., Ukraine’s representative said the Russian Federation has fired more than 2,000 missiles at his country’s cities, most of which do not hit military targets. Moscow’s missile terrorism must be punished with stronger sanctions and increased military assistance to Ukraine, he emphasized. Pointing out that Russia is threatening his country’s food security by stealing grain supplies from temporarily occupied regions and attacking farming infrastructure, he said the Security Council’s inaction continues to irritate the international community and to create an atmosphere of impunity. The Council Chamber has “turned from a venue of diplomatic debates into a biological hazard site”, as the Russian Federation’s envoy leaves a trail of blood and the smell of smouldering corpses behind as he enters and exits the Chamber, he asserted., The representative of the United States said the Russian Federation has repeatedly lied to the Council with a string of wild conspiracy theories and misinformation, noting “each falsehood has been more ridiculous than the last”. However, the truth is well-known, she reiterated: The Russian Federation is the only perpetrator of this war. “Russia alone started this war, and Russia alone can end it.”, Germany’s representative, noting that the world will soon commemorate the end of the Second World War unleashed by Nazi Germany, noted that, 77 years after that watershed moment, Russian propaganda is attempting to create an outrageous link between the heroic fighting of the Red Army then against the Nazi regime, and the Kremlin’s current aggression against Ukraine. “This utter nonsense is beyond cynicism,” she said, pointing out that the world can see how Russia’s attempt to “de-Nazify” and “liberate” Ukraine looks in pictures from Mariupol, Irpin and Bucha, which reveal atrocities and crimes against humanity., The Russian Federation’s representative said that “Russophobia” has become prevalent in Ukraine, emphasizing that the special military operation began to liberate Donbas after all the crimes committed by the Kyiv regime and Russia’s warnings against them. Western countries dismissed Russia’s security concerns and assured of the purely defensive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) while moving the bloc closer to Russia’s borders, he recalled, pointing out that the West arrogantly cast aside his country’s proposals for a global and indivisible security architecture. Westerners only needed Ukraine as an arena of confrontation with Russia, he added. The Secretary-General’s visits to Russia and Ukraine were presented by both the media and Western politicians in a completely distorted manner, giving the impression that Kyiv and the United Nations managed to “persuade” Russia to open a corridor for the evacuation of civilians from Azovstal, he said, pointing out that Russia opens the corridors regularly and they are open today., China’s delegate emphasized that dialogue and negotiations are the only inevitable way to resolve disputes, stressing: “Delivering weapons will not deliver peace.” Basing one country’s security on the insecurity of others is not reasonable. Pointing out that repeated eastward expansion of NATO after the cold war not only failed to make Europe safer, he said it also sowed the seeds of conflict. China will never forget the 7 May 1999 NATO strike on its embassy in Yugoslavia, and will never allow history to repeat itself, he vowed, underlining: “The world does not need a new cold war.”, India’s representative was among the delegates who expressed grave concern about the broader regional and global implications of the conflict’s destabilizing effect, cautioning that skyrocketing oil prices, shortage of food grains and fertilizers, and challenges in food and energy security have had a disproportionate impact on developing countries., In similar vein, Gabon’s delegate noted the increasing pressure on the global economy, including agriculture, warning that, if the war does not end, the countries already facing humanitarian emergencies might collapse, rendering ordinary people “collateral victims”., Injecting a different perspective, Kenya’s representative cautioned that the unprecedented sanctions in response to the war are reshaping global development, food security and political stability, as global equity and debt markets seek to exit riskier emerging market economies. Investors are delaying or cancelling the investments needed to deliver sufficient jobs, he noted., Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister said his country, a major host to refugees from Ukraine, will not cease either to deliver aid to that country or to be a reliable partner for all United Nations system entities involved in providing support. He highlighted the high-level International Donors’ Conference for Ukraine that Poland and Sweden are holding in Warsaw today., Also speaking today were representatives of Albania, Mexico, France, Ghana, Brazil, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Norway, Greece, Latvia, Italy and Slovakia., The meeting began at 3:04 p.m. and ended at 6:13 p.m., Briefings, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, [gave](https:/reliefweb.int/node/3844188 a brief overview of his recent visit to the Russian Federation and Ukraine, where he met with President Vladimir V. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, respectively, on 26 and 28 April. He added that he also had discussions with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey in Ankara and President Andrzej Duda of Poland in Rzeszów. “Throughout my travels, I did not mince words,” he emphasized, recalling that, in both Moscow and Kyiv, he repeated exactly what he had said in New York: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations. It must end for the sake of the people of Ukraine, Russia and the entire world.”, To President Putin, he stressed the imperative of enabling humanitarian access and evacuations from besieged areas — Mariupol, first and foremost. Soon after the Secretary-General strongly urged the opening of a safe and effective humanitarian corridor to allow civilians in the Azovstal plant to reach safety, he received confirmation of an agreement in principle, and his team immediately followed up with intense preparatory work with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), as well as Russian and Ukrainian authorities. He said he was pleased to report some measure of success, noting that the United Nations and the Red Cross are leading a humanitarian operation of great complexity — both politically and in terms of security., The operation began on 29 April and has required enormous coordination and advocacy with the Russian and Ukrainian authorities, he continued, noting that two safe-passage convoys have been successfully completed so far. In the first, completed on 3 May, 101 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant alongside 59 more from a neighbouring area, he said, adding that, in the second, concluded last night, more than 320 civilians were evacuated from the city of Mariupol and surrounding areas. A third operation is under way. He said that, so far, nearly 500 civilians found long-awaited relief after living under relentless shelling and scarce availability of water, food and sanitation. “We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes,” he stressed., He said that his meetings with President Putin and President Zelenskyy also focused on the crucial issue of global food security, noting that the war’s world‑wide implications were in full view during his subsequent travels in West Africa. He recalled that, in Senegal, Niger and Nigeria, he heard direct testimony from leaders and civil society on how the war is unleashing a food‑security crisis. “A meaningful solution to global food insecurity requires reintegrating Ukraine’s agricultural production and the food and fertilizer production of Russia and Belarus into world markets, despite the war,” he underlined. In addition, the war is setting in motion a crisis that is devastating global energy markets, disrupting financial systems and exacerbating extreme vulnerabilities for the developing world, he warned, explaining why he established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to help countries face those challenges. “The war on Ukraine is senseless in its scope, ruthless in its dimensions and limitless in its potential for global harm,” he affirmed, stressing that the cycle of death, destruction, dislocation and disruption must stop., MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said the United Nations and its more than 217 humanitarian partners have scaled up at record speed, with more than 1,400 United Nations personnel deployed across Ukraine. They are operating out of eight hubs beyond Kyiv, with staff, warehouses and supplies in 30 locations, and reaching more than 4.1 million people with some form of assistance, he added. Explaining the main aspects of humanitarian response, he cited assistance to and protection of displaced people, and restoring the basic services necessary to survival. ICRC repaired basic water infrastructure in Irpin, just outside Kyiv, a short while ago, he recalled, explaining that was a key request by the authorities during his visit. Injecting cash aid allows civilians to choose what they need and offers a modicum of dignity. It helps to keep markets open and supply chains moving. This is a priority, with a plan to reach 1.3 million people with cash assistance by the end of May., A second part of response is prepositioning supplies to forward operating bases and increasing preparedness in areas to which the war might shift next, he continued. Third is engagement, every single day, with parties to the conflict to push for the movement of aid to civilians in areas of active conflict, or to negotiate to help civilians leave for safer places. To date, five inter-agency aid convoys have reached some of the hardest-hit areas, he noted, describing them as a lifeline for the civilians encircled by fighting, bringing in much needed medical supplies, water, food rations, non-food-items, water repair systems and generators. On 2 May, more than 100 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, including women, children and older people, he said, adding that about 60 more people joined the convoy on the outskirts of Mariupol and were then able to move to safety., “This was a truly exceptional operation,” he emphasized. “It showed us there is enough good will and common ground to work together to save lives.” Today, a third operation began, with the intention of evacuating more civilians from Mariupol and Azovstal, he said, adding: “We are finally seeing the fruits of our labour over these past many weeks,” he said, adding that efforts have been under way for some time to reach agreement on local ceasefires, pauses or windows of silence. The pauses upon which those latest operations depended have, in large part, held, he noted. At the same time, the United Nations and partners are exploring all options to reach more people in places where needs are greatest, he said, noting that the reverberations of this war are being felt worldwide. “We remain firmly committed to leaving no stone unturned”, he stressed., MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to verify allegations of violations of international human rights law and of international humanitarian law in the context of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine. “Many of these allegations concern violations that may amount to war crimes,” she stated, adding that “it pains me to say that all our concerns remain valid, and the situation keeps deteriorating”. Noting that today marks the seventy-first day of the escalation in hostilities, she said the already eight-year-long conflict is expanding to all regions of Ukraine. Reports of deadly incidents have become shockingly frequent, she added, noting that “there seems to be no end in sight to the daily reports of civilian deaths and injuries”. Quoting messages shared by residents of Mariupol about relatives who perished in the city, she said her Office has recorded 6,731 civilian casualties since 24 February., “We know the real figures are considerably higher,” she continued, pointing out that most of those casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide effects in populated areas. She went on to say that her office is also documenting the devastating consequences of the conflict on other human rights, including incidents of families shot as they tried to escape in convoys and the arbitrary detention and possible forced disappearances of civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Furthermore, she added, evidence of torture, ill-treatment and summary execution of prisoners of war committed by both parties to the conflict is surfacing. While affirming that her office is collecting evidence, she stressed that the only way to stop such horrors is for armed forces to fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law., The international community cannot let the number of victims continue to rise, she continued, saying a one-day ceasefire would spare the lives of at least 50 civilians; prevent between 30 and 70 civilians from being injured and a dozen from being disabled; and allow several thousand civilians to safely leave areas in which they are currently trapped in hostilities. “More importantly, a ceasefire will show that the horror in Ukraine can be stopped.” Underlining that advocacy for accountability is a cornerstone of her office’s work, she said that, if the perpetrators of violations against civilians are brought to justice, potential perpetrators will think twice before unleashing similar unlawful attacks and creating new victims. Underscoring the crucial importance of national justice systems to that end, she called upon the parties to the conflict to investigate all violations allegedly committed by their armed forces., TETIANA LUZAN, Advocacy Coordinator for the non-governmental organization Right to Protection, briefed on behalf of civil society, detailing efforts to support all Ukrainians who “are now beating as one big heart”. The war has lasted eight years, and at the end of April, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that the number of those internally displaced reached 7.7 million, she said, noting: “They all carry the same heavy burden of displacement.” Calling for their protection and urging the international community not to forget those forcibly displaced without documents or means of communication, she said the Russian Federation forcibly displaced more than 1 million people from Ukraine in the last two months. The international community must ensure that those willing to return, or travel to other countries, have the possibility to do so, she emphasized., She went on to spotlight the growing number of civilians killed and injured, and the thousands whose destinies are unknown, calling on the international community to assist the Ukrainian Government in establishing and enforcing appropriate investigative and prosecutorial measures. “Each life is priceless, and relatives deserve to know the truth,” she stressed. Furthermore, those fleeing must not be overlooked, she said, adding that stateless persons and third‑country nationals previously finding refuge in Ukraine must be protected alongside Ukrainian citizens. She also underscored that the unprecedented destruction of civilian infrastructure requires solutions, and called upon Council members, international organizations and Governments “to support Ukrainians firmly in these dark times”., Statements, FERIT HOXHA (Albania), noting that some 1,200 bodies have been discovered around Kyiv so far, almost all civilians, killed by a bullet to the head, declared: “[The] Kremlin considered Ukrainians as brothers and yet is killing them […] When you kill your family, you are a monster.” He added: “When you cannot prevail on the battlefield, you resort to atrocities.” The more the Russian Federation struggles in the face of Ukraine’s resistance, the more the Kremlin’s rhetoric continues to escalate into the madman’s ideas of nuclear war, he said, describing nuclear sabre-rattling as “ignominious”. Leon Trotsky wrote that “the army is a copy of society and suffers from all its diseases, usually at a higher temperature”, he recalled. Emphasizing that no one wants to destroy Russia, he said that, if [the] Kremlin made bad choices, they can correct course by stopping the war and calling the troops home. Pretending that the most ardent anti-Semites are usually Jews, that Hitler had Jewish blood — which underlies a theory that Jews inflicted the Holocaust on themselves, just as Ukrainians are supposedly slaughtering their own people and destroying their own country — is neither black humour nor basic fake news, but part of the worst conspiracy-theory warfare, he said, marvelling: “When you have the top diplomat dwell on such disgracefulness, this is a terrible low coming from a dangerous high.” He went on to reject any idea of forcibly dividing Ukraine’s territory., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), recalling that a year ago, the Council unanimously adopted resolution 2573 (2021) — which requires that all parties to armed conflict abide fully by their obligations under international humanitarian law — said it is inadmissible that 186 attacks targeted hospitals and other health facilities, as well as the registered attacks against schools, dams, train stations, food-storage facilities, and homes in total disregard for international humanitarian law. He added that his delegation will closely follow the investigations announced by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Mexico’s position has been unequivocal, he emphasized, calling for dialogue, a political solution, and above all, for putting people at the heart of the Council’s action. All States, having signed the Charter of the United Nations, should respect the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of States, he said, stressing that Ukraine cannot be an exception., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), noting that the Secretary-General’s recent visits to Kyiv and Moscow resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of civilians, welcomed that development, but questioned how many yet remain in Mariupol. He emphasized that the evacuation of civilians must continue in a safe, secure and voluntary way, in which evacuees can choose their destination. Condemning the Russian Federation’s continuing siege of that city and the indiscriminate strikes that hit Kyiv during the Secretary-General’s visit, he said the latter action reflects the low esteem in which that country holds the United Nations. He went on to note that civilians have no respite as the Russian Federation continues its bombing, its targeting of water infrastructure and its mining of fields to deny Ukrainians their means of survival. Against that backdrop, he called for urgent humanitarian access to those in Mariupol and other besieged cities, and on the Russian Federation to lift its blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, stressing: “War criminals will be held accountable.”, ZHANG JUN (China) welcomed the Secretary-General’s visit with the leaders of the Russian Federation and Ukraine and the subsequent successful evacuation of more than 300 civilians from Mariupol, while noting that the humanitarian crisis remains dire. Calling upon the parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid hurting civilians or infrastructure, he urged them to establish, building on the Mariupol evacuation, a broader, more efficient coordination mechanism to minimize the conflict’s humanitarian impact. “Delivering weapons will not deliver peace,” he pointed out, emphasizing that dialogue and negotiations are the only, inevitable way to resolve disputes, and that basing one country’s security on the insecurity of others is not reasonable. He went on to state that repeated eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after the cold war not only failed to make Europe safer, but it also sowed the seeds of conflict. China will never forget the 7 May 1999 NATO strike on the its embassy in Yugoslavia, and will never allow history to repeat itself, he vowed, stressing: “The world does not need a new cold war.”, HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), expressing regret at the resumption of heavy shelling and air strikes directed at the steel plant before all the people could be removed to safety, called for intensified efforts to secure the immediate evacuation of close 1,000 people, including children. He urged the parties to negotiate further humanitarian pauses and demilitarized humanitarian corridors in all besieged areas, saying he is concerned about growing reports of human rights violations and possible war crimes. Underlining the impact of the war on world food, energy and financial systems, he called upon the Security Council to facilitate an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and to provide a forum to address the core geopolitical and security concerns of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, NATO and its allied countries., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) expressed grave concern about the latest developments in Mariupol, Izium and Popasna, among other cities, including heavy shelling and air strikes. Public statements by the combatants and their allies suggest there is little respite from violence that civilians can look forward to, he said, pointing to the media’s repeated mentions of the possible use of nuclear weapons. Turning to food security challenges, particularly in the Global South, including Africa, he noted that the unprecedented sanctions in response to the war are reshaping global development, food security and political stability, as global equity and debt markets seek to exit riskier emerging market economies, and investors are delaying or cancelling the investments needed to deliver sufficient jobs. He went on to urge States to place more trust in the good offices of the Secretary-General, while welcoming his recent trip to the Russian Federation and Ukraine., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) emphasized that the utmost priority should be the immediate cessation of hostilities and the strengthening of diplomatic negotiations to find a lasting solution to the crisis. Brazil is concerned about the negative economic effects of the war for the world, especially in the form of higher food and energy prices, in addition to the human rights violations and humanitarian costs of the conflict, he said. Acknowledging the Secretary‑General’s recent visit to Moscow and Kyiv, he called on all parties to respect provisions regarding the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including vulnerable groups, refugees and internally displaced people. To that end, Brazil has offered shelter to people fleeing the conflict and granted temporary visas and residency authorizations to those affected or displaced, he said., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said the Secretary-General’s recent visit to Moscow and Kyiv helped alleviate the suffering and to put arrangements in place for the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. However, thousands still remain trapped and under siege, she noted, encouraging the parties to ensure safe passage and humanitarian access. Emphasizing that the parties must comply with international humanitarian law, including the obligation to limit attacks to military objectives, she condemned the horrific violations documented by the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, including summary executions, conflict‑related sexual violence, arbitrary detentions and deportations, including of journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists, enforced disappearances and torture of prisoners of war. All allegations of violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law must continue to be investigated and those responsible held to account, she stressed. “We know what we are dealing with; it cannot be dismissed as fake news.” Reiterating calls for the Russian Federation to comply with its obligations under international law, she said: “Stopping the war tonight could not undo what has been done. But, it would stop the slaughter, it would save lives.”, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that, unlike the previous presidency, he expects the United States to conduct business fairly, emphasizing that a Council President should not act in a national capacity. He noted that the maintenance of international peace and security and the protection of civilians do not fall under the purview of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). He went on to say there are people and countries who have long dreamed of turning Ukraine into a bridgehead for a war against Russia, and continue to flood the neighbouring country with weapons. They tried to create their own ideology based on the denial of everything Russian, he said, recalling that, during the independence years, a whole generation of Ukrainians were taught to hate Russia. “Russophobia” has become prevalent, he reiterated, adding that “you will not find anything similar” in relation to Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia. Oles Buzina, a Ukrainian historian killed by the nationalists in 2015, rightly said that, with the collapse of the imperial, extreme nationalism, tinged with provincialism, begins to flourish. Ukraine is the most striking example of that, he asserted. Describing the conflict as a proxy war of the collective West against Russia, he said Western countries have frozen accounts belonging to his country in the amount of $300 billion., He went on to point out that his delegation has been talking for eight years about the suffering of the people in Donbas, about shelling by Ukraine’s armed forces and nationalists, and about the deaths resulting from those attacks. After all the crimes committed by the Kyiv regime and Russia’s warnings against them, the special military operation began to liberate Donbas, he added. Western countries dismissed Russia’s security concerns and assured of the purely defensive nature of NATO while moving the bloc closer to Russia’s borders, and today, the West is already talking about the global alliance, including Asia, he pointed out. He said the Russian Federation put forward proposals for a global and indivisible security architecture, but the West arrogantly cast them aside, adding that Westerners only needed Ukraine as an arena of confrontation with Russia., Warning that Kyiv should have no illusions, he said the West will not help Ukraine. Today, people live in a state of disinformation war, he said, adding that its target is Russia. The international community hears only one version of events, and nothing about Ukrainian provocations, such as in Bucha or Kramatorsk, he noted. The Secretary-General’s visit to Russia and Ukraine was presented by both the media and Western politicians in a completely distorted manner, giving the impression that Kyiv and the United Nations managed to “persuade” Russia to open a corridor for the evacuation civilians from Azovstal, he said. Russia opens the corridors regularly and they are open today, he pointed out, saying the problem is that the Azov militants use civilians as a “human shield”., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said her delegation was encouraged by the recent progress regarding safe passage from Mariupol through coordinated action by the United Nations, authorities of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, such initiatives do not alter the obligations of the parties to uphold international humanitarian law, she emphasized, welcoming the Secretary-General’s proposal of a contact group as a starting point and expressing hope to hear more details. Stressing the critical importance of increased humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries hosting refugees, she said that, on 28 April, the United Arab Emirates dispatched a plane carrying 30 additional tons of food supplies to support refugees from Ukraine hosted by the Republic of Moldova., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) appealed to the belligerents to abide by international humanitarian law, emphasizing that civilian structures must never be targeted. It is essential to sustain ceasefires in order to keep humanitarian corridors open, he said. Noting that pressure is increasing on the economy, including on agriculture, he warned that, if the war does not end, the countries facing humanitarian emergencies might collapse, rendering ordinary people “collateral victims”. The solution can only be found through dialogue, he stressed., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said the first and clearest solution to end the suffering of civilians is for Russia to end its illegal war and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. She expressed deep concern that the war is supported by a propaganda campaign, including in the Security Council, designed to dehumanize and demonize Ukrainians by labelling them as neo-Nazis. “This hate speech is extremely dangerous,” she warned. “As we near the anniversary of the end of the Second World War, it disrespects the sacrifices of all of those Russians, Ukrainians and many other nationalities who fought to end true Nazism,” she said, noting that her country has announced a plan today to provide a further £45 million in humanitarian assistance., MONA JUUL (Norway), welcoming the joint statement on freedom of expression, expressed alarmed at the humanitarian situation, including in Mariupol, and concern about the poor condition of many of the evacuees. He called for the voluntary safe passage out of the city for thousands of civilians and hundreds of wounded. Deeply worried that Russia’s intensified hostilities in eastern Ukraine will lead to new besiegement of entire cities and towns, she called upon Moscow to immediately end its relentless attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure. Ukrainian ports must be reopened to allow wheat and grain to reach those in need globally, she said, stressing that the war’s crippling impact on the food security of millions is unacceptable. There must be accountability for the sake of the victims, and all the people of Ukraine, she added., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) noted that his country has been consistently calling for a complete cessation of hostilities and for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out. He strongly condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha and expressed support for an independent investigation. While welcoming the Secretary-General’s visit of to Moscow and Kyiv and his engagement with the leaders of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, he said the conflict is having a destabilizing effect with broader regional and global implications, pointing to skyrocketing oil prices, shortage of food grains and fertilizers, and challenges in food and energy security. That has had a disproportionate impact on developing countries, he noted. Calling for guarantees of safe passage for delivery of essential humanitarian and medical supplies, including through the establishment of humanitarian corridors, he emphasized that humanitarian action must never be politicized., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), Council President for May, spoke in her national capacity to point out that — while Russian forces may have abandoned their attempt to capture Kyiv — the Russian Federation continues to conduct missile strikes against the city and terrorize citizens across Ukraine. Moscow has violated the Charter of the United Nations, ignored global calls to cease its hostilities and continues to wage unprovoked war against its smaller neighbour, she emphasized. Furthermore, the Russian Federation has lied to the Council repeatedly with a wild string of conspiracy theories and misinformation, she said, noting “each falsehood has been more ridiculous than the last”. However, the truth is well-known: the Russian Federation is the only perpetrator of this war, she insisted. In light of that, it is hard to understand why some Council members continue to call on all parties to desist. “Let’s call a spade a spade,” she stressed, urging Council members to call explicitly on the Russian Federation to stop its aggression against Ukraine. “Russia alone started this war, and Russia alone can end it,” she reiterated., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that, while the recent evacuation in Mariupol demonstrated that international organizations can be effective, civilians remain in that city and the evacuation operation must continue. Noting that the Russian Federation has fired more than 2,000 missiles at Ukrainian cities, most of which do not hit military targets, but, rather, are intended to break Ukraine, he declared: “Ukraine is not afraid, and the world should not be afraid either.” Moscow’s missile terrorism must be punished with stronger sanctions and increased military assistance to Ukraine. He also pointed out that Moscow is threatening his country’s food security by stealing grain supplies from temporarily occupied regions and attacking grain silos, farming infrastructure and fertilizer stores. That harms not only Ukraine, but the entire world’s population, he pointed out, demanding that the Russian Federation cease its illicit theft of grain, unblock Ukraine’s ports and restore freedom of navigation., He went on to note the approach of 9 May, saying it brings the threat of escalating provocations, and condemned the Russian Foreign Minister’s recent anti‑Semitic attacks, saying they demonstrate to the world that “Putin’s Russia is cultivating Russian supremacy and hatred of other peoples”. The Russian terrorist practice of shelling Ukrainian citizens with long-range missiles continues, he said, adding that the Security Council’s inaction and ability only to express deep concern continues to irritate the international community and create an atmosphere of impunity. The Council Chamber has “turned from a venue of diplomatic debates into a biological hazard site”, as the Russian envoy leaves a trail of blood and the smell of smouldering corpses behind as he enters and exits the room, he asserted. “Punishment is imminent,” he warned. “Milošević will not stay lonely for too long.”, PIOTR GLIŃSKI, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Culture and National Heritage of Poland, said his country will not cease either to deliver aid to Ukraine or to be a reliable partner for all United Nations system entities involved in providing support. Emphasizing that the number of needy people, and the volume of assistance they require, grow with every day the Russian aggression continues, he highlighted the high-level International Donors’ Conference for Ukraine that Poland and Sweden are holding in Warsaw today. He went on to echo the Secretary-General’s description of the damage to multilateralism caused by the invasion of Ukraine as a “three-dimensional crisis”, pointing out its impact on global food, energy and financial security. The Russian Federation must stop the war and withdraw all its forces from Ukrainian territory, he stressed., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), noting her country’s particular interest in the Mariupol area — home to a centuries-long established Greek community of more than 120,000 — said the city now lies almost entirely destroyed. Greece has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire and the swift creation of humanitarian corridors, she said, adding that the recent evacuation — achieved through persistent United Nations efforts — demonstrated that, “when there is a will, there is a way”. Greece has already delivered multiple packages of needs-based, in-kind humanitarian aid to the suffering Ukrainian people and is welcoming thousands of refugees from that country, she stated, adding that it will support reconstruction in Mariupol and Odessa. She went on to say that, since there can be neither peace nor reconciliation without accountability, Greece will continue actively to raise the issue of Mariupol in all forums and to emphasize that war crimes be investigated thoroughly., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), speaking on behalf of the Baltic States, called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease all hostilities and allow the safe evacuation of the civilians trapped in the Azovstal complex. All relevant United Nations entities should maintain focus on the situation of civilians affected by the Russian Federation’s aggression, he added. Moscow’s denials, deceptions, lies, disinformation, war propaganda, incitement of violence and dehumanizing language do not change the fact that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law against civilians in Ukraine, he said, emphasizing: “Those directly responsible for these war crimes and violations on Ukrainian soil must be held accountable.” The Baltic States will continue their steadfast support for efforts to ensure independent investigations of such crimes, he said, recalling that they were among the first to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court. Noting that the shelling makes it almost impossible for Ukrainian farmers to sow, he said the Russian Federation is also blocking hundreds of ships filled with wheat in the Black Sea, with 20 million tons of grain from the 2021 harvest trapped inside Ukraine., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy) noted that the conflict is not only fuelling one of the most severe humanitarian crises in Europe since the Second World War, but also exacerbating a global food security crisis. Calling on the Russian Federation to ensure safe, rapid and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance, he also urged it to allow the export of crucial Ukrainian agricultural goods in order to alleviate the challenges faced by numerous States of the global South depending on those products. He went on to highlight that his country has transferred €110 million to Ukraine and announced a further loan of €200 million, as well as an additional €36 million in support of humanitarian activities in Ukraine and neighbouring countries., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia) said that, almost worse than the 6,635 civilian casualties — 3,238 deaths and 3,397 injuries — is the reason for them, condemning Moscow’s pretext for its “special military operation” — the de-Nazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. He denounced comments by Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, who claimed that Adolf Hitler was part Jewish, as “particularly hideous” and confirmed his delegation’s efforts to counter the Russian Federation’s disinformation. As a neighbour, Slovakia is particularly alarmed by the refugee crisis, he said, noting that 394,000 refugees have entered his country. “We continue to stand in solidarity with them,” he emphasized, pointing out that Slovakia is among the largest donors per capita of military, humanitarian and financial assistance to Ukraine., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said the world will soon commemorate the end of the Second World War, unleashed by Nazi Germany. Seventy-seven years after that watershed moment, she noted, Russian propaganda is attempting to create an outrageous link between the heroic fighting of the Red Army then against the Nazi regime, and the Kremlin’s current aggression against Ukraine, on the premise that the latter is now a failed State that must be de-Nazified. “This utter nonsense is beyond cynicism,” she said, pointing out that the world can see how so-called Russian “liberation” looks in pictures from Mariupol, Irpin and Bucha, which reveal atrocities and crimes against humanity. “The perpetrators must be held accountable in accordance with international law,” she emphasized. To that end, Germany will contribute additional funding and the secondment of experts to the International Criminal Court, she said. Meanwhile, the Federal Public Prosecutor General has opened structural investigations, preparing the ground for war crime charges, she added. Expressing extreme concern about reports that the Russian parliament is planning to ease rules for the adoption of Ukrainian children, she said Germany will follow that ideologically motivated motion with extreme scrutiny and hold the Russian Federation accountable for its deeds. Germany is also strengthening its humanitarian response, especially through the World Food Programme (WFP), and will prioritize such issues on the agenda of the upcoming Group of Seven foreign, development and agricultural ministerial meetings, she pledged., For information media.

Civil Society Responds — as Health-Care Facilities in Ukraine Come Under Attack,News and Press Release,IPS,HIV/Aids,6 May 2022,"By Eamonn Murphy - The writer is UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director and is leading UNAIDS’ humanitarian response., GENEVA, May 6 2022 (IPS) - Alongside the devastation caused by bombs and bullets, the war in Ukraine has wrought another danger that can be as deadly as the violence itself: the disruption of access to health services for people who will not survive if cut off from health care., Health provision has been badly hit, and supply lines crucial for the delivery of medicines severely disrupted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 186 attacks on health-care facilities since the war began., WHO’s survey showed that of the Ukrainian households in which someone has a chronic health condition, one in three are now unable to get the medicines and care they need., People living with HIV depend upon daily medication to keep them healthy and alive. More than 40 health-care facilities that provided HIV treatment, prevention and care services before the war have closed or been destroyed., Many Ukrainians hemmed in by the conflict are unable to make a journey to the health facilities that remain. Approximately 260 000 Ukrainians are living with HIV. UNAIDS is working with partners to ensure the continuity of HIV services. Disruption to treatment services puts their lives on the line and risks a resurgence of the country’s HIV pandemic., In what is a huge achievement, medicines have successfully been brought into Ukraine, thanks to PEPFAR (the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which has committed US$ 13 million to procure 51 million emergency doses of HIV medicines, enough to keep Ukrainians living with HIV supplied with life-saving treatment for a year., The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria also is fast-tracking US$15 million in emergency funds for Ukraine and some nearby countries to enable continued provision of life-saving care., Now that HIV medicines have reached Ukraine, attention is focused on getting them to everyone who needs them. Before the war, the Ukranian AIDS response had built up an exemplary model of community-led services working in partnership with government. It’s the resilience of that network of community-led services built up over decades that has enabled the AIDS response to continue., The Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and civil society organizations such as 100% Life, the country’s biggest network of people living with HIV, are working together to maintain services., Delivering medicines in this war is a huge logistical and security challenge. Several volunteer drivers working for 100% Life have been killed while trying to deliver desperately needed HIV medicines to front-line areas., Despite the enormous difficulties involved, grass-roots organizations are a lifeline for many people who move to safer places within or outside the country, providing them with humanitarian aid and HIV medicines—even in areas of intense conflict. Their courageous work is saving lives, but the needs and challenges are huge and growing, and resources are not sufficient., “The situation for people living with HIV in Ukraine is desperate. We are trying to deliver medicines, food and other emergency assistance to people in need, but the work is dangerous and volunteer drivers are putting their lives at risk. If we don’t get more help, I am not sure how much longer we can continue, especially reaching people in the front-line zones,” Dmytro Sherembey, the Head of the 100% LIFE Coordination Council, has shared., That is why UNAIDS has issued an urgent call to the international community to upscale support to help these everyday heroes to save lives., The challenge to reach people in need has been greatly exacerbated by the displacement of people. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are now 7.7 million internally displaced people in Ukraine., The war has also caused millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighbouring countries, including Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia., It is estimated that up to 30 000 Ukrainian refugees may currently need HIV medicines as the stocks they carry with them become depleted. WHO has helped to broker a deal with the pharmaceutical company ViiV Healthcare to provide donations of HIV medicines to Czechia, Poland and other European Union countries receiving large numbers of Ukrainian refugees., Ensuring that the medicines get to those who need them requires the involvement of communities of people living with HIV and key population networks in host countries to ensure tailored outreach and trust-building. These community-led organizations require upscaled international support too., It’s clear from listening to those receiving and providing health services on the ground that what Ukraine most needs is peace. That is why the United Nations Secretary-General has called for a complete cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine., The damage of this awful war means, however, that even once there is peace, enormous and long-term needs for international assistance will remain. Support will be needed in particular for community-led organizations, whose partnership with the public health system is key to ensuring health for all., Meanwhile, as the impact of the war worsens, the world must increase support to Ukrainian civil society organizations to maintain health provision. This is vital to preventing a resurgence of Ukraine’s HIV pandemic. And for Ukrainians living with HIV, it is literally a matter of life and death., Civil society networks, on whose creativity and courage HIV services depend, are managing to get life-saving HIV medicines to people. They do it on a shoestring, powered only by determination and love of humanity., Many of those involved are themselves people living with HIV—they understand the gravity of what is at stake if they cannot continue their work. The help they provide to save lives risks their own. They do not seek international admiration, but they do need an upscaling of international help. And they need it now.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/civil-society-responds-health-care-facilities-ukraine-come-under-attack

Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 May 2022,"BACKGROUND, In the 10 weeks since the Russian invasion, a third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes. This is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. As of today, more than 5.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine. A further 7.7 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine. Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., Many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys., UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and for neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., Key figures - UKRAINE, As of 3 May:, 365,391 people reached with essential food and non-food items, winter clothes and shelter materials, 125,058 people received protection assistance, advice and referrals at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 215,114 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance. 131,205 already received first payment, 53,244 people received assistance through humanitarian convoys delivered to hard-hit areas, 35,395 sleeping spaces created / improved in 149 reception centres and collective centres",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-11-5-may-2022

We are distributing 10 litres of water per person to those in need. We also distributed almost 13,000 water containers for 9,000 people., ""One of the biggest problems in eastern Ukraine is that many people have been left without access to drinking water because of the fighting.

PIN is providing more individualised social assistance, counselling, and material and financial support or help with the education of children, Czech and Ukrainian teachers. We are working on developing longer-term housing, and we are supporting Czech towns and villages in working towards systemic changes regarding helping Ukrainians., We are updating data and analysing the distribution of refugees across the Czech Republic. Where the number of Ukrainian refugees is the highest, we propose relocations based on housing availability elsewhere. We are also looking at job opportunities and school capacity. We specifically consider the economic situation in the poorest localities not to burden them further., We are recruiting new field workers, On Monday, we opened a social counselling centre in Karlovy Vary, where our ten staff are working in cooperation with the maternity centre and the city to support Ukrainians. We are running counselling services for Ukrainians, for example, in our Beroun centre.

Intense fighting and bombardments continued to affect multiple areas across Ukraine, mainly reported in eastern Ukraine – in Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts – but also in the south, while the overall security situation continued to deteriorate. Several missile strikes were reported across the country, hitting civilian infrastructure and leading to civilian losses. On 3 May, several missiles were reported to have struck the western city of Lviv (Lvivska oblast), where dozens of UN and humanitarian partners’ staff are now based. On the same evening, there was also a reported missile attack on railway infrastructure in Kirovohradska oblast in central Ukraine – at a major junction for trains evacuating civilians – and in other oblasts, including, for the first time, Zakarpatska oblast, Ukraine’s westernmost oblast., Such wide-ranging, repeated missile attacks were frequently reported over the past week, reportedly affecting an industrial facility in Zaporizka oblast (south-east) on 26 April, an industrial site in Dnipropetrovska oblast (centre) and in the capital, Kyiv, on 28 April., As hostilities continue unabated, thousands of civilians remain trapped in areas of active hostilities with limited opportunities to relocate to safer areas. The situation in eastern and parts of southern Ukraine remains particularly challenging due to active fighting and difficulties with agreeing on safe passages for civilians with relevant parties. Despite immense challenges, the UN, in coordination with ICRC, supported the evacuation of civilians sheltering at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and nearby areas. The operation was carried out in coordination with the parties to the conflict and other relevant actors. The operation started on Friday, 29 April, with a joint UN/ICRC convoy and a fleet of buses reaching the plant the following morning. Further negotiations ensued, followed by a difficult journey out of Mariupol 230 kilometres north-west to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast). By 3 May, 101 civilians had been successfully evacuated from the Azovstal factory in Mariupol, 69 of whom chose to join the convoy to Zaporizhzhia. An additional 58 people were permitted to join the evacuation convoy in the town of Manhush (Donetska oblast) along the way, so that on 3 May, the operation brought 127 evacuated civilians to Zaporizhzhia, where they received initial humanitarian assistance, including health and psychological care. On 4 May, Humanitarian Coordinator Osnat Lubrani confirmed that a new safe-passage operation to evacuate civilians stranded in Mariupol and other communities had been completed that day – and that over 320 more civilians from Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast), Manhush, Mariupol, Tokmak and Vasylivka (Zaporizka oblast) had also arrived and were receiving humanitarian assistance in Zaporizhzhia., Civilian casualties. As of 4 May, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 6,731, including 3,280 killed and 3,451 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). More than half (3,422) of all casualties so far verified have been recorded in Government- and non-Government-controlled areas (GCA and NGCA) of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. OHCHR believes that the actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Institute of Mass Information (IMI) reported that, with the death of a Radio Liberty journalist in a reported missile strike on a residential building in Kyiv on 28 April, 22 journalists have so far been killed since 24 February.
IMI said that seven journalists were killed in the line of duty – including four foreigners and three Ukrainians, five men and two women. It said the other 15 journalists – 13 men and two women – died not while performing their professional duties but rather as victims of shelling and shooting or, in the case of six of the men, as participants in the hostilities. The UN does not have the means to verify these numbers and particular cases., Impacts on health care. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that immediate steps are needed to prevent a measles outbreak due to the ongoing hostilities and low vaccination rates. It said that 85 per cent of eligible children in Ukraine received their first dose of measles vaccine in 2020 – which, while a significant improvement compared to the low of 42 per cent in 2016, is still below the recommended 95 per cent or higher each year to achieve and maintain herd immunity and protect the population. With first the COVID-19 pandemic and now the ongoing war leading to severe disruptions to the Ukrainian health system, including routine immunizations, WHO is seriously concerned about a potential measles outbreak, which could have devastating health consequences. WHO said immunization gaps among Ukrainian children, adolescents and adults led to measles outbreaks in 2012 and then again from mid-2017 to the end of 2019, when Ukraine had the second-largest measles outbreak reported globally. WHO said, despite the challenges, it is continuing to work with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to provide COVID-19 vaccinations as well as routine vaccinations of children for a range of diseases, including measles, rubella, diphtheria and polio – and including of internally displaced children in 10 oblasts across the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-6-may-2022
UNICEF Geneva Palais briefing note on the situation of children in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,6 May 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by Aaron Greenberg, UNICEF’s Regional Child Protection Adviser for Europe and Central Asia Region – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, GENEVA, 6 May 2022—""The situation in Ukraine is a child protection crisis of extraordinary proportion, the likes of which we perhaps haven’t seen before., “Two months of war in Ukraine have left 7.7 million people internally displaced and driven over 5.5 million people across international borders, including nearly two-thirds of all children in Ukraine. Hundreds of children have been killed and many more have been injured. Nearly 200 attacks have been reported against health care facilities, and schools continue to be impacted by strikes., “While the Government of Ukraine and humanitarian partners continue to work to protect the most vulnerable children, the needs are tremendous., “Let me remind colleagues of something that’s important in our view to recall. Ukraine had the highest number of children in institutional care across Europe prior to the war -- over 90,000 living in institutions, orphanages, boarding schools and other care facilities. Nearly half of them are children with disabilities., The impact of the war on these children has been particularly devastating. Tens of thousands of children living in institutional or foster care have been returned to families, many of them hastily, as they war got started. Many have not received the care and protection they require, especially children with disabilities., “The war has impacted all children’s psychosocial wellbeing. All of them. Children have been uprooted from their homes, separated from caregivers and directly exposed to war. Children have been shaken by bomb explosions and the blaring sirens of missile alert systems. Nearly all children are coping with the absence of their fathers, older male siblings or uncles as nearly all men between the ages of 18-60 are mobilized for the war effort. And, most importantly, many children have witnessed or experienced physical and sexual violence., “But children are resilient. UNICEF’s decades long experience working with children affected by armed conflict has clearly shown that a large number of impacted children will bounce back if they get back to school, remain connected to family and loved ones, and get back some normalization in their lives. A sub-set will need more intensive psychological support. And a smaller, but important number, will present symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder usually after 2-4 months of their experience. This group will need intensive support from a dedicated cadre of professionals., “Let me emphasize a particular problem we’re seeing. The workforce in Ukraine – social workers, child psychologists, and other professionals – are equally impacted by this conflict. And the country needs them now – perhaps more than ever. Retaining the workforce and supporting them to stay and deliver is more important than ever. We must stand in solidarity with the backbone of Ukraine’s social service workforce. We are here in L’viv looking at options for what is going to be a significant roll-out of support through existing government systems to support that workforce., “UNICEF is working in overdrive, supporting Government, coordinating child protection partners, and scaling investments in local NGOs and government services., “Let me highlight a number of statistics from our side. Since 24 February, UNICEF and partners have reached over 140,000 children and their caregivers with Mental Health and Psychosocial services, a vast majority of that are direct engagements with children and trained psychologists. Over 34,000 children have benefited from specialized services through social work case management and referral to support services as we scale mobile teams of social workers, child psychologists, nurses and lawyers. We now have 56 operational mobile units across the country, including 12 in the East. Over 7,000 women and children have been reached by violence prevention, risk mitigation and violence response services, including gender-based violence, including in the eastern areas of the country., “But it’s not enough. Although we are working in overdrive, I think we must be prepared with more specialized services for child survivors of physical and sexual violence. And children with disabilities, who have suffered disproportionately as a result of this war, must receive urgent support. The Government, UNICEF, and partners are scaling more services to these children now.”, #####, Multimedia materials are available here, Find out more about UNICEF's work in Ukraine here, Media contacts, James Elder

Every day that the war in Ukraine continues is a nightmare for millions of children,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,5 May 2022,"UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell's remarks at the High-Level International Donor's Conference for Ukraine, **NEW YORK, 5 May 2022 - ""**Every day that the war in Ukraine continues is a nightmare for millions of children., ""Nearly two-thirds of Ukraine’s children have been forced to flee. Many have seen things no child should ever see., ""Their homes have been hit. Their schools have been attacked, along with all the systems that could help them survive., ""And we must never forget the hundreds of children who have not survived – many of them killed by explosive weapons – and hundreds of other children who have been wounded in this senseless war., ""Every minute counts in the effort to help every child affected by the war. Reaching them is extremely challenging - especially in parts of eastern Ukraine where shelling and attacks are continuous., ""From the very start of this war, UNICEF has been working wherever children need us to be – from the frontlines to the borders, to the countries hosting refugees., ""We have delivered millions of dollars worth of emergency supplies to hospitals, shelters, train stations, schools, and child protection centres and trucked in safe water for over a million people. And both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries we are operating ongoing programmes reaching children with child protection services, education, health care and social protection support., ""We will continue doing everything we can for Ukraine’s children -- to meet their urgent needs and also to support critical social services that build resilience, so they can rebuild their lives someday., ""I wish this was enough. It is not. Only peace will ever be enough to give these children back even a fraction of what they have lost. Until then, we will stay and deliver for Ukraine’s children and families., ""In closing, I would like to express my appreciation for the tremendous efforts by our UN teams both inside and outside of Ukraine – and for the solidarity Poland and other refugee-hosting countries continue to show., ""I would also like to express our gratitude to our donors in every sector.

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 May 2022,"Wet, dark cellars, basements, old bomb shelters and metro stations have become homes, schools, playgrounds and refuges for thousands of people in eastern Ukraine. These are the only safe places available for many living close to the frontline and suffering from constant shelling. In cities like Lyman, Lysychansk, Izium, Sievierodonetsk, Kharkiv or Avdiivka, most people have already left their homes. Still, many thousands remain—some trapped because there is no more public transportation, and others simply do not want to abandon their homes for various reasons. The availability of fuel is also declining in Ukraine, affecting people’s ability to move to safer areas., ""We had to leave Sievierodonetsk which is in Luhansk Oblast as it was under constant shelling. In my neighbourhood, every house has been touched by the fighting. I spent most of my time in a basement with my six-year-old son, but I decided to leave as I didn't want him to go through this horror anymore,"" says Iryna who is staying in a PIN supported collective centre in western Ukraine., ""It’s only safe in the basement. It’s good that we have one. We didn’t want to leave. We realise we won’t be able to return here soon,"" says Yevhenia evacuated from Lyman, in a report to Radio Free Europe., ""We were hiding in the basement. There were Grad rockets. It’s very scary. We were crying - my wife and our child who is turning 3-months-old soon. We don’t know how we are going to live. We've taken all we could,"" says Ihor—who was just evacuated from Lyman—to Levko Stek from Radio Svoboda., Candles, torches, and psychological support, People hiding for weeks in basements need water, food, hygiene items and medicine. ""Bomb shelters also need blankets, pillows, bed linen, and mattresses because often it is wet in the shelters, and they quickly become dirty,"" says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for the Eastern Partnership and the Balkans. ""People sheltering in basements also need candles, solar-powered torches, dishes or kitchen utensils. Psychological support is among biggest needs,"" he adds., The situation in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in eastern Ukraine is especially dire. Recent data by UN OCHA shows that more than 47 per cent of all casualties so far verified in Ukraine have been recorded in those two regions alone. Furthermore, a survey conducted by HelpAge International found that 99% of older people in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts had no plans to leave., Of the estimated 7.7 million people displaced within Ukraine, those who originally resided in the east now represent 45% of the entire displaced population; this is 3,468,000 people. According to a recent survey by IOM, 41% of all internally displaced people in Ukraine come from just 3 regions in eastern Ukraine - 21% are from Kharkiv Oblast, 15% from Donetsk Oblast and 5% from Luhansk Oblast., The water situation is critical, The situation in eastern Ukraine deteriorates as fighting advances, making the water supply situation critical. In the east, there are over 1.4 million people without access to safe water according to UNICEF reports. In many places, centralised water is not available; it is only available twice a week for a few hours in other locations. ""The only solution for the people is to bring them bottled water or establish water tanks and arrange regular water trucking,"" says Petr Drbohlav, In Donetsk Oblast, electricity and gas are still available in most places; in Luhansk Oblast, however, gas and electricity are not working in most settlements. The situation in Kharkiv Oblast is better, but the infrastructure is damaged in many places and electricity, gas, and water systems are not working in some places., The situation with food is deteriorating quickly. Basic food is available but limited. Hygiene items, especially diapers and female hygiene products, are among the biggest needs., According to a PIN survey, services like medical institutions, local authorities, communal services and the banking system are still working, but they are limited as many people left Donetsk Oblast. ""The situation in Luhansk Oblast is much worse with many authorities having left, the banking system is not operational in many locations, the internet is almost not working, the mobile connection is minimal and medical institutions are providing only first aid,"" says Petr Drbohlav based on the recent survey., Mattresses for bomb shelters in Kharkiv, Humanitarian access is challenging, and distributions are unsafe, especially in areas of ongoing fighting. For example, in Sievierodonetsk, the warehouse with goods and strategic reserves was destroyed during the fighting. Despite the challenges, People in Need and our partners are still doing their best to deliver aid to eastern Ukraine., In the last week alone, we delivered 500 mattresses to bomb shelters and health facilities in Kharkiv and 10 tonnes of food for 700 people to frontline locations in Donetsk oblast. The next 40 tonnes of food and hygiene items should arrive in cities in Donetsk Oblast in the coming days., People in Need continues to deliver humanitarian aid to other parts of Ukraine as well. This month alone, we supplied water to 18,500 people in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. In the Mykolaiv Oblast alone, we have distributed water to 11,000 people. We distributed 10 litres of water per person. We also distributed almost 13,000 water containers for 9,000 people.

On 1-2 May, the United Nations and ICRC helped facilitate the evacuation of 101 ciivilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and 58 persons from Mangush (Donetsk region). In coordination with this operation, IOM Ukraine assisted with the evacuation of civilians in Zaporizhzhia. Alongside these efforts, the Governor of Luhansk region urged the population to evacuate from Severodonetks, Rubizhne, Lysycahnsk, and Hirske. Meanwhile, the evacuation from Popasna was suspended after the shelling of two evacuation buses on 29 April and the disappearance of all persons on board. The route of the evacuation train following from Pokrovsk was changed on 3 May and the train will follow to Lviv instead of Chop., OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 2 May, there have been 6,546 civilian casualties, including 3,193 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA).

WFP welcomes EUR 25 million from the European Union for humanitarian multipurpose cash and food assistance in Ukraine and Moldova,News and Press Release,WFP,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",6 May 2022,"LVIV – The United Nations World Food Programme welcomes a contribution of EUR 25 million from the European Union to provide humanitarian food assistance to people affected by the conflict in Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. This funding contributes to the provision of multipurpose cash as well as immediate food relief to families in conflict-affected areas in Ukraine, and to displaced people from Ukraine in Moldovan transit sites and receptions centres., As WFP continues to call on everyone to grant safe access to humanitarian relief operations in encircled and partially encircled cities in Ukraine, the generosity of WFP's partners is enabling us to scale up our response to the conflict, with the goal of supporting six million people caught up in the world's fastest-growing humanitarian crisis., In Ukraine, families in conflict-affected areas are receiving food and ready-to-eat rations, while in areas where markets are functioning, multipurpose cash is being distributed so families can buy what they need most urgently. In Moldova, displaced people from Ukraine currently in transit sites and reception centres receive hot meals., “We welcome this generous contribution from the European Union, which will help support the countless families who have had to flee for their lives and are struggling to put food on the table amid this humanitarian catastrophe,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “It’s thanks to partners like the EU, who have stepped up with immediate funding, that WFP has already reached 3.4 million people in Ukraine and Moldova since the start of the war. But millions more urgently need our help.”, “The European Union has been working around the clock to ensure that life-saving aid reaches civilians in Ukraine,” said European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič. “Humanitarian partners like WFP continue to deliver urgently needed emergency assistance to the most vulnerable as we speak.”, Over 7.7 million people are displaced inside Ukraine and the pre-conflict supply chain systems for feeding the country’s population have broken down in many areas. WFP estimates almost half of the people in the country are worried about finding enough to eat., The conflict in Ukraine is also triggering a wave of collateral hunger elsewhere in the world. Global food prices have increased sharply since the onset of the conflict and are now at an all-time high. These hikes are expected to further limit access to food for millions of people who are already under stress because of food inflation in their countries., /# # #, The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change., Follow us on Twitter @wfp_media / @wfp_europe, CONTACT, For more information please contact (email address: firstname.lastname@wfp.org):, Paul Anthem, WFP/Lviv,

Ukraine: Migrants Locked Up Near Front Lines [EN/AR/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,6 May 2022,"Free Migration Detainees; Allow Them to Leave Country for Safety, (Berlin) – Migrants and asylum seekers locked up in a migrant detention center in Mykolaiv on the edge of the front lines in southern Ukraine are in danger and should be released, Human Rights Watch said today. Ukraine should urgently release the dozens of migrants and asylum seekers arbitrarily detained in this and another detention center and allow them to reach safety in neighboring countries., “Migrants and asylum seekers have been locked up for nearly two months on the edge of a war zone,” said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Detainees are terrified and in danger, and there is no justification for keeping them in immigration detention.”, In mid-April 2022, Human Rights Watch interviewed two men by telephone who are being held in the Temporary Holding Center for Foreigners and Stateless People in Mykolaiv region, close to frontline hostilities. On April 4, Human Rights Watch had released a report based on interviews with migrants and asylum seekers detained in the Zhuravychi Migrant Accommodation Center in Volyn’ oblast, a former military barracks one hour from Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine. Migrants and asylum seekers also remain in detention at the Zhuravychi center., People interviewed in both centers said that they had been detained in the months prior to the Russian invasion for irregularly trying to cross the border into Poland or for visa irregularities. Whatever the original basis for detaining them, their continued detention is arbitrary and places them at risk of harm from military hostilities, Human Rights Watch said. If they were being detained administratively for the purpose of removal, since Ukraine is not able to deport anyone at this time because of the conflict, the reason for their detention evaporates, and further detention becomes arbitrary., Human Rights Watch wrote to the Ukrainian authorities on March 9 and April 20 about the situation of people still held in immigration detention and seeking the grounds for their detention but has not received a response., In March, the Global Detention Project reported that a third detention center, the Chernihiv Temporary Holding Center, had been emptied of migrants and asylum seekers. In early May, Borys Kryvov, deputy director of the Chernihiv center, told Human Rights Watch that the facility had been hit by munitions he believes were fired by a drone on March 30, after people had been evacuated, shattering windows in the dining hall and dormitory and damaging the roof. While the damage was limited, it underscores the need to urgently evacuate people from Zhuravychi and Mykolaiv before these centers are also targeted in an attack., Interviewees in both centers said guards told them they could leave the Zhuravychi or Mykolaiv facilities if they joined the Ukrainian war effort, and that the guards promised them they would be granted Ukrainian citizenship and documentation if they joined. The interviewees said that no one accepted the offer., People in both facilities said that since the Russian invasion, they have felt terrified being locked up in a war zone. The Zhuravychi center is close to the Belarusian border and in March, people there said they heard explosions and artillery fire. The Mykolaiv facility is extremely close to the frontline and men we interviewed said they can hear and see military planes flying over the detention facility and the sounds of explosions and artillery at regular intervals. In a text message to Human Rights Watch on April 28, one man there said, “I lost hope … I think death is very close.” All men interviewed said they wished to leave as soon as possible and to seek refuge in neighboring countries with other civilians fleeing Ukraine., Some people from both Zhuravychi and Mykolaiv have been released and evacuated to Poland with the aid and assistance of their embassies in neighboring countries. While the involvement of embassies of third country nationals might be needed at some point to assist with identity and travel documents, this should not be used as a reason to delay the urgent release of everyone currently held in both centers so that they can move to safety. Detainees from the Chernihiv migrant detention center in Chernihiv oblast were allowed to leave promptly after it became clear they were in danger. According to diplomatic sources, all released detainees formerly at Chernihiv have crossed the border out of Ukraine., Two men at the Mykolaiv center have received letters from their embassies, that were also sent to Ukrainian officials, asking the Ukrainian authorities to urgently facilitate their release, but both remain in detention., The European Union has long funded Ukraine’s border control and migration management programs and funded the International Center for Migration Policy Development to construct the perimeter security systems at Zhuravychi migrant detention center. The core of the EU’s strategy has been to stop the flow of migrants and asylum seekers into the EU by shifting the burden and responsibility for migrants and refugees to countries neighboring the EU, in this case Ukraine., “Now that Ukraine has become a war zone, the EU should do all it can to facilitate the release and safe passage of people that Ukraine has detained based, in part, on agreements and financial support from the EU,” Hardman said. “At a time when the EU is welcoming Ukrainian refugees, the EU should throw a lifeline to migrants and asylum seekers still in danger in Ukraine.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-migrants-locked-near-front-lines

Recovery and Reconstruction",6 May 2022,"More than nine weeks of war have led to senseless loss of life, massive devastation in urban centres, and the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure. As of the end of April more than 1,400 education facilities and kindergartens, 231 medical institutions, 173 factories and enterprises, 75 administrative buildings, and 130 cultural buildings have been damaged or destroyed. More than 12 million Ukrainians have been displaced, fleeing violence, and seeking peace –more than 5 million have crossed into other countries and over 7 million are internally displaced., As the fighting continues, and in parallel with a strong focus on humanitarian support, UNDP is working closely with Government of Ukraine to plan for early recovery and reconstruction. UNDP and its partners are developing ambitious strategies to rebuild this great nation for when peace finally returns. As of 31 April 2022, these activities include:, On 6 April, the Government of Japan announced a US$4.5 million contribution to UNDP to help ensure safe human mobility and access to essential goods and services. Specific activities within this initiative will start immediately in Irpin and Bucha, and will include:, 1. Identifying critical delivery routes in close coordination with local authorities to facilitate the delivery of goods and to provide access for humanitarian actors;, 2. Surveying and clearing identified routes of explosive ordnances in coordination with the National Mine Action Authority; and, 3. Ensuring safe passage along the identified routes by removing unstable structures and debris., UNDP designed and launched, in partnership with the Ministry of Digital Transformation and the Ministry of Social Policy, a mobile application to facilitate the online registration of IDPs. The innovation, supported by the Government of Sweden, also allows IDPs to apply for government support and assistance. More than 270,000 Ukrainians registered as IDPs on the platform within the first week of its launch., UNDP conducted an e-learning course for staff at the headquarters and regional network of the Ombudsperson Office on the implementation of international humanitarian and criminal law during war. The purpose of the training was to enhance the institution’s capacity to monitor human rights developments during the ongoing conflict. Participants learned the basics of international humanitarian and criminal law, including (i) the legal mechanisms to protect human rights during war settings; (ii) war crimes and crimes against humanity; (iii) the difference between information and evidence; and (iv) how to document war crimes., UNDP expanded and consolidated its knowledge management capacity in areas of assessments, damage and losses estimations, analysis, resource mobilization, and dissemination with the specific objectives of:, 1. Providing knowledge management support, including the consolidation, updating and storage of evidence and indicators, to inform UNDP’s planning, implementation, and advocacy efforts;, 2. Strengthening the capacity of government counterparts in areas of damage assessment methodologies, including but not limited to the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing; and, 3. Establishing an information repository/portal to collate and archive relevant baseline and assessments to be used, with partners, to identify and address information gaps in preparation for post-conflict needs assessments., The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Ukraine launched ‘ReStart Ukraine’ – an open-source collective of researchers and practitioners designed to collaboratively explore and develop the best ways to restore affected and afflicted urban and rural areas when the war is over. Partners on the platform include the Goethe Institut, the 1991 Open Data Incubator, the University of Essex, the European Council of Spatial Planners, and many others. It is structured around three phases:, 1. Building a framework for restoring and rebuilding strategies;, 2. Developing tools and guidelines for each step and defining approaches; and, 3. Rebuilding, Restoring, Restarting through a multi-stakeholder process in collaboration with local and national governments., A socio-economic baseline analysis was finalized for Lviv Oblast. The predictive analysis is based on the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation (SCORE) Index – an evidence-based analytical instrument designed to measure the various components of social cohesion, as well as resilience capacities and vulnerability factors, so as to inform peacebuilding and development efforts. The findings present the (pre-war) baseline data on the main economic, social and inter-group factors that can affect both the immediate response and planning activities of the Government of Ukraine in their reconstruction efforts., To meet the urgent needs of the health sector, the UNDP procured and delivered (i) US$4.8 million worth of medical equipment for HIV diagnostics, medicines for adult and child juvenile arthritis, medicine for children haemophilia, and medicine for transplantology; (ii) first-aid kits and generators to police units in hard-to-reach areas of Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia; and (iii) 1,723 tonnes of food supplies for the State Emergency Services unit in Donetsk., In April, construction work commenced in five locations in Poltava and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts: (i) the reconstruction of a cultural education centre and of an arts school in Myrhorod, Poltava Oblast; (ii) the reconstruction of two schools in Kamianske, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast; (iii) major repairs to a school in Andriivka village, Poltava Oblast., Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about access to information during the war, the right to information, the online publication of official data, access and other issues were answered and published on the Ombudsperson website., Relatedly, through a multi-sectoral framework loan of EUR 200 million funded by the EIB and supported by UNDP to assist local authorities rehabilitate critical municipal infrastructure and improve living conditions for IDPs and their host communities, UNDP assessed the damage inflicted by the war to the project sites in nine government-controlled oblasts., Supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Coordination Centre for Legal Aid Provision produced a series of informational publications on legal aid during the war. These printed materials aim to help people to better understand legislative changes and resolve their legal issues during the war. From advice on accessing compensation to understanding ones’ rights, the series of booklets and leaflets provide millions of Ukrainians with vital up-to-the-minute legal information, both in print and digitally, and also provide connections for people in need of access to free legal aid., In April, UNDP Ukraine, with the support of Japan, launched a new initiative operationalizing the national component of a global programme that promotes responsible business by strengthening human rights standards, particularly in context of the ongoing war and post-conflict restoration. The project will serve two main purposes. First, it will guide companies in carrying out Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse impacts. The second objective of the project is to support the development of policies to tackle business-related human rights abuses., Within the national Anti-Crisis platform, UNDP partnered with the Zaporizhzhya Chamber of Commerce and Industry to conduct two interactive events, at which over 137 representatives (55 percent women) from various MSMEs learned about how military actions are changing global and Ukrainian value chains, and how businesses should adapt to the new business environment., UNDP’s Resilience Building and Recovery Programme for Ukraine is responding to multiple dimensions of the ongoing crisis. The offer hinges on three pillars of support: Supporting the Government-led crisis response and public service delivery at the national and local levels; Leveraging Ukraine’s high human capital, productive capacities, and natural resources to meet immediate humanitarian needs while promoting social and economic recovery; and Strengthening Ukrainian institutions and civil society organizations to maintain the social fabric, uphold human rights, and ensure inclusion, protection, and the empowerment of all people, leaving no one behind.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/summary-undp-s-activities-ukraine-1-31-april
UNECE to coordinate UN Task Force on new Master Plan for the city of Kharkiv,News and Press Release,UNECE,Recovery and Reconstruction,6 May 2022,"The war has already caused the destruction of infrastructure in many urban areas of Ukraine and will require enormous efforts by the government and international partners to reconstruct following the cessation of hostilities., In April 2022, the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development developed draft recommendations for plans for rebuilding cities and human settlements, which are expected to be applied by local governments as part of the reconstruction efforts., Building on longstanding cooperation, the Ministry requested UNECE support for the further development of the Recommendations. In response, UNECE established the UN4Kharkiv Task Force which now comprises more than ten UN agencies who work together to support efforts of the government in developing innovative approaches to rebuilding cities in Ukraine. The Task Force includes representatives of the UN Resident Coordinator office in Ukraine, UNOPS, UNDP Ukraine, UNEP, UNDRR, WHO, IOM, OCHA, OHCHR, UN-Habitat and UNICEF Ukraine. UNECE coordinates activities of the Task Force., As part of the cooperation, the Ministry initiated a first pilot project on the development of a reconstruction plan for the city of Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, which is expected to become a blueprint for the reconstruction of other Ukrainian cities., The Mayor of Kharkiv Ihor Terekhov met at the Second UNECE Forum of Mayors on 5 April 2022 with Architect Lord Norman Foster who supports the organization of the Forums of Mayors and acts as its informal patron. At the Forum of Mayors, Mr. Terekhov outlined his vision for rebuilding of the city and invited Norman Foster to develop the new city master plan., Lord Foster accepted the invitation and has released a manifesto to rebuild the city of Kharkiv where he pledged ""to assemble the best minds with the best planning, architectural, design and engineering skills"", bringing together top Ukrainian talents with worldwide expertise and advice. According to the manifesto, “the first step would be a city masterplan linked to the region, with the ambition to combine the most loved and revered heritage from the past with the most desirable and greenest elements of infrastructure and buildings – in other words to deliver the city of the future now and to plan for its life decades ahead. A masterplan is an act of confidence in the future for generations still to come.”, The Mayor of Kharkiv Ihor Terekhov outlined his vision for the new master plan: “In the new and peaceful Kharkiv, we would like to pay great attention to developing the IT sector, high-tech industrial parks and industry. It is an opportunity to reconstruct large production facilities and breathe into them a second life. In terms of architecture, comfort and security, the city of Kharkiv should achieve a completely different level. Our plans are to build a state-of-the-art city centre, to diversify our neighbourhoods so that they would differ from each other. We will also build bomb shelters, dual-use underground parking lots, multi-level road junctions, bike paths, new recreation areas, parks and squares”., Work on the Master Plan started on 12 April 2022 with the first coordination meeting of the UN4Kharkiv Task Force. The work on collection of data and information for the Kharkiv Master Plan is ongoing. Weekly coordination meetings between the city administration of Kharkiv, the Norman Foster Foundation, involved international and national experts are organized by UNECE. Four working groups were established on: (1) Development of the master plan; (2) Public consultation on “Kharkiv before the war and after”; (3) Master plan design and architecture bringing together both international and local architects and architecture experts; (4) Assessment of destructions in the city., In parallel to the development of the Master Plan, the UN4Kharkiv Task Force is working on redesigning the national draft recommendations for plans for rebuilding cities and human settlements and mapping capacities of UN agencies and of available approaches and instruments to support the government’s efforts to rebuild Ukrainian cities and regions. The Presentation of the first outcomes of the UN4Kharkiv Task Force is expected to take place on 24 May 2022., “Negotiations must bring an end to this senseless war now so that urgently needed sustainable developments efforts may resume. Amid the ongoing destruction and suffering in Ukraine, we must also keep hope and look to the future. This is why UNECE is fully committed to working with the Government of Ukraine and the city of Kharkiv to plan ahead for sustainable reconstruction efforts, connecting the expertise and vision of our partners in the UN system and Lord Foster”, stated UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova., UNECE has a longstanding partnership with the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine, dating back to 2011-2012, with the launch of the Country Profile on Housing and Land Management. The latest project was the preparation of an economic and financial recovery and rebuilding plan after the COVID-19 pandemic for the city of Kharkiv., The Norman Foster Foundation hosts a UNECE Centre of Excellence on Smart Sustainable Cities and Sustainable Housing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unece-coordinate-un-task-force-new-master-plan-city-kharkiv

Update 73 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (05 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,5 May 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, today met with the head of Ukraine’s regulatory body, Oleh Korikov, to discuss the Agency’s efforts to help ensure the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities during the current conflict., In their meeting at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna, Director General Grossi and Korikov, Chair of the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), also spoke about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in southern Ukraine., The Director General said the IAEA is “ready to fulfil its indispensable role” related to nuclear safety and security at the NPP, which is Ukraine’s biggest with six reactors. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhya NPP two months ago, but its Ukrainian personnel are continuing to operate the plant. Ukraine last week informed the IAEA that they were “working under unbelievable pressure”., Thursday’s meeting came a day after Director General Grossi “stressed the urgency of ensuring the safety” of the Zaporizhzhya NPP in a meeting with Alexey Likhachev, Director General of Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, and other senior Russian officials in Istanbul., In his summary report on nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine that was issued on 28 April, Director General Grossi said the situation at the Zaporizhzhya NPP “continues to be challenging and requires continued attention owing to the presence of Russian forces and Rosatom personnel at the site while operational management remains with Ukrainian plant operators”., The report added that “the Director General has proposed to lead a visit to the Zaporizhzhya NPP after the necessary consultations and at the earliest possible opportunity”., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four NPPs, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, following last week’s visit of IAEA inspectors and technicians to the Chornobyl NPP, data from all unattended monitoring systems installed at the site has now been fully recovered. Also, as a result of the deployment of new transmission channels based on satellite technologies, the remote transfer of the safeguards data to the Agency’s Vienna headquarters has been fully restored with the exception of one facility for which technical work is still required. The transmission from the Chornobyl NPP had been interrupted for two months. For the other NPPs in Ukraine, remote data continues to be transferred to the IAEA.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-73-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-05-may-2022
"Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths, Remarks to the UN Security Council on Ukraine, 5 May 2022",News and Press Release,OCHA,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",5 May 2022,"New York, 5 May 2022, As Delivered, Linda, Madam President,, Thank you very much indeed., As we have just heard from the Secretary-General, elements of diplomatic progress are coming into view, even as civilian suffering mounts., So, I’ll speak briefly today, if I may, about the human toll of this war, and then about what we are doing to address humanitarian needs, including a short update on our latest operations., And I know that High Commissioner Bachelet will, of course, detail the impact on civilians, so I will be brief.
Just to recap:, The destruction of civilian infrastructure has come to characterize this conflict. Apartment buildings, schools and hospitals in populated areas have been attacked, and they must not be so.Over 13 million Ukrainians have now been forced to flee their homes, of whom 7.7 million are displaced inside Ukraine., Lives have been uprooted, ripped apart, and never will be the same again. And many others couldn’t run. Often the most vulnerable are simply stuck. The elderly, people with disabilities have been unable to seek shelter from bombs, get out to gather supplies or receive information on evacuations., And the threat of gender-based violence — including conflictrelated sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and human trafficking — has, as you will hear from the other briefers, risen hugely since the war began. Allegations of sexual violence against women, girls, men and boys are mounting., Roads, as we have all seen, are heavily contaminated with explosive ordnance, putting civilians at risk and stopping humanitarian convoys from reaching them., Madam President,, Let me briefly brief you on what the UN and our humanitarian partners are trying to do inside Ukraine to meet these growing needs., We have 217 humanitarian partners with whom we are working in Ukraine. And I think we have now scaled up at record speed. We have more than 1,400 staff — UN staff — deployed across the country, operating out of eight hubs beyond Kyiv, with staff, warehouses and supplies in 30 locations, principally, of course, across the east, where the war is happening and the needs are greatest., We reached more than 4.1 million people with some form of assistance on a daily basis across all the country’s 24 oblasts., Our humanitarian response has three main aspects., First, we deliver a great deal of humanitarian assistance and protection services to displaced people, and I know it’s not enough, and I’m sure it’s inadequate, and I know we will hear more on that., But that’s all across the country, especially where internally displaced people have sought safety, or where people have begun returning — a crucial, crucial new element — to severely damaged communities., And when I was in Irpin just a few weeks ago, the mayor was describing to us — as he, I think, described to the SecretaryGeneral — how his people are trying to get back to Irpin, but to do so, the reconstruction will take, as he’s put it, a year and a half., So, restoring basic services necessary to survival is key. And I was very struck by the fact that the International Committee of the Red Cross very, very quickly after the conversation I’d had — but not as a result of that — went in to repair the basic-services element for the population of Irpin to be able to return., In these areas, injecting cash aid allows civilians to choose what they need and offers a modicum of dignity in these fractious times., It helps to keep markets open and liquidity and supply chains moving., We plan to reach 1.3 million people with cash assistance, plugging into Ukraine’s social protection system with top-up payment, working with the Government, working with the Prime Minister and his plans for the distribution of cash to his people to reach families at risk., This is needed… and is now largely achieved. Cash-based aid will now scale up very, very quickly indeed., That’s the first part. The second part of our response is working on pre-positioning supplies to forward operating bases and increasing our preparedness in areas to where we think, we imagine this war might move next., And third, as we heard from the Secretary-General, we engage every single day with parties to the conflict to push for the movement of aid to civilians in areas of active conflict, or to negotiate to help civilians leave for safer areas., We have been able, Madam President, so far, to stage five interagency aid convoys to some of the hardest-hit areas — operations which required a humanitarian notification system to both parties to allow for those safe passage movements., They’ve been a lifeline, a small mercy perhaps, to civilians encircled by fighting, bringing in medical supplies, water, food rations, non-food items and so forth. But it’s a beginning, but hopefully it’s not an end., And as the Secretary-General has described, as a result of his own efforts, we have seen a glimmer of hope in these past days, thanks to his efforts and those of our colleagues on the front line., As you know, on May 2nd, more than 100 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, including women, children and older people. About 60 more people joined that convoy on the outskirts of Mariupol and were then able to move to safety., And it was, as the Secretary-General described, a project of the greatest complexity and of constant, constant oversight, and it was an exceptional operation., And I am especially grateful, and I’d like to record here our thanks to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the leadership of Peter Maurer, as well as to our own highly, highly experienced first responders., But I must also applaud the authorities, and essentially the respective militaries of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, for their close and constructive and essential cooperation in making that operation a reality., It showed us that that can happen. And I believe, though the numbers weren’t great, that a single life saved is worth every ounce of effort., And as of yesterday, as the Secretary-General said, we were able to move more than 320 civilians out of the Mariupol area broadly, again working closely in lock step with ICRC and with the cooperation of the Ukrainian and the Russian authorities., And today we have that third operation, which began this morning, and with the intent of evacuating civilians from Mariupol and Azovstal, and as he said, we prefer not to speak about that operation until it is complete., What I can finally about this is that we’re seeing the fruits of our labour over these past many weeks of establishing a liaison in Moscow, of the visits that preceded the Secretary-General, and which were brought into fruition by his own long and detailed meetings with the leaderships of both sides in this last week., We are beginning to see now the agreement of the local ceasefires, because none of these movements of safe passage could happen without local ceasefires, pauses, windows of silence., So, we’re making some progress, we’re building relations and we’re building experience, which we hope we can then broaden to more such operations, and that is the third element of our humanitarian programme., We’ll keep pushing for more civilians to be able to leave Mariupol, and indeed Azovstal, if they so choose., And we can now begin, on that basis, to explore options for reaching others where the need is greatest, and where we need a desire to serve the people of Ukraine in their hour of direst need.
Madam President, thank you very much.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-3

Protection and Human Rights",5 May 2022,"SG/SM/21259, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council meeting on Ukraine, in New York today:, I welcome this opportunity to address the Security Council on my recent visit to the Russian Federation and Ukraine, where I met with President [Vladimir V.] Putin and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy on 26 and 28 April respectively., As part of my regional visit, I also had discussions with President [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan in Ankara and President [Andrzej] Duda in Rzeszów, Poland., Throughout my travels, I did not mince words. I said the same thing in Moscow as I did in Kyiv — which is exactly what I have repeatedly expressed in New York. Namely that: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations. It must end for the sake of the people of Ukraine, Russia and the entire world., I visited Moscow and Kyiv with a clear understanding of the realities on the ground. I entered an active war zone in Ukraine with no immediate possibility of a national ceasefire and a full-scale ongoing attack on the east of the country., Before the visit, the Ukrainian Government issued an appeal to the United Nations and to me personally — expressed publicly by the Deputy Prime Minister — regarding the dire plight of civilians in the devastated city of Mariupol and specifically the Azovstal plant., In my meeting with President Putin, I therefore stressed the imperative of enabling humanitarian access and evacuations from besieged areas, including first and foremost, Mariupol. I strongly urged the opening of a safe and effective humanitarian corridor to allow civilians to reach safety from the Azovstal plant. A short time later, I received confirmation of an agreement in principle. We immediately followed up with intense preparatory work with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) along with Russian and Ukrainian authorities., Our objective was to initially enable the safe evacuation of those civilians from the Azovstal plant and later the rest of the city, in any direction they choose, and to deliver humanitarian aid. I am pleased to report on some measure of success., Together, the United Nations and ICRC are leading a humanitarian operation of great complexity — both politically, and in terms of security. It began on 29 April and has required enormous coordination and advocacy with the Russian Federation and Ukrainian authorities., So far, two safe passage convoys have been successfully completed. In the first, concluded on 3 May, 101 civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal plant along with 59 more from a neighbouring area. In the second operation, completed last night, more than 320 civilians were evacuated from the city of Mariupol and surrounding areas. A third operation is under way — but it is our policy not to speak about the details of any of them before they are completed to avoid undermining possible success., It is good to know that, even in these times of hyper-communications, silent diplomacy is still possible and is sometimes the only effective way to produce results., So far, in total, nearly 500 civilians found long-awaited relief, after living under relentless shelling and scarce availability of water, food and sanitation. The evacuees have shared moving tales with United Nations staff. Mothers, children and frail grandparents spoke of their trauma. Some were in urgent need of medical attention., I hope that the continued coordination with Moscow and Kyiv will lead to more humanitarian pauses to allow civilians safe passage from the fighting and aid to reach those in critical need. We must continue to do all we can to get people out of these hellscapes., Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths will brief you today in greater detail on the latest efforts in Mariupol and additional steps., High Commissioner [Michelle] Bachelet will brief on reports of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, possible war crimes and the need for accountability., As I discussed yesterday with President Zelenskyy, the United Nations will continue to scale up humanitarian operations, save lives and reduce suffering., My meetings with both leaders also focused on the crucial issue of global food security. And indeed, the worldwide implications of this war were in full view in my subsequent travels to West Africa. In Senegal, Niger and Nigeria, I heard direct testimony from leaders and civil society on how the war is unleashing a food security crisis., We need quick and decisive action to ensure a steady flow of food and energy in open markets, by lifting export restrictions, allocating surpluses and reserves to those who need them, and addressing food price increases to calm market volatility. But, let me be clear: a meaningful solution to global food insecurity requires reintegrating Ukraine’s agricultural production and the food and fertilizer production of Russia and Belarus into world markets, despite the war. I will do my best to help facilitate a dialogue to help make this a reality., At the same time, the war in Ukraine — in all its dimensions — is setting in motion a crisis that is also devastating global energy markets, disrupting financial systems and exacerbating extreme vulnerabilities for the developing world. That is precisely why I established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, to mobilize United Nations agencies, multilateral development banks and other international institutions to help countries face these challenges. We were particularly engaged in making proposals at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank., The war on Ukraine is senseless in its scope, ruthless in its dimensions and limitless in its potential for global harm. The cycle of death, destruction, dislocation and disruption must stop. It is high time to unite and end this war., For information media.

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-4-may-2022-enruuk

We are now in the 10th week of Russia's brutal invasion. 10 weeks during which the European Union stood firmly by Ukraine. Today, the European Union answered the call, once more, to support Ukraine.

Humanitarian assistance fully safeguarded as refugee costs increase in 2022,News and Press Release,Govt. Sweden,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",4 May 2022,"As Sweden assumes responsibility for the many people – primarily women and children – fleeing Ukraine, the increased associated costs can be counted as Official Development Assistance (ODA) in line with OECD DAC guidelines. This is due to Ukraine’s classification as an ODA recipient. Like most other countries that provide development assistance, Sweden deducts asylum costs from development assistance. The Government has prioritised fully safeguarding humanitarian assistance and particularly ODA to the poorest countries. Even after deductions for refugee costs, Sweden remains one of the world’s largest donor countries., To ensure that we have coverage for asylum deductions, the Government is now setting a limit on how much of this year’s aid funding can be disbursed. This ceiling is approximately SEK 9.2 billion., The Swedish Migration Agency has presented a number of scenarios in relation to asylum seekers and people in need of temporary protection. According to the main scenario, some 76 000 people from Ukraine may seek asylum in Sweden., Costs for reception of asylum seekers and people in need of protection from low- and middle-income countries can be counted as ODA on humanitarian grounds during the first year in the host country. This practice has been applied since 1991. The costs deducted from ODA to finance the reception of people from Ukraine would increase by just over SEK 9 billion in 2022., If the Migration Agency’s main scenario is accurate, Sweden will deduct a total of approximately SEK 10.3 billion in 2022. This is equivalent to 18 per cent of the development assistance framework and is lower, for example, than the deductions in 2015, which were equivalent to 22 per cent of the development assistance framework., The Government remains committed to its target of allocating one per cent of gross national income (GNI) to ODA. Sweden’s GNI has grown in recent years and in 2022 amounts to approximately SEK 57 billion. This means that Sweden’s development assistance framework is larger than ever before. Therefore, Sweden remains a major aid donor and one of the few countries that surpasses the UN recommendation to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of GNI to ODA., Due to the decision on deductions against the development assistance budget, the Government is setting a limit on disbursements in the development assistance budget. As a result, some disbursements will be deferred or suspended, some planned disbursements will be reduced, and reprioritisations will take place., The Government has prioritised fully safeguarding humanitarian assistance and particularly assistance to the poorest countries. Support will go to those hit hard by the pandemic and the accelerating food crisis resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Government continues to prioritise climate aid and maintains its target of doubling climate aid., The announced deductions are based on the Migration Agency’s main scenario for the number of people needing to seek protection in the country. The number may be lower if fewer than expected arrive in Sweden. If, however, costs for refugee reception increase beyond those anticipated in the Migration Agency’s main scenario, it is not certain that those costs can be counted as ODA. In that case, the Government will consider new alternatives for broader funding., This sudden and extensive humanitarian crisis is an exceptional situation, and many refugees in Europe need to seek protection in Sweden. Sweden’s solidarity with the Ukrainian people is immense, and we will help both those who remain in the country and those who have had to flee to other countries. Even after deductions for refugee costs, Sweden remains one of the world’s largest donor countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-assistance-fully-safeguarded-refugee-costs-increase-2022
"As the needs of people fleeing Ukraine skyrocket, donors must deliver on their commitments to robust regional response",News and Press Release,NRC,Contributions,5 May 2022,"Statement by Dominika Arseniuk, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Country Director in Poland, on the humanitarian pledging conference for Ukraine held in Warsaw:, “We welcome the generous pledges of USD 6.5 billion at today’s donors' conference for Ukraine. The ongoing support of the international community is crucial not only for the people of Ukraine, but also for the neighbouring countries, hosting the largest numbers of refugees fleeing the ongoing war., “The UN and aid organisations on the ground in neighbouring countries must do all they can to support national and local emergency and long-term relief work, and introduce robust contingency measures to ensure that people forced to flee are protected for as long as needed. The regional aid response must target everyone in dire need of assistance, including the most vulnerable people in host countries, who also suffer the economic impact of the war. This step is essential to ensure that the solidarity shown to Ukrainian refugees by the people of Moldova, Romania and Poland remains intact., “This funding needs to reach frontline responders in a timely manner both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. We urge donors to simplify administrative procedures to the extent possible for local partners and international organisations working with them, as well as push for a change on the EU level to make the humanitarian funds accessible to non-governmental actors in EU member states., “The amounts pledged must not be reallocated from other humanitarian funding pots, and should not come at the expense of other crises across the Middle East, Central, Western, and the Horn of Africa, where food insecurity is reaching alarming levels., “Donors should also support organisations working with people who fall outside of existing protection solutions and special legislation introduced in response to the war. It is crucial that the welcome provided to the people affected by the armed conflict in Ukraine is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity.”, Background on the conference:, A High-Level International Donors’ Conference for Ukraine was hosted by Poland and Sweden in Warsaw on 5 May 2022, in partnership with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission, and with participation of the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. The aim was to mobilise substantial pledges based on the UN appeal and to discuss further arrangements towards supporting Ukraine’s efforts to handle the economic challenges created by the war., Facts and figures on Ukraine:, 5.7 million people have fled Ukraine since 24 February. 7.7 million are internally displaced., 16 million people inside Ukraine are estimated to need humanitarian aid. According to OHCR, there have been over 6,600 civilian casualties, with more than 3,200 civilians killed., As the needs continue to grow, the UN renewed its appeal on 25 April, seeking US$2.25 billion to help 8.7 million people – more than half of them women. Over 44% of the flash appeal is currently funded., NRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014 assisting over 700,000 people through its legal aid, food security and livelihoods, WASH and shelter programmes. We launched a Ukraine Regional Crisis Response Plan on 7 March detailing plans to target 800,000 people with assistance through operations across Ukraine, Poland, Romania and Moldova. The response plan is costed at US$82 million over the next few months., Note to editors, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/needs-people-fleeing-ukraine-skyrocket-donors-must-deliver-their-commitments-robust
"Ukraine: ""Level of death, destruction and misery abhorrent and unacceptable""",News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,5 May 2022,"Speech given by Mr Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, at the High-Level International Donors’ Conference for Ukraine; Warsaw, 5 May 2022, on behalf of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, comprised of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the National Societies responding to the crisis and those supporting our collective mobilization., The level of death, destruction and misery of civilians affected by the international armed conflict in Ukraine is abhorrent and unacceptable., I am addressing you today, in your capacity as High Contracting Parties of the Geneva Conventions, on the issues at the heart of our mandate – the lifesaving impacts of humanitarian action and international humanitarian law., Importantly: International humanitarian law, or jus in bello, is concerned the ways in warfare is conducted. It is solely humanitarian, seeking to limit the suffering caused. Crucially, it is independent from questions about the justification or reasons for war, or jus ad bellum., The Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols identify critical issues where the consensus of the parties is vital to offer a minimum of humanity in conflict: so that civilians and wounded people are protected, so humanitarian aid can reach those in need, so that prisoners of war are treated humanely, so that people do not disappear, so that mortal remains are collected in a dignified manner. The law is also clear on the obligations to respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law, including to facilitate the access of humanitarian action. Access is an obligation, not a point of negotiation., The ICRC knows that reaching consensual agreements on humanitarian issues is challenging. We appreciate the agreements that been made by the parties - for example in the safe passage arrangements allowing people to leave areas of hostilities, such as recently in Mariupol. Progress has been too slow and too little... it has led to senseless deaths and prolonged suffering. But we have seen the potential for agreements to be made and we implore parties to make expanded efforts to save lives., Today, the generous funding of humanitarian action for people impacted by the conflict is critical. But it is only part of the picture: to meet the needs of the civilian population, funds must be equitably operationalized. For this, the space for neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian action must be protected: so that those in most need can be served, without discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions, wherever people are., Already present for eight years, the ICRC with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, is massively scaling up its response. Our support in places Kyiv, Mariupol, Odessa, Donetsk, Luhansk and elsewhere includes emergency assistance such as food, water, and other essential items. We are supporting hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and emergency preparedness. We are working on mitigating the impact of weapons contamination and helping repair damaged water stations and homes., Tens of thousands of local Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff across Europe are working tirelessly to provide support to those in need. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and National Societies and its member National Societies have already reached more than a million people affected by the conflict with life-saving aid., The strength of the Red Cross, the largest humanitarian organization in the world, is our combination of community-based and global support. Our experience shows us that to have maximum impact we need to work closely with communities, to strengthen the capacities of local actors; and to work with and through governments and local authorities. Our aim is to support the development of capacities to the local structures leaving them stronger, more robust., Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, The foundations for reconstruction in Ukraine must be laid today to avoid further human suffering., Services vital to the survival of the civilian population – water, electricity, healthcare, must continue. Maintaining these services in coming weeks and months will avoid reverberating secondary impacts and mitigate further degradation in the longer term. In this way frontline humanitarian action is a vital stabilizing factor in fragmented environments and a building block towards moments of reconciliation and broader peace-building efforts., Those living through the horrors of this conflict need urgent and pragmatic solutions for now and for the future. I urge you to support principled humanitarian action, to do your part in championing respect for international humanitarian law., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-level-death-destruction-and-misery-abhorrent-and-unacceptable

Furthermore, donations made to the Disaster Relief Fund are used to aid people fleeing Ukraine in Finland., The donated funds: , In addition to financial aid, the Finnish Red Cross has sent accommodation and medical supplies and an entire health clinic to Ukraine., The collected funds have also allowed us to send aid workers to the area. These include professionals in logistics, health care, psychosocial support, communications and organisational development, as well as specialists who assess the changing humanitarian situation and need for aid., Our disaster preparedness unit focusing on logistics organises the transport, storage and distribution of material aid from the International Red Cross to Ukraine., The Finnish Immigration Service is always responsible for funding statutory reception operations, but donations made to the Disaster Relief Fund are also used to support people arriving in Finland., We offer them e.g. clothes, hygiene supplies, food and drink and other basic necessities as required. Donations have also been used in arranging psychosocial support., The Finnish Red Cross channels the funds of the Ukraine collection through the International Red Cross.
 
Both the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have published emergency aid appeals that the Red Cross organisations from different countries – such as the Finnish Red Cross – are funding together., ""We need to create a system where people can get aid in the long term."" Marko Korhonen, Head of International Disaster Management, The International Red Cross directs the received funds to aid work in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. The funds are used to procure e.g. food, water, hygiene and accommodation supplies, clothes and medical supplies. Furthermore, cash grants are distributed to families e.g. for grocery shopping., People are also offered first aid and psychosocial support. The Red Cross is also helping with evacuations., The aid is delivered as cooperation of the entire Red Cross movement: tens of thousands of volunteers, employees of the Red Cross organisations of Ukraine and its neighbouring countries and aid workers from the International Red Cross and national Red Cross organisations., Logisticians from the Finnish Red Cross are also playing an important role in getting the aid to its destination., The aid operation in Ukraine is exceptionally challenging, since the number of people fleeing their homes is immense and the operation is carried out in many neighbouring countries in addition to Ukraine., However, all funds collected in our emergency aid collection will be used to help those suffering from the conflict. The Finnish Red Cross places a special focus on health work, in particular., Our current estimate is that at least 90 cents from each euro donated to the emergency aid collection go directly to aid work helping people affected by the Ukraine crisis., Collection expenses consist of the expenses of collection methods, service providers and marketing and the salary costs of fundraising employees. Collection expenses vary by year and collection., In case of earlier collections of this extent, the collection expenses have settled to around 10 per cent. In this collection, however, we have made exceptional savings in collection expenses, as several media have taken part by offering free visibility for the collection and many banks have waived their service fees.
 
We can only calculate the exact percentage of expenses after the collection is over, but our estimate is that the costs of this collection are very small and likely to end up clearly below 10 per cent.
 
The Ukraine collection gathers donations to our Disaster Relief Fund, the rules of which state that the collection expenses must not exceed 20 per cent., As the need for aid will continue for years to come, our aid work also requires a long-term approach.
 
The conflict has caused immense humanitarian distress, and the need for aid grows by the day. This means that aid will be needed for a very long time even after the fighting one day comes to an end., Not all funds donated to the Ukraine collection can be used immediately. We must first confirm what kind of help is needed most and where, and how distribution can be organised as effectively and safely as possible.
 
“When you have lost your livelihood and home, it is not enough to get a one-off aid package at the start of the operation. We need to be able to create a system where people can get aid in the long term,” says Marko Korhonen, Head of International Disaster Management at the Finnish Red Cross., You can follow the work of the Finnish Red Cross in helping people affected by the Ukraine crisis here",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/how-finnish-red-cross-using-donated-funds-ukraine-crisis
Diaspora humanitarian response and engagement – Key Highlights,Analysis,DEMAC,Coordination,5 May 2022,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND, DEMAC is a global initiative aiming to enhance coordination among diaspora organizations involved in humanitarian assistance, and across diaspora organizations and institutional humanitarian actors., DEMAC seeks to increase engagement and visibility for diaspora organizations in the humanitarian system. DEMAC contributes to a deeper understanding of diasporas as humanitarian actors and thus adds to transforming the humanitarian ecosystem., Diaspora organizations are multi-sectoral, fast responding actors who work transnationally., Having a connection and understanding of their country of origin or heritage plays a vital role in humanitarian assistance where diaspora organizations often are part of the first response in the aftermath of a disaster., They are key actors when it comes to raising the alarm in times of crisis. The ease and frequency of communication between local communities and diaspora organizations means that they can be alerted in real-time, and their capacity to collect and disperse funds rapidly ensures that they are a key factor in unlocking the first responses in crisis settings. In hard-to-reach places where access may be an issue, diaspora organizations have a unique advantage due to their local connections and ties., They use their transnational position to respond to the growing demands for remote management and cross-border response in countries where international actors have a limited presence, and to advocate on behalf of crisis affected populations in the policy arenas of their countries and regions of residence., In line with the objective of facilitating increased common ground between diaspora and institutional humanitarian action and enhancing mutual knowledge and coordination between diaspora and humanitarian actors and the international humanitarian system, DEMAC commissioned Owl RE research and evaluation consultancy in 2020-21 to conduct two real-time reviews and three case studies. The case studies provided an in-depth analysis of the diaspora response to the crises experienced in Pakistan, Somalia and Ukraine from 2014 to 2020. The real-time reviews provided a rapid analysis of the diaspora response to sudden-onset crises, with a real-time review conducted on the flash floods and landslides in Timor-Leste (April 2021) and a second on the COVID-19 response in Tunisia (October 2021)., This document provides key highlights and findings of this research.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/diaspora-humanitarian-response-and-engagement-key-highlights

The event was organised at the initiative of the Prime Ministers of Poland and Sweden and the main goal was to raise funds for the war-torn eastern neighbour of Poland. Over EUR 6.3 billion was raised during the conference and the funds will be used for further humanitarian aid. The President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission were partners of the event. The conference was also attended by the heads of state and government, representatives of global business and financial institutions, as well as representatives of international humanitarian institutions., A joint initiative of Poland and Sweden to support fighting Ukraine, At the initiative of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Prime Minister of Sweeden Magdalena Andersson, the International Donors’ Conference to support Ukraine was held at the National Stadium in Warsaw. The partners of the event were the President of the European Council Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen., The meeting was held at the level of Heads of State and Government, with the participation of representatives of global business and financial institutions - partners from the European Union, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Representatives of international humanitarian institutions, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, were also present at the conference., Solidarity - the key to stoppig Russian aggression, For more than 70 days, Ukraine has been struggling with brutal aggression from Russia. The fight of the Ukrainians is a fight for freedom and security of the whole Europe. The crimes in Bucha, Borodzianka, Hostomel, Mariupol and hundreds of other towns show what a barbaric system we have to face as Europe., During the conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw, the head of the Polish government addressed Ukrainians, including the President and Prime Minister of Ukraine: - Dear brothers and sisters from Ukraine, dear President Zelenski, dear Prime Minister Denys, we know very well that today you are fighting not only for your homeland, not only for your independence and freedom but also for ours., The Prime Minister also declared further help: - We will continue to support you in every possible way. You will win this war, we will win it together. Together, we will prove that European values are not empty words but are followed by action., Poland has been supporting Ukraine since the beginning of Russian aggression, Since the first day of Russian aggression against Ukraine, our country has been standing in solidarity with its eastern neighbour. Over 5.6 million people have already fled Ukraine due to the aggressive actions of Russia, more than 3 million of whom have crossed the border with Poland., All those who have sought shelter in Poland received such assistance. This is the result of solidarity action and support from the government, local government units, non-governmental organisations and thousands of Polish people. The Prime Minister thanked Poles for their attitude and the heart showed to refugees: - I would like to thank all Poles, all citizens of our country, all those who are involved in supporting Ukrainian refugees and those who raise funds to support Ukraine., Persons from Ukraine can work legally in Poland or continue their education free of charge. - We are not creating refugee camps. We prefer another form of integration of refugees with our society so that they can stay with us as long as they want to. We all hope that they will be able to return to their homes as soon as possible. This approach chosen by Poland is much more costly but much more humane and sustainable at the same time – added the Prime Minister., Apart from humanitarian aid, Poland also provides military support: - EUR 1.6 billion - this is the equivalent of the military aid provided by Poland to date. We will continue providing the suport and will strengthen it if required - said the Prime Minister., Our country also supports Ukraine's accession to the European Union. - Ukraine should obtain the status of a candidate country for accession to the European Union as soon as possible. I know how important it is for Ukrainians to keep up their fighting spirit and morale. This is extremely important – stated the head of the government., Further assistance for Ukraine, The Prime Minister declared further support to Ukraine: - Poland will continue to support refugees from Ukraine, at least to the amount of EUR 3.4 billion by the end of this year., The money will be allocated to support housing and transport, among other things. Moreover, Poland will continue to offer free education, language courses, transport, access to the labour market. We will also provide EUR 100 million of aid in the form of hygiene products, including medicines, and temporary houses, which will be built in Ukraine., Poland supports severe sanctions, Poland is actively involved in actions to impose strict and severe sanctions on Russia: - We all need to increase the pressure on Russia. The sanctions must be serious. Poland may soon become independent of Russian gas and oil. As you probably already know, we have already been cut off from Russian gas – since over a week. This is because we did not want to agree to pay for the gas in roubles - said the head of the government., The Prime Minister also addressed all European governments asking them to follow the same path: - I am pleased that many governments have already agreed to that, which is expressed in the sixth package of sanctions. There needs to be a full embargo on raw materials from Russia. We also need to ensure the confiscation of Russian assets. This should no longer be a taboo subject. There should be full confiscation of Russian assets, the property of the oligarchs. This money should be used to rebuild Ukraine., The European Commission has presented a proposal of the sixth package of sanctions. It is to include restrictions on imports of oil and petroleum products, further restrictions on the financial sector and financial services, further sectoral sanctions and export controls. The package will also include sanctions against individual companies in the military sector and those responsible for war crimes., Prime Minister Morawiecki meets the head of the European Commission and Prime Ministers of Ukraine and Finland During the conference at the National Stadium in Warsaw, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki held bilateral meetings with the President of European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, with Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal and Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin., The topic of the talks during the leaders' meetings was the situation behind our eastern border, the possibility of supporting Ukraine and the imposition of further sanctions on Russia.

Update 72 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (04 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,4 May 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, today met with Alexey Likhachev, Director General of Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, and other senior Russian officials in Istanbul., Director General Grossi said he was continuing timely and professional discussions where he stressed the urgency of ensuring the safety of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The IAEA is ready to play its indispensable role, he added., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, following last week’s visit of IAEA inspectors and technicians to the Chornobyl NPP, data from all unattended monitoring systems installed at the site has now been fully recovered. Also, as a result of the deployment of new transmission channels based on satellite technologies, the remote transfer of the safeguards data to the Agency’s Vienna headquarters has been fully restored with the exception of one facility for which technical work is still required. The transmission from Chornobyl had been interrupted for two months. For the other NPPs in Ukraine, remote data continues to be transferred to the IAEA.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-72-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-04-may-2022

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 3 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,4 May 2022,"Date: 4 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 3 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 6,635 civilian casualties in the country: 3,238 killed and 3,397 injured. This included:, a total of 3,238 killed (1,162 men, 738 women, 71 girls, and 84 boys, as well as 72 children and 1,111 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,397 injured (424 men, 337 women, 71 girls, and 82 boys, as well as 169 children and 2,314 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 3,352 casualties (1,700 killed and 1,652 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 2,859 casualties (1,599 killed and 1,260 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 493 casualties (101 killed and 392 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,283 casualties (1,538 killed and 1,745 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-3-may-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: Joint statement on Russia’s invasion and importance of freedom of expression and information (04 May 2022),News and Press Release,ACHPR,Protection and Human Rights,4 May 2022,"GENEVA (4 May 2022) - Following the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the continuation of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, freedom of expression mandate holders* from the United Nations, the African Commission of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and the Representative on Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe issue the following joint statement:, “We collectively condemn the invasion of and continuous aggression against Ukraine, its sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation. The actions of the Russian Federation violate international law and the common UN, OSCE, ItACHR and ACHR commitments and the very principles on which our organisations are based., We are outraged about the continuous atrocities and the resulting grave human rights and humanitarian crises, which have a massive detrimental impact on civilians’ lives, safety and well-being. We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine in these difficult times., We recall that it is precisely during times of war and armed conflict that the right to freedom of expression and free access to information must be vigorously defended, as it is instrumental for the promotion of lasting peace, understanding the nature of the conflict and ensuring accountability., In this connection, we highlight the following:, First, we are profoundly concerned about the safety of journalists, media workers and associated personnel in Ukraine, who are carrying out their work under unprecedented conditions, and are now at a very high risk. There are numerous reports that journalists are being targeted, tortured, kidnapped, attacked and killed, or refused safe passage from the cities and regions under siege. Such actions are abhorrent and must be stopped immediately. We recall that under international humanitarian law, during armed conflict journalists are considered to be civilians and must be afforded protection as such. An attack to kill, wound or abduct a journalist constitutes a war crime. Those responsible for direct or indiscriminate attacks on civilians, including journalists, should be held accountable and brought to justice under national and international law. Measures must also be taken to trace missing journalists, ascertain their fate, provide appropriate assistance and facilitate their return to their families. States have the duty and obligation to protect and guarantee human rights, to conduct effective investigations and to guarantee effective remedies and reparations., Second, we are alarmed by reports that Ukraine’s media and internet infrastructure may be intentionally targeted by the Russian forces in an effort to disrupt access to information, including by means of cyberattacks. We appreciate that access to Ukraine's internet infrastructure has remained largely resilient. It is crucial to ensure that people in Ukraine have continued access to the internet, broadcasting and other means of communication. We call for the adoption of all feasible measures to protect the media, media organisations, and internet infrastructure from attacks and hostile take overs. We also call for increased support in various forms by the international community to ensure media sustainability in Ukraine at a time when a number of national and local media outlets have lost their premises and equipment or have been damaged or destroyed. Initiatives that enable Ukrainian journalists and media in exile to continue their professional work should also be supported in a manner that is sustainable and adapted to the exceptional conditions they are facing., Third, we underline that propaganda for war and national hatred which constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence are profoundly harmful and prohibited under article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We call on the Russian Federation to immediately refrain from these unlawful practices., Fourth, we are concerned at the spread of disinformation concerning the conflict in Ukraine in Russian state-owned media. However, we believe that disinformation cannot be addressed by blocking or banning media outlets. Any restriction of freedom of expression should respect scrupulously the three-part test of legality, legitimate aim, and necessity and proportionality. We are concerned that the EU’s decision to ban two Russian state-owned media outlets may have been a disproportionate response to disinformation. It has been used as a pretext for additional closure of independent media outlets in the Russian Federation. Promoting access to diverse and verifiable information, including ensuring access to free, independent and pluralistic media, is a more effective response to disinformation., Fifth, we believe that the erosion of the right to freedom of expression and other human rights over a prolonged period of time and the silencing of critical voices in the Russian Federation have contributed to creating an environment that facilitates Russia’s war against Ukraine. We are alarmed at the further tightening of censorship and repression of dissent and pluralist sources of information and opinion in the Russian Federation, including the blocking of social media platforms and news websites, disruption of services from foreign content and service providers, massive labelling of independent journalists and media as ‘foreign agents’, introduction of criminal liability and imprisonment of up to fifteen years for spreading so-called ‘fake’ information about the war in Ukraine or questioning Russian military action in Ukraine or simply standing for peace or even mentioning the word ‘war’. We deplore the systematic crackdown on political opponents, independent journalists and the media, human rights activists, protesters and many others opposing the Russian government’s actions. All these measures amount to the creation of a state monopoly on information in blatant violation of Russia’s international obligations. They must stop. We call on the Russian government to fully implement its international human rights obligations, including by respecting, promoting and protecting the freedom to seek, receive and impart information regardless of frontiers, and by ensuring a safe working environment for independent media, journalists and civil society actors., Six, we note that the war in Ukraine has further highlighted the risks of the proliferation of disinformation, misinformation and incitement to violence and hatred and restrictions of lawful speech on digital and social media platforms as a result of their business models, policies and practices. While we appreciate that dominant companies recently made some efforts to address these problems, we urge them to strengthen their human rights due diligence and impact assessment, accountability, transparency and equal and consistent application of policies to uphold the rights of all users.”, ENDS, *The expert: Ms. Irene Khan was appointed as UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression in June 2020 and is the first woman to hold this mandate.

For the next six months, a Google.org Fellowship team of 13+ Google employees will be working hand in hand with the IRC, full-time and pro-bono to help build United for Ukraine and expand Signpost globally., UNHCR has estimated that more than 5M refugees have already fled Ukraine into neighboring countries. The United for Ukraine platform will provide those displaced with accurate and timely information about services such as temporary housing, and legal aid through a network of 400+ highly experienced legal experts and psychological support professionals across 30+ countries. The platform will be a trusted resource to consolidate and simplify the process for displaced people to flee the country safely and find long-term solutions. United for Ukraine began as a grassroots organization, and will continue to remain a civil society effort, now supported by Signpost's technology, IRC, and Google. The platform is also powered by technical assistance and tools from Zendesk and Cisco, key global tech partners for IRC and Signpost., David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said: ""As millions continue to flee the crisis in Ukraine, it's clear that we need bold commitments and forward-thinking solutions - not just from governments and NGOs - but from the private sector as well. Google.org's long-standing support of the IRC and the Signpost project exemplifies the bold and innovative thinking we need, and the IRC welcomes this continued collaboration in creating solutions to the humanitarian emergency in Ukraine. By harnessing Signpost technology and resources, we will expand the reach of the United for Ukraine platform, providing displaced families and people with critical information about legal services, housing support, and more."", Rowan Barnett, Director Google.org in EMEA, said: ""Providing access to authoritative information and connecting displaced people fleeing the war on Ukraine to critical services is crucial. We're proud to have a team of 13 Google.org Fellows who for the past six weeks have joined the IRC Signpost team to build this platform, and who will be working pro-bono and full-time for the next six months to help scale this vital effort."", Nina Levchuk and Olga Hamama, co-founders United for Ukraine, said: "" Empowered by the unprecedented spirit and strength of our community, we vow to never stop our action. As soon as the war is over, we will channel this power to rebuilding Ukraine and creating the cradle of Contemporary Democracy and Modern Economy."", In the coming months, the private sector and aid agencies will continue to collaborate together to build a meaningful response to the fallout from the war brought to Ukraine. What is built for the emergency of today will also remain in the toolkit for future responses to crises as Signpost continues to scale worldwide., Signpost was originally launched by the IRC and Mercy Corps in 2015 at the height of the European refugee crisis. Google became a supporter of the Signpost project at the same time, collaborating to create the first version of Signpost for refugees in Greece. Since then, Signpost has expanded to 15 countries on 5 continents. Two additional nonprofit partners - Internews and NetHope - have joined the collaborative project. Signpost has reached over 20 million people with information to equip its clients to make critical decisions and find reliable access to vital services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/irc-receives-new-15m-grant-and-team-googleorg-fellows-help-refugees-fleeing-ukraine
"From Ukraine to Afghanistan, Iceland increases its support to humanitarian efforts to safeguard women's and girls’ rights",News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Contributions
Health
Protection and Human Rights",4 May 2022,"UNITED NATIONS, New York – In March, Iceland signed a new contribution of 50 million Icelandic Krona (equivalent to 388,000 US Dollars) to support UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, in its humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. As needs continue to soar, Iceland’s new funding will enable UNFPA to scale up life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, including protection and response services for survivors of physical and sexual violence., Since the beginning of the war, almost 12 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine. The vast majority of them are women and children, who are at increased risk of sexual and physical violence and abuse as services become scarcer on-the-ground. Health facilities, including for maternal and newborn care, have also been damaged and destroyed, while infrastructure in neighbouring countries has been stretched to the limit by the increased caseload of refugees., Despite challenges on-the-ground, UNFPA’s priority remains to safeguard the health, dignity and rights of women and girls impacted by the war. Since the beginning of the conflict, UNFPA has distributed 40 metric tonnes of reproductive health supplies, medicines and equipment to war-tone cities across Ukraine. Mobile teams have also been deployed to 12 cities across the country to provide mental health counseling as women and girls grapple with increased risks of violence. Thirty shelters, crisis rooms and daily care centres for displaced women and survivors of violence also remain operational., While it is clear that the war in Ukraine will exacerbate inequalities in the region, it could also impact the most vulnerable around the world, as fuel, food and energy prices soar. On 31 March, during a pledging conference for Afghanistan, where an estimated 24 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, the UN urged the international community not to abandon the people of Afghanistan. At the conference, Iceland announced a total contribution of ISK 400 million for the years 2022-2024, and pledged a 40 million ISK contribution to UNFPA (USD 314,199) for 2022., In March, Iceland’s Minister of Social Affairs, Mr. Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, traveled to New York to attend the 67th session of the Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), and met with UNFPA’s Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem, who thanked him for Iceland’s strong support to UNFPA. In April, Iceland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Thórdís Kolbrún Reykfjörd Gylfadóttir met with Dr. Natalia Kanem during the Commission on Population and Development to announce a significant increase in core contributions, which will empower UNFPA with predictable and flexible financing to transform the lives of women and girls. Iceland and UNFPA also signed a renewed agreement for the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation., In order to continue to reach women and girls in need in Ukraine, UNFPA urgently requires $65.6 million dollars. To respond to the reproductive health and protection needs of 9.3 million people affected by the crisis in Afghanistan in 2022, UNFPA requires $251.9 million.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-afghanistan-iceland-increases-its-support-humanitarian-efforts-safeguard

Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 May 2022,"AS we know from international news reports and statements from other official bodies, eastern and southern parts of Ukraine continue to face fierce fighting, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis. As intense fighting and air strikes continue to cause civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure across the country, the duration of martial law in Ukraine has been extended until 25 May 2022., According to the United Nations International Organization for Migration, 600,000 additional people were internally displaced in the first 17 days of April, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons to 7.7 million. In total, nearly 12.8 million have been displaced internally or across borders since 24 February., The civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive has now surpassed five thousand. As of 20 April, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 5,264, including 2,345 killed and 2,919 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights., RESPONDING ACROSS EUROPE, The Salvation Army has continued to respond to the humanitarian crisis unfolding across Europe as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, whilst recognising that not everyone in Russia either supports the war or is free to state their objection and there are Ukrainians living in Russia today. The Salvation Army has responded to the needs of refugees in all but two of the European countries in which it operates, by providing food, hygiene, practical advice and spiritual care. As always, this care is offered without prejudice or discrimination to all those in need., The number of people leaving Ukraine has reduced, and as yet unconfirmed numbers of people are reported to be going back into Ukraine. The Salvation Army in Ukraine is providing relief such as sandwiches, hot meals, hot drinks, drinking water and other non-food items to internally displaced people in various locations. Cities like Lviv, near the border with Poland, receive a large number of displaced people and The Salvation Army has been able to transport goods to three corps (churches) there. Another delivery was planned for the end of April., The Eastern Europe Territory and International Headquarters' (IHQ) International Emergency Services (IES) are in daily contact with corps officers in Lviv. There are also plans to implement a 'care for the carers' package to support all responders with additional spiritual care. Officers remain largely in their corps locations and are serving where they are appointed. Female officers and children were given the opportunity to evacuate to Moldova, but most decided to stay., In Dnipro, The Salvation Army provides prepared sweet pies and has distributed them to displaced people. It has also distributed more than 100 pieces of survival equipment -- supplied by the Red Cross -- to displaced people at the train station every day. In Lviv, The Salvation Army stocked-up other supplies and shared contact details on social media to enable displaced people to get in touch and receive the most essential items. Both urgently needed food and non-food items have been transported to Ukraine via Poland. Additional trips are planned., In the Federal Asylum Centre in Switzerland, The Salvation Army -- together with Caritas -- continues to operate a placement service for qualifying displaced people. More than 1,000 people have been placed using this system so far., RECEPTION, The operation of the Initial Reception Centre in Switzerland, with a capacity for 500 in the civil defence facility 'Allmend', is now entirely managed by The Salvation Army along with four other short-term shelters for approximately 280 people. A fifth shelter is being planned with capacity for some 150 people. The largest shelter, with a capacity for 1,000 rooms, has been established in a container village in Bern's 'Vierefeld'., The Salvation Army now operates a 'civil protection facility' in Bern, with 500 places in addition to the existing refugee shelters. The Hope clothing drop-off centre in Zurich has opened and 453 vouchers have been utilised, with each voucher allowing a person to collect 10 items of clothing. The Brocki thrift store has produced 10,000 vouchers for a one-time 50 per cent shopping discount intended as emergency aid for qualifying refugees., The Eastern Europe Territory has developed posters and flyers in a variety of languages which are now in use in all locations as part of its anti-human trafficking work., Neighbouring host countries such as Hungary, Moldova, Poland and Romania have also been impacted by the crisis. The Salvation Army in Hungary went to the border early after the outbreak of war to assess likely needs. The Salvation Army's Switzerland, Austria and Hungary Territory is supporting the Hungary Region in the response both with personnel from within the territory and basic relief items. An emergency team supported refugees by helping to welcome people at the border, and in the emergency shelter by providing emotional and spiritual care., In Budapest, 22 sites were made available for the reception of refugees. Gyöngyös Corps and Remeniség Centre will prepare food for up to 40 people as soon as the city extends its help in receiving more refugees. The corps officers in Debrecen and Miskolc have also been mobilised to support work at different border posts., More than 500,000 refugees have crossed the border into Hungary, with countless volunteers helping to provide for people in need. Fifty-two pallets of relief supplies have arrived from The Salvation Army in Switzerland, whilst Salvation Army personnel have travelled almost 9,000 kilometres and spent 1,500 hours in recent weeks helping Ukrainian refugees in Hungary., WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP, In partnership with local government, Ungheni Corps in Moldova is providing daily refugee services for Ukrainian women and children. The facility has some 90 private rooms with access to kitchens. The Salvation Army is providing clothing, food, laundry services, and emotional and spiritual care. In addition to community rooms and an outdoor playground, there is a classroom programme for Russian-speaking children to continue their education. The Salvation Army also works in coordination with the 'Centre for Refugees Reception' in the village of Mikhaylany in the Ryshkansky district., During the time of the humanitarian corridor in March, the Salvation Army team in Moldova managed to send urgently needed medical items across the border where a team from Ukraine transported them to a children's intensive care unit in Odessa. Several trips to transport further items have taken place since. The Salvation Army in Moldova also provides free assistance to refugees from Ukraine including temporary accommodation, hot meals and drinks and access to Wi-Fi., 'FOOD FOR ALL', The Salvation Army has prepared relief parcels for Ukrainian refugees coming into Poland. The regional officers and corps officers in Warsaw, together with members of the IHQ IES team, supplied much-needed items to a Warsaw reception centre in early April. In English, the Ukrainian sign there reads, 'Welcome, free food for all', a simple act of kindness that expresses so much to those fleeing their homes., The Salvation Army is also working in the Romexpo refugee reception centre in Bucharest alongside the municipality and other stakeholders. Part of the responsibilities are to raise awareness of the risks of human trafficking. Information material has been developed in various languages and to date more than 4,000 Ukrainian refugee families have received this, along with thousands of supermarket shopping vouchers targeted specifically at families with children., Tens of thousands of refugees passed through the Siret camp in Romania in March. The Salvation Army emergency team offered help to complete asylum seekers' documents, gave advice about how to obtain biometric identification documents, assisted with the emotional aspects of family reunifications with those waiting outside the camp, and coordinated the need for and distribution of relief material with other organisations., SANCTUARY AND SUPPORT, Other host countries have also offered sanctuary and support. These include Austria where The Salvation Army is networking with partner organisations to help those who have escaped from the war zone. Exchanging information with The Salvation Army in Switzerland and Hungary, Austria also monitors developments in Ukraine and neighbouring countries., Belgian Salvationists have provided financial support for a young Ukrainian woman to travel from Romania to Brussels. She was welcomed on arrival in Belgium and is now in temporary accommodation provided by the Belgian Salvationist team., Two Russian-speaking officers from Bulgaria went to the border with Romania for four days in April to join with the Red Cross in the distribution of food parcels, hot meals and to offer a listening ear to refugees and those wanting to reunite with relatives. More than 400 people were assisted., The Czech Republic is already home to some 200,000 Ukrainians and therefore anticipates many more refugees will seek support from family and friends there. The Salvation Army has capacity in the existing social services in the Czech Republic, so since February has been ready to provide support without impacting the existing client base., The Denmark Territory is preparing a project in Tønder, a town on the German border. The territory has a current project for disadvantaged families, and many Ukrainians have been seeking assistance. In March negotiations were on the municipal level, but The Salvation Army has been helping by supporting social programmes and offering basic aid such as food, hygiene, inclusion programmes and activities for children., ACCOMMODATION WORK, Also in March, Salvation Army social institutions in France held discussions with the French state regarding the management of locations for refugee accommodation. In Le Havre, north-western France, The Salvation Army is officially responsible for the social support of Ukrainian refugees, both in the first emergency reception centres and in more permanent accommodation. This is either with private individuals or in accommodation made available by local authorities., Georgia is now welcoming displaced people from Ukraine. In Batumi and Tbilisi, Salvation Army assistance includes the distribution of food parcels, hygiene supplies, clothes and blankets., In Germany, Berlin South West Corps has been working closely with volunteers at Berlin-Südkreuz train station. The corps welcomed 20 refugees from Ukraine in one night. People have been provided with accommodation, breakfast, lunch, supper, laundry services, hygiene kits, conversation, caring and shared prayers., In April, Greece launched 'The Meeting Point' project to assist people who have fled the conflict in Ukraine. Based at Athens Corps in Agios, Panteleimonas, it provides practical and essential material needs, and assistance and advice in order to provide a pathway for meaningful integration. The Greek Salvation Army has also provided mobile phone sim cards and supermarket vouchers to Ukrainian refugees., ESSENTIAL ITEMS, Latvia has provided food, water and bedding to refugees arriving from Ukraine, whilst in Lithuania an increasing number of Ukrainian families have been applying for essential items. The Salvation Army in Klaipeda and Vilnius is helping in any way it can, with food and hygiene articles, bedding, supermarket vouchers and clothing vouchers for the Salvation Army second-hand shop. Many existing children's activities have been expanded to include refugee children., In late March, The Salvation Army took on responsibility for one of Norway's largest refugee emergency accommodation centres. 'Kongsberg akuttmottak' will house 700 Ukrainian refugees for two to three months at a time, before they are offered permanent housing in the municipalities. The centre, situated in a recently closed university college, measures 15,000 square metres, and offers four meals a day, health services, activities for small children, and primary and elementary school teaching, in cooperation with the town authorities. The Salvation Army has a one-year contract with the government for the operation of the centre., The Spanish government, via individual city councils plus the Red Cross, receives Ukrainian refugees and then locates the places that offer services and aid needed, such as shelter, food and accommodation. The Salvation Army has contacted the government to offer its resources, including the provision of food and temporary accommodation in Denia and Coruña., The Salvation Army in the Netherlands is providing support to families hosting Ukrainian refugees and is managing several temporary shelter locations, including on cruise ships made available for this purpose.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-aid-offered-salvation-army-response-russiaukraine-war

MedShare is a humanitarian aid organization dedicated to improving the quality of life of people, communities, and the planet by sourcing and directly delivering surplus medical supplies and equipment to communities in need around the world., The shipment, which left the U.S. in March, is now in the hands of Salesian Sisters. The supplies are being distributed to ambulances and clinics and used to treat those who have been internally displaced within the country and arrive daily seeking medical attention., ""We appreciate MedShare's donation which has assured Salesians on the ground in Ukraine have access to the medical supplies they need to care for the sick and injured,"" said Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions. ""Salesian organizations around the globe have come together to help support Salesians in Ukraine who are working with people displaced inside the country and refugees who have fled to bordering countries. The need is overwhelming and we are all doing our part."", Salesian Missions has already launched a Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund that will help provide shelter, nutrition and supplies to refugees in need. This fund is among other fundraising efforts that Salesians in more than 130 countries are doing in support of Salesians on the front lines of this crisis., In addition to financial support, Salesians are sending material support similar to the medical supplies from MedShare. Through the support of a U.S.-based foundation, two ambulances were purchased in Serbia, filled with medicines and then driven by two Serbian drivers into Ukraine. Even though the trip was filled with challenges, the two ambulances made it to their destination inside Ukraine., Salesian missionaries around the globe are answering the call to help support people in distress in Ukraine and refugees fleeing the conflict. Salesians living and working in Ukraine have remained in their centers and churches, and they are helping families with shelter and nutrition., Sources:, Photo courtesy of Salesian Missions (contact for usage permissions), MedShare, Salesian Missions",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-medical-supplies-reach-internally-displaced-through-partnership
"School year nears tragic end in Ukraine amid child deaths, empty classrooms and destruction of educational facilities",News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",4 May 2022,"17 per cent of UNICEF-supported ‘Safe Schools’ in eastern Ukraine damaged or destroyed, KYIV/NEW YORK, 4 May 2022 – At least one in six UNICEF-supported schools in eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war, including School 36 – the only ‘Safe School’ in Mariupol – underscoring the dramatic impact the conflict is having on children’s lives and futures., Two schools have been hit by attacks in the past week alone. The damaged or destroyed schools – 15 of 89 – are part of the ‘Safe Schools’ programme established with the Ministry of Education and Science, primarily in response to attacks on kindergartens and schools in the Donbas region, which has seen a simmering armed conflict since 2014., Since the outbreak of war in February, hundreds of schools across the country are reported to have been hit due to the use of heavy artillery, airstrikes and other explosive weapons in populated areas, whilst others are being used as information centres, shelters, supply hubs, or for military purposes., “The start of the academic year in Ukraine was one of hope and promise for children following COVID-19 disruptions,” said Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative to Ukraine. “Instead, hundreds of children have been killed, and the school year ends amid the closure of classrooms due to war and the decimation of educational facilities.”, For children affected by crisis, school is critical - providing them with a safe space, and a semblance of normality in the most difficult of times – and ensuring they don’t pay a lifelong price for missed learning. Education can also be a lifeline – providing children with access to information on the risks of deadly explosive ordnance and connecting them and their parents to essential health and psychosocial services., “Ensuring access to education can be the difference between a sense of hope or despair for millions of children,” Sahin added. “This is crucial for their future and that of all Ukraine.”, Together with partners, UNICEF is working to reach as many children as possible with safe and appropriate learning opportunities. This includes:, The ‘All Ukrainian Online Education Platform’ for students in grades 5-11, developed by the Ministry of Education and Science with UNICEF support during the COVID-19 pandemic, is reaching over 80,000 displaced students inside Ukraine., In dozens of Kharkiv metro stations, where children have been forced to shelter for safety, UNICEF-supported volunteers have set up spaces where teachers, psychologists and sports instructors play and engage children on a regular basis., Episodes on the new online kindergarten platform ‘Numo’ supported by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and Science regularly hit hundreds of thousands of views., An ongoing digital campaign on explosive ordnance risk education (EORE) created by UNICEF with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reached 8 million users online., Nearly 250,000 children have benefited from education-related supplies provided by UNICEF to shelters, metro stations and other locations hosting displaced children., For children who have fled Ukraine, UNICEF is supporting governments and municipalities to include children in national school systems, along with alternative education pathways including digital learning., “Despite the horror of war, impressive work has gone into making sure children can keep learning,” said Sahin. “Ultimately, the fighting needs to stop so that classrooms can be rebuilt, and schools can be safe and fun places to learn again.”, Children and schools must be protected in line with international humanitarian law. Parties to the conflict must take measures to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and the military use of educational facilities., Media contacts, Joe English UNICEF New York Tel: +1 917 893 0692 Email: jenglish@unicef.org, Christopher Tidey UNICEF New York Tel: +1 917 340 3017 Email: ctidey@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/school-year-nears-tragic-end-ukraine-amid-child-deaths-empty-classrooms-and
“A litmus test of civilization” - How the war in Ukraine has impacted LGBTI people,News and Press Release,UNAIDS,"HIV/Aids
Protection and Human Rights",3 May 2022,"Andrii Chernyshev heads the advocacy work of the Ukrainian national lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) organization ALLIANCE.GLOBAL, which is one of the largest among about 30 LGBTI community organizations across the country. After the start of the war in Ukraine, he moved from Kyiv to the central part of Ukraine, a safer place to continue his work. His Facebook page has been full of announcements about where LGBTI people fleeing hostilities can find shelter and help, both inside and outside the country., Before the war, the primary focus of ALLIANCE.GLOBAL was public health, HIV prevention, monitoring of violations of human rights and national LGBTI advocacy. But the war has brought about new urgent tasks., “The main challenge for all people during the war, including LGBTI people, is just to survive. Many have lost their homes and relatives. Just recently, we welcomed several people from Mariupol, which is now completely destroyed. Although they managed to leave the city, they are in a very bad psychological state,” said Mr Chernyshev., According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are now 7.7 million internally displaced people in Ukraine. This number includes members of key populations, including LGBTI people, and others who are especially vulnerable., Sviatoslav Sheremet, the coordinator of policy and legislation work of the National MSM Consortium, said that there are several factors that make LGBTI people especially vulnerable. “Many LGBTI people are fleeing the areas occupied by Russian forces. People are afraid, and this fear has pushed them to actively move out to safer zones in Ukraine and outside the country.”, He noted that LGBTI people often cannot reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity, fearing violence, rejection and discrimination if they do. He underlined that all cases of homophobia are still being recorded and submitted to state bodies. “The proceedings on such cases are postponed until there is peace,” he added., Both ALLIANCE.GLOBAL and the National MSM Consortium have significantly changed their work. Several additional shelters for LGBTI people have opened in Dnipro and Chernivtsi. Men and women, including transgender people, can stay there one night and move on, or stay longer, and can bring their relatives and friends. People also receive financial support to leave the war zones and reach shelter., “The shelter in Chernivtsi, for example, was in a non-residential building,” said Mr Chernyshev. With a small grant from the UNAIDS Emergency Fund and other donors, we installed a shower and bought heaters. People have food, the Internet, a first aid kit, access to HIV counselling and antiretroviral therapy.”, LGBTI organizations outside the country have also provided support to people in need., Stas Mishchenko, an LGBTI activist from Ukraine, now lives in Munich, Germany. At the beginning of the war, he joined the Contact Group of Munich Kyiv Queer, which is part of the Alliance for Assistance to Queer People of Ukraine, a group of more than 50 LGBTI organizations in Germany whose members volunteer to help people who have fled to Germany and those who remain in Ukraine., “Sometimes there is homophobia and transphobia in refugee camps. And even if these are not systemic, there is always the human factor, combined with stress, fear and violence. That is why we accompany people on their way to us, provide psychological assistance, try to resettle them in private homes, help with humanitarian aid,” said Mr Mishchenko., “The war exacerbated both good and bad in our society,” said Marina Novachuk, UNAIDS Community Adviser at the UNAIDS Country Office for Ukraine. It is essential for the state and all stakeholders engaged in protecting forcibly displaced people to recognize and respond to the unique needs of LGBTI and gender-diverse people.”, Over the past 20 years, Ukraine has made a real breakthrough in ensuring the rights of LGBTI people and in protecting their security. LGBTI rights are an integral part of the National Human Rights Strategy. Leaders of the LGBTI community sit on the National Council of HIV and TB, as well as on regional councils. The number of participants of the annual equality marches has risen from just a dozen to thousands of people. Ukraine plans to develop legislation on the registration of civil partnerships., “Achieving civil equality has been the goal of my work for many years—I have seen huge improvements. The attitude towards LGBTI communities is a litmus test of civilization,” Mr Sheremet said., In April 2022, Ukraine received a questionnaire from the European Commission on its readiness for candidate status for membership of the European Union. On 18 April, Ukraine completed and submitted the first part of the questionnaire, which includes several questions on the situation with regard to LGBTI people and legislation, specifically about the legislative and policy instruments in place to prevent and respond to discrimination and how hate crimes are addressed in the criminal code. ALLIANCE.GLOBAL and the National MSM Consortium team will follow the process closely., “We have been working on changes in the legislation on LGBTI rights for many years now and we hope that now it will take not years but months to change. But first the war should end,” added Mr Chernyshev.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/litmus-test-civilization-how-war-ukraine-has-impacted-lgbti-people

Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",1 Dec 2021,"Eastern Ukraine has been affected by conflict since 2014, resulting in large numbers of people requiring humanitarian assistance. Throughout the different phases of the conflict, numerous lessons have been learned by humanitarian actors., This Knowledge, Evidence and Learning for Development (K4D) Programme report outlines lessons learned in three categories, protect (protecting civilians, humanitarian access and civil-military coordination), prioritise (prioritising effective humanitarian assistance to people in greatest need), and prevent (preventing and anticipating future shocks and rebuilding resilience in protracted and recurring crises)., There is a limited body of literature on lessons learned from humanitarian interventions in the Ukraine. Evaluations provide some evidence on best practices and areas for improvement, but these are limited in number. While these evaluations often provide lessons learned and recommendations for specific organisations, many of these are applicable for other international humanitarian actors operating in Ukraine. While Ukraine has a well-established social protection system, there is limited evidence on the use of existing social protection mechanisms to channel assistance., The existing literature on humanitarian interventions in Ukraine between 2014 and 2021 discusses persons with disabilities and the elderly from the perspective of inclusion in programming. There are also numerous gender analysis reports of conflict-affected areas, and gender is addressed in the context of gender mainstreaming in humanitarian interventions within programme evaluations., Read the full report",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/lessons-learned-humanitarian-interventions-ukraine-2014-2021

Water Sanitation Hygiene",4 May 2022,"Ukraine: New UN Women and CARE report highlights disproportionate impact of the war on women and minorities, After more than two months of war in Ukraine, which has forced millions of refugees and displaced people to flee their homes, a new Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE reveals that women and minorities are facing immense hardship when it comes to health, safety, and access to food as a result of the crisis. In Ukraine, women are increasingly becoming heads of households and leaders in their communities as men are conscripted, yet they remain largely excluded from formal decision-making processes related to humanitarian efforts, peace-making, and other areas that directly impact their lives., The analysis, based on surveys and interviews with people in 19 regions in Ukraine between 2 and 6 April 2022, sheds a spotlight on the gender dynamics of the crisis and recommends actions for governments, the international community, and other actors to implement in their humanitarian response., “When it comes to humanitarian needs of displaced people, locals, and households, women do most of the work: they drive, provide hospitals and locals with medication and food, they care about their disabled relatives and children,” said a woman who participated in the survey., The report reveals that the impact of the war is particularly disproportionate for internally displaced people and marginalized groups such as female-headed households, Roma people, LGBTQIA+ people, and people with disabilities. Many respondents from Roma communities gave testimony of severe discrimination, both in their daily struggle and in access to humanitarian aid., The analysis also reveals that gender roles are changing in Ukraine. While many men have become unemployed and are primarily engaging in the armed forces, women report taking on new roles and multiple jobs to make up for the lost family income. Women are also performing vital roles in the humanitarian response in local communities. However, despite taking on increasing leadership roles in their families and communities, they are largely excluded from formal political and administrative decision-making processes., With schools closed, high demand for volunteer work, and the absence of men, women’s unpaid care burden has increased significantly. Backtracking on gender equality is already evident in the ongoing crisis. The war is increasing unemployment among the entire population and will likely push women into the unprotected informal sectors of the economy and increase poverty., Women and girls also highlighted poor access to health care services, especially for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and pregnant, expecting, and new mothers, as well as rising fears of GBV and lack of food, especially for those in heavy conflict areas. Many respondents also spoke of the challenges and barriers they face in accessing humanitarian aid and services, and around 50 per cent of both women and men indicated that mental health was a main area of life impacted by the war., “It’s critical that the humanitarian response in Ukraine takes into account and addresses the different needs of women and girls, men and boys, including those that are furthest left behind”, says UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous. “This timely analysis provides the evidence of those needs, and their urgency. Women have been playing vital roles in their communities’ humanitarian response. They must also be meaningfully involved in the planning and decision-making processes to make sure that their specific needs are met, especially those related to health, safety, and access to livelihoods.”, “Our Rapid Gender Analysis allows us to consult directly with affected populations in order to accurately identify what specific needs different groups of people have, and how to best meet them,” says Sofia Sprechmann Sineiro, Secretary General of CARE International. “What we are hearing from the people of Ukraine is that certain groups—such as those with disabilities, Roma and other ethnic minorities, single mothers, and unaccompanied children—are each in need of different forms of protection and assistance. To keep our response effective and relevant, such groups must be consulted and prioritized across the aid ecosystem as this truly devastating situation continues to evolve.”, Key recommendations of the Rapid Gender Analysis:, About UN Women, UN Women is the United Nations entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women.

"Statement by Mr Erik Møse, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, to United Nations Security Council Arria Formula Meeting - 27 April 2022",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,27 Apr 2022,"Chair, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,, On behalf of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, I would like to thank the organisers – the permanent mission to the UN of the Republic of Albania and the permanent mission of France – for having invited the Commission to this Arria-formula meeting. This is the first time the Commission appears in a public context. The three commissioners are all present; Ms Jasminka Dzumhur and I are participating remotely, and Mr Pablo de Greiff is physically present at your meeting in New York., Limited time has passed since the President of the Human Rights Council appointed the members of the Commission on 30 March 2022. Recruitment of staff is on-going, and the office of the secretariat in Vienna is under establishment. Given this very early stage of the Commission’s existence, the three members have considered carefully whether we should participate today. We have decided to do so, demonstrating in a visible way the Commission’s availability to communicate with all stakeholders from the beginning. We consider it important to follow discussions of relevance to the Commission’s work., Today’s topic – accountability for atrocities – is an important element of the Commission’s mandate. Ensuring accountability is of course only possible with reliable and sufficient evidence. Resolution 49/1 contains several references to the significance of this: The Commission shall investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes; establish the facts of any such violations and abuses; collect, consolidate and analyse such evidence, and systematically record and preserve all information, documentation and evidence., In performing this huge task, the Commission will build on the work of the UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine and work in close coordination with that mission and with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as mandated for in the resolution. The Commission will discuss the implementation of these provisions with the High Commissioner’s office, including during our physical meeting in Geneva in a couple of weeks. We consider this element of our mandate to be important, particularly given the Monitoring Mission’s extensive experience in Ukraine., It is a well-known fact that a large number of entities are investigating the situation in Ukraine, both international and national bodies. As mentioned in the organisers’ concept note for this Arria meeting, there is reason to believe that coordination can ensure the efficiency of investigations, and we intend to look into this issue., Turning specifically to the on-going ICC investigations, I am very pleased to note the presence of the Prosecutor, Mr Khan, at this meeting. Our Commission will establish contact with the ICC in the near future., More generally, the Commission will seek contact with the parties to the conflict, with victims, civil societies, member states and other stakeholders. The main purpose is to obtain information of relevance to its mandate. It will be necessary to build upon a broad range of sources, which will have to be assessed together. The Commission aims to visit Ukraine and other areas where information and evidence is available., The Commission’s broad mandate includes all kinds of allegations, irrespective of whether they receive extensive press coverage or less attention. In conformity with its mandate, the Commission will seek to contribute to accountability. While not a strictly judicial instance, one of its tasks is to identify, where possible, individuals and entities responsible for violations or abuses of human rights or of international humanitarian law, or other related crimes., When performing its task, the Commission is – as stated in its mandate – independent. It has no link to any particular country, party, or entity. The Commission will submit reports of its activities to the UN’s Human Rights Council and to the General Assembly, and its conclusions will be based on the independent assessment of the commissioners and their analysis of the information and evidence that comes out of their investigations., The Commission is of course fully aware of the challenges in executing its mandate under the current circumstances, but also of its importance, especially when there are conflicting versions of the facts or even disinformation. In conformity with established principles, the Commission will assess the evidence carefully, giving particularly weight to primary evidence and seeking corroboration whenever needed. Over the years, the many Commissions of Inquiry established by the Human Rights Council have built up a considerable experience in this field., As already mentioned the Commission finds itself at an early stage of its work. This is not the time for it to give long statements but I would like to thank the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Bachelet, for having set up an excellent start-up team that has been of great assistance. Let me end by reiterating that the Commission is ready to communicate with anyone who may assist it in the completion of its mandate., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-mr-erik-m-se-chair-independent-international-commission-inquiry-ukraine

Those specifics included time, location, evacuation route, and other logistical details, as well as exactly who could be voluntarily evacuated., As a neutral and impartial humanitarian intermediary, the ICRC has been facilitating the intensive confidential dialogue between the parties on the safe passage of civilians since late February., ""It is an immense relief that some civilians who have suffered for weeks are now out,"" said ICRC President Peter Maurer.

We will not spare any effort to reach them."", Note to editors and producers:, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war.

Massive devastation in urban centres and the destruction of civilian infrastructure have made life unbearable for millions of people and severely disrupted vital services, especially access to water and health care. More than 25 per cent of the country’s population have been forced to flee. Over 5.1 million people have left Ukraine to seek refuge in other countries, and another 7.7 million people are now internally displaced, trying to find safety far from their homes., Despite tremendous challenges, humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have rapidly scaled up their operations to support people impacted by the war. Since 24 February, more than 4.1 million people received humanitarian assistance and protection services across the country. This includes nearly 3.2 million people who had the support of aid organizations to bring food to their tables and around 1 million people who received critical health care support across the country. Around 281,000 people were assisted with access to clean water and hygiene products and 241,000 people uprooted by the war have received emergency shelter or critical household items.
Humanitarians have provided protection services to nearly 305,000 people. Education services are now reaching 110,000 children who fled their homes and schools., This massive scale up of humanitarian response in Ukraine was possible thanks to the tireless effort of 217 organizations—more than half Ukrainian national NGOs—and the generous and timely support of donors. Just two months ago, humanitarian partners in Ukraine were delivering assistance on about 5 per cent of the countries’ territory. Today, aid workers are operating across all 24 oblasts, and making every effort to deliver assistance to people who need it, wherever they are. The international community has stepped in and has provided over $1.01 Billion, around 45 per cent of $2.25 billion requested in the Humanitarian Flash Appeal., The UN and partners have still not been able to reach areas where people are in desperate need of support, including Mariupol and Kherson, despite extensive efforts and ongoing engagement with the parties to the conflict. Humanitarians continue dialogue with both parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, to guarantee the safety and protection of civilians in Ukraine, and safe passage for humanitarians so that we can provide the assistance that people who have now endured two months of war urgently need",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-response-dashboard-april-2022
Ukraine: Russian Forces Fired On Civilian Vehicles [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,2 May 2022,"Civilians Killed Trying to Flee, Approaching Checkpoints, (Kyiv) – Russian forces have fired on civilian vehicles in three separate incidents in Ukraine’s Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, killing six civilians and wounding three, Human Rights Watch said today. In one case, they pulled a man from a van and summarily executed him., “Russian soldiers at checkpoints opened fire on passing vehicles without any apparent effort to verify whether the occupants were civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants is a constant as is the prohibition on targeting civilians, whether in their homes, on the streets, or in their cars.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed nine witnesses who were each present during one of the three incidents, including two who were wounded in these attacks. Researchers visited the sites of the three incidents and examined the four cars that were fired upon. Witnesses say that there were no Ukrainian forces in the vicinity at the time., The large number of civilian vehicles currently disabled on roads in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions with bullet holes, burn marks, and other signs of destruction suggests that Russian forces have also harmed other civilians in similar unlawful attacks. Russian forces should respect civilians trying to flee hostilities and facilitate the delivery of impartial humanitarian aid for civilians through territory under their control., Two of the incidents took place in Hostomel, a town about 20 kilometers northwest of Kyiv. Russian forces tried to secure the area on the first day of their invasion on February 24, 2022, and to seize control of the town’s military airport. Russian forces then occupied the area for much of March, before pulling out of the Kyiv region on March 31., On February 28, Russian forces opened fire on two vehicles carrying nine civilians who were trying to flee the area. On March 3, they shot at a vehicle with four men who were going to negotiate delivery of humanitarian aid. The third incident took place in the village of Nova Basan, in Chernihiv region, 70 kilometers east of central Kyiv, when Russian forces shot at a civilian van carrying two men, injuring one of them. Soldiers pulled the second man from the van and summarily executed him, while the injured man escaped., Under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, civilians may never be the deliberate target of attacks. Parties to an armed conflict must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects, and not carry out attacks that fail to discriminate between combatants and civilians. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., Russia should conduct impartial, thorough, and transparent investigations into these killings and should compensate victims of any unlawful attacks., “These incidents are indicative of Russian forces’ failure to abide by their obligations to always distinguish civilians and to minimize harm to them,” Wille said. “The Russian military has an obligation to investigate these incidents, hold those responsible to account, and ensure these kinds of killings cease.”, For details about the three incidents, please see below., Three Killings in Hostomel, February 28, Maksym Maksymenko told Human Rights Watch that at least four Russian armored vehicles were parked meters from his home in Hostomel on February 28. He and his neighbor’s family, who share the same surname but are not related, decided to flee south in the direction of Kyiv. That afternoon, Maksymenko left in his car with four passengers: his mother, Liubov, in the passenger seat, and his wife, Zhanna, their toddler son, and his mother-in-law in the back seat. His neighbor, Oleksandr Maksymenko, with his wife and son, and Maksym’s father, Volodymyr, followed in a second car., Maksym said that the cars passed through three checkpoints in Hostomel staffed by Russian soldiers without problem. But as the cars approached the fourth, near the southern edge of the city, they were suddenly fired upon from multiple directions. His mother was immediately hit in the head, with “only a piece of the back of her skull remaining and one ear.” He said he stopped the car and tried to duck under the dashboard, but a bullet hit him in the right side of his neck and lodged in his right shoulder blade. The doctor who later removed the bullet at the hospital said it was a 5.45 mm caliber. Maksym Maksymenko lost an eye in the attack and has metal fragments in his head., A bullet also passed through his wife’s left leg. He said he got out of the car yelling, “Don’t shoot! There are only women and a child in the car!” His son was screaming and covered in blood. Maksym said he was terrified that his son was also injured, but he was covered in his grandmother’s blood., Maksym said he helped his wife, son, and mother-in-law run to the yard of a nearby house, and then went back and got his father out of the second car, which was also hit, and brought him to the yard. His father died 30 minutes later in his arms with multiple bullet wounds in his abdomen and head, Maksym said., Oleksandr Maksymenko’s son, Andrii, in the second car, was also fatally wounded. He was shot in the left eye, ear, and shoulder, Maksym said. His father initially buried his body in a temporary grave, but it was exhumed after Russian forces left the area. An autopsy recorded a bullet found in Andrii’s chest, in addition to head wounds., Human Rights Watch spoke with two members of a family living in the house next to the fourth Russian checkpoint, Valerii Savchenko and Oleksandr Savchenko. They said that, at the time of the shooting, four Russian armored vehicles were parked on the road outside of their home with at least ten Russian soldiers. They did not see but heard the shooting and helped the survivors shelter in their basement, which could be reached from the yard., Russian forces would not allow the families to evacuate toward Kyiv until at least March 10. Until then, Maksym, his wife, and son remained in the basement without any treatment for their wounds. Maksym said that Russian forces came to the yard several times, spoke to them, saw they were wounded, but offered no medical care., The Russian forces did not allow Maksym’s family to get his mother’s body out of the car until March 6. The family buried her and Volodymyr in the yard of the home where they sought refuge, and Oleksandr took Andrii’s body by wheelbarrow to bury him in the town’s Kimerka neighborhood, where they had lived., Human Rights Watch examined the two cars, one green Lada 2101 and one blue Mitsubishi Lancer X, which had been attacked, and saw that both were perforated with a large number of bullet holes of various sizes, and had blood traces on the ceiling of the passenger’s seat of the car where Liubov died., Two Killings in Hostomel, March 3, Yurii Shturma, 57, a Hostomel entrepreneur, and Taras, 44, the bodyguard for Yurii Prylypko, who withheld his last name, Hostomel’s mayor, said that they, the mayor, and another friend, Ivan Zaria, were driving through Hostomel on the afternoon of March 3, to meet an aid convoy coming from Kyiv. They intended to negotiate with Russian forces to allow the convoy access to the town., As they turned a corner, they found themselves in front of a column of Russian armored vehicles. Soldiers in the vehicles suddenly opened fire on them with what Taras described as machine-gun fire, and hit Zaria, who was sitting in the back seat, near his left temple. Shturma, who was sitting next to him, tried to stem the flow of blood with a glove, as Taras, the driver, swerved down another road. He soon had to stop because the road was blocked by an abandoned construction digger., The mayor, Prylypko, got out of the car, Shturma and Taras said, and started running, but a Russian soldier firing from a nearby apartment building gunned him down. Shturma and Taras then got out of the car and hid behind the digger, trying to drag Zaria with them. Zaria was hit a second time and died, they both said. As they sought cover behind the digger, a Russian soldier in the doorway of another nearby apartment building about 100 meters away fired a shoulder-fired rocket at them but missed., Several hours later, the two men saw three Ukrainian territorial defense force members try unsuccessfully to rescue the body of the mayor, but Russian forces shot at them, wounding one, Karpenko Oleksandr, who later died of his injuries., With the digger providing Shturma and Taras cover, they dug a small trench with their bare hands and a knife, which took them 12 hours. They then crawled under a fence that ran along the road they were on and hid in the yard of a house for another day. They were eventually able to sneak out of the area, without the Russian sniper seeing them., Researchers followed the car’s path and saw over 20 bullet holes in the fences behind where Zaria and the mayor were shot, saw the car they had been in, which was still on the street, and the trench and hole under the fence that they had dug. Human Rights Watch also reviewed a CCTV screenshot from a camera in the area showing the digger blocking the car at 4:30 p.m. on March 3. Human Rights Watch identified three perforations in the body of the vehicle on the rear driver side, near where Zaria was sitting. The size and shape of the holes were consistent with projectiles fired from a heavy machine gun., A Killing in Nova Basan, March 12, Oleksandr, who withheld his last name, is the former father-in-law of Ihor Yakob, a 22-year-old welder, and lives in the northern outskirts of Nova Basan, a village in the Chernihiv region, 70 kilometers east of central Kyiv. Russian forces took control of the village on February 28 and stationed two armored vehicles on either side of the road entering the village next to the former father-in-law’s house. Oleksandr, the former father-in-law, said that at about 8 p.m. on March 12, he heard gunshots and looked out his window. He saw Russian forces firing on a van, which swerved and stopped. He then saw Ihor jump out of the passenger seat and run down a side street. Ihor’s friend Andrii, 30, a delivery driver, stayed in the car., Interviewed separately, Ihor said that, as they drove past the Russian forces, soldiers opened fire on the van, shooting the tires and forcing them to stop. He said he was injured with a bullet to his left shoulder but was able to jump out of the car and run away. Later, when he received medical treatment, the bullet was found lodged near his spine. He has suffered nerve damage in his left hand and cannot move his fingers., Oleksandr said that the van broke into flames. He saw soldiers drag Andrii from the driver’s seat and shout at him, “What is your military position?” and “Where are you stationed?” After a moment of silence, he heard one of them say, “He is drunk,” and then he heard them shoot Andrii multiple times., Oleksandr said his neighbor later came and took Andrii’s body and buried it in his yard. Two other neighbors described the same events to Human Rights Watch. Researchers examined the burned-out van., Neither Andrii, who was killed, nor Ihor, who was wounded, had any relation to the military, Ihor and Oleksandr said. On the day of the event, they were dressed in civilian clothes and were in a white civilian van.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-forces-fired-civilian-vehicles-enru
Older People No Longer Invisible Casualties of War in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,2 May 2022,"Governments, Aid Agencies Should Ensure Protection and Assistance, Bridget Sleap
Senior Researcher, Rights of Older People, The impact of war on older people has never been more visible than in the conflict in Ukraine. Images of older people unable to reach the safety of basements, being carried over makeshift bridges or walking through body-strewn streets haunt our screens. Some have been unable to flee. Others have decided not to leave their lifelong homes., As fighting intensifies in Donbas, evacuation from there becomes more difficult and living under Russian occupation more dangerous., Russian forces have threatened older people with summary execution, and arbitrarily detained them. The Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine is investigating alleged war crimes against older people, including Russian soldiers killing an older woman and injuring her husband as they cycled to a local hospital. In a village south of Chernihiv, Russian soldiers locked over 350 people in a school basement for 28 days. Ten died of suffocation or the harsh conditions of confinement. All those who died were older people., Disruption of food, energy, water, and medical supplies has also threatened older people’s survival. In Bucha, one man said he buried his older neighbor, who had relied on an oxygen concentrator and died when the power went off., What has been less visible is the impact on those older people living in facilities across the country., The director of an older people’s home in Kyiv said he tried to shield older people from the realities of the war to prevent traumas of the past returning. In Bucha, the bodies of six older people were found in a nursing home in early April. The cemetery workers who found them said they had died from hunger., A staff member from a psychiatric facility in Borodyank told Human Rights Watch that older residents spent a week under Russian occupation before being evacuated. The staff member said that Russian forces occupied the building following their evacuation, looted property, including computers, food, and other provisions, and defecated everywhere., International humanitarian law, or the “laws of war,” and human rights law protect older civilians and their property from harm during armed conflict. All parties to the conflict should abide by international law and ensure civilian protection. Russian forces should allow civilians at risk of hostilities or in Russian-controlled territory, including Mariupol and Kharkiv, to leave in safety to Ukraine-controlled territory if they choose. Humanitarian assistance should be facilitated for older people, including those with disabilities or who are sick or injured, and may require special attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/older-people-no-longer-invisible-casualties-war-ukraine-enru
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 28 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,29 Apr 2022,"Date: 29 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 28 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 6,134 civilian casualties in the country:, 2,899 killed and 3,235 injured. This included:, - a total of 2,899 killed (970 men, 646 women, 64 girls, and 76 boys, as well as 70 children and 1,073 adults whose sex is yet unknown), - a total of 3,235 injured (380 men, 314 women, 67 girls, and 76 boys, as well as 166 children and 2,232 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,963 casualties (1,411 killed and 1,552 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 2,499 casualties (1,317 killed and 1,182 injured),  On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 464 casualties (94 killed and 370 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,171 casualties (1,488 killed and 1,683 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-28-april-2022-enruuk
Ukraine war – How ordinary people became refugees,News and Press Release,FCA,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 May 2022,"When the terror began, they fled – Finn Church Aid followed the first weeks of Ukraine’s war and how ordinary people became refugees, In spring 2022, first thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of Ukrainians crossed the border to neighbouring countries in search of safety. Even more Ukrainians are living as internally displaced people. We documented the refugee crisis and aid deliveries on the spot for three weeks., 2 March 2022. In east Ukraine, the main street of the small village of Barabás is calm, despite Europe going through its worst crisis since World War II. The border is just a few minutes’ drive away, and on the other side, in Ukraine, Russia’s brutal war of aggression is raging., The local village house in Barabás has been turned into a refugee shelter, where Ukrainians who’ve left their homes and crossed the border can find safety. From there, they continue towards the Hungarian capital Budapest., The refugee crisis that has resulted from the war looks somehow different to what we’re used to seeing in news images. The camps that we’ve seen in traditional refugee imagery are missing from the sides of the roads, and some people are driving to safety in their modern cars. Almost everyone has a smartphone, and their clothes are unscathed; yet still these people are running for their lives., Inside the village house, there are tired families, to whom volunteers are serving food and drinks. The journey has been long, but the kids still have some energy left. They’re colouring at the tables, and you can hear someone giggle., Chop railway station, Kristina is standing outside, and her eyes seem sore from crying. The young woman has fled Russian aggression twice already. In 2014, she left her home in Lugansk in east Ukraine, and she thought she’d be able to return home after three days., The days turned into eight years, and Kristina settled in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. In February 2022, she had to flee again, and catching an evacuation train wasn’t easy., “People started to panic and run and push each other. There were men to whom we tried to tell that children must be protected first, then women and lastly men. Everyone was trying to save themselves,” Kristina says. She fled together with her mother and cat., At the railway station of Chop on the Ukrainian side of the border, an elderly lady sat in a half-empty departure lounge introduces herself as Nadiya Petrovna Chiripovskaya. She says she had started her journey from the badly bombed Kharkiv., Mrs Nadiya describes the first strikes as loud and scary. The calendar says it’s 5 March, but it’s difficult for her to remember when the journey began: “My children just took me with them.”, Many people leave the border crossing with a broken heart. Men are wiping their eyes and hugging low-spirited women and children, who are going to cross the border to Hungary and head to safety. Men of fighting age turn their cars around to cross the Carpathian Mountains, heading back to their homes and bases. No one knows when they can see their loved ones again – or whether this was a goodbye., Border town school turned into refugee shelter, Although millions of Ukrainians have left their home country, an even larger number of people is living as internally displaced people within the borders of Ukraine. In the border town of Berehove, a school hosts almost 80 internally displaced Ukrainians. There are five bunks beds placed a small room, and there’s a family of five sitting on them: father Kirill, mother Ljubov, siblings Alica and Masha, and their relative Daria., The family used to work at a theatre in Kharkiv and fled west as soon as the bombings and shelling began. Many loved ones stayed behind., “They are hiding in basements, staying at metro stations for various days and trying to find food in inconceivable ways,” says father Kirill., The family already misses having things to do. The following day, Kirill is going to go to a job interview, and the women are planning to weave protective nets for the Ukrainian army., The other family staying in the room has a small cat, and the animal is jumping from one bed to another. Larissa, wearing a scarf around hear head, says that it took four days for the family to reach Berehove from Kharkiv., “We’re happy to have a warm place to sleep, we get food three times a day, we can wash ourselves and do laundry.”, Larissa has cancer. In Kharkiv, she was given treatment, but the hospital has been destroyed by bombs. Now she wonders if it would be possible to be admitted to a Hungarian hospital, but she’s hesitant. The family members would end up apart, because her partner has to stay in Ukraine., Air raid in Lviv?, On 11 March, an air raid makes children and grownups jump out of their beds in Lviv, approximately 60 kilometres from the border with Poland. The time is 5.25, when the smartphone app starts to make a wailing sound. Quilted trousers on, coat on, two flights of stairs down, and to the basement door., Two families with children come to the bomb shelter. One of the children is sneezing and coughing; another one finds a piece of chalk and draws a heart on the foundation of the shelter. Previously someone has played noughts and crosses on the staircase., The girl continues her work tirelessly, and soon every stair in the bomb shelter is decorated with a lilac heart., At 7.34, the app says that the danger is over., Later on the same day, in the buzz of the Lviv railway station, we meet Anna, shivering in the station tunnel with her mother Natalia and cat Gorkik. The ginger animal leans firmly against Anna’s chest and trembles., One day at a time, In the outskirts of Lviv, 6-year-old boy Kyryl is leaning against a door frame with a grin on his face. He’s full of energy, and he’s jumping up and down in a room with mattresses on the floor. After fleeing Kyiv, the little rascal has spent four days in a refugee shelter at a church., Next to him, his sister says that Kyryl probably doesn’t understand he’s escaping. Many parents tell a similar story: children see the situation as a peculiar holiday, and they continue playing whenever an opportunity arises., Natalia Karpienko and her 9-year-old son Igor are staying in the room next door. On the bed lies the youngest guest of the shelter, Nastia. The two-month-old smells of sweet breastmilk, and she’s making happy sounds. Her small feet are kicking inside the playsuit, and there’s a white beanie on her head., Natalia says they’ve come from the Kyiv region, near Boryspil. “When the bombings started at night, I didn’t know where to go. I was scared that our house would be destroyed. In this shelter I feel safe.”, 400 meals a day, After mid-March, people have been fleeing the war for the fourth consecutive week. It’s striking to see that the border crossing between Hungary and Ukraine is now controlled by women in military outfits. Maybe all capable men are already fighting?, The border town of Berehove is full of internally displaced Ukrainians. Finn Church Aid and its sister organisation Hungarian Interchurch Aid are supporting refugees with food and material deliveries. The hardest work is done by local volunteers, who have been working around the clock for weeks to help refugees., The kitchen at a refugee shelter set up in a school is managed by Ivonna Kobypyavska. She’s worked in the same kitchen for 27 years already, but now she’s feeding refugees instead of school children. Ivonna’s son went to fight in Kyiv, so she wanted to do something useful; hence, she continued to work in the kitchen without pay., Now Ivonna and her team prepare 400 meals a day to fill the stomachs of refugees. Just a month ago, she was feeding 40 school kids. She starts her days in the kitchen at 6am and goes home at 11pm., “But it’s not a big deal,” Ivonna notes and smiles, looking baffled. Routine, routine, the translator says Ivonna has just told us., On the top floor of the school, there’s still the theatre family from Kharkiv we met weeks ago. Mother Ljubov is worried, because for a few days the family hasn’t been able to contact friends in Mariupol. Larissa, the cancer patient staying in the same room, has been admitted to a hospital in a nearby town. Her partner and daughter have stayed at the shelter, as has their cat Bella. Bella is walking on the bed frame and playfully pokes her paws towards the guests., Ljubov says that her husband Kirill hasn’t managed to find work yet. The future seems hazy, but three weeks at the shelter has made the family consider what to do next. Ljubov has been toying with ideas: maybe Poland, if she can find a suitable art project. We say goodbye to the family and wish them the best of luck., In mid-April, we receive a message. Daria from the theatre family tells us she’s gone to Italy to try her wings. The other girls of the family are in Georgia, and father Kirill has stayed in Berehove., Text: Ulriikka Myöhänen

European Rotaract clubs organize to help Ukrainian refugees,News and Press Release,Rotary,Protection and Human Rights,1 May 2022,"Within hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, Iryna Bushmina fled her home in Kyiv. Along with her sister and her three-month-old nephew, she journeyed to Vienna, Austria, staying with Rotary members along the way. Their generosity inspired Bushmina, a member of the Rotaract Club of Kyiv-City and the district Rotaract representative for Ukraine, to organize a larger-scale relief effort — and now, an online platform she created has helped Rotaract and Rotary members find shelter for thousands of Ukrainian refugees., Across Europe, Rotaract members are using digital tools to share information and coordinate to help people who have been affected by the war in Ukraine. By routing communications through the European Rotaract Information Centre (also known as Rotaract Europe), a multidistrict information organization that serves clubs in more than 40 countries, these young members are using the power of Rotary's global network to direct aid where it's needed most., Shortly after the war began, Christiane Leitner, the president of Rotaract Europe, learned about a project that was already underway to help Ukrainians. Led by the Rotaract Club of Klagenfurt-Wörthersee, Austria, Rotaractors coordinated using the Rotaract Europe website, then packed five vans and cars full of relief supplies and drove through the night to the Polish-Ukrainian border, where local Rotaractors were waiting to deliver the aid., ""This really stood out to me as an example of how quickly our Rotary network can make things happen,"" says Leitner, a member of the Rotaract Club of Linz, Austria. After learning about dozens of Rotaract initiatives that started within a week of the invasion, she realized that Rotaract Europe could play a key role in coordinating communication among Rotaract and Rotary clubs and districts and facilitating partnerships that could lead to projects., Rotaract Europe leaders have compiled information for refugees as well as for volunteers on their website under the heading United for Peace. As Bushmina worked to create a housing-specific platform called Spaces for Ukraine, she used the United for Peace webpage to post information and a form to match refugees with hosts. The page also offers updates about projects in neighboring countries, information about free rail, bus, and air transportation available to refugees, and tips for helping people at the border. There are lists of needed supplies and options for making donations as well., ""Rotaract clubs have the chance to get an overview of what's going on in and around Ukraine, and then decide what projects they can help implement,"" Leitner says. ""We want to make it as easy as possible for our members to connect and collaborate."", Leitner and other leaders of Rotaract Europe meet weekly over Zoom with Rotaract representatives from each European country to exchange ideas and share updates about projects. These meetings have helped foster better communication and organization, she says., Since it began as a coalition of clubs in 1988, Rotaract Europe has focused on sharing information about Rotaract activities across borders. But the effort to help Ukrainians is different, Leitner says: ""We are being much more proactive than in the past. The passion and energy of Rotaractors are really motivating us to do more.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/european-rotaract-clubs-organize-help-ukrainian-refugees

Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",1 May 2022,"Highlights, WFP reached over 2.7 million displaced and conflict-affected people with food and cash throughout Ukraine.
WFP transferred an amount of USD 9.1 million to close to 144,000 internally displaced people, mostly in western Ukraine.
WFP’s Ukraine emergency response is currently funded at 46 percent. Timely funding is urgently needed to avoid immediate pipeline breaks., Situation Update, Conflict and insecurity continue to aggravate food insecurity and malnutrition across the country, devastating the livelihoods and wellbeing of vulnerable people. The revised UN Flash Appeal (March - August) estimates that some 10.2 million people across Ukraine are in need of food and livelihood assistance, showing an increase of over 350 percent compared to the estimate of the initial UN flash appeal of 2.25 million people.
These findings resonate with the WFP’s latest food security survey, which concluded that one in every three households in Ukraine are now food insecure. In eastern and southern parts of the country, which have witnessed the most intense impacts of the fighting, more than 50 percent of the population of Luhanksa (56 percent) and Kharkivska (50 percent) were found to be severely to moderately food insecure. Other Oblasts like Khersonska, Donetska,
Chernihivska also have about 45 percent of their populations facing high food insecurity.
Displacement has also taken a heavy toll on the food security of vulnerable populations, hampering access to nutritious food. About 54 percent of the internally displaced people (IDPs) are food insecure compared to 23 percent of resident populations who are still in their homes. IDPs in the eastern and southern parts of the country are the most food insecure—62 percent in the east and 59 percent in the south are severely to moderately food insecure.
About 35 percent of the population employ coping strategies such as reducing the number of meals eaten per day, the portion size of meals, restricting adult consumption to feed children, borrowing food, or eating less preferred foods.
More than 50 percent of the population in Luhanska,
Khersonska, and Chernihiviska are using such coping strategies. Separated families have higher levels of food insecurity. On average, 48 percent of separated families are food insecure compared to 29 percent of non-separated.
Amid these rising needs, humanitarian access remains impeded by ongoing fighting, hampering the delivery of the much-needed assistance to the vulnerable people in hard-toreach areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-situation-report-15-1-may-2022
Ukraine creates a single information space for all parties involved in the blood- and blood products-related healthcare [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Health,18 Apr 2022,"The information space will ensure effective interaction between all participants in the blood-and blood products-related healthcare: donors, recipients, medical institutions and authorities, Kyiv, 18 April 2022 - The Ministry of Health of Ukraine, with the support of UNDP, has completed the preparation of technical requirements for the creation of an information space for the participants in the blood- and blood products-related healthcare., The information space is a set of technologies that enable information exchange between all participants in the system: donors, recipients, blood centers, executive and supervisory national and local authorities, as well as patients organisations and other civil society entities. In particular, a unified and centralised national system is created to record donors, recipients, donations, stocks, needs of blood and/or its components, and blood transfusions in Ukraine., The functioning of such a space will help to address the many challenges the blood- and blood-related healthcare faces due to lack of financial, logistical, and human resources., Due to previous systemic hiccoughs, this very complex medical sphere faced a lack of volunteer donors and blood components, absence of control over the technological processes of procurement, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of donor blood and blood components, lack of centralized management of blood components, insufficient supervision over the proper use of blood components for patients, the provision of transfusion services and absence of hemostasis. All of it caused serious obstacles to introducing high quality blood-related medical care in Ukraine. The new information space will help to overcome the disorder of the system by uniting donors, recipients, donations, transfusions, and blood components in Ukraine into a single accounting system. The features of the space will serve both the donors - potential and available, as well as the staff of medical institutions., By means of ""personal accounts"" donors will receive information about the existing rewards system for donors and the current updates on the needs of blood or its components. Recipients will have full access to transfusions, while the monitoring system will guarantee the security of all processes and ensure the safety of donors., At the same time, the system will automate the work of blood centers. The functioning of a single information space will solve issues not only in individual medical institutions but also at the regional and national levels. The automation of certain processes will also reduce the burden on the hospital staff and the administration, thus allowing them to concentrate on other important activities, but more importantly will seriously reduce the likelihood of human errors.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-creates-single-information-space-all-parties-involved-blood-and-blood
People from abroad can now support Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,21 Apr 2022,"From now on, Ukrainians can get direct help from people all around the world via the eDopomoga site, Kyiv, 21 April 2022 – The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Ukraine, with the support of the government of Sweden, has provided technical support for the development of the eDopomoga platform. The platform was developed by the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine with support from the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and was launched in March 2022., The site was developed to bring together people who are seeking support and those who can help them. Ukrainians affected by the war can leave an application with a list of things they need, and benefactors can buy and provide the goods that are needed., In mid-April, a new feature appeared on the site – Help online. From now on, after selecting an application for help, users can pay for a social certificate for the necessary goods so that the applicant can buy them for themselves. That way, people from abroad can now use the site and provide direct help to Ukrainians., To do so, people abroad can now go to the eDopomoga site, switch the site to their language (as well as Ukrainian, the site supports English, Polish, German and French), and click “Help Fast” in the “Help online” section to the left. Having entered a contact number, the user then selects one of the applications for assistance and enters the amount they are willing to give in support of the applicant. Once the user has completed the payment, the applicant who has been helped will receive an SMS with a code. They can use the code in any store that is a partner of the eDopomoga platform, redeeming it for the goods indicated in their application., UNDP provided technical assistance for the development of the platform under the “Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine Project” project (DIA Support Project), which it implements with the financial support of Sweden. The DIA Support Project was launched in 2021 and aims to bridge the digital divide between different generations and different social groups.

‘Leave no Child Alone’ campaign to improve protection for children without parental care [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,21 Apr 2022,"Information campaign to focus on ensuring child rights for some of the most vulnerable children affected by war., LVIV, 21 April 2022 –A new campaign, ‘Leave no Child Alone’, launched today will provide advice and guidance for child protection authorities and caregivers on how to best support children without parental care, The campaign, run by UNICEF Ukraine, the Office of the President of Ukraine, the Presidential Advisor on Children’s Rights and Child Rehabilitation, and the Ministry of Social Policy, aims to ultimately prevent child rights violations., The campaign provides information and legal advice on how to support children without parental care, as well as guidance on temporary home and care options will bolster the protection of these extremely vulnerable children., “Today, the number of children deprived of parental care and being at risk is growing. First, these are children from regions where active hostilities and bombing of residential areas are taking place. The chat bot @dytyna_ne_sama_bot (“Child not alone”) is a tool which can help people give a temporarily shelter in their family to a child who got lost or is left without parental care,” said Maryna Lazebna, Minister of Social Policy in Ukraine., The campaign will scale-up access to the already established UNICEF supported Telegram chatbot ‘@dytyna_ne_sama_bot’ (Leave no Child Alone), which provides opportunities for families and organizations to submit an application to children’s services to provide temporary care for children in need. Over 15,000 Ukrainian families and more than 500 organizations from abroad have already submitted their applications for screening and review through the chatbot., ""Even before the war, nearly 17,000 children in Ukraine were up for adoption. Orphans and children deprived of parental care need to grow up in a home and family environment instead of upbringing in institutional care facilities. With each bombing, the number of these children is increasing. We are planning to improve the adoption process and will digitize some of its components, which will be launched immediately after the war. Currently a large number of families are able and willing to help these children - they need additional information and latest updates on the process,"" - said Dariya Herasymchuk, Advisor to the President of Ukraine on the Rights of the child and child rehabilitation., The Ministry of Social Policy will launch a new webpage with specific guidance on the protection of child rights during wartime. UNICEF is providing technical support for the content development and management of the page., “Every child in Ukraine needs assistance, as this horrific war continues, but children without parental care are particularly at risk of exploitation and abuse,” said UNICEF Ukraine Representative, Murat Sahin. “This campaign unites all our efforts to best protect children across the country,” Sahin added., The three-month campaign integrates digital content and outdoor advertising, as well as national and international media engagement.

"Ukraine: ""Some people are too scared to surface at all""",News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",29 Apr 2022,"MSF doctor Lisa Searle writes about her experience caring for displaced people in Kharkiv’s metro stations, Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, has been severely affected by the Russian offensive. While many of the 1.8 million people who lived in Kharkiv before the war broke out have fled, some 350,000 who were unwilling or unable to leave remain in the city, according to local authorities., Many have taken refuge in underground subway stations to escape the incessant bombing. Trapped underground, they are cut off from essential services, including health care. From children who are too afraid to fall asleep to people who feel like they can’t breathe to patients with high blood pressure at risk of stroke, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) mobile clinics working in several stations on three of Kharkiv’s subway lines are treating a wide range of health conditions, both pre-existing and related to or exacerbated by the conflict., Here, MSF doctor Lisa Searle describes her experiences caring for patients sheltering below the city., The public transport system has completely collapsed here, and the network of underground subway stations have become refuges for people whose homes have been destroyed by airstrikes and shelling, or who are too scared to stay at home above the surface. Being on the surface now feels so strange, eerie. A few people hurrying down the streets in ones or twos clutching bags of supplies. Trying to get to safety before the next air raid alarm sounds, which is often, at least four or five times a day. And after only a few days here, the sound of outgoing and incoming shelling has become background noise. It's just too exhausting to spend too much time thinking about what it means whenever we hear that sound. Another building destroyed, more lives lost and homes destroyed. Today during one of my too-brief visits to the surface, I could see smoke rising from a building that had just been hit, in a part of the city that is already destroyed and suffering more damage every day. The hits from above force the buildings' contents to spew out onto the streets. Books, clothes, shredded insulation, bricks, curtains, and cooking pots trailing out of the buildings and down to the ground, like intestines hanging out of a disemboweled body., The whole country is in a state of emergency. The few remaining inhabitants of this city are huddled underground, crammed into the subways or makeshift basement shelters. Trying to survive. Most people who had the means have left, leaving behind the elderly, the disabled, those with chronic mental health conditions. The most vulnerable. During the day some people venture out, squinting against the bright lights and shuffling down the streets, terrified and waiting for the next impact. Some people are too scared to surface at all and have been underground for weeks., We are working underground, running mobile clinics for the displaced population and sleeping in the underground Metro stations on whatever we can find. With the sudden flood of displaced people from Ukraine, over 6 million now in the whole country, there is no camping gear left anywhere. The nights are cold, so people wrap up in coats and blankets, trying to stay warm. As we finished our clinic tonight and packed up, picking our way through the crowded platform, a woman I had treated called out to me, ""Doctor!"", and handed me a shiny red apple with a grin. I took it gratefully, holding her hand for a second, touched that she was willing to share what little she had with me. She looked me in the eyes, thanking me profusely for being here. She lost her home in the shelling and has nowhere else to go. She is suffering panic attacks and insomnia, as well as being unable to access her regular medication for high blood pressure., Tonight I spoke to an elderly woman whose home was hit and destroyed yesterday. She and her husband were at home, her inside the apartment and him on the stairs. They heard the first explosion and had no time to react before their block was hit. They were pulled from the rubble by emergency services and, through some miracle, the only injury between them was a ruptured eardrum. She was distraught. She has nowhere else to go, so she has joined the thousands like her now living a subterranean life, with no privacy or washing facilities. Stories like this are everywhere. So many of the patients we see present to us for a problem which initially seems fairly simple, like a top-up of their blood pressure medication, or a check-up for a sore throat. But once we start talking to them, they often break down, words spilling out of them about the horrors they have endured., I treated an 11-year old boy two nights ago whose father brought him to see me. Initially, he was complaining of difficulty breathing, and when I asked some more questions it became clear that this only happens when he has to go up to the surface. Panic attacks are common among the people living here underground. They are terrified of surfacing and many of them experience severe panic attacks at even the prospect of going up., Something inspiring and positive here amongst all this suffering is the appearance of local volunteer networks throughout the city: people organizing themselves and working together to help those most in need. Local people who have decided to stay here are taking requests from people stuck in their homes, and coordinating donations of food, hygiene items, and medications. Local drivers travel around the city, taking huge risks to get these much-need items to the most vulnerable. I meet people every day whose compassion and determination to help the most vulnerable brings tears to my eyes and forces me to see the hope that lives on in this devastated place.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-some-people-are-too-scared-surface-all

It said they demanded daily reports from plant management about “confidential issues” on the functioning of the NPP, covering aspects related to administration and management, maintenance and repair activities, security and access control, and management of nuclear fuel, spent fuel and radioactive wastes., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that personnel at the Zaporizhzhya NPP – the country’s largest with six reactors – were “working under unbelievable pressure”., Russian forces seized the plant on 4 March.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, Note: This update to the Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) builds upon the rapidly-developed document published on 3 March 2022. The update adds depth to the information presented in the previous version, tracks changes in the situation, considers additional threats, and incorporates data from assessments.
There are an estimated 15.7 million people affected by the war in Ukraine in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 12.1 million are considered in need of humanitarian health care., This analysis has identified the priority health threats to the conflict-affected population based on the current situation and their expected evolution over the next three months. In areas of active fighting, facilities struggle to cope with number of casualties. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has substantially decreased globally and in Ukraine, with weekly decreasing trends. Since the beginning of the war, it is important to note that testing and reporting capacities in Ukraine have been limited. It is important to note that since the beginning of the war the testing and reporting capacities have been limited. However, COVID-19 remains a substantial threat, particularly given low vaccination rates. The recently reported case of diphtheria in an internally displaced person, highlights the threat of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. Despite childhood vaccination coverage reportedly being close to WHO targets in 2021, disruptions to immunization programmes due to hostilities and displacement, coupled with historical coverage gaps, place both adults and children at risk. TB and HIV programmes have been disrupted, impeding access to medicines, potentially delaying treatment due to unreported infections and risking further disease transmission in a country known to have higher rates of TB and HIV/AIDS than its regional neighbours. 4, 5 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, are the leading cause of death in Ukraine. 6 Reduced access to health care and medicines due to hostilities is likely to worsen the health status of the population, impacting quality of life and life expectancy.7 Mental health and psychosocial support needs of the affected population are intensifying as a result of the significant distress and socio-economic effects caused by the war., Vulnerable groups are disproportionately impacted by health threats and barriers to accessing health care. Of particular concern are the elderly. It is estimated that 20% of the population of Ukraine are 60 years and older – the highest proportion of elderly persons in a humanitarian setting in the world. 8 Other vulnerable groups identified in this analysis are people with disabilities (PwD), children and youth, women and girls, Roma, health care workers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, Note: This update to the Public Health Situation Analysis (PHSA) builds upon the rapidly-developed document published on 3 March 2022. The update adds depth to the information presented in the previous version, tracks changes in the situation, considers additional threats, and incorporates data from assessments.
There are an estimated 15.7 million people affected by the war in Ukraine in need of humanitarian assistance, of which 12.1 million are considered in need of humanitarian health care., This analysis has identified the priority health threats to the conflict-affected population based on the current situation and their expected evolution over the next three months. In areas of active fighting, facilities struggle to cope with number of casualties. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has substantially decreased globally and in Ukraine, with weekly decreasing trends. Since the beginning of the war, it is important to note that testing and reporting capacities in Ukraine have been limited. It is important to note that since the beginning of the war the testing and reporting capacities have been limited. However, COVID-19 remains a substantial threat, particularly given low vaccination rates. The recently reported case of diphtheria in an internally displaced person, highlights the threat of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases. Despite childhood vaccination coverage reportedly being close to WHO targets in 2021, disruptions to immunization programmes due to hostilities and displacement, coupled with historical coverage gaps, place both adults and children at risk. TB and HIV programmes have been disrupted, impeding access to medicines, potentially delaying treatment due to unreported infections and risking further disease transmission in a country known to have higher rates of TB and HIV/AIDS than its regional neighbours. 4, 5 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, are the leading cause of death in Ukraine. 6 Reduced access to health care and medicines due to hostilities is likely to worsen the health status of the population, impacting quality of life and life expectancy.7 Mental health and psychosocial support needs of the affected population are intensifying as a result of the significant distress and socio-economic effects caused by the war., Vulnerable groups are disproportionately impacted by health threats and barriers to accessing health care. Of particular concern are the elderly. It is estimated that 20% of the population of Ukraine are 60 years and older – the highest proportion of elderly persons in a humanitarian setting in the world. 8 Other vulnerable groups identified in this analysis are people with disabilities (PwD), children and youth, women and girls, Roma, health care workers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Each of these groups has distinctive humanitarian health care needs which demand attention., Many of the social determinants of health, such as water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food security, shelter, security, restriction of movement, impact the health of displaced and nondisplaced populations. Having an understanding of the status of these determinants gives context to the health issues faced by those affected and can help inform intervention planning., The needs of the health system are highlighted by describing the disruptions and challenges experienced by key health system components and their predicted impact over the next three months.

More than 5 million people have now fled Ukraine and millions more have been displaced internally. In addition to those who have had to flee, an estimated 13 million people remain stranded in areas hardest hit by the war within Ukraine and are in need of urgent support., As the humanitarian needs continue to increase, donations from the private sector are essential in enabling UNHCR to scale up its relief efforts., Since UK for UNHCR’s Ukraine Emergency appeal launched, corporate donors have shown their support and solidarity in a number of ways, including direct cash donations, employee fundraising, payroll giving, product donations and customer-facing campaigns, from established and new partners., As refugees continue to flee across the border to Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary and other neighbouring countries, contributions from the private sector have already enabled UNHCR to scale up its lifesaving work in these countries and inside Ukraine., For example, airlifts and truck convoys swiftly delivered essential items, such as high thermal blankets and baby kits, and specialist staff are on the ground providing protection services such as psychosocial support and targeted care to the most vulnerable, including unaccompanied and separated children. UNHCR has also established an emergency cash assistance programmes in Poland, Moldova and Romania, giving enrolled refugees an emergency cash grant to help them buy essentials such as medicine, food or children’s items., Estelle Hollingsworth, Virgin Atlantic Foundation trustee and Chief People Office for Virgin Atlantic said: ""We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine caught up in this senseless war.

Our people have rallied together in their fundraising efforts, organising charity football matches, bake sales, raffles and more. We’re proud to partner with UNCHR both during this time of crisis, and also for the long-term supporting refugees beyond this emergency.”, Alex Gerko, Founder & co-CEO, XTX Markets, said: “We are proud to partner with UNHCR.

UNHCR has been a key partner for M&S and we’re delighted that our donation of £500,000 and 12,000 units of coats and thermals will help with their humanitarian response. This is part of a wider £1.5m package of support that M&S is mobilising for the people of Ukraine. We would like to thank UNHCR for their important work at this critical time.”, Emma Cherniavsky, Chief Executive, UK for UNHCR, said: “We are so grateful to the corporations that are supporting UNHCR’s work in Ukraine and with refugees from the country. The scale of the crisis is staggering, and support like this from the private sector means that we can act quickly to deliver life-saving aid now, and commit to staying for as long as we’re needed.”, Generous private sector donors to UK for UNHCR include:, Arm, Aesop Foundation, Alexander McQueen, Arnold Clark, Arup, Atom Bank, Avanti Communications, Baker McKenzie, Capital Group, CBRE, CheckOut.com, Deloitte, DLA Piper, EDF, Experian, Facepunch Studios, FARFETCH, First Sentier Investors, Herbert Smith Freehills, Inchcape plc, Just Eat Takeaway.com, Kellogg’s, Marks & Spencer, Macfarlanes, Micropathology Ltd, National Grid, Next, Oliver Bonas, Papa John’s, Slaughter and May, Suzuki GB PLC, Swarovski Foundation, The Restaurant Group, Unilever, Uniqlo UK, Virgin Atlantic Foundation, Virgin Red, Wise, WPP, XTX Markets., As well as supporting the Ukraine crisis, a number of UK for UNHCR partners are ensuring that refugees and crises currently outside the media spotlight also continue to receive support, such as the Swarovski Foundation, which has also committed to funding for ‘invisible emergencies’, and the Virgin Atlantic Foundation, which is supporting refugee children’s education in India., In times of crisis, UNHCR is committed to staying and delivering – the war in Ukraine is no different.

Humanitarian needs in the region continue to rise, with affected populations requiring critical support., IOM is one of the largest humanitarian actors in Ukraine where it has been working since 1996 and continues to engage with states and partners to coordinate response efforts across Ukraine and neighboring countries., The IOM Flash Appeal aims to reach over 10 million people; eight million in Ukraine and two million people who have fled the country. Persons targeted for assistance include internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, third-country nationals, and vulnerable populations including women, children, elderly people and those with disabilities., The Organization will continue to support national and local governments, as well as non-governmental and civil society partners, across a variety of sectors. A key component of the response will be to enhance capacities to manage collective informal shelters, accommodation centres, reception and transit sites in a safe and dignified manner. IOM will also provide temporary shelter and non-food items to those in need., Faced with mounting health needs, IOM will continue to improve access to healthcare and support outbreak preparedness and response. Medical teams are deployed, offering services such as wellness screenings and mental health and psychosocial support. In addition, IOM is working to improve Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and service provision, which have been severely affected by the hostilities., IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is also being scaled up to better understand mobility dynamics and strengthen the wider humanitarian response to the crisis., The Organization’s established supply chain in the region will continue to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to populations in hard-to-access areas. IOM’s presence and logistics capacity enables it to address the immediate food and livelihood needs of vulnerable individuals, including through distributing food parcels and providing multipurpose cash-based assistance., With the war raising an array of protection concerns, IOM is offering protection services to vulnerable people, including survivors of and people at risk of trafficking and gender-based violence, unaccompanied and separated migrant children, people with disabilities and third country nationals., IOM operates hotlines to share up-to-date information on services, referral mechanisms, border crossings, and trafficking prevention and reporting in Ukraine and neighbouring countries IOM is further leveraging its vast experience in humanitarian movements by supporting voluntary transits, resettlement and return assistance., Thanks to the generosity of donors and partners, this appeal will enable IOM on the ground to meet these humanitarian objectives, protect those forcibly displaced inside and outside Ukraine and uphold their human rights and dignity., IOM’s Global Crisis Response Platform provides an overview of IOM’s plans and funding requirements to respond to the evolving needs and aspirations of those impacted by, or at risk of, crisis and displacement in 2022 and beyond.

So far, Russia has only made minor gains in this so-called “Battle for Donbas”. However, analysts anticipate that Russia has yet to pull all its forces into the effort and anticipate a rapid escalation in the coming weeks., Meanwhile, fighting continues in the besieged city of Mariupol. Located along Ukraine’s southeast coast, this port city has been surrounded by Russian troops for almost two months. Only limited evacuations have taken place there to date—leaving tens of thousands of civilians trapped and without access to essential goods and services. The situation is unlikely to improve as Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be in a deadly standoff over this strategic location., After some successful evacuations from the city, the number of new Mariupol evacuees has started to decrease. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), this is because Russian forces have begun collecting information on those wishing to flee in a large database—the effort is considerably slow and resulting in queues exceeding 5,000 at each collection site. iv Men under 65 years of age are not allowed to sign up to be evacuated., With fighting concentrated in the east, notable attacks are still taking place elsewhere—including airstrikes in Lviv over the weekend. The attacks are of significant concern as Lviv has been a major hub for internally displaced persons (IDPs) because of its perceived relative security., At the Civilian-Military Coordination briefing, analysts shared that recent attacks in the west and north, as exhibited in Lviv, have been targeted, including launching of rockets at railway points to block aid. They forecast that strikes aimed at high-value targets (e.g., airfields, petroleum storage sites) would continue but that larger-scale bombardments were unlikely while Russian forces remain largely positioned in the east., Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, is not receiving IDPs due to security concerns, according to a UNHCR protection officer. Although Russia has largely pulled back from the city for the time being, new reports of found bodies—some with signs of torture—continue to emerge., The conflict has displaced 7.1 million Ukrainians to date. The most pressing needs among this population are cash and financial support, transportation, food, shelter, and hygiene items. Many are also in need of medicines and health services.vi The humanitarian conditions for those who remain in their homes are also severe. Over 1.4 million people are without running water in Eastern Ukraine and an addition 1.6 million across the country are in immediate risk of losing their access. Many others face significant protection, food, and health risks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-14-22-april-2022

Since then, the remote data transmission has been partially re-established; additional work is required by the facility operator. For the other NPPs in Ukraine, remote data is being transferred to IAEA headquarters., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-66-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-28-april-2022
OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Secretary General announce upcoming closure of Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine,News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,28 Apr 2022,"WARSAW/VIENNA, 28 April 2022 –OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Foreign Minister of Poland Zbigniew Rau and OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid have today announced that the OSCE would take immediate steps to implement the closure of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine., This decision follows the lack of consensus at the OSCE Permanent Council on 31 March 2022 to extend the Mission’s mandate., “This is not an easy decision to take. We have explored all possible options through political dialogue with participating States to achieve the renewal of the Special Monitoring Mission’s mandate, but the position of the Russian Federation left us with no choice but to take steps to close down the Mission,” said Chairman-in-Office Rau. “The Mission played a crucial role in providing objective information on the ground, facilitating ceasefires and working to ease the effects of the conflict on the civilian population. The work of the SMM’s members deserves our appreciation and gratitude”., Minister Rau assured that the Organization will seek to continue its engagement in the country in line with existing OSCE commitments. “The Polish Chairmanship will continue to engage with participating States in order to explore alternatives on the OSCE’s future role in Ukraine,” he stressed., Secretary General Schmid added that; “The vital role the Mission played for the past eight years by providing invaluable and objective facts on the ground, facilitating dialogue where there was none and enabling the repairs of civilian infrastructure on which millions of people depend, cannot be overestimated”., “I am extremely proud of our mission members who have been working tirelessly to fulfil their crucial tasks, in good times and bad,” she added. “The objectivity, impartiality and professionalism they demonstrated, as well as their personal commitment to the people of Ukraine, deserves our highest recognition.”, “The OSCE will initiate immediately operational, administrative and financial steps to close the Mission as responsibly and cost-effectively as possible, with the safety and security of mission members throughout Ukraine remaining a priority,” emphasized Schmid. “We continue to do our utmost day and night to support our Ukrainian colleagues, and continue to press through all available channels for an end to the detentions, intimidation, and disinformation that are so dangerous for our national mission members.”, Contacts, Communication and Media Relations Section

Ukraine Crisis: Week of 16-22 April 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,28 Apr 2022,"Russian forces focused operations on the Donbas region last week, where Russia has been supporting separatist armed formations since 2014 (Hromadske 18 April 2022). More than half of all political violence events in Ukraine last week were recorded in Donbas, where the city of Mariupol remains under siege. In Mariupol, Ukrainian forces continued to fight from their positions in the Azostal plant, despite a Russian ultimatum to surrender (USA Today, 21 April 2022). Alongside Ukrainian soldiers, about 1,000 civilians are trapped in the Azovstal plant, as Russia refuses to facilitate the opening of humanitarian corridors (Hromadske, 25 April 2022)., Heavy fighting continued in the southern regions of Ukraine as well last week. While fighting was mostly centered in the Zaporizhia region, clashes were also recorded in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, where Russian forces occupy territories that link the Donbas region with occupied Crimea., Meanwhile, Russia continued to launch missiles targeting cities across Ukraine throughout the week, including deadly strikes on Odesa and Lviv (Ukrayinska Pravda, 17 April 2022; Al Jazeera, 22 April 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-16-22-april-2022
Secretary-General's remarks at press conference with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine,News and Press Release,UN SG,Protection and Human Rights,28 Apr 2022,"President Zelenskyy, thank you very much for your warm welcome in these most difficult times., Today, Ukraine is an epicenter of unbearable heartache and pain., I witnessed that very vividly today around Kyiv: the senseless loss of life, the massive destruction, the unacceptable violations of human rights and the laws of war., It is vital that the International Criminal Court and other UN mechanisms conduct their work so that there can be real accountability., The position of the United Nations is clear., As I said in Moscow, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and of the Charter of the United Nations., I am here to focus on ways on how the UN can expand support for the people of Ukraine, saving lives, reduce suffering and help find the path of peace., I want the Ukrainian people to know that the world sees you, hears you, and is in awe of your resilience and resolve., I also know that words of solidarity are not enough., I am here to zero in on needs on the ground and scale up operations., Let me be very clear. The Security Council failed to do everything in its power to prevent and end this war. This is a source of great disappointment, frustration and anger., But the men and women of the United Nations are working every day for the people of Ukraine, side by side with so many brave Ukrainian organizations., I salute the more than 1,400 staff of the UN — the vast majority of whom are Ukrainian nationals. They are on the ground in 9 operational hubs and 30 locations., Many have been here from day one — and we have sent in additional personnel since then to serve the Ukrainian people. They are engaged in an enormously complicated mission under difficult conditions., This is one of the fastest scale-up operations we have ever undertaken, and we are very much aware that not everything is perfect. Whatever we can provide pales in comparison to the needs., I am here to pledge that we will boost our efforts across the board – coordinating with the Ukrainian Government every step of the way., Until now, we have provided life-saving humanitarian aid to 3.4 million people inside Ukraine – and we are aiming to more than double that number to 8.7 million by the end of August. Some recent estimates show a worst-case scenario in which some 25 million people could be in need of humanitarian assistance by the end of this year. We hope this scenario does not materialize but we are obliged to plan for it., We are expanding our cash assistance – distributing $100 million per month, reaching 1.3 million people by May and covering 2 million by August., This will be done in very close coordination with the Ukrainian Government., This is not a typical humanitarian UN operation in a developing country, with lots of problems of governance and lots of difficulties. Ukraine is a country with a government and with a system of support to its citizens, and so the role of the UN is not replace that system, it is to support the Government to support the people of Ukraine., Our food aid has reached 2.3 million people, but we want to help 4 million by May and 6 million by June, and the plans will be implemented., With more than 12 million Ukrainians who have fled their homes, we are supporting host countries that have generously received over 5 million refugees. But, more important, we are increasing our capacity to meet the needs of the 7.7 million that have been displaced inside the country based on the recent survey by the International Organization for Migration., The World Health Organization is delivering medical supplies for trauma and emergency care for more than seven million people. We are also stepping up our vital efforts to extend urgent health care, emergency shelter, water and sanitation and to protect children and end gender-based violence, all in very close contact and very close coordination with the Ukrainian Government., And we are advancing the work of accountability and justice by monitoring and reporting on human rights violations wherever they are detected., Ladies and gentlemen of the press,, All this work is essential, but it doesn’t address the root cause of all this human suffering: the war itself., This war must end, and peace must established in line the charter of the United Nations and international law., Many leaders have made many good efforts to stop the fighting, though these efforts, so far, have not succeeded., I am here to say to you, Mr. President, and to the people of Ukraine: We will not give up., As we keep pushing for a full-scale ceasefire, we will also keep striving for immediate practical steps to save lives and reduce human suffering., Effective humanitarian corridors. Local cessations of hostilities. Safe passage for civilian and supply routes., Today, the people of Mariupol are in desperate need for just such an approach., Mariupol is a crisis within a crisis., Thousands of civilians need life-saving assistance., Many are elderly, in need of medical care or have limited mobility., They need an escape route out of the apocalypse., During my visit to Moscow, President Putin agreed, in principle, to the involvement of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross in the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol., Today, President Zelenskyy and I had the opportunity to address this issue., As we speak, there are in intense discussions to move forward on this proposal to make it a reality., Finally, let me say that, in many ways, we are at ground zero for the world we need to build – a world of respect for international law, the UN Charter and the power of multilateralism, a world that protects civilians, a world that advances human rights, a world where leaders live up to the values that they have promised to uphold., That, too, is a struggle – but it is one that we must win for the sake of every country, community and person around the world., Thank you., Question: And my question to the Secretary-General. You have been to Moscow recently and spoke to the biggest war criminal of the 21st century, the head of the biggest gas station of planet Earth, Mr. Putin. You looked into his eyes and now, he told you obviously something, and now, you are here in Ukraine and you have seen what he has done around Kyiv and Ukraine. Do you see any chance, any practical chances, that the world can stop him, especially with his continuous threats to use the nuclear weapons? Thank you., Secretary-General: I have to say that what I said in Moscow, what I said here, and what I say in New York is exactly the same. Probably, you have heard my press conference with [Russian Foreign] Minister [Sergey] Lavrov – the speech was very similar to this one. You have, eventually, seen the part that the Russian television has given, the conversation between President Putin and myself, and you heard me saying, to President Putin, the same things I said myself., So, it has been coherent with the defense of the values of the UN, and the values of the UN Charter, and one of the values of the UN and the UN Charter is that the territorial integrity of countries must be respected. This is fundamental from the point of view of international law. And I hope that, as in everything else in life, law will prevail., **Question: **Mr. General Secretary, could you please tell us a little bit more about the general principle that Mr. Putin agreed on when you met him in Moscow a few days ago? And what will the UN do if the Russian Federation is violating these general principles the President agreed on. Thank you very much., Secretary-General: May I go first, please? Madam, what do you want? Do you want the people to be rescued, or do you want me to say something that will be an obstacle to that task? At the present moment, I can only tell you, we are doing everything we can to make it happen. I am not going to enter into any comments that would undermine that possibility because my first and only priority is the people that suffer and the people that must be rescued., Question: [inaudible], Secretary-General: That's exactly what you want, is for me to say things that would not facilitate the work that we are doing at the present moment, which is to guarantee that that happens. I cannot admit that it will not happen. If it will not happen, I will take the right decisions at the right moment., Question: And about a timeframe, you can say anything about the timeframe?, Secretary-General: Again, I am working with only one objective, not to shine in the media. I'm being very boring to the media on purpose because the only way to ensure the rescue of people is to be boring to the media, because we have enough difficulties by themselves., Question: I have a question to Secretary-General. First, you told us today that the UN Security Council has not fulfilled the functions as some would expect of that. Then how would you need to reform the United Nations organization in order for that organization to be effective in settling the conflicts and not to follow the paths of the League of Nations?, Secretary-General: As I said, the UN is not only the Security Council – the UN is also the General Assembly, and the General Assembly was clear in this regard. And the UN is all the men and women that are working in different parts of the world to support people that are victims of war, that are victims of conflict., I have not the power to reform the Security Council. I have no illusions about the possibility to do it immediately, but I will do everything I can through making the UN as effective as possible in situations like these to at least compensate for a failure that I cannot solve., And you can be sure about total commitment to support Ukrainian people in this difficulty and to our permanent voice asking for the end of this war, and the end of this war, in respect for international law and in respect for the Charter of the United Nations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-generals-remarks-press-conference-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine

UN: Support Impartial Justice for War Crimes in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",27 Apr 2022,"Global Commitment to Accountability Should Be Model for Other Crises, (New York) – United Nations Security Council members should use an informal meeting on accountability for serious crimes in Ukraine to highlight the importance of impartial justice and coordination of a wide range of international accountability efforts., Since February 24, 2022, Russian forces have battered Ukrainian towns and cities with airstrikes and artillery, killing and injuring thousands of civilians. They have conducted indiscriminate attacks that have hit residential buildings as well as schools and hospitals across Ukraine, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In areas they have occupied, Russian forces have committed apparent war crimes, including summary executions, torture, and rape., “With the death toll increasing in Ukraine and frequent reports of new war crimes, the international community has an urgent responsibility to send a clear message to those who would commit war crimes that wanton slaughter could one day lead to a prison cell,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “Governments, international organizations, and civil society need to cooperate to ensure effective, impartial justice for the atrocities being committed in Ukraine.”, On April 27, Albania and France will convene an “Arria-formula” meeting, an informal gathering of Security Council members, to discuss how the UN can support and coordinate accountability efforts for serious crimes in Ukraine. Participants will include the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan; the Albanian foreign minister, Olta Xhaçka; the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova; the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet; Amal Clooney of the Clooney Foundation for Justice; and the Human Rights Watch crisis and conflict director Ida Sawyer., In recent weeks, the town of Bucha has become synonymous with the word “atrocities.” But similar violations and apparent war crimes have taken place elsewhere in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch researchers have traveled to villages and towns previously occupied by Russian forces and gathered scores of accounts from witnesses of Russian forces committing torture, enforced disappearances, summary executions, pillaging, sexual violence, and other crimes. Russian forces have also repeatedly used cluster munitions and other explosive weapons in densely populated Ukrainian cities and towns., In Mariupol, tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped as their city has been turned into rubble amid persistent shelling, leaving people with little or no food, water, medicine, heating, or means of communication – and no safe way to escape. Many have apparently been forcibly transported to Russia, which amounts to a war crime. The number of civilians killed in Mariupol remains unclear, but local officials estimate that 20,000 may have died. Evidence has emerged that Russian forces buried some of the victims in at least two mass grave sites in neighboring villages., Children, older people, and people with disabilities are generally disproportionately affected during conflicts, Human Rights Watch said., Governments and international judicial bodies have initiated a number of accountability efforts in response to the crimes in Ukraine. On March 2, the ICC prosecutor announced the opening of a formal investigation, while authorities in countries including France, Germany, Lithuania, and Sweden have opened their own criminal investigations under the principle of universal jurisdiction. On March 4, the UN Human Rights Council voted to establish an international commission of inquiry to document war crimes and human rights abuses., Ukrainian authorities are also conducting their own criminal investigations. To support these efforts, many governments have offered Ukraine assistance to bolster its judicial capacity. Meanwhile, domestic and international civil society groups have been vigorously working to document violations as they occur., Ukrainian and international civil society organizations have an essential role to play in pursuing justice in Ukraine, including in documentation, capacity building, research, and advocacy, as well as with outreach to victims and affected communities. The authorities should cooperate with those organizations to inform ongoing judicial processes, Human Rights Watch said., While Russian Forces have committed the majority of apparent war crimes, there have also been reports of Ukrainian violations of the laws of war. Human Rights Watch has urged Ukrainian authorities to investigate alleged abuse by Ukrainians forces of Russian prisoners of war. Ukraine should also investigate allegations that its forces have used banned cluster munitions as reported by The New York Times and hold accountable anyone responsible for using these weapons. The laws of war apply to all parties to the conflict, and Ukraine has made a public commitment to adhere to those norms., While Ukraine has accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed on its territory since November 2013, it is not an ICC member. Ukraine should also ratify the ICC treaty and formally become a member of the court. National and international civil society groups have for years been pressing the Ukrainian government to join the court., Ukraine should also fully align its national legislation with the ICC treaty and international law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should sign into law a bill adopted by Ukraine’s parliament in May 2021 that could help authorities prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity domestically. Harmonizing national laws with international law is critical to strengthening the domestic justice system and rule of law, Human Rights Watch said., All of those engaged in such investigations should cooperate and collaborate to ensure effective inquiries, Human Rights Watch said. They should preserve evidence to internationally accepted standards and safeguard crime scenes. Governments should also support Ukraine in developing and expanding the capacity of its own investigators, prosecutors, and courts, and building a framework to support victims and protect witnesses., UN member countries advocating for justice and accountability should ensure that justice is not sidelined in any peace negotiations. It is important for the long term not to compromise on justice, Human Rights Watch said., The informal Security Council meeting highlights the body’s paralysis on Ukraine due to Russia’s ability to veto substantive Council action. On February 25, Russia blocked a resolution calling for ending its invasion and withdrawing all Russian forces. As a party to the conflict, Russia should have abstained from that vote under Article 27 (3) of the UN Charter, but it did not., Since then, the UN General Assembly has adopted three resolutions condemning Russia in an Emergency Special Session on Ukraine, including one suspending Russia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. The special session was convened in accordance with the 1950 “Uniting for Peace” resolution, which enables the General Assembly to take up matters of international peace and security when one or more veto powers is preventing Council action., Security Council member states – and High Commissioner Bachelet – should use the April 27 meeting to demonstrate the UN’s continued relevance by voicing support for further action by UN bodies like the Human Rights Council and General Assembly, where Russia has no veto power. They should express support for the ICC and human rights organizations gathering evidence of war crimes., It is important to remember that international justice is not limited to the conflict in Ukraine. The support for accountability efforts for Ukraine should become a paradigm for the international community’s response to crises and conflicts elsewhere in the world, such as in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Palestine, and Yemen., “The international community’s rush to support justice and accountability for the grisly crimes committed in Ukraine should be the rule and not the exception,” Sawyer said. “If the UN, ICC, national governments, and civil society can work together to document and preserve evidence of the crimes in Ukraine, it could serve as a model for the future of international justice.”, CORRECTION

Ensuring accountability for atrocities committed in Ukraine,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,27 Apr 2022,"DELIVERED BY, Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, AT, Arria Formula Meeting, Excellencies,
Colleagues,, I am grateful to Albania and France for organizing today’s crucial and timely discussion., In the words of a woman from Irpin on 15 April after her house burned down: ""I am sad about our house in which I was born and had lived during my whole life. But I am even more sad that the whole history of our family burned down."", Accountability is a cornerstone of upholding human rights., Yet, two months into the Russian armed attack on Ukraine, we ask: who will be held accountable, when and how?, As I stated to the Human Rights Council in March, the gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of humanitarian law that have occurred - in particular regarding the principle of distinction and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks - may amount to war crimes., The victims of these violations and their families need reparation. They need to obtain effective remedies for the harm and tragedy they have endured., And efforts aimed at redressing violations must begin now., This sends a clear message that violations of international law will not go unaddressed; that individuals will be held to account; and that parties to the conflict will be held responsible for internationally wrongful acts their forces commit., For this to happen, there are at least four critical steps., First – the comprehensive preservation of all types of evidence related to alleged international humanitarian and human rights law violations, including digital evidence., Second - decent treatment of all mortal remains, including their proper identification and burial, as well as forensic examinations of bodies to establish cause of death., Third - the effective and comprehensive recording of all deaths linked to the conflict, including civilian casualties., And finally, the development of comprehensive policies and mechanisms to provide remedy and reparations for the victims of serious violations of international law related to the armed conflict since 24 February 2022, as well as those who suffered harm before, since mid-April 2014. This includes families of those killed, and those injured., Individual criminal responsibility for war crimes that may have been committed in Ukraine will have to be determined by a fair trial before a court or tribunal, in full compliance with international rule of law standards., This is the primary duty of the parties to the conflict., As the war continues and intensifies, so too does the magnitude of human suffering. We are gravely concerned by the rising civilian death toll, mass displacement and the destruction of civilian objects., As of today, my Office has documented and verified 5,939 civilian casualties, with 2,787 killed and 3,152 injured. Actual figures are considerably higher, and my Office is working to estimate them., Most of these have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, such as shelling from heavy artillery, and missile and air strikes., The staggering scale of human rights violations in Bucha has shocked Ukraine and the world. During a one-day visit, our team documented the unlawful killing, including summary executions of 50 civilians – mostly men, but also women and children. We continue to follow up all reports of violations in Bucha, as well as over 300 other allegations of killings, including summary executions of civilians in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, controlled by Russian armed forces in late February and March. OHCHR has corroborated over 170 cases of apparent arbitrary detention and enforce disappearances of public officials, journalists and activists in areas controlled by Russian armed forces. OHCHR has also received information about alleged arbitrary and incommunicado detentions by Ukrainian forces or people aligned with them., My Office is also looking into dozens of allegations of conflict-related sexual violence., The treatment of prisoners of war by the parties also raises serious concerns. Videos apparently recorded by combatants are available online, depicting intimidation, torture and even killing of prisoners of war., Accountability for these violations and the rights of victims to a remedy and reparations must be ensured., Excellencies
Colleagues,, My Office is committed to engaging with all actors working towards accountability, within our respective frameworks and mandates. Here, I welcome the establishment of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine which is an important step. I emphasise that all efforts should be coordinated, with victims’ rights, including their protection, at the centre of the approaches., Yet, looking at what is playing out today will be in vain if we can’t commit to preventing future violations and atrocities., Our efforts for peace must be sustained and unwavering., In the meanwhile, the parties to the conflict must urgently reassess the methods used to conduct hostilities. The use of weapons with wide area effects in populated areas should cease immediately. Summary executions, other unlawful killings and enforced disappearances must come to an end now., My Office will continue the crucial work of documenting violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. To guarantee our monitoring is independent and impartial, our human rights officers must have complete and unimpeded access to all affected areas in Ukraine, as well as access to information., This futile and senseless war has already caused immeasurable human tragedy., Let us commit to putting a stop to it before we have more deaths, more suffering, and more perpetrators to hold to account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ensuring-accountability-atrocities-committed-ukraine
"Atrocity Alert No. 298: Ukraine, Sudan and Afghanistan",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,27 Apr 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., GROWING EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE TWO MONTHS AFTER RUSSIAN INVASION, Sunday, 24 April, marked two months since Russian Armed Forces invaded Ukraine. Since that time, millions of people have experienced devastating impacts from the conflict as thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, more than 5.2 million people have fled the country and an additional 7.7 million have been internally displaced. On Friday, 22 April, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, warned that, “over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored, but seemingly tossed aside… Our work to date has detailed a horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians.”, The High Commissioner’s Office and the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) have documented gross violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and serious violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) that may amount to war crimes, including evidence of indiscriminate shelling and bombing of populated areas and civilian infrastructure by Russian forces, as well as the use of indiscriminate weapons by Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine. The HRMMU has also documented allegations of sexual violence, summary executions and widespread civilian detentions in areas previously under the control of Russian forces, torture, attacks on medical facilities and blocked access to medical care in besieged towns and cities., Since 24 February the HRMMU has verified 5,939 civilian casualties, including 2,787 deaths. However, the UN has consistently noted that the actual figures are considerably higher. During her remarks on 22 April High Commissioner Bachelet emphasized that, “we know the actual numbers are going to be much higher as the horrors inflicted in areas of intense fighting, such as Mariupol, come to light.” One day prior to the High Commissioner’s remarks, Maxar Technologies published satellite imagery from the village of Manhush, outside Mariupol, allegedly showing an expanding mass grave site. According to Maxar Technologies, the mass grave spans approximately 340 meters, larger than three football fields., While UN Secretary-General António Guterres travels to Moscow and Kyiv this week, he must use his diplomatic power to encourage a cessation of hostilities and urge both sides to ensure their forces strictly respect IHL and IHRL, including distinguishing between military and civilian targets and not targeting or deliberately killing civilians. Parties to the conflict must investigate all violations allegedly committed by their forces and ensure the appropriate preservation of evidence of potential crimes., AT LEAST 168 PEOPLE KILLED IN RENEWED ARMED ATTACKS IN WEST DARFUR, SUDAN, At least 168 people were killed and more than 100 injured when Janjaweed fighters attacked several non-Arab Massalit villages around Kreinik in the West Darfur region of Sudan on 24 April. The fighting was triggered on Thursday, 21 April, by the killing of two Arab men suspected of cattle rustling near Kreinik. The following day, Arab Janjaweed militias attacked Kreinik and killed at least nine people. The clashes spread to El Geneina in subsequent days, with several hospitals attacked and civilians forced to hide in their homes. The UN Special Representative for Sudan and Head of the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission, Volker Perthes, deplored “the heinous killings of civilians” and reminded “the authorities and armed groups of their international legal obligation to protect all civilians, and civilian infrastructure, including health facilities.”, Despite the considerable progress made since August 2019 in bringing armed groups together – including the historic Juba Peace Agreement signed by the transitional Sudanese government and several armed groups in October 2020 – actions by the military since their October 2021 coup have impeded peacebuilding efforts. Armed forces have been re-deployed to Khartoum to address ongoing political instability, leaving communities in Darfur vulnerable to attacks. According to witnesses, government forces, including members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have done little to protect civilians in Kreinik and El Geneina amidst intensifying inter-communal clashes. Many Janjaweed fighters have been integrated in the RSF, who previously waged war against armed rebel groups, including Massalit groups in Darfur., Populations in Darfur have endured decades-long conflict and atrocities. During former President Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year rule, the Janjaweed – supported by the government – allegedly committed crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide against civilians. The UN estimates that in Darfur alone, over 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million forced to flee since the conflict began in 2003. In a positive step towards justice for victims of atrocities, on 5 April the International Criminal Court opened the trial of former Janjaweed leader, Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman (Ali Kushayb) – the Court’s first trial concerning potential war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur., The Sudanese authorities need to urgently implement the National Plan for the Protection of Civilians and the Juba Peace Agreement in order to provide safety and security for civilians in West Darfur. The authorities should also conduct investigations and bring perpetrators to justice. Sustainable peace and stability can only be achieved when the Sudanese military relinquishes power and restores the civilian-led transitional government., TARGETED ATTACKS ACROSS AFGHANISTAN KILL AT LEAST 75 CIVILIANS, Since Tuesday, 19 April, at least 75 civilians have been killed in a series of attacks targeting minorities, places of worship and schools across Afghanistan. Two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) detonated on 19 April outside the Abdul Rahim-e Shahid High School and Mumtaz Education Centre in the predominantly Hazara neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi in Kabul, killing six people and injuring 25, including students. On 21 April IED explosions targeted the Shia Seh Dokan Mosque in Mazar-e-Sharif, killing 17 people and injuring at least 52, many of whom were Hazara. The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) claimed responsibility for this bombing. The next day, another targeted attack occurred at the Sunni Mawlavi Sikandar Mosque in Kunduz, killing at least 33 people and wounding several others., The UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Ramiz Alakbarov, strongly condemned the attacks, stating that, “the people of Afghanistan have already endured immense suffering, and must be spared from such senseless and horrific attacks.” UN Secretary-General António Guterres also reiterated that, “attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including mosques, are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law.”, ISIL-K frequently targets and threatens the Shia minority in Afghanistan, particularly the Hazara. In October ISIL-K carried out a series of attacks targeting these groups, including bombings at Shia mosques in Kunduz, Kabul and Kandahar that killed more than 90 civilians. Since then, ISIL-K has carried out numerous targeted attacks on religious institutions and residential areas, as well as against minority groups., Vulnerable populations, including women and girls, minorities and human rights defenders, remain at risk of further war crimes and crimes against humanity under Taliban rule. According to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), suicide bombings, targeted killings, enforced disappearances and incommunicado detention have all been perpetrated against vulnerable populations. The Taliban have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of Hazara in recent months, as well as mass forced displacements of Hazara communities in several provinces. The spate of attacks and the direct targeting of minorities indicate that the Taliban is likely unable or unwilling to protect vulnerable populations., All international actors engaging with Taliban representatives must urge respect for international law, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights for all Afghans. Taliban de-facto authorities should cooperate with and facilitate access for the newly-appointed UN Special Rapporteur, UNAMA’s Human Rights Service and OHCHR. The Taliban must also ensure there is a thorough investigation of the recent attacks and end their own violations of international law.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-298-ukraine-sudan-and-afghanistan
"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (16 - 22 April 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,28 Apr 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, with Russian forces increasing operational focus on the Donbas region. Demonstrations against the invasion across the European region continue to be prevalent, with anti-war rallies continuing in Russian cities, despite intimidation by the state. Elsewhere, the government in Northern Cyprus resigned over an internal dispute over electricity price increases. Environmental activists demonstrated across Europe, demanding more climate action. And lastly, demonstration activity continued in France in the lead-up to the presidential run-off election on 24 April., In Ukraine, Russian forces focused operation activities on the Donbas region last week, where Russia has been supporting separatist armed formations since 2014 (Hromadske 18 April 2022). More than half of all political violence events in Ukraine last week were recorded in Donbas. Increased activity in the Donetsk region in Donbas comes as the city of Mariupol remains under siege. Ukrainian forces continued to fight from their positions in the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, despite a Russian ultimatum to surrender (USA Today, 21 April 2022). Alongside Ukrainian soldiers, about 1,000 civilians are trapped in the Azovstal plant as Russia refuses to facilitate the opening of humanitarian corridors (Hromadske, 25 April 2022)., Heavy fighting also continued in the southern regions of Ukraine last week. While fighting was mostly centered in the Zaporizhia region, heavy fighting was also recorded in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, where Russian forces occupy territories that link the Donbas region with occupied Crimea. This violence contributed to the 113% increase in violence in Ukraine last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month.1, Meanwhile, Russia continued to launch missiles targeting cities across Ukraine last week. Russia hit the western city of Lviv, killing seven civilians (Ukrayinska Pravda, 17 April 2022), and carried out a series of cruise missile attacks on Odesa, killing at least eight people (Al Jazeera, 22 April 2022). Moreover, at least seven people were killed in explosions of mines and bomb remnants across the country., Russian forces also continued to abduct people from occupied territories in Ukraine last week, including current and former government officials, their relatives, and other local residents. Russia also continued to forcibly deport Ukrainian citizens to Russia from Mariupol in the Donetsk region and Izium in the Kharkiv region (24 Channel, 18 April 2022; Suspilne Media, 16 April 2022)., In Russia, anti-war action continued, despite police crackdown and attacks against activists in recent weeks. On 18 April, unidentified rioters threw Molotov cocktails at a military enlistment office in the Mordovia region, setting it on fire. This is the latest of several similar incidents reported over the past month, targeting the Russian military's recruitment campaign amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine (The Moscow Times, 22 April 2022). In Moscow and Saint-Petersburg, activists held a series of anti-war pickets for several days in a row, facing arrests and fines (OVD Info, 19-21 April 2022)., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine also took place in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Finland, Romania, Moldova, Spain, Portugal, France, Switzerland, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. Meanwhile, in Italy, a hand grenade accompanied by an anti-communist threat --- connecting communists with Russian President Vladimir Putin --- was located at a supermarket parking lot in Collegno (Italy24 News, 16 April 2022). The threat comes after a series of destructive acts targeting property owned by Russian citizens and the Russian state in recent weeks., Meanwhile, around 20 pro-invasion rallies were held across Russia last week. In Germany, several acts of vandalism on cars with Ukrainian plates were reported last week (Berliner Zeitung, 17 April 2022)., In Northern Cyprus, the recently elected Turkish-backed government resigned amid an internal dispute over electricity price increases. The coalition government submitted its resignation to President Ersin Tatar after he blocked Prime Minister Faiz Sucuoğlu's attempt to dismiss Finance Minister Sunat Atun (Detay, 19 April 2022). The prime minister replaced the finance minister in his new cabinet, though the government remains otherwise unchanged (Ahval, 26 April 2022).2 The new government in Northern Cyprus was formed on 25 April, which is outside of the time period of this regional overview, and will be included in next week's Regional Overview. [/mfn] The resignation follows weeks of demonstrations by Turkish Cypriots against government policies and ongoing strikes over energy price hikes., Environmental activists demonstrated across Europe last week, demanding more climate action and less investment in fossil fuels. Demonstration activity was recorded in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, police arrested Extinction Rebellion-affiliated Just Stop Oil affiliates in several cities. Climate activists, targeting fossil fuels industries, climbed atop oil tankers, blocked access to oil depots, and padlocked themselves to industrial facilities. Hundreds of activists have been arrested in recent weeks amid the group's ongoing campaign calling on the government to stop new oil and gas projects (Time, 16 April 2022)., Demonstration activity continued in France last week ahead of the presidential run-off between incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron and far-right National Rally (RN) party president Marine Le Pen on 24 April. Thousands of people gathered in more than 30 locations against the far-right RN, with events turning violent on a few occasions as demonstrators threw objects at police. Demonstrations against the reelection of Macron were also recorded. Other violence and destructive activity have also been reported. For example, unknown perpetrators vandalized the headquarters of another political party before the run-off elections (Attaque, 21 April 2022). Sporadic outbreaks of violence associated with the elections contributed to the 45% increase in violence in France last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-16-22-april-2022
"Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine: Summary Report by the Director General, 24 February – 28 April 2022",Analysis,IAEA,Disaster Management,28 Apr 2022,"INTRODUCTION, On 24 February 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), through its Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC), was notified by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), in its capacity as a national competent authority under the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, of the imposition of martial law on the territory of Ukraine and of an alert at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (NPP). Since this information was received, the IAEA has activated the IEC, has established regular contact with Ukrainian authorities and has been closely monitoring the situation at nuclear facilities as well as activities involving radioactive sources on the territory of Ukraine, focusing on the implications for nuclear safety, security and safeguards., In accordance with established operational arrangements1 on reporting and information exchange that apply for situations in which prompt action is warranted to mitigate any adverse effects or situations of considerable media and public interest, the IAEA published relevant information on its 24/7 secure communication channel, the Unified System for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies (USIE), and has been issuing daily public statements and updates regarding the situation concerning nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine. Through sharing such transparent, factual and authoritative information, the IAEA substantively responds to heightened media and public interest, supports public understanding and aims to counteract potential misinformation. This information shared by the IAEA includes its assessment of potential emergency consequences and the prognosis of possible emergency progression, where appropriate., During an emergency meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on 2 March, the IAEA Director General called for restraint from all measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear and other radioactive material, and the safe operation of nuclear facilities in Ukraine. On 3 March, the Board adopted a resolution on the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine, which “deplores the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine”, expresses “grave concern that the Russian Federation’s aggression is impeding the Agency from fully and safely conducting safeguards verification activities”, and “requests that the Director General and the Secretariat continue to closely monitor the situation, with a special focus on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and report to the Board on these elements, as required”2, This report provides a summary of the situation in Ukraine regarding nuclear safety, security and safeguards of nuclear facilities and activities involving radioactive sources in Ukraine. It is based on information made available to the IAEA since the beginning of these unprecedented circumstances and consolidates information that the IAEA has been communicating to the public since 24 February, including actions taken by the IAEA in response to Ukraine’s request for assistance in re-establishing, as appropriate, a sound nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities and in activities involving radioactive sources. In addition, the report includes some initial findings of the IAEA expert missions led by the Director General to Ukraine in March and April 2022., This report also summarizes relevant aspects of the implementation of safeguards in Ukraine under the Agreement Between Ukraine and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Protocol Additional thereto under the current circumstances.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nuclear-safety-security-and-safeguards-ukraine-summary-report-director-general-24-february-28-april-2022
OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Secretary General call for immediate release of detained OSCE officials in areas of Donetsk and Luhansk,News and Press Release,OSCE,Safety and Security,27 Apr 2022,"WARSAW/VIENNA, 24 April 2022 - OSCE Chairman-in-Office and Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew Rau, and OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid call for the release of four national members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine detained in in non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk., “The detention of SMM national mission members in Donetsk and Luhansk is unacceptable, and we call for their immediate release,” said Rau. “They were taken for engaging in administrative activities that fall within their official functions as OSCE staff. They have been held without charge for a period of time now and the OSCE and their families have not been sufficiently informed of the situation.”, While all mandate activities ceased on 1 April, the SMM continues to carry out minimum necessary administrative tasks., “I condemn the deplorable acts of intimidation, harassment, and hostile public rhetoric against the SMM and mission staff in non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. All of our national mission members remain OSCE officials and should be afforded functional immunity, including during this period when the mandate has lapsed,” Schmid said. “Their work has been crucial in many areas, including maintaining contacts with relevant stakeholders and civil society, and facilitating localized ceasefires for vital infrastructure repair, directly helping to alleviate human suffering.”, Out of concern for the safety of the staff, the OSCE is not able to release any additional information about the situation at this moment., Background information, On 31 March 2022, during discussions at the OSCE Permanent Council, no consensus was reached on the extension of the mandate of OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, owing to the position expressed by the Russian Federation. Therefore, as of 1 April, no mandated activities have taken place and the SMM has moved to an administrative mode. This involves carrying out a limited number of essential administrative functions, including those focused on efforts to ensure the safety and security of its mission members, assets and premises, throughout Ukraine, including in areas not under the control of the Government., While the OSCE Chairmanship continues to engage with participating States, the SMM is discharging its obligations in the management of its human, financial and material resources pending a conclusion on the future of the Mission., Contacts, Communication and Media Relations Section

IAEA Delivers Specialized Safety and Security Equipment to Chornobyl,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,27 Apr 2022,"The IAEA has delivered specialised equipment to Ukraine in the first major step in its technical assistance to help the country ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities during the ongoing conflict., Responding to an earlier request from Ukraine for equipment, an IAEA team, headed by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, arrived at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant yesteday to conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems as well as to deliver equipment such as radiation detectors, spectrometers and personal protective clothing., Included in the batch of equipment are personal radiation detectors to detect and monitor radiation levels throughout the site. These robust and versatile personal radiation detectors are widely used by nuclear safety and security experts worldwide., ""The equipment, under the guidance of our staff on the ground, can be operational within minutes and can immediately support the staff at Chornobyl to fulfil their nuclear safety and security tasks,"" said Carlos Torres Vidal, Director of the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre., The IAEA team also handed over spectrometers which assess the level of radiation in the environment and provide a spectrum that is like a fingerprint identifying the type of radiation. This will help Chornobyl staff to assess the radiological situation at the site and the Exclusion Zone, spanning 30 kilometres around the plant., Spectrometers carried in personal backpacks were provided to support extended surveying with GPS mapping capabilities. The backpack lets the user focus on walking safely around an area instead of looking at a screen and numbers. This is especially necessary in an area like the Exclusion Zone., As a result of the conflict and the prevailing conditions following the 1986 accident, the situation in the Exclusion Zone is uniquely challenging. Ukraine recently informed the IAEA that Chornobyl's analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring were destroyed, and analytical instruments stolen, broken or otherwise disabled., The IAEA's presence in Chornobyl will be of paramount importance, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant said in a statement. ""We have been cooperating with the IAEA for many years in a row, and I am sure that now we will continue to have fruitful and successful cooperation,"" said Acting Director General Valeriy Seyda., The IAEA assistance team also brought personal protective equipment from Vienna. Such protective garments provide protection against some types of radiation, as well as from radioactive contamination and inhalation, and therefore help to manage the risks posed to staff who due to the nature of their work are exposed to radiation., In addition to nuclear safety and security assistance, IAEA safeguards staff travelled within the assistance team to Chornobyl this week to conduct on-site safeguards work. They will install equipment to reactivate remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl plant., ""This is just a first step. The IAEA will be sending more equipment as we continue our assistance to Ukraine in the coming weeks and months,"" added Torres Vidal.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-delivers-specialized-safety-and-security-equipment-chornobyl

Ukraine: New MSF medical train completes its first evacuation journey,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,27 Apr 2022,"A specially equipped medical train run by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) completed its first journey across Ukraine on April 26, carrying 26 patients from Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro to hospitals in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv. Most required post-operative care following traumatic injuries., MSF equipped and staffed the train to care for patients who needed to be medically evacuated from war-affected areas of eastern Ukraine, working in collaboration with Ukraine's Ministry of Health and National Railways. Hospitals in areas close to active war zones frequently send out urgent requests for patients to be referred to other hospitals in safer areas of the country. This is partly to manage their bed capacity as new patients keep coming with war wounds, but also to give the patients the best chance to have the dedicated medical care they need., Since March 31, MSF has managed the medical referrals of nearly 300 patients from eastern to western Ukraine on a simpler, four-car train. They have included hospital patients, residents of long-term care facilities and young orphans who required care during the journey., The new train has eight cars, with the capacity to transport about 36 patients at a time.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 26 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,27 Apr 2022,"Date: 27 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 26 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 5,939 civilian casualties in the country: 2,787 killed and 3,152 injured. This included:, a total of 2,787 killed (912 men, 611 women, 61 girls, and 74 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,062 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,152 injured (365 men, 296 women, 66 girls, and 73 boys, as well as 163 children and 2,189 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,826 casualties (1,314 killed and 1,512 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 2,388 casualties (1,229 killed and 1,159 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 438 casualties (85 killed and 353 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,113 casualties (1,473 killed and 1,640 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-26-april-2022-enruuk

Over a quarter of Ukraine’s population have fled their homes, including more than 7.7 million people now estimated to be internally displaced and over 5.2 million people who have crossed borders to seek security and safety in other countries, most of them women and children. Nearly two-thirds of the children in Ukraine have been displaced., Massive devastation in urban centres, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, have made life unbearable for millions of people and severely disrupted critical services, especially healthcare. In besieged areas, people have lived for weeks without access to food, water and heat, while under the constant threat of bombardment., The war is impacting women and men in different ways and is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, according to a Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE. Ukraine’s population has a distinctly gendered profile, with 54 per cent women and 46 per cent men, including a particularly large population of older females. Prior to the escalation of the war, 71 per cent of the heads of households in Governmentcontrolled areas were female. Women from groups in vulnerable situations are being left behind and disproportionately affected by disruptions caused by war, while the displacement and refugee flow is largely gendered-based violence—including conflictrelated sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and trafficking., The armed conflict may prevent farmers from accessing their fields, harvesting, and marketing current crops, planting new crops, or sustaining livestock production. Between 20 and 30 per cent of areas under winter cereal, maize and sunflower production will remain unharvested in July/August, or not be planted this spring, according to the Government and FAO. About half of winter wheat and a third of rye due to be harvested in July–August 2022 are currently in war-affected areas. There are also concerns over damage to standing crops and risk of mines and unexploded ordnance impacting the ability to harvest in the period ahead., The war has also devastated Ukraine’s economy. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, has said that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion, while some 53 per cent of employed Ukrainians have lost their jobs since the war began, according to a nation-wide survey conducted by the Rating Group in March.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-business-guide-ukraine-humanitarian-crisis-april-2022

Protection and Human Rights",26 Apr 2022,"Since the war began in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, an estimated 5 million refugees have fled to neighboring countries, while over 7 million people have been displaced inside the country in search of safety, protection and assistance meeting basic needs., As the scale of this humanitarian crisis continues to grow, Global Communities is working directly with local governments and civil society organizations to support meeting non-food item and hygiene needs in 8 communities across 3 oblasts in western Ukraine. This includes procuring and delivering such items as beds, blankets, kitchen goods and lamps as well as distributing critical personal hygiene supplies like baby diapers, soap, sanitary pads and toilet paper. Whenever possible, we are prioritizing procuring goods from Ukrainian producers and vendors, which continue to operate in Ukraine either directly or remotely from a neighboring country., In addition to direct procurements, Global Communities has leveraged its relationships with 100 local governments across Ukraine to connect them to each other, local NGOs and other international organizations. This has led to western Ukrainian communities connecting with and sending supplies to eastern communities in need, and the provision of direct food assistance or cash from local and international NGOs. Global Communities continues to monitor the needs of communities on an ongoing basis, facilitating these connections and planning for future assistance., For decades, Global Communities has responded to complex humanitarian emergencies. Our approach prioritizes partnering with affected communities to identify and address urgent needs with a focus on resilience and long-term recovery. We deliver community-led humanitarian responses with a focus on prioritizing the safety, dignity and needs of those who are most at risk of harm, including people with disabilities, older persons, women and children., In addition, Global Communities has worked in Eastern Europe for more than 60 years and has a deep understanding of the unique needs of the region. Over the past six years, in Ukraine specifically, Global Communities has led a consortium of local and international organizations to implement a program that improves the ability of local governments to identify and support the needs of their community, with a focus on promoting gender equality, women's empowerment and enhancing economic sustainability. Through this work, our dedicated team on the ground has developed close relationships with local governments and organizations across 10 oblasts. With the onset of the war, we have been able to engage this network to conduct rapid assessments to identify specific needs prioritized by affected communities in Ukraine., Notably, our partnerships with local self-government and civil society organizations in our 100 partner communities allow us to reach both deeply and broadly to strengthen the outreach of humanitarian assistance efforts, from large cities to smaller towns and consolidated communities across Ukraine. Our team maintains telephone contact with communities that are otherwise more challenging to reach given the conflict context, allowing us to build capacity to respond from a distance as needed and help target assistance to meet the immediate and lifesaving needs of those who might otherwise be neglected., ""Global Communities has a unique ability to respond to this crisis, as we have spent the last six years building relationships of trust with the local governments and civil society in Ukraine who will ultimately lead the recovery,"" said Julie Steiger, Senior Director, Humanitarian Program Operations. ""This is just one example of how, as global conflicts increase and intensify, we will need to bring to the table real expertise across both sustainable development and humanitarian assistance. In today's world, one can pivot to the other faster than ever before."", Global Communities' approach to humanitarian assistance focuses on restarting livelihoods, increasing access to financial services, rebuilding homes and neighborhoods, and providing psychosocial support. Protection is at the heart of our programs, and through mainstreaming protection and direct service delivery, we ensure that lifesaving responses are grounded in the principle of Do No Harm and guided by the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence., To read more about our response to the war in Ukraine and experience with complex humanitarian emergencies, we invite you to explore the information below:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/responding-humanitarian-needs-ukraine

The next report will be issued on or around 5 May., HIGHLIGHTS, • The ongoing war continues to exacerbate a massive humanitarian crisis and prompt further displacement. Eastern and southern parts of the country have been facing the most severe consequences of the fighting in recent weeks, while airstrikes reported in multiple areas in Ukraine in the past few days have caused additional damages and civilian losses., • As the war rages on and the UN continues its efforts to bring about peace, the UN Secretary-General is scheduled to arrive to Ukraine this week to meet with the President and Foreign Minister of Ukraine., • The UN and humanitarian partners issued the revised Flash Appeal and Regional Refugee Response Plan on 25 April. Nearly US$4.1 billion will be urgently required to meet the needs of 17 million people inside and outside Ukraine, including $2.25 billion to meet escalating humanitarian needs of 8.7 million within Ukraine until August 2022., • The most recent needs assessment conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that residents of Ukraine with chronic diseases face severe challenges with accessing health care. One in three households with at least one person with a chronic condition is unable to secure medication and care., • The World Food Programme (WFP), through a network of local partners, has delivered food, integrated nutrition packages for children aged 6 to 23 months, vouchers and cash assistance for 2.4 million people in Ukraine since 24 February., • Since the war started, nearly 835,000 people in Ukraine were able to access health care as a result of supplies distributed, either directly by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) or in partnership with implementing organizations., • UNICEF has ensured access to safe water for over 400,000 people in affected areas since 24 February, including through water trucking, bottled water distribution and supporting water availability in collective centres. Furthermore, nearly 90,000 people have been reached with water, sanitation and hygiene supplies., • As of 26 April, Cash Working Group (CWG) partners have distributed multipurpose cash assistance to over 314,000 people, with the total amount transferred estimated at $44.6 million., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. Active fighting continued to be reported in eastern and southern Ukraine, primarily affecting eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts. Calls for a humanitarian pause during Orthodox Easter went unheeded, and there were reports of multiple attacks across the country striking civilian infrastructure as well as residential areas. On 23 April, missile strikes in Odesa (Odeska oblast, south) reportedly hit an apartment building, allegedly killing eight people, including a three-month-old girl, and injuring 18 others. On 24 April, missiles reportedly struck a thermal power plant and oil refinery in Kremenchuk in Poltavska oblast (centre), killing one person and injuring seven. On 25 April, there were reported missile attacks on five railway stations across Ukraine, with unconfirmed civilian casualties, in Lvivska oblast (west), Rivnenska oblast (north-west) and Vinnytska oblast (centre-west). Moreover, according to Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of nuclear power facilities, two rockets were reportedly noticed flying in close vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) site (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) on 26 April. According to Energoatom’s CEO, such lowaltitude missile strikes in the vicinity of the largest NPP in Europe pose colossal safety risks for the region. The information about damages and civilian casualties has not been verified by the UN., The military offensive that began nearly two months ago has plunged Ukraine into a human rights and humanitarian crisis that has devastated the lives of civilians throughout the country and beyond, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on 22 April, as she called for all parties to respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law, in particular the rules governing the conduct of hostilities. Ms. Bachelet said that the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of populated areas, the killing of civilians and destruction of hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure “may amount to war crimes.”, As the war rages on and the UN continues its efforts to bring about peace, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres is scheduled to arrive to Ukraine this week. He will have a working meeting with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and will be received by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy on 28 April. The UN Chief will also meet with UN staff on the ground to discuss the scaling up of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-26-april-2022

Prolonged exposure to distress impacts children’s immediate and long-term health and development. Women and children risk gender-based violence when sheltering, moving and seeking asylum., In Ukraine, 7.1 million people are internally displaced, including up to 2.8 million children. Hospitals, water facilities, schools and kindergartens have been destroyed.
Access to WASH, education, health, livelihoods and social services support is interrupted., Over 4.5 million refugees, 90 per cent women and children, have fled to neighbouring countries and beyond, seeking protection and requiring critical assistance., Children in Ukraine and living as refugees urgently require protection, including for unaccompanied and separated children, psychosocial services and prevention of trafficking, sexual and labour exploitation and abuse, along with critical health, nutrition, education, WASH services and livelihoods and social support., UNICEF is appealing for US$ 948.9 million to provide multi-sectoral life-saving support for children and their families, including US$ 624.2 million to respond to critical needs within Ukraine (Pillar 1) and US$ 324.7 million for the refugee response (Pillar 2)., HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND NEEDS, Pillar 1: Ukraine, The war in Ukraine has uprooted children and families from their homes, creating a child protection and child’s rights emergency. Over 11 million people have fled their homes8 ; nearly a quarter of the total population of Ukraine. The majority, over 7.1 million people, have been internally displaced, of which an estimated 2.8 million are children., Displacement has placed women and children at increased risk of gender-based violence (GBV), abuse, psychological trauma, trafficking, and family separation. The most vulnerable children, including those living outside their families, the nearly 91,000 children, half with disabilities, living in residential institutions for children without parental care or boarding schools, unaccompanied and separated children (UASC), and children with disabilities, have been particularly impacted. To date, 121 children have been killed and over 170 injured.9 Civilian infrastructure and basic services continue to be attacked. Nearly 100 health facilities and 870 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed, interrupting access to critical medical supplies and services and leaving the majority of children in Ukraine without access to in-person education services.10 Water supply services and infrastructure, particularly in eastern Ukraine, have been damaged leaving over a million households without access to water., Hygiene and dignity items are in limited supply, putting displaced families at increased health risk. With approximately 80,000 women expected to give birth in the coming three months, access to essential health care services is becoming an urgent need.11 Further outbreaks of measles and polio are possible, particularly given decreasing childhood immunization rates, the high number of people on the move and overcrowding in temporary shelters. Over 2 million children under five years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women are in need of life-saving nutrition services inside Ukraine as the nutritional status of children is expected to decline as family’s resources are stretched.12 The operating environment in Ukraine has become extremely complex. The public sector workforce, including teachers, pediatricians, social workers and engineers, has been severely disrupted and displaced. The banking system has been impacted, limiting fund transfers to partners and staff salaries. Access constraints, active fighting, air strikes and rapidly changing front lines are posing significant challenges to UNICEF and partners in delivering critical lifesaving services to vulnerable children and families. Several cities are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and protection with civilians trapped inside for several weeks, experiencing constant shelling, and prolonged disruption of essential services such as access to food, medicine, heating, water, and mobile connections. As the war continues, humanitarian needs continue to worsen, taking a heavy toll on the wellbeing of Ukrainians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-action-children-2022-ukraine-and-refugee-outflow

As of 19 April, over 5 million refugees from Ukraine have fled abroad, whilst within Ukraine, some 7.7 million people have been internally displaced and another 8 million are also in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection.
Across Ukraine, critical infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. This has caused total outages of electricity, heating and water in some areas, while other services such as internet connectivity, medical care and public transport have been disrupted. As a result, many people find themselves with no resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation and are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. Given the lack of safe humanitarian access, the delivery of life-saving aid is difficult in many areas.
Of the more than 5 million refugees, 90% are women and children. Refugees have mostly fled to neighbouring countries. Most have fled to Poland, but significant numbers have sought safety in Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, and other countries in the region. These countries have demonstrated extraordinary solidarity, providing immediate assistance to people arriving but the scale of the displacement is putting considerable pressure on available services, and on hosting communities. Of the refugee population, some 2.1 million (as of 20 April) have continued onward to other European countries., Two months into the fighting, OCHA’s revised initial Flash Appeal outlines the most pressing needs of 15.7 million people inside Ukraine, 7.1 million of whom are IDPs. As per its mandate, UNHCR has in parallel coordinated a ten-month revision to the regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) for the Ukraine Situation responding to the needs of people who have fled Ukraine. This will support governments in responding to the needs of up to 8.3 million refugees in Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and other affected countries, and provide support to hard-pressed host communities., Given that the emergency has exceeded the worst-case scenario, this revised supplementary appeal for the Ukraine situation outlines UNHCR’s additional requirements of $1.246 billion for March to December 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-unhcr-revised-supplementary-appeal-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 Apr 2022,"Appeal Code: 6642, Situation, Russia launched an unprovoked attack on the sovereign neighboring nation of Ukraine on February 24. In the two months since, more than 11 million Ukrainians have fled their homes, including more than 5 million refugees who have fled to other nations., More than 400,000 Ukrainians have fled to neighboring Moldova since the invasion. Many continued their journeys into Romania and beyond, and a few have returned to Ukraine as fighting shifts. As of last week, there were about 97,000 Ukrainian refugees in Moldova. Of those, 40% were women, 10% were men and 50% were children., It is important to note that among the primary countries that are receiving Ukrainian refugees, only Moldova is not a member of the European Union. It is also one of the poorest countries in Europe, and yet it has welcomed the highest number of Ukrainian refugees relative to its population. The generosity and spirit of welcome among Moldovans has proven to be extraordinary., There are 95 official Refugee Accommodation Centers in Moldova, but only about 5% of the Ukrainian refugees are staying in them. More than 90,000 Ukrainian refugees are living in private homes with Moldovan families or are staying in hotels or apartments. Refugees living outside official accommodation centers face unique protection risks, including gender-based violence (GBV) and risk of trafficking, and the families hosting them are facing increasingly stretched finances., CWS Response, CWS has been active in Moldova through several local partners and projects for years. Shortly after Russia's invasion, CWS deployed a specialized staff team to Moldova and Romania to assess the needs of displaced and host communities and recommend how CWS and its partners may best respond. Unfortunately, it is increasingly clear that the humanitarian consequences of Russia's invasion have only worsened, and persisting hostilities continue to threaten the safety, well-being, and even lives, of countless Ukrainians and others affected., CWS is committed to assisting Ukrainians and others impacted by Russia's aggression for the long-term. Our response will focus in three areas:, CWS has already established a three-person team in Moldova and is currently responding in three parts of the country: the capital of Chișinău, the city of Balti, and the northern district of Soroca. Our initial response focuses on enhancing the capacity of local partners to offer a warm and dignified welcome to Ukrainian refugees and ensure that refugees and the Moldovan families hosting them can meet their basic needs., For example, we are supporting an organization called Diaconia in Chișinău and Balti. Diaconia established the first food bank in Moldova in 2020, which is now serving as a logistics and material hub for a number of organizations supporting Ukrainian refugees. They also converted a space that was intended to open as a daycare center into a small shelter for Ukrainian refugees. CWS has provided funds to cover utility costs for the shelter and purchase a forklift to enhance operations at the food bank. We are also supporting their educational outreach to refugee children and planning to offer technical assistance in child protection., In Balti, we purchased a prefabricated container that will be used as an educational and recreational space for refugee children as well as a space for programming for Ukrainian refugee women. In the long run, this space will transition to being a community space for local families., In Soroca our partner Soarta will support refugees living in a Refugee Accommodation Center (RAC) as well as those living with host families.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, Large-scale offensive operations in eastern Ukraine are still ongoing, with Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts experiencing widespread civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure. Heavy bombardment of many cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol continues. Ukrainian forces continued operations in the north of the country during the first weeks of April amid the withdrawal of Russian forces. By April 8, Russian troops had fully pulled out of the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions. While the security situation is relatively stable in Western Ukraine, the first civilian deaths have been recorded in Lviv on April 18. As intense fighting and airstrikes continue to cause civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure across the country. The duration of martial law in Ukraine was extended until 25 May 2022., There are an estimated 7.7 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine. Evacuations from the eastern oblasts have pushed the number up. Displacement to neighbouring countries continues to rise, reaching over 5 million. There is a slight increase in the rate of displacement compared to the previous two weeks, though still slower than during the first weeks of the conflict. Conversely some IDPs and refugees are returning., As fighting is intensifying efforts have been made to evacuate the civilian population from Ukraine’s eastern Luhanska and Donetska oblasts, however, continuous shelling is posing difficulties. While some evacuations are taking place, they are often through private transport. The start of a new Russian offensive in the east will also likely reduce access to populations in the region. Lack of respect for humanitarian corridors and failure to implement “windows of silence” continue to hamper access to the area’s most heavily affected by conflict. In the north of Ukraine and around Kyiv areas now back under Ukrainian control are heavily contaminated by mines and UXOs., The food security situation continues to deteriorate across Ukraine. Immediate food needs are reported in conflict-affected areas and in areas hosting IDPs, the disruption in food production and delivery challenges due to access constraints are some of the reasons driving up the need. The lack of income and disruption in financial services is also contributing to the rise in need for basic necessities. Hostilities-related damages and access constraints have left around 1.4 million people without running water across eastern Ukraine. Water access in IDP-hosting oblasts is relatively better, however, there are hygiene needs., Access to education remains limited in conflict-affected areas. Both IDP and refugee children also face challenges to accessing online education services or to integrate into host country education systems while at the same time dealing with the psychological impact of conflict and displacement., In conflict affected areas, access to health services and medications continue to impact the majority of the population. Access to services is extremely limited in Izium, Mariupol, Popasna and Rubizhne. In IDP-hosting areas, among the primary unmet needs reported was access to treatment for long-term health problems., Hostilities have damaged or destroyed hundreds of residential houses, leaving many civilians living in substandard conditions sheltering from attacks. In some IDP-hosting areas, there has been a reported rise in rent prices., While immediate needs of refugees in hosting countries are relatively met by humanitarian and government response, longer term needs are becoming more of a concern. With refugees entering neighbouring countries since the end of February there is now a significant strain on resources and services, further exacerbated by rising inflation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-23-april-2022

"Ukraine: Immediate steps needed to prevent a measles outbreak due to the ongoing war and low vaccination rates, warns WHO",News and Press Release,WHO,Health,27 Apr 2022,"L’viv, 28 April 2022, According to the latest data available, 85% of eligible children in Ukraine received their first dose of measles vaccine in 2020. While this was a significant improvement compared to the low of 42% in 2016 and a major achievement for the country, WHO recommends vaccine coverage of 95% or higher each year to achieve and maintain herd immunity and protect the population. With the ongoing war leading to severe disruptions to the Ukrainian health system including routine immunizations, WHO is seriously concerned about a potential measles outbreak, which could have devastating health consequences., There are immunization gaps among children, adolescents, and adults in Ukraine. These gaps led to measles outbreaks in 2012 and then again from mid-2017 to the end of 2019, when Ukraine had the second largest measles outbreak reported globally. Thanks to the efforts of the health authorities, an aggressive immunization response helped control the outbreak in 2019 and bring infection rates down, but overall population immunity remains low., “Vaccination drives among school-age children initiated with WHO support to the Ministry of Health in 2019 were interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine. “Now the ongoing war is greatly increasing the risk of a measles outbreak, with so many families displaced and staying in crowded, temporary accommodation, and many others unable to access healthcare services.”, “Despite the many challenges of the war, WHO is working closely with the Ministry of Health to provide COVID-19 vaccination as well as routine vaccinations of children for a range of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles, rubella, diphtheria, and polio,” continued Dr Habicht. “To protect children and prevent disease outbreaks, it is critical that every child who missed a scheduled vaccination is provided with easy access to catch-up on needed doses. All possible efforts must be made to avoid a measles outbreak taking place amid the ongoing war. That’s why WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to offer measles vaccines to internally displaced children, as part of European Immunization Week, in ten oblasts across Ukraine.”, Vitaliia is a pediatrician providing immunizations for children at a repurposed technical college that is now housing internally displaced people. “I think the war has now affected everyone and the work of all health workers. I can say immunization decreased a bit because of the war, because at first there was panic, people left en masse and the number of vaccinations decreased,” she says. “But now we have restored it and we continue doing preventive vaccinations.”, WHO is also concerned and is closely monitoring an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in Ukraine. To date two children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have tested positive for polio, and the virus has also been detected in 19 asymptomatic contacts. A nationwide polio vaccination campaign to provide inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to approximately 140,000 children aged 6 months to 6 years who had not received any previous doses was disrupted just weeks after its launch on 1 February this year. The campaign has since resumed where possible, with just 48% (approximately 69,000) of the targeted children vaccinated as of 24 April., “Even one child with polio is a threat to every un- or under-vaccinated child in Ukraine. This is a highly infectious disease that can permanently affect or even take a child’s life,” noted Dr Habicht. “There is no cure for polio, only prevention. Vaccination is the only way to protect your child from this debilitating disease. At present Ukraine has enough stocks of polio vaccine to meet routine immunization needs. The issue is not one of supply but access. Many children are displaced or on the move, the health system is severely disrupted, health facilities and hospitals have come under attack, and we have no way of knowing if polio is spreading among the population in several conflict-affected areas.”, WHO is doing everything possible to support the Ukrainian health authorities to reach high-risk groups, while bringing in additional vaccine supplies as required., “The humanitarian crisis still unfolding in Ukraine has taken a tragic toll on health and well-being. Health services, already strained by COVID-19, have been stretched beyond capacity. Among the many serious and long-term impacts has been the disruption of immunization in the country,” said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., “Every day that passes without resumption of disrupted services or catch-up opportunities for displaced children increases the risk of polio circulation, outbreaks of other childhood diseases and further spread of COVID-19. The risk of these outbreaks is a stark reminder of the fragility that lies in our communities when we have un- and under-vaccinated populations,” concluded Dr Kluge., The progress Ukraine has made over the years in protecting children and adults from life-threatening diseases deserves celebration and must not be taken for granted. Maintaining this progress requires a collective effort, especially now when the ongoing war is making it all the more challenging., ENDS, Contacts:, Bhanu Bhatnagar, WHO Spokesperson in Ukraine, bbhatnagar@who.int, WHO/Europe Press Office, eupress@who.int, Notes to editor:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-immediate-steps-needed-prevent-measles-outbreak-due-ongoing-war-and-low
Grossi Meets Ukraine’s President Zelensky as IAEA Expands Technical Assistance,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,26 Apr 2022,"The IAEA will continue to support Ukraine in ensuring the safety and security of its nuclear sites, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky this evening during a meeting in Kyiv. Mr Grossi is in Ukraine heading an assistance mission to deliver vital equipment and conduct radiological and other assessments at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks before they withdrew on 31 March., “It was an emotional day to be in Chornobyl and remember the tragic events of 1986,” he said. “At the same time, it is an honour to be here with President Zelensky and show our support. The IAEA will continue to support Ukraine,” Mr Grossi said., President Zelensky thanked the Director General for visiting Chornobyl and the continued support the IAEA has provided to Ukraine and its nuclear regulator. The IAEA has been in increasingly close communication with the regulator since Russian forces advanced into Ukraine on 24 February., The IAEA has released updates on nuclear developments in Ukraine daily since then and distributed them on social media in all UN languages and Ukrainian. The IAEA has also been on the ground at other Ukrainian power plants during the conflict, and last month Mr Grossi visited the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant to offer technical assistance for safety and security to the country’s nuclear facilities.　　, Equipment and praise for Chornobyl, In the afternoon, Mr Grossi visited the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant and delivered specialized safety security equipment to the site., He met with staff at the power plant and thanked them for their resilience and courage during what has been an extremely difficult time of conflict. Mr Grossi praised the workers’ continued efforts while under Russian occupation: “We do not only have respect for you we have admiration for you because you did exactly what you were expected to do. You showed professionalism, courage, and of course, patriotism. But you did the right thing so don't worry, we are here, the IAEA is going to stay.”, Mr Grossi’s visit to Chornobyl coincided with the anniversary of the nuclear accident that occurred there on this day in 1986. He paid tribute to the lives lost at the accident and laid a wreath of flowers at its memorial. “I'm here to pay respect to the victims of the nuclear accident and to all those who work tirelessly to rebuild and protect this place,” Mr Grossi said, The 1986 accident is the most severe in the nuclear power’s history and was caused by improper testing at low power, leading to a loss of control, an explosion and a fire that demolished the reactor building and released large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/grossi-meets-ukraine-s-president-zelensky-iaea-expands-technical-assistance

"Secretary-General's remarks at press encounter with Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey V. Lavrov (26 April 2022)",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",26 Apr 2022,"Ladies and gentlemen of the press,, As Secretary-General of the United Nations, I came to Moscow as messenger of peace., My objective and my agenda is strictly linked to save lives and to reduce suffering., I had a very frank discussion with the Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and it is clear that there are two different positions on what is happening in Ukraine., According to the Russian Federation, what is taking place is a special military operation with the objectives that were announced., According to the UN, in line with the resolutions passed by the General Assembly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a violation of its territorial integrity and against the Charter of the United Nations., But it is my deep conviction that the sooner we end this war, the better – for the people of Ukraine, for the people of the Russian Federation, and those far beyond., The United Nations has repeatedly called for ceasefires to protect civilians and to facilitate a political dialogue to reach a solution., So far, that has not been possible., Today, across the Donbas, a violent battle is underway with tremendous death and destruction., Many civilians are being killed, and hundreds of thousands of people are in life-threatening conditions, trapped by the conflict., I am concerned about the repeated reports of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and possible war crimes, and they require independent investigation for effective accountability., We urgently need humanitarian corridors that are truly safe and effective and that are respected by all to evacuate civilians and deliver much-needed assistance., To that end, I have proposed the establishment of a Humanitarian Contact Group, bringing together the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United Nations, to look for opportunities for the opening of safe corridors, with local cessations of hostilities, and to guarantee that they are actually effective., Simultaneously, we recognize that we face a crisis within a crisis in Mariupol.
Thousands of civilians are in dire need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and many, of evacuation., The United Nations is ready to fully mobilize its human and logistical resources to help save lives in Mariupol., My proposal is for a coordinated work of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Ukrainian and Russian Federation forces to enable the safe evacuation of those civilians who want to leave, both inside the Azovstal plant and in the city, in any direction they chose, and to deliver the humanitarian aid required., This is not just about what is happening in Ukraine, as we are seeing shock waves around the world., The dramatic acceleration of the increases of the prices for food and energy, that was already taking place in the last year, are causing enormous suffering to hundreds of millions of the most vulnerable people worldwide. This comes on top of the shock of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and uneven access to resources for recovery, that particularly penalize developing countries around the world., So the sooner peace is established, the better – for the sake of Ukraine, Russia, and for the world., And it’s very important, even in this moment of difficulty, to keep alive the values of multilateralism., We need a world that is multipolar, with multilateral institutions, and those multilateral institutions must abide by the UN Charter and by international law – and by the UN Charter and by international law, recognizing full equality among States, they hopefully will be an instrument that will allow us, once again, to come together as humankind and address the dramatic challenges we face, from climate change to epidemics and to many others, and in which the only war we should have would be a war of those that put the planet at risk., Question: I am Geeta Mohan, from India Today. I have a question each for both the leadership, beginning with the United Nations Secretary-General. Mr. Guterres, there are allegations and counter-allegations regarding genocide, war crimes, human shields and also reports of chemical weapons and biological weapons being used. You spoke about contact group and humanitarian corridors. You also spoke about investigations. Will the United Nations look at independent investigations, creating a team and investigating team to look into the facts on the ground?, Secretary-General: Well, the UN Secretariat has not the power to do investigations of that kind. We have the International Criminal Court. We have the different mechanisms that exist in the human rights system, many commissions of inquiry. It is not my intention to promote an investigation myself. I have not the authority for it, but I think it's very important to have independent investigations in order to have full credibility and full accountability., [Following a reply by Foreign Minister Lavrov], If I may, as the Secretariat was mentioned, I'd like to say that the Secretariat entirely respects and abides by all resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. And today, if I regret something is that the UN was not allowed to be part of the Normandy format to follow the Minsk Agreement and to be able to form a very clear-cut opinion about the failure of the Minsk Agreement. On the other hand, I would like to say that I understand that the Russian Federation has many grievances, but the UN Charter foresees a large number of mechanisms in which grievances can be addressed; and mainly with a recourse to the International Court of Justice or other mechanisms, if all the other ones foreseen in the Charter fail. There is one thing that is true and obvious, and that no arguments can change: We have not Ukrainian troops in the territory of the Russian Federation, but we have Russian troops in the territory of [Ukraine]., Question [translated from Russian]: Valentina Schwartz from Lenta.ru. I have a question for both speakers. Sergey Viktorovich: United Nations General Assembly is expected to vote today on Liechtenstein's draft resolution on the right of veto, which proposes to convene the General Assembly whenever one of the five permanent members of the Security Council vetoes a resolution. What does Russia think about the proposals to reform the Security Council and about initiatives that would involve overriding the veto if there were a vote in the General Assembly? And do you, Mr. Guterres, as UN Secretary-General, think the institution of the right of veto should be reformed? Thank you very much., Secretary-General: If I am able to interpret those that so many years ago created the Charter, I believe the reason of the veto was to avoid the situation in which a confrontation among the members of the group of Permanent Members might lead to another global war. And so, the veto was a kind of an element introduced to avoid this kind of danger. It is also true that as time went by, the veto has probably been used too many times. As in many circumstances, it’s used without vital interests of a country existing., And so, I'm very much in favour of a moderate use of the veto, having no illusions about the possibility of changing it. I don't think that it will be possible to have a majority, such majority in the General Assembly with the five members agreeing on changing that. But I also believe it's important to enlarge the Security Council and to have a more equitable representation. Particularly the countries [in] Africa., Africa is a double victim of colonialism. First of all, because it suffered colonialism itself. And second, because many of the countries only gained independence when the international institutions above already have been created. And so, Africa is underrepresented in decision-making processes, in most of the multilateral institutions. And so, I do believe that a stronger representation of developing countries in many areas, from the Bretton-Woods institutions to the Security Council, would be an important reform., Question [translated from Russian]: Good afternoon, Sergey Viktorovitch! Good afternoon, Mr. Guterres. Zukhra Ishmukhametova, Sputnik. I have questions for both speakers. Now, my questions to Mr. Guterres. How can you comment on illegal expropriation of Russian diplomatic property in the US, as well as Washington’s abuse of its host status when a number of diplomats, including Russian ones, are frequently denied a visa for UN events? What steps and actions does the UN Secretariat take to engage the US in fulfilment of its obligations? My second question about Afghanistan. You encouraged the US to unblock its [inaudible] in order to avoid humanitarian economic collapse in the country. What steps have been taken in this direction?, Secretary-General: Starting off with Afghanistan. We have decided since the very beginning to engage actively with the Taliban and we have a massive humanitarian operation in Afghanistan, but we recognize that humanitarian aid is not enough. In the absence of cash, in the absence of liquidity in the economy of Afghanistan, the collapse of the economy can have devastating consequences for the people of Afghanistan. So, we have been claiming that the international community needs to create the conditions for cash to be injected in the Afghan economy. We have done ourselves. The UN is bringing by plane banknotes to Afghanistan, we have already brought 500 million US dollars. We have been pushing the World Bank in order for the World Bank to disburse amounts that are foreseen in relation to Afghanistan. And we are working together with the Central Bank, the American Treasury, to remove the obstacles that still exist in relation to the need to unfreeze the money that is available. We hope that this will be true for all the countries that have these assets frozen., We believe naturally that we need to do everything for the good of the people in Afghanistan, but we are also engaging with the Taliban very seriously in relation to the inclusivity of government and inclusivity between men and women, but also inclusivity in order for Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazar, as it was said, to be fully included in the political process in Afghanistan. On the need for Afghanistan not to be a base for any kind of terrorist activities, outside its territory and, of course, also to be able to defeat terrorism inside the territory, and on the need to respect a number of fundamental rights. And here there are two questions that are of great concern to me. One is the possibility of girls to be in schools, especially in secondary school and in university. There was a negative decision recently, I hope it will be overcome quickly. And second, the right of women to work and to exercise their professions in the country as it is happening to the UN staff, female UN staff that is indeed allowed to work at the present moment., On the other hand, we believe that it is very important that all Member States, including the Russian Federation, have a normal treatment of their visa requirements. It is essential to have the full participation of all countries in UN procedures. And we will be keeping a very strong position with the host country in order to guarantee that we move swiftly in that direction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-generals-remarks-press-encounter-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-v-lavrov

Ukraine: Behind the numbers,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,26 Apr 2022,"“It is hard to remember the exact date of my concussion. Under shelling, you get into this endless process, which has no dates,” said the man who had just fled Kharkiv in the east of Ukraine., Nataliia* sat on the floor in the sport complex in Uzhhorod, in Ukraine’s west, listening to the man’s story, as well as many of the other internally displaced persons (IDPs) there. Nataliia is a human rights officer working with the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU)., One of her key jobs now is to gather first-hand information on allegations of international human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations resulting from the armed attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine. She talks to people on the ground, listens to their stories and documents what has happened to them or their loved ones. In the sports complex, she looked for information that can help to verify civilian casualty incidents that are happening across the country., “Some people I talk to have lost their relatives and friends,” she said. “Some lost literally everything in their lives and have no place to go.”, Collecting accounts of victims and witnesses is just one facet of the monitoring work undertaken by HRMMU. But it is a vital piece – providing a trusted source of verified information on the human rights violations, including on civilian casualties that the Mission has been recording in Ukraine since 2014., Using data to “clarify what happened”, To do this, human rights officers consult a broad range of sources., When possible, they will visit the place where an incident took place and interview victims and witnesses. If it is not possible to visit the location of an incident, the Mission relies on an extensive network of trusted contacts, and partners, gleaned over the eight years it has worked in Ukraine. Also, human rights officers travel to different locations to visit IDP centres, like Nataliia did in Uzhhorod., Data is also gathered through open sources. Monitoring staff will start the day by checking publicly available information — reports by local authorities, police, and emergency services. They also monitor photos, stories and video footage posted on social media and in media. All this data is carefully corroborated, said Olga*, a human rights officer., “I am looking into different kinds of data on each and every civilian casualty case to clarify what, when and with whom it happened,” she said, explaining how the monitoring and data gathering process works., “Just to give you one example: in the morning I see information that there was a civilian casualty in location A. I check all the available information on this case – videos, photos, official data, interviews etc. I also check more general data — what occurred in this location, what type of weapon was used” she said., “Then if needed, I can request our field teams to verify this information on the ground with the available sources, for example, visiting the location of the incident or talking to victims and witnesses,” Olga added., It’s only when all these checks are finished – showing that this civilian casualty happened, Olga and other human rights officers will consider the case verified., More than just numbers, Since the beginning of the armed attack on Ukraine, the Mission has been publishing civilian casualty updates daily. As of 26 April, 2,729 people died and 3,111 were injured., “One needs to realize that we are not working with figures — we are working with individual incidents. We try to get the information about an individual incident in which a man or woman, a boy or girl was killed or injured in a specific place, in a specific situation and from a specific weapon”, said Uladzimir Shcherbau, head of a unit of the Mission. “We keep collecting information on the cases which have been reported in previous days. It's like a mosaic — you are getting additional information, and ultimately have a full picture on what happened to civilians.”, The civilian casualty numbers provided by HRMMU have become the go-to statistics for the Governments, the media, international agencies and others reporting on or monitoring the war in Ukraine. The verified information that HRMMU provides can apply pressure that may help to prevent further violations. It also can be used by different justice mechanisms to ensure justice for victims of human rights violations, as well as hold perpetrators to account, said Matilda Bogner, Head of Mission., “Our monitoring work is not easy as it requires a lot of patience and verification,” she said. “We need to ensure that we support victims and follow the do no harm principle. In the end, we are able to communicate what has happened, where there have been violations and how to take steps to remedy the situation and prevent further violations. The documentation that we do helps us to advocate for changes, justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators.”, *Some monitoring staff in Ukraine are not fully identified for security reasons., For human rights officers these updates are more than just numbers.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-behind-numbers

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 25 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,26 Apr 2022,"Date: 26 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation's armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00midnight on 25 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 5,840 civilian casualties in the country: 2,729 killed and 3,111 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 24 April 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 25 April only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 25 April have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation's military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact: Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or Lori Brumat +41 22 928 91 49 / lori.brumat@un.org

ALLOCATION AMOUNT, Between January and March 2022, the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) launched two reserve allocations to support the most vulnerable conflict-affected people, and mobilized rapidly in response to the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. The first reserve allocation of US$3m, which was launched prior to the escalation of the conflict, was reprogrammed to address the unfolding humanitarian situation, focusing on (i) supporting medical facilities to strengthen the capacity of the health-care system undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) agricultural and non-agricultural livelihood assistance for conflict-affected communities; and, (iii) multisectoral assistance to IDPs residing in collective centres., The second reserve allocation of $41m was launched a few days after the start of the war. It aimed to provide (i) lifesaving multisectoral assistance to displaced and non-displaced persons, who were affected by the escalation of hostilities; (ii) protect conflict-affected people and civilian infrastructure in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law; and (iii) support the provision of basic services in areas impacted by the conflict. A total of $44.4m was allocated to 25 partners implementing 29 projects across 24 oblasts and assisting over 2.1m people in need.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-1st-and-2nd-reserve-allocations-2022-dashboard-25-april
Urgently help Ukraine civilians flee Mariupol [EN/RU],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,26 Apr 2022,"Guterres Should Press Russia to Allow Aid, Routes Out to Ukraine-Controlled Areas, (Kyiv) – Russian forces now occupying most of Ukraine’s southeastern port city of Mariupol should ensure that civilians remaining in the city can leave in safety to Ukraine-controlled territory if they choose, Human Rights Watch said today. Older people, people with disabilities, and those who are sick or injured require special attention., United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, visiting Moscow and Kyiv this week, should prioritize the plight of civilians in Mariupol, and stress that senior Russian officials can be held accountable for unlawful civilian deaths and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. Russian forces need to respect the fundamental obligation under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians., “After surviving two months of terror, hiding in basements as their city was turned to char and rubble, civilians still in Mariupol urgently need assistance and safe evacuation routes,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “Secretary-General Guterres and other international leaders should press top Russian officials to ensure safe passage to Ukraine-controlled territory.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed 56 people who escaped Mariupol between mid-March and mid-April. They described dire conditions in the city, with those who left more recently forced to go to Russia or Russia-controlled territory unless they had the financial means and were able to organize private transportation through dangerous escape routes., The number of civilians still in Mariupol remains unclear. Ukrainian officials say that 120,000 remain but that cannot be verified., Following a siege that began around March 2, 2022, Russian forces now occupy nearly all of Mariupol except for the Ukrainian forces’ final holdout at the Azovstal steel plant, where, according to Ukrainian authorities, a few thousand Ukrainian soldiers, about 500 of them wounded, and 1,000 civilians reportedly remain. Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s televised order on April 21 to blockade the plant instead of trying to seize it, the Russian bombardment continued at least through April 24., The total number of civilians killed in Mariupol also remains unknown. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 20,000 people may have been killed there since the war began., Ukrainian officials have reported that Russian forces buried many of them in two mass grave sites, one in Manhush, 20 kilometers west of Mariupol, and the other in Vynohradne, 14 kilometers east. Satellite imagery that Human Rights Watch analyzed indicates that both sites are next to village cemeteries. In Manhush, signs of this mass grave site are first visible on satellite imagery between March 23 and 26, and in Vynohradne, between March 26 and 29. Both expanded dramatically in recent weeks. In Manhush, as of April 24, the site had tripled longitudinally in size. In Vynohradne, as of April 20, the site occupied about 1,125 square meters., A 57-year-old English teacher who sheltered for over three weeks at Mariupol’s Regional Intensive Care Hospital said that Russian soldiers told her in early April that they were taking bodies to Manhush to bury them. The bodies had been piling up at the hospital, she said, including of injured people who died of their wounds, and bodies picked up from the streets. “The Russians told us they were taking the bodies to Manhush,” she said. “They used this van to take the bodies. I saw them loading the van with bodies when I went out to get water – twice, and then they told us not to use that entrance anymore.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed 43 people who left Mariupol in mid-March and made it to Zaporizhzhia in Ukrainian-controlled territory, after hearing about possible escape routes through word of mouth. As Human Rights Watch previously documented, they traveled in private vehicles through multiple checkpoints along the 80-kilometer route of Russian-controlled territory to Berdyansk. Some then boarded buses while others continued in private vehicles to Zaporizhzhia, where volunteers and aid groups have been providing assistance., Many other civilians were unable or unwilling to risk the dangerous route out of Mariupol. With mobile phone and internet connections down since early March, civilians had no way of obtaining information about possible evacuation routes and many decided they were safest remaining in their shelters, despite deteriorating conditions and lack of food, water, and medicine. Others had no means of transport out of the city, including because shelling had destroyed their cars or it was too dangerous to reach them., By around March 21, it had become even more difficult for civilians to escape the city for Ukraine-controlled territory. Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 civilians who left Mariupol between March 21 and April 11, when Russian forces had already occupied much of the city. All said that Russian forces provided no opportunities or support for them to reach Ukraine-controlled territory, where they all wanted to go. Many provided personal accounts and information they had about family and friends, about Russian forces transporting civilians to Russian-controlled territories and Russia., One woman who tried to flee the fighting with her neighbors on April 8 said that Russian forces made them board a Russian armored vehicle, which took them to Vynohradne village, where their documents and bags were checked, names registered, and they were put on a bus to Bezimenne in the Russian-backed territory of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR), which is not controlled by the Ukrainian government., After three nights at a community center, they were taken by bus to Starobesheve, also in DNR, for what the soldiers referred to as a “filtration process.” She said Russian personnel took their fingerprints and personal details, photographed them, and made them fill out a questionnaire, including about their connections to the Ukrainian military and their political views., The next day another bus took them to the Russian border, where they were questioned again, then to Tagonrog, where they said a large sports facility held hundreds of Mariupol residents. The woman said that, fearing they would be sent to a faraway Russian town, she and six others managed to pool their resources to hire a private car that took them to Tbilisi, Georgia., When leaving Mariupol, “We would have used the opportunity to go to Ukraine if we could have, for sure,” she said. “But we had no choice. There was no possibility to go there.”, A 24-year-old woman from a village 13 kilometers from Mariupol, where Russian forces had reportedly taken control on about March 13, said that she went on a similar journey to Bezimenne and then on to Tagonrog on around March 15. She was ultimately able to find her own transportation to St. Petersburg and then on to a European Union country, but she said her aunt and two cousins, who were also transported from Ukraine, have not been able to leave Russia., Two women who left Mariupol on March 21 and another woman who left on April 11 said that they were told that they would be able to get buses to Zaporizhzhia if they went to Nikolske (Volodarsk), about 20 kilometers from Mariupol in Russia-controlled territory. Once in Nikolske, a woman who left on March 21 said, “We started asking if we could get a bus to Zaporizhzhia. But we were told that there were no more buses to Zaporizhzhia... The only options were Russian territories: DNR, Rostov on Don [in Russia], any Russian area, but we could forget about Ukraine.” But the women said they had enough cash to hire private vehicles that took them to Berdyansk, and eventually to Zaporizhzhia., Many other Mariupol residents have apparently ended up in Russia against their will, unable to leave, but the exact numbers remain unclear. A woman from Mariupol who made it to Zaporizhzhia said that her sister got on a bus on March 26 that she was told would go to Zaporizhzhia, but ended up in Rostov, Russia, and is now in Russia’s Pskov region. “We’re in touch … but she’s scared to talk, even to me,” the woman said., Ukrainian authorities reported on April 18 that Russian forces have taken about 40,000 Mariupol residents “forcibly” across the border to Russia, while Russian authorities reported on April 22 that 143,631 Mariupol residents have evacuated to Russia. Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify these figures., Both Russia and Ukraine have obligations to ensure access for humanitarian assistance to all civilians and to take all feasible steps to allow civilians to evacuate safely, if they choose. Russia is prohibited from forcing civilians, individually or en masse, to evacuate to Russia. A transfer can be forcible, and may constitute a war crime, when a person volunteers because they fear consequences such as violence, duress, or detention if they remain, and the occupying power is taking advantage of a coercive environment to transfer them., “The city of Mariupol and its residents have already suffered unspeakable horrors,” Sawyer said. “To protect the lives and dignity of the tens of thousands of civilians reportedly still in the city, Secretary-General Guterres should mobilize the global community to stand with Mariupol and press Russian forces to immediately facilitate the delivery of aid and voluntary safe passage.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/urgently-help-ukraine-civilians-flee-mariupol-enru

More than 100 fire stations and 250 fire engines have been destroyed in Ukraine., The UK is supplying 22 new ambulances to Ukraine – in addition to those from NHS Trusts already announced – equipped with paramedic kits and medical grab bags.

They will also set up mobile health clinics to support the most vulnerable civilians remaining in Ukraine, including the elderly and young children., The UK is also donating £300,000 worth of medicines and pharmaceutical supplies to UK-Med which could support a hospital for up to six weeks., Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:, The Kremlin continues to lie about deliberate attacks on Ukraine’s hospitals and the indiscriminate targeting of civilians., Now our vital humanitarian support will help save lives and deliver medical expertise to the frontline., Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency Jacob Rees-Mogg said:, I was privileged to be able to visit Ashford and meet the volunteers and civil servants behind the fire aid shipments to Ukraine., This aid demonstrates the tremendous practical work that Britain’s public servants are doing for the people of Ukraine, and is an example of the good-heartedness of the British people and their determination to help., More than five million medical items have also been donated to Ukraine including wound packs, intensive care equipment and medicines., At the beginning of March, UK-Med launched a national fundraising appeal to fund its work in Ukraine and has sent 26 doctors, nurses, paramedics, surgeons and humanitarian health programme specialists to the country., UK-Med CEO David Wightwick who’s currently in Eastern Ukraine said:, I’ve seen with my own eyes the devastating impact of this cruel war. Ensuring the more than 7 million internally displaced people across the country have access to vital primary health care is and will continue to be of the upmost importance for many months to come., This very welcome funding from the UK government will enable us to continue to deliver primary health care and lifesaving specialist clinical training in both the east and the west of the country, reaching those who need it most.

This included:, a total of 2,665 killed (855 men, 563 women, 59 girls, and 69 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,052 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,053 injured (355 men, 284 women, 64 girls, and 71 boys, as well as 161 children and 2,118 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,690 casualties (1,217 killed and 1,473 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 2,268 casualties (1,136 killed and 1,132 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 422 casualties (81 killed and 341 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,028 casualties (1,448 killed and 1,580 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.

In Kharkiv, from 13-17 April, active fighting and ongoing airstrikes resulted in the death of 18 civilians, with reports of 106 injured persons and significant damage to civilian infrastructure. Cluster munitions also remain a grave concern in the region as three military engineers were killed, and four others were seriously injured while removing the devices on 17 April. Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that from 18-19 April, 1,592 explosives were detected, seized and neutralized. Meanwhile, Lviv, a major hub for humanitarian coordination and assistance during the war, was reportedly hit by five missiles, resulting in additional casualties on 18 April. OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 18 April, there have been 4,966 civilian casualties, including 2,104 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., On 16-17 April, evacuations continued by train from Pokrovsk to Chop and from Lozova to Uzhhorod and Khmelnytskiy, however, from 17-19 April there were no humanitarian corridors in operation, as a ceasefire agreement had not been reached between Ukrainian and Russian Federation authorities., IOM continues to be particularly concerned about the steadily rising internal and cross-border displacement of persons as a result of the war. Between 11-17 April, IOM conducted the third round of a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. As of 17 April, approximately 7.7 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine – around 17.5 per cent of the country’s population – an increase of over 670,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) since April 1., UN Secretary-General Guterres again called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine to allow the delivery of lifesaving aid as well as evacuations. The appeal followed the attacks on Lviv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, among others, which resulted in numerous civilian casualties and destruction., IOM’s Director General, António Vitorino, in his remarks delivered to the UN Security Council on 19 April, echoed the Secretary-General’s call for a ceasefire and called upon the international community to ensure support for all persons fleeing the war, including third country nationals.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-15-21-april-2022

In Mariupol alone, local authorities estimate that tens of thousands of people have been killed, while the recent revelations of mass graves in Bucha, Irpin and other areas surrounding Kyiv highlight the likelihood of many more deaths that have not been counted. The war has seen the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in urban settings, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. The presence of landmines and unexploded explosive ordnance is also a major concern. Even before this war, eastern Ukraine was one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world., The conflict has caused the world’s fastest growing displacement crisis since World War II, with nearly 13 million people uprooted in less than two months. Over a quarter of Ukraine’s population have fled their homes, including more than 7.7 million people now estimated to be internally displaced and over 5.2 million people who have crossed borders to seek security and safety in other countries, most of them women and children.
Nearly two-thirds of the children in Ukraine have been displaced., Massive devastation in urban centres, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, have made life unbearable for millions of people and severely disrupted critical services, especially healthcare. In besieged areas, people have lived for weeks without access to food, water and heat, while under the constant threat of bombardment. More than half of all attacks against healthcare facilities in the world this year—119 out of 182 by 11 April—have occurred in Ukraine. These attacks have decimated access to healthcare at a time when people need it most—women have been forced to deliver babies in basements, injured people have had no access to care and ill children have lost access to life-saving treatments., Roughly 300 health facilities are in conflict areas and 1,000 health facilities are in areas that have changed control. Nearly 50 per cent of Ukraine’s pharmacies are presumed to be closed and many health workers are either displaced or unable to work. Other civilian infrastructure has also been severely impacted: more than 869 educational facilities have been damaged and 88 destroyed, according to the Ministry of Education, although these figures are not verified., Millions of people—including women and small children—have been left without access to safe water or sanitation, drastically heightening the risk of waterborne disease as well as dehydration. Due to attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages an estimated 1.4 million people in eastern Ukraine do not have access to water, and another 4.6 million people across the country have only limited access., Poor water quality can lead to diseases, including skin infections and scabies. People are having to live in crowded conditions and are unable to follow basic hygiene measures, including menstrual hygiene. This could lead to respiratory tract infections and the spread of COVID-19. Low and poor water supply can also cause outbreaks of communicable diseases, including cholera. The bacteria which causes cholera is present in the Mariupol area, as highlighted by the outbreak reported in the city 2011., The war is impacting women and men in different ways and is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, according to a Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE. Ukraine’s population has a distinctly gendered profile, with 54 per cent women and 46 per cent men, including a particularly large population of older females. Prior to the escalation of the war, 71 per cent of the heads of households in Governmentcontrolled areas were female. Women from groups in vulnerable situations are being left behind and disproportionately affected by disruptions caused by war, while the displacement and refugee flow is largely gendered., The threat of gender-based violence—including conflict-related sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and human trafficking—has risen exponentially since the war began. Two thirds of women in Ukraine had experienced some form of gender-based violence in their lifetime before the conflict and the deterioration of the security context has sharply increased the risk of multiple forms of violence., There are mounting allegations of sexual violence perpetrated against women and girls during the war.
The armed conflict may prevent farmers from accessing their fields, harvesting, and marketing current crops, planting new crops, or sustaining livestock production. Between 20 and 30 per cent of areas under winter cereal, maize and sunflower production will remain unharvested in July/August, or not be planted this spring, according to the Government and FAO. About half of winter wheat and a third of rye due to be harvested in July–August 2022 are currently in war-affected areas. There are also concerns over damage to standing crops and risk of mines and unexploded ordnance impacting the ability to harvest in the period ahead., The war has also devastated Ukraine’s economy. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, has said that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion, while some 53 per cent of employed Ukrainians have lost their jobs since the war began, according to a nation-wide survey conducted by the Rating Group in March.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-flash-appeal-march-august-2022-enruuk

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Apr 2022,"Key Takeaways, ● Airstrikes, shelling, crossfire and the targeting of civilian areas continues to result in the death and injury of children. By April 15, 50 days since the conflict began, official figures showed that 153 children had lost their lives and a further 246 were injured, with the actual number likely to be far higher. Moreover, the number of testimonies regarding protection incidents affecting children in Ukraine is increasing (allegations of rape, kidnapping, hostage taking etc.). These incidents, coupled with the overall impact of the war and of the displacement, will inevitably have a heavy negative impact on children’s mental health., ● Education was disrupted for 5.7 million children in Ukraine, as schools shut down at the start of the war. While there are efforts to restart education for children including through a national online education platform, difficulties persist. In conflict-affected areas, security concerns coupled with the lack of access to electricity and internet hamper the access to education services.

An Agenda for the UN Secretary-General’s Trip to Russia and Ukraine,News and Press Release,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Apr 2022,"The UN Secretary-General is on his way to Moscow and Kyiv. With fighting still raging, he may find his diplomatic options limited, but nevertheless he should table proposals both for how to save lives now and how the UN might help with future peace talks., UN Secretary-General António Guterres is travelling to Moscow and Kyiv. He will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on 26 April, and then with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the next day. The Secretary-General’s visit will take place against the backdrop of the hostilities in eastern and southern Ukraine. He is in no position to act as a peacemaker in the short term, as both sides still believe that they can gain the upper hand on the battlefield and he has no new incentives to offer that would be sufficient to persuade either party to change course. Nonetheless, Guterres can use this opportunity to press for relief for Ukrainian civilians – especially those trapped in the devastated city of Mariupol – and give the two presidents some ideas as to how the UN could facilitate and support credible peace initiatives in the future., The Secretary-General has had no major diplomatic role in the war to date. Like many other informed observers, he was reportedly sceptical of U.S. intelligence at the start of the year that Russia planned a full-scale invasion. Once the invasion was under way, he condemned it in clear terms and called on Russia to withdraw, drawing accusations of bias from Moscow. Crisis Group understands that President Putin has since turned down a number of requests for telephone calls with Guterres. While it may be a small positive sign that Moscow will host him, the Secretary-General will need to avoid looking like he wants to curry favour with Russia after being on the outs with the Kremlin. President Zelenskyy – who has decried the Security Council’s inaction over the war – has called the Secretary-General’s decision to visit Moscow first and Kyiv second “simply wrong”., Given his limited diplomatic options, the Secretary-General has tried to address the war’s consequences inside and outside Ukraine from other angles. He has focused on humanitarian operations inside the country – where the UN has over 1,000 staff – and on drawing attention to the war’s impact on global food, energy and commodity prices. The UN may yet play a crucial role in coordinating efforts to mitigate the war’s international economic fallout. But given the central place of peace and security in the organisation’s charter, it is hard to see the Secretary-General giving up on diplomacy while the war rages., In both Moscow and Kyiv, Guterres is likely to find the atmosphere chilly at best. Russia has said the Secretary-General will “be received” by President Putin on 26 April, adding that he will also have talks with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. This language does not suggest that the Russian leader is open to an extended discussion. Even if he were, it might not make much difference. In March 2014, shortly after Russia annexed Crimea, and with crisis building in eastern Ukraine, then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met with Putin for what he called a “very productive and constructive meeting”, but with no observable impact on Russia’s subsequent actions. Zelenskyy’s criticism of how Guterres will sequence his visits suggests that the Secretary-General will also get a sceptical reception in Kyiv., Secretary-General Guterres should nonetheless aim to table specific proposals to ease the harm done by the war in his meetings in Moscow and Kyiv. He can use his meetings with the two presidents both to lay out immediate humanitarian priorities – to help ensure that he makes the most of this trip to save lives – and also to share some thoughts about how the UN could support long-term efforts to achieve an eventual peace. Three themes that Guterres should emphasise in particular include:, Pressing for humanitarian access: Both the Russians and Ukrainians accuse each other of stopping humanitarian convoys from reaching embattled Ukrainian locales. According to Ukrainian and international sources involved in relief efforts, Russian forces are the main culprits as they block some roads and mine others, precluding aid access. Russian units have also struck health care facilities and people queuing for food assistance. The Secretary-General can use his meetings to offer both the Russians and Ukrainians a reckoning of the obstacles UN and other humanitarian agencies face in Ukraine. He can also try to extract assurances that aid will henceforth be delivered without obstructions (although aid workers will doubtless wonder if such pledges will mean anything in reality)., Aiding and evacuating civilians from Mariupol: Over 100,000 civilians remain in the port city of Mariupol, a centre of intense fighting since the first day of Russia’s assault. Some 1,000 are taking shelter in the besieged Azovstal steel mill complex. Recent efforts to allow them to flee through humanitarian corridors have had very limited success as few people took advantage and there were reports of shelling of those who did. If the Secretary-General can persuade Russia to agree to a large-scale evacuation of the city’s remaining civilians to central Ukraine, and the provision of humanitarian assistance to those who cannot leave (and if Russia actually sticks to these terms), this accomplishment alone will make his travel worthwhile., Setting out ideas for a future UN role in peace talks: The UN has played no significant role in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine so far, leaving other actors such as Turkey and Israel to guide discussions. These efforts have to date been inconclusive, as both sides continue to see military victory as plausible, although they have led to some humanitarian steps. Depending on battlefield events, more realistic peace talks may become possible in the months ahead. The Secretary-General cannot predict when or under what circumstances this opportunity may arise. But he can at least table some ideas about how the UN might provide its support in this eventuality. Options range from purely logistical assistance – such as the provision of facilities in Geneva – to the appointment of a personal envoy by the Secretary-General to coordinate with interested parties in forging a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. If all these possibilities seem remote at present, Guterres can still flag them for future consideration., There are topics that Guterres should avoid. While talking about potential UN support for peace talks, the Secretary-General should avoid pressing for a ceasefire, which both parties will likely reject as playing to the other’s military advantage by allowing breathing space for rest and resupply. He should also eschew premature speculation about what a final settlement might look like. As Crisis Group has noted, it is conceivable that the UN might one day be invited to send military monitors to observe a disengagement of Russian and Ukrainian forces if hostilities cease. But such options remain entirely hypothetical, and it would be distracting to discuss them this week., The Secretary-General will also have step gingerly around some difficult moral and legal issues. In Kyiv, if not in Moscow, his political interlocutors and the media may press him on whether President Putin is a war criminal, and if Russian politicians and generals should face tribunals. He will have to avoid making pointed remarks on these matters, whatever his own views of their merits. The Secretary-General has already highlighted the war’s illegality and immorality. His job now is to focus on maximising the UN’s humanitarian and diplomatic functions in Ukraine., Finally, there is an important question concerning the Secretary-General’s itinerary. He and his advisers should consider whether, in addition to visiting Kyiv, he should also go to other parts of Ukraine to see the scale of war damage. The most dramatic move he could make would be to go to Mariupol or its environs to urge evacuation of civilians. Making this trip would send a powerful signal and symbolise that the UN understands the severity of the war’s human costs. The Secretary-General’s security detail is unlikely to welcome the idea of him visiting an active war zone, although his predecessors have taken such risks. (Boutros Boutros-Ghali flew into Sarajevo when it was under siege in 1993 for example.) If it proves impossible to go to such a place, Guterres should take the time to speak in person with civilian victims of the war during his time in Kyiv., For all the frustrations he is likely to encounter, the Secretary-General’s trip is a welcome development. It may require an international figure of his status and seniority to hammer out agreements to assist civilians in Mariupol and other centres of fighting, even as the war continues. Similarly, there may come a time in the war when the UN’s good offices can help facilitate the de-escalation that cannot come too soon. While the Secretary-General may struggle to make near-term progress, it is essential that the UN continues to look at every avenue for easing the suffering of Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/agenda-un-secretary-general-s-trip-russia-and-ukraine

Timely funding is urgently needed to avoid immediate pipeline breaks., Situation Update, The humanitarian situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate, as a result of ongoing hostilities chiefly taking place in eastern and southern oblasts. Over a quarter of Ukraine’s population is currently displaced internally or in neighbouring countries. According to the latest assessment of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), around 60 per cent of those displaced are women. More than half of those displaced expressed their need for food. Over one quarter of internally displaced families with children under the age of five reported difficulties in feeding their children since the start of the conflict., As hostilities intensify, the basic needs of people stranded in hard-to-reach areas increase, while also hampering efforts to establish humanitarian corridors to both evacuate civilians and deliver life-saving assistance. The most urgent and critical needs are in these locations with high levels of insecurity, disrupted food supply and retail capacities, and limited or sporadic humanitarian access. Logistics challenges are also increasing, constraining the access to the encircled and partially encircled oblasts of Ukraine. The limited availability of trucks and drivers willing to move to frontline areas are delaying the delivery of humanitarian assistance to some of the hardest-hit areas., Lack of access to conflict zones is the biggest obstacle to providing life-saving food assistance.

Protection and Human Rights",22 Apr 2022,"L’VIV, 22 April 2022 – More than 63,000 babies are estimated to have been born into war in Ukraine in the past two months and into conditions that could have a lifelong impact on their mental health, according to Save the Children[i]., These newborns join the millions of children put at heightened risk of grave physical harm and lifelong psychological trauma from violence, loss, and displacement, since the escalation of the war on 24 February and with fighting increasing in the east of the country., Save the Children is calling for an immediate end to the violence as the only way to protect children from physical and psychological harm. It is also the only way to safely reach the 12 million people across Ukraine in desperate need of critical humanitarian assistance to survive[ii]., The escalation has caused the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War Two, with five million now having fled Ukraine. At least two thirds of the country’s 7.5 million children have fled their homes and more than 450 children been killed or injured., Save the Children said the escalation has meant 63,000 babies born into conditions that could have negative lifelong impacts. New mothers are struggling to bond with their babies due to severe psychological distress, according to Save the Children. This can have a negative and sometimes permanent impact on babies’ attachment to their mothers and their subsequent development. Medical staff have also reported an increase in the number of babies being born prematurely., Morgan MacDonald, Save the Children’s mental health and psychosocial support adviser with the Emergency Health Unit, said:, “We know that stress can impact a mother’s ability to breastfeed, whether as a result of hormonal changes or lack of confidence. Obviously being in a war zone brings on a huge amount of distress which can impact the body physically as well as mentally, including potentially disrupting the ability to produce breastmilk. It can also prevent mothers from recognizing and responding to the needs of their babies., One of the most important aspects to a parent-child relationship is attachment, and when you lack that parent-child bonding it is a huge developmental problem that can create issues throughout that baby’s life. Attachment disorders are one of the most serious mental health issues that we face – our brain development and growth are based on healthy attachment to caregivers., “Supporting mothers to try to breastfeed can actually be a life-saving intervention. But the fact that we are seeing this happen in the first place is incredibly alarming.”, Save the Children staff are already seeing thee psychological and emotional impacts of war on the children they are meeting, with needs assessments identifying psychological support as one of the biggest priorities in the response[iii]. Staff and partners within Ukraine have reported children arriving at reception centres showing worrying signs of severe distress. One child psychologist in Zaporizhzhia, central-east Ukraine, described a nine-year-old boy who arrived with shrapnel wounds in his leg but was so distressed that he would not allow the medical team to come anywhere near him for treatment[iv]., In the same reception centre, it is sometimes the children who take on the parental role, such as a five-year-old girl who calmed down her mother who was panicking after misplacing her phone., The staff and volunteers who have been supporting people who have fled their homes across the country are also caught up in this war and are experiencing signs of burnout themselves, Save the Children said., Save the Children’s Country Director in Ukraine, Pete Walsh, said:, “At Save the Children, we know from research in other war zones that conflict can cause long-term harm to children’s mental and physical health. Put simply, children born into war are born into devastation. Unless this war ends, more than 63,000 new lives are at risk of death, injury, physical and psychological trauma. At the same time, we know that given the right conditions and support children have an amazing resilience which can allow them to recover., “Without a political solution to this crisis, this number will continue to grow. Enough is enough. This war needs to end so that children have a chance to recover and no longer have to go through these unimaginable experiences.”, ENDS, [i] The population of Ukraine is currently 43.19m. The UN projection for birth rate in 2022 is 8.816 births per 1,000. We divided 43.19 million by 1000, which is 43,190. We then multiplied this figure by 8.816 to get to 380,763.04: the total number of babies born throughout 2022 using the UN’s current projected birth rate. We divided this by 12 to get to the monthly average figure of 31,730.2533. We then multiplied this by two, to get to a total of 63,460.5067.

Protection and Human Rights",22 Apr 2022,"FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT, Production prospects of 2022 winter crops hampered by low availability of inputs, delivery challenges, difficult physical access to fields due to the war and eventual labour shortages, Forecast for cereal exports in 2021/22 reduced, amid port closures, damage to infrastructure and implementation of government policies to secure sufficient domestic supplies, As of early March 2022, about 12 million people estimated to be in need of life saving assistance, Uncertain production prospects for 2022 winter crops, The 2022 winter crops (wheat and rapeseed), for harvesting from June onwards, were sown last October. Although drier‑than‑average conditions delayed planting operations in some regions, the area sown to winter wheat was estimated at an above‑average level. Weather conditions during the winter (mid‑November to February) were overall favourable and crops have resumed growth after dormancy in mid‑March. Following below‑average precipitation amounts in March, rain levels returned to normal and, as at the first dekad of April, soil moisture amounts were reported to be near average in most croplands. (1), The escalation of the conflict in late February 2022 casts uncertainty over the harvest of winter crops. Active fighting resulted in population displacements, restricted the movements of people and prevented farmers from attending to their fields., As of March 2022, it was estimated that about 20 percent of the area planted to the 2022 winter crops may not be harvested as a result of direct destruction, constrained access to fields, labour shortages and/or lack of economic resources. Similarly, national yields are expected to fall by about 10 percent compared to the average level due to delayed or missed application of fertilizers and inability to control pests and diseases. (2), Planting of sunflower seed and spring cereal crops, including maize, started in April and, despite being constrained by fuel shortages, it is currently progressing across the country on fields without the remnants of the war. According to estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, as of 18 April 2022, planting of spring crops was completed on 2.5 million hectares, or 17.6 percent of the projected sown area (corresponding to about 80 percent of the area planted to spring crops in 2021). (3) Despite seed and fertilizer stocks being sufficient for 70‑80 percent of the needs, considering anticipated decreases in planted areas, safe delivery of inputs to farmers may not be guaranteed. For both maize and sunflower seed, plantings may decline by 30 percent compared to 2021, with yields likely to decrease by 20 percent below the average levels. (4), Reduced forecast for cereal exports in 2021/22, amid port closures, damage to infrastructure and implementation of government policies, As of late March 2022, total cereal exports in the 2021/22 marketing year (July/June) are forecast to drop at a below‑average level of 46 million tonnes. Wheat and maize shipments are forecast at 19 million tonnes and 21 million tonnes, respectively, only slightly above the levels already exported up to 24 February 2022, when the war started. Exports virtually stopped since the escalation of tensions due to port closures and damages to transport and storage infrastructure., Some quantities are still exportable by rail via western borders, but the capacity, coupled with logistical challenges caused by different railway gauges, is unlikely to make up for the lost maritime exports. In the past, about 300 000 tonnes of agricultural commodities were exported via rail per month. (5), Based on FAO's forecasts for the ongoing 2021/22 season (July/June) before the start of the war and on the pace of exports, the country was initially expected to export approximately 6 million tonnes of wheat and 14 million tonnes of maize between March and June 2022. (6), In early March 2022, the government suspended the exports of some food products, including oats, buckwheat, millet, rye, barley, rapeseed, meat, sugar and salt. The decision was taken to safeguard domestic food supplies amid the ongoing conflict. In addition, export licensing requirements were introduced for other commodities, including wheat and meslin (FPMA Food Policy)., About 12 million people in need of life‑saving assistance, Already prior to the start of the war, about 1.5 million people had been displaced as a result of the near eight‑year conflict in the eastern areas and about 1.1 million people were in need of food and livelihood assistance. The ongoing conflict is increasing humanitarian needs within the country as well as in neighbouring countries where displaced populations are seeking refuge. As of 20 April 2022, about 5.1 million people, (7) mostly women and children, had been forced to abandon their homes and flee across borders to safety, with over 2.8 million refugees crossing borders with Poland., According to the Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022, issued on 1 March 2022 by the United Nations, about 12 million people in the country were estimated to be in need of life‑saving assistance. In addition, given the scale and direction of ongoing hostilities, 18 million people were projected to be affected, including up to 6.7 million anticipated to be newly internally displaced people. Currently, western parts of the country are reporting large numbers of IDPs, which are putting a strain on local resources. Reports indicate that a large share of refugees have private host accommodations set up in their destination countries, which are often different from their entry countries. However, as the wave of refugees without prearranged hosts intensifies, humanitarian needs in the host countries will increase., The violence has escalated rapidly and it is extremely difficult to predict the evolution of the war and its effect on lives, livelihoods, food security and nutrition. (8) Food security conditions remain particularly concerning in besieged cities, many of them suffering constrained humanitarian access., The prevalence and severity of domestic food insecurity will depend on the length and scale of the conflict and urban areas are likely to be more affected as most rural dwellers typically cultivate some land to produce food to supplement their household's diets., As food access, production and overall food availability deteriorate, efforts to bolster agricultural production and the functioning of food supply chains will be critical in averting a food crisis in 2022 and into 2023. Under its updated Rapid Response Plan, FAO requires USD 115.4 million to scale up its support to reach 979 320 small farmers and medium‑sized producers in the country through December 2022 to boost food availability and access., Disclaimer: The designations employed and the presentation of material in this information product do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of FAO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries., (1) APK-inform: https://www.apk-inform.com/en/news/1526376., (2) FAO Information Note, 25 March 2022 Update: https://www.fao.org/3/cb9236en/cb9236en.pdf., (3) Agricensus: https://www.agricensus.com/Article/Ukraine-s-spring-crop-planting-covers-2-5-million-hectares-to-date-21754.html., (4) FAO Information Note, 25 March Update: https://www.fao.org/3/cb9236en/cb9236en.pdf., (5) CSIS Presents: https://www.csis.org/events/agriculture-and-food-security-casualties-war-ukraine., (6) FAO Information Note, 25 March Update: https://www.fao.org/3/cb9236en/cb9236en.pdf., (7) UNHCR: https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine (accessed on 21 April 2022)., (8) FAO, Note on the impact of the war on food security in Ukraine: https://www.fao.org/3/cb9171en/cb9171en.pdf.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/giews-country-brief-ukraine-22-april-2022
Press briefing notes on Ukraine and Israel/OPT (22 April 2022),News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,22 Apr 2022,"FROM the Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Ravina Shamdasani, LOCATION GENEVA, 1. Ukraine, The Russian invasion nearly two months ago has plunged Ukraine into a human rights and humanitarian crisis that has devastated the lives of civilians throughout the country and beyond, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Friday, as she called for all parties to respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law, in particular the rules governing the conduct of hostilities., “Over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside,” Bachelet said., Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, actions that may amount to war crimes., “What we saw in Government-controlled Kramatorsk on 8 April when cluster sub-munitions hit the railway station, killing 60 civilians and injuring 111 others, is emblematic of the failure to adhere to the principle of distinction, the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks and the principle of precaution enshrined in international humanitarian law,” Bachelet said., Full press release, available online, 2. Israel/OPT, We are deeply concerned by the escalating violence in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel over the past month., Last weekend saw Israeli security forces injure around 180 Palestinians, including at least 27 children during tensions in the Al Aqsa Mosque compound. The witnessed conduct of Israeli security forces in particular on 15 April, captured in numerous videos, raises serious concerns that the use of force was widespread, unnecessary and indiscriminate. A number of Palestinians, including elderly, women, children and at least one journalist, who did not appear to pose any threat to the Israeli security forces in any manner, were beaten with batons or shot with sponge-tipped bullets from close range. Many sustained broken bones. Some were injured from stun grenades including some directly striking their heads., In Jerusalem, between 15 and 17 April, Israeli police reportedly arrested over 470 people, including 60 children. Prisoners’ organisations have raised concerns that some of them were injured at the time of arrest, and that many were prevented from receiving legal aid. All of these 470 have reportedly now been released. Most of those released were prohibited from entering Al Aqsa Mosque compound or the Old City of Jerusalem in the coming weeks as a condition of release., At around 6:30 am yesterday, 21 April, Israeli police reportedly raided the yards of Al Aqsa Mosque compound and used force to push Palestinians out of the area. Reportedly, Israeli security forces confined dozens of Palestinians inside Al Qibli mosque, and six people were injured by sponge-tipped bullets. Last night and early this morning yet more violence has been reported in the compound, with a journalist, an elderly person and a paramedic among those injured by Israeli forces., The use of force in law enforcement operations is strictly limited and governed by international norms and standards. The use of force by Israeli police resulting in widespread injuries among worshippers and staff in and around the Al Aqsa Mosque compound must be promptly, impartially, independently and transparently investigated. Those responsible for any violations should be held to account, and policies and procedures on the use of force reviewed with a view to avoid any further violations., The tension in Jerusalem has impacted other areas. Between 18 and 21 April, Palestinian armed groups launched six rockets and one mortar shell towards Israel. One of the rockets caused some damage to a residential building. Israel responded by striking several armed groups’ military sites across the Gaza Strip. No casualties were reported in either Israel or Gaza., These latest events follow weeks of violence in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel. In the most serious attacks in Israel in many years, 14 people were killed by attackers in incidents in Beersheba, Bnei Brak, Hadera and Tel Aviv. Among those losing their lives were 12 Israelis and two foreign nationals., Israel’s intensified military operations in the West Bank, in particular in Jenin, and the use of firearms by Palestinian militants place Palestinian residents at high risk. In April so far, Israeli security forces have killed 19 Palestinians, including three boys and three women, and injured tens of others. Israeli security forces have also intensified raids and arrest operations across the West Bank, raising serious concerns of excessive use of force and ill-treatment and arbitrary arrests of family members of wanted people. Some of the killings, including in particular Israeli security forces shooting at a Palestinian woman in Husan on 10 April, raise serious concerns of excessive use of force and arbitrary deprivation of life. All use of force resulting in killing or injury must be promptly, impartially, independently and transparently investigated, and those responsible for any violations held to account., The response by Israeli authorities to the attacks in Israel, in particular measures imposed by Israel on Jenin Governorate such as widespread movement restrictions and punitive measures taken against family members of suspected attackers, raise concerns of possible collective punishment. International humanitarian and human rights law strictly prohibits penalties of any kind against people or entire groups of people for acts they have not personally committed., We echo the call of the UN Secretary-General for calm and urge investigations where people have been killed or injured., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (9 - 15 April 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,21 Apr 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, as further evidence of war crimes continued to surface following the retreat of Russian forces from northern Ukraine. The ongoing invasion continued to drive demonstration activity across the region. Violent demonstrations broke out in Sweden over public Quran burnings by far-right activists. Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards engaged in a deadly clash on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border. In France, the results of the first round of the presidential elections on 10 April sparked demonstration activity and violence. In Germany, police arrested members of a far-right group for allegedly planning to carry out a series of attacks targeting the state., In Ukraine, heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces continued in the eastern and southern parts of the country last week. Russia made no major territorial gains last week, despite sending reinforcements to eastern Ukraine following their withdrawal from the north in recent weeks (ISW, 16 April 2022). In the besieged city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region, intense fighting continued around the large Azovstal steel factory, which appears to be one of the last “strongholds” of Ukrainian forces in the city (New York Times, 18 April 2022). Amid the fighting, the Mariupol city mayor claims that at least 10,000 civilians have been killed during the ongoing Russian siege of Mariupol (AP, 12 April 2022).1 Russian forces also continued to launch missile attacks across Ukraine, targeting railways, airports, and civilian buildings. This violence contributed to the 118% increase in violence in Ukraine last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month.2, In the Black Sea, the Russian guided-missile cruiser ‘Moskva’ sank on 14 April. Ukraine claims to have hit the cruiser with two anti-ship missiles on 13 April, causing significant damage (Ukrayinska Pravda, 14 April 2022). Russian official sources did not corroborate Ukrainian claims, with the Russian Ministry of Defence instead stating that ‘Moskva’ sank due to an onboard fire and a heavy storm (Current Time, 15 April 2022). However, US officials have claimed that Ukrainian missiles were responsible for sinking the vessel, with other experts and analysts also suggesting that Ukraine’s claims are more plausible (Washington Post, 14 April 2022; New York Times, 15 April 2022)., In northern Ukraine, further evidence of war crimes committed by occupying Russian forces continued to emerge last week, including mass executions of civilians. Dozens of dead bodies of civilians were found in formerly-occupied areas across the Kyiv region, including in Buzova, Irpin, Borodianka, and Hostomel (ZMINA, 10 April 2022; Ukraine Crisis Media Center, 13 April 2022). The bodies of civilians, some bearing signs of torture, were also discovered last week in Lukashivka in the Chernihiv region and Husarivka in the Kharkiv region (Ukrinform, 9 April 2022; Fakty, 8 April 2022)., Russian forces also continued to abduct government officials and other civilians from occupied settlements last week. On 11 April, Russian soldiers abducted a 19-person crew of a Liberian-flagged cargo ship, including 18 Ukrainians, from the port of Mariupol and took them to an unknown destination (Ukrayinska Pravda, 11 April 2022)., Demonstrations against the Russian invasion and in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., Meanwhile, amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, multiple destructive acts targeting property owned by Russian citizens and the Russian state were recorded in Italy last week. In Castiglioncello, an unknown perpetrator threw a Molotov cocktail at a private villa belonging to a Russian couple, while a Ukrainian man sprayed the entrance of the Russian embassy in Rome with red paint (ANSA, 11 April 2022)., While anti-war protests dropped significantly in Russia last week following police interventions and attacks against anti-war activists in recent weeks, demonstrations in support of Russian troops continued. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation and regional authorities organized a series of events in support of the Russian troops, including concerts, motor rallies, and demonstrations. These events were attended mainly by public sector employees and state university students, with reports that some universities and their students were pressured to participate (RFE/RL, 15 April 2022). Meanwhile, in Germany, hundreds of pro-Moscow supporters took to the streets in several cities last week to show support for Russian operations in Ukraine and protest discrimination against Russian speakers in Germany as a result of the ongoing war (Merkur, 11 April 2022). In Ireland, a pro-Russian motorcade took place in Dublin, with cars carrying Russian flags and one of them bearing a ‘Z,’ a symbol of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Independent, 11 April 2022)., In Sweden, violent demonstrations erupted last week after far-right Danish-Swedish activist Rasmus Paludan and his far-right party, the Hard Line (Stram Kurs, in Danish), burned a copy of the Quran during an anti-Islamic demonstration in Rinkeby. Violent demonstrations against the burning took place in cities where the far-right group planned further anti-Islamic events, including Rinkeby, Stockholm, Linköping, Norrköping, and Örebro. Rioters pelted police officers with stones and set fire to vehicles, including police and emergency services vehicles. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested, while 40 people were injured, including 26 police officers, and 20 police vehicles were destroyed (BBC, 18 August 2022). A previous Quran burning carried out by Paludan in August 2020 also led to the outbreak of violent demonstrations in Malmö., On the border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, a deadly armed clash broke out between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards near Maksat village in the disputed Barken region last week. One Tajik border guard was fatally wounded in the clash, which reportedly broke out when Tajik border guards crossed the border into Kyrgyz territory (RFE/RL, 12 April 2022). During the clashes, Tajik border guards also reportedly fired mortars at Dostuk village in Kyrgyzstan. The border clash triggered the displacement of about 17,000 Kyrgyz villagers from the Leylek district of the Batken region (24Kg, 13 April 2022). The latest escalation follows fighting in the border region in January that left 12 Kyrgyz citizens wounded., In France, the first round of presidential elections on 10 April prompted demonstration activity and violence in several locations last week. Demonstrators took to the streets in several cities against the outcome of the first round of elections, in which no candidate won a majority of votes, with police deploying tear gas against demonstrators on several occasions. Meanwhile, unknown perpetrators broke a window of the Republicans party headquarters in Besancon and a window of the French Communist Party headquarters in Paris.​​ The two frontrunners of the 10 April vote, incumbent French President Emmanuel Macron and far-right National Rally (RN) party president Marine Le Pen, will go to a run-off election on 24 April (BBC, 18 April 2022)., Meanwhile, in Germany, police seized weapons and arrested four people linked to far-right and anti-coronavirus movements last week. Police accused them of planning attacks targeting the state, including the abduction of the German health minister and attacks against the country’s power supply facilities. The four allegedly belonged to a right-wing extremist chat group on Telegram, self-identifying as “United Patriots” (DW, 14 April 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-9-15-april-2022
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet DEC aid workers as Ukraine appeal reaches £300 million and charities lay out response plans,News and Press Release,DEC,"Food and Nutrition

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Apr 2022,"The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to its London offices today as it was announced that the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal had raised over £300 million., The Duke and Duchess met the DEC’s Chief Executive Saleh Saeed as well as aid workers who have recently returned from Ukraine and neighbouring countries where 5 million refugees have fled. They also spoke to staff on the ground in Ukraine via video link to get a clearer picture of the current situation and hear about how aid is helping people in need. They also heard how the crisis in Ukraine is having far reaching consequences in other countries by driving up food prices., The visit came as the 13 member charities of the DEC that are responding to the crisis laid out their plans for their response over the first six months. Many charities started spending funds immediately and these plans now give a more detailed account of how DEC charities plan to spend money up until the end of August – although as the situation is so fluid that they may be adjusted to suit the needs on the ground. A full summary and examples are included below., Speaking to the Duke and Duchess via video link from Kyiv, Rachael Cummings, Health Lead for Save the Children in Ukraine said: “What the DEC funds have meant is that we’ve been able to significantly scale up our existing work in the country. We’re building our response to providing mobile health units, trauma kits, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, nutrition support and safe drinking water to respond to this crisis. We’re particularly concerned about the devastating effect on children and these funds mean that we can ensure that children receive high quality care and support now, and in the months ahead.”, Vanessa Maynard, Programmes and Operations Officer for Christian Aid, who was at the DEC’s offices, told the Duke and Duchess: “I’ve just returned from Hungary where with DEC funds we’ve been responding rapidly through our existing network of local partners. We’re helping integrate refugees into the communities by supporting them with group cash so they can decide for themselves how best to address their specific needs like buying nappies, paying rent for the lodgings in host communities, or even pet food as many have fled with their animals as they couldn’t bear to leave without them. We’re also providing them with hot meals, temporary rest in community centres, safe spaces for children to receive trauma care, and information on their rights when they arrive in the host countries.”, Vital fundraising efforts are ongoing with donations continuing to come in and individuals, companies, schools and arts organisations raising money for the appeal. The £300 million total includes £25 million of match funding from the UK Government., DEC Chief Executive Saleh Saeed said: “DEC charities have been quickly and efficiently scaling up their work to help people inside Ukraine and refugees fleeing over the border. We are seeing the real impact of the work they are doing, whether that is incubators for babies born under bombardment in Ukraine or vital protection work to ensure that vulnerable refugees are kept safe as they flee the conflict., “We are incredibly grateful to the generous British public, to all the inspiring people and organisations that continue to do all they can to support people affected by this devastating conflict. We have seen everything from homemade badges sold in village shops to beautiful limited-edition artwork and of course, the Concert for Ukraine, which was broadcast not only nationally, but inside Ukraine as people watched the visible display of support from laptops in underground bunkers. It feels as though everyone is doing their bit and more.”, Summary of planned spending from DEC charities in first six months, DEC charities have so far budgeted £75 million to spend over the first six months of the response. Funds from the appeal will be spent over a period of three years to meet the ongoing needs of people affected by the conflict. Below is a summary of their planned expenditure, although these plans may be adjusted to meet changing needs on the ground., Examples of DEC-funded projects:, Inside Ukraine, In neighbouring countries, ENDS, Notes to editors:, Media enquiries please call 020 7387 0200 or 07930 999 014 (out of hours)., Spokespeople available in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and the UK.  For more information or to request interviews in advance please contact: bguiton@dec.org.uk, Via a video link from Ukraine the Duke and Duchess met Giuliano Stochino Weiss, emergency response lead for Hungarian Interchurch Aid, one of Christian Aid’s partners, Rachael Cummings, Health lead for Save the Children and Alexander Matheou, International Federation Red Cross (IFRC) Special Representative to Ukraine, leading the response to the crisis. IFRC are funded by DEC member charity British Red Cross., In the DEC’s offices the Duke and Duchess met humanitarian experts including Diana Hiscock, Humanitarian Inclusion Advisor for HelpAge International (DEC member charity Age International’s partner), just back from Moldova, Vanessa Maynard, Programme Operations and Quality Officer for Christian Aid, just back from Ukraine and Hungary and Bethan Lewis Head of Disaster Risk Management, Plan International UK, who will give an overview of the impact of the Ukraine crisis on other humanitarian issues and crises around the world., About the DEC: The DEC brings together 15 leading UK aid charities at times of crisis overseas to raise funds quickly and efficiently.

IAEA Chief Grossi to Head Assistance Mission to Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant Next Week,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,22 Apr 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, will head an expert mission to Ukraine's Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) next week to step up efforts to help prevent the danger of a nuclear accident during the current conflict in the country., The team of IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards staff will be in Chornobyl from 26 April to deliver vital equipment and conduct radiological and other assessments at the site, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks before they withdrew on 31 March., ""The IAEA's presence at Chornobyl will be of paramount importance for our activities to support Ukraine as it seeks to restore regulatory control of the plant and ensure its safe and secure operation,"" Director General Grossi said. ""It will be followed by more IAEA missions to this and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine in the coming weeks."", The Director General travelled to another key Ukrainian nuclear site last month -- the South Ukraine NPP -- to start the implementation of the IAEA's assistance initiative aimed at reducing the risk of a major nuclear accident that could have severe consequences for both human health and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond., Since the beginning of the conflict in late February, Director General Grossi has expressed grave concern about the safety and security of Ukraine's nuclear facilities. He has also stressed the IAEA's commitment and readiness to help ensure that the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring safety and security are adhered to. Several of them -- including the physical integrity of facilities, the ability of operational staff to work without undue pressure, and the access to off-site power -- have been seriously compromised over the past two months. In March, for example, the Chornobyl NPP lost both external communications and off-site power, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days., During its first such mission to Chornobyl, the IAEA will provide the operator with different types of radiation monitoring equipment, including radionuclide identification devices and gamma dose rate meters. Personal protective equipment will also be delivered to the plant., ""Based on our scientific measurements and technical evaluations, we will be able to better understand the radiological situation there,"" Director General Grossi said., In addition, IAEA safeguards experts will repair remote safeguards monitoring systems installed at the site, which stopped transmitting data to the Agency's headquarters in Vienna at the start of the conflict., Since the withdrawal of the Russian military from the Chornobyl NPP, Ukraine has taken significant steps for the safe and secure operation of the site of the 1986 accident, where various radioactive waste management facilities are now located. It has carried out the first rotation of staff in three weeks, and earlier this week it re-established direct communications between the NPP and the nuclear regulator that had been down for more than a month., But the general situation in the area around the site known as the Exclusion Zone remains difficult, in part due to damaged bridges and de-mining activities, Ukraine told the IAEA this week., As he did at the South Ukraine NPP, Director General Grossi will meet with staff at Chornobyl to thank them in person for their courage, resilience, and determination in carrying out their important work duties during extremely difficult circumstances. Unable to go home and rest for several weeks, many of them worked non-stop at the site when it was controlled by Russian forces., ""I look forward to being able to talk to the staff and to express my deep gratitude for everything they have achieved during such immensely stressful and challenging conditions. They have been through more than we can imagine, and they deserve our full respect and admiration for preserving the safety and security of the site despite the dire situation,"" he said., In close coordination with Ukraine, the IAEA has drawn up detailed plans for its safety and security assistance to the country's nuclear sites, which include fifteen reactors at four plants as well as the Chornobyl NPP, where the world's worst nuclear accident took place exactly 36 years ago on 26 April., ""Over the past two months, nuclear safety in Ukraine has been seriously jeopardised on several occasions. So far, the worst-case scenario has been avoided. But we need to intensify our efforts to make sure that remains the case. The IAEA will do everything it can to help prevent the conflict from also leading to a nuclear accident, in addition to the vast human suffering and major destruction it has already caused,"" Director General Grossi said., Over the past several decades, the IAEA has provided support for the decommissioning and radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel management at Chornobyl., ""The IAEA knows the Chornobyl NPP very well. This local knowledge -- coupled with our nuclear safety, security and safeguards expertise -- means that we can quickly establish exactly what needs to be done, and how and where,"" Director General Grossi said., The Director General is expected to hold a press conference upon his return to Vienna on Thursday.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-chief-grossi-head-assistance-mission-ukraine-s-chornobyl-nuclear-power-plant

Please read more about next week’s mission here., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant new developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours, Director General Grossi said., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said it was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-60-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-22-april-2022
Bachelet urges respect for international humanitarian law amid growing evidence of war crimes in Ukraine,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,22 Apr 2022,"GENEVA (22 April 2022) – The Russian invasion nearly two months ago has plunged Ukraine into a human rights and humanitarian crisis that has devastated the lives of civilians throughout the country and beyond, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Friday, as she called for all parties to respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law, in particular the rules governing the conduct of hostilities., “Over these eight weeks, international humanitarian law has not merely been ignored but seemingly tossed aside,” Bachelet said., Russian armed forces have indiscriminately shelled and bombed populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, actions that may amount to war crimes., “What we saw in Government-controlled Kramatorsk on 8 April when cluster sub-munitions hit the railway station, killing 60 civilians and injuring 111 others, is emblematic of the failure to adhere to the principle of distinction, the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks and the principle of precaution enshrined in international humanitarian law,” Bachelet said., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has also documented what appears to be the use of weapons with indiscriminate effects, causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects, by Ukrainian armed forces in the east of the country., Since 24 February to midnight on 20 April, HRMMU has documented and verified 5,264 civilian casualties – 2,345 killed and 2,919 injured. Of these, 92.3 per cent (2,266 killed and 2,593 injured) were recorded in Government-controlled territory. Some 7.7 per cent of casualties (79 killed and 326 injured) were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk regions controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., “We know the actual numbers are going to be much higher as the horrors inflicted in areas of intense fighting, such as Mariupol, come to light,” the UN Human Rights Chief said., “The scale of summary executions of civilians in areas previously occupied by Russian forces are also emerging. The preservation of evidence and decent treatment of mortal remains must be ensured, as well as psychological and other relief for victims and their relatives,” Bachelet added., During a mission to Bucha on 9 April, UN human rights officers documented the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians., “Almost every resident in Bucha our colleagues spoke to told us about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. We know much more needs to be done to uncover what happened there and we also know Bucha is not an isolated incident,” said the High Commissioner., HRMMU has received more than 300 allegations of killings of civilians in towns in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all under the control of Russian armed forces in late February and early March., Wilful killing of protected persons, including summary executions, are gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law, and amount to war crimes., HRMMU is also documenting the devastating consequences of the conflict on a range of other human rights, including the right to health. To date, it has recorded 114 attacks on medical establishments, although the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher. The disruption of medical care has also seen the general mortality rate among civilians increase in a number of besieged towns and cities., “We estimate that at least 3,000 civilians have died because they couldn’t get medical care and because of the stress on their health amid the hostilities. This includes being forced by Russian armed forces to stay in basements or not being allowed to leave their homes for days or weeks,” said Bachelet., Allegations of sexual violence against women, men, girls and boys by members of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine have increasingly surfaced. HRMMU has received 75 allegations from across the country, although the majority are from the Kyiv region. HRMMU is looking into each allegation, although this remains challenging as survivors may not be willing or able to be interviewed., Detention of civilians has become a widespread practice in areas controlled by the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Since 24 February, HRMMU has recorded 155 such cases, including of local officials, journalists, activists, human rights defenders, and others. Some were reportedly tortured or ill-treated, left without food or water, or held in overcrowded improvised facilities. Five victims of enforced disappearances were subsequently found dead., HRMMU has also received information about alleged arbitrary and incommunicado detentions by Ukrainian forces or people aligned with them. In some cases, relatives do not have information about where their loved ones are, raising serious concerns regarding enforced disappearance, compliance with due process and the risk of torture and ill-treatment., “Our work to date has detailed a horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians. First and foremost, this senseless war must stop. But as the fighting shows no sign of abating, it is vital that all parties to the conflict give clear instructions to their combatants to strictly respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law,” Bachelet said., “This means distinguishing between civilian and military objects. It means not targeting or deliberately killing civilians. It means not committing sexual violence. People, including prisoners of war, must not be tortured. Civilians, prisoners and others hors de combat must be treated humanely,” she stressed, noting the reports of torture, ill-treatment and summary executions committed by all belligerent parties. There are numerous videos put out by both sides available online apparently depicting intimidation, interrogation, torture and even killing of prisoners of war., “Those in command of armed forces must make it clear to their fighters that anyone found to have been involved in such violations will be prosecuted and held accountable,” Bachelet said. “I call on the parties to the conflict to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law allegedly committed by their nationals, armed forces and affiliated armed groups, in line with their obligations under international law.”, ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact: Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org or Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or Lori Brumat - + 41 22 928 9149 / lori.brumat@un.org, Tag and share Twitter @UNHumanRights Facebook unitednationshumanrights Instagram @unitednationshumanrights",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/bachelet-urges-respect-international-humanitarian-law-amid-growing-evidence-war

Sustaining HIV services for people who use drugs in Odesa,News and Press Release,UNAIDS,HIV/Aids,22 Apr 2022,"Odesa is a major Black Sea port in Ukraine where the first outbreak of drug use and HIV infection in the 1990s brought about the beginning of the HIV epidemic in Ukraine., Today Odesa has one of the most efficient systems of harm reduction services for people who use drugs funded by the state and local budgets and implemented jointly with non-governmental and community organizations. Odesa was one of the first cities in Eastern Europe and Central Asia that signed the Paris Declaration and last year reported a reduction of new HIV cases among people who use drugs., Natalia Kitsenko is head of the public health department of the Road to Home Foundation. This is one of Odesa’s oldest organizations providing services to people who use drugs. She shared with UNAIDS how her organization has been coping since the start of the war in Ukraine., Question: Natalia, what is the situation in Odesa right now?, Answer: In general, the situation is under control, facilities are periodically shelled, air raids occur several times a day, but all the main services of the city are functioning. Nothing is like before the war, of course, and there is a curfew., Question: Did many people flee Odesa?, Answer: Yes, many left, mostly women and children. We are an exception. In our organization of 60 employees, 4 people left because they have small children. The rest stayed and we are actively continuing our usual work and also providing emergency assistance to women with children and elderly people fleeing from other cities—Mykolaiv, Kherson, Mariupol and Kharkiv. We mostly provide transportation to the Moldova border and connect them with volunteers who then help them in the country or in another destination depending on their needs., We also prepare food such as pies and dumplings for refugees and territorial defense groups. This whole situation has united us; I have seen a lot of mutual support around., Question: How many people from your harm reduction program have left the city?, Answer: Our coverage in Odesa and surrounding region includes about 20,000 people per year. As far as we know only 7 clients have fled abroad. Some of our clients have gone into the local territorial defense groups. Others have taken part in building protective structures, which involves collecting bags of sand and transporting them to protect streets and monuments. The rest remain with us, getting the services they need. We had an influx of people who use drugs from other regions of Ukraine where conditions are far worse., Question: What services does your organization offer to people who use drugs?, Answer: First of all the basic harm reduction package which we provide under the state budget includes consultations, HIV prevention (syringes, condoms, wipes, lubricants, etc.); HIV testing, and TB screening. Among clients who have used these services for a long time, the detection rate of HIV infection is 0.02%. Among new clients who have just joined the programme, it reaches up to 7%. We set up a client recruitment model with the Alliance for Public Health coordination using the Global Fund Grant and ECDC support. Basically we encourage people who use drugs to bring their close friends to our community centres for testing. This is an important aspect because new clients, especially young people, those who recently started using drugs, are a very difficult group to reach. They hide their use and try to stay invisible. This recruitment system allows us to attract them to our harm reduction services, and first of all to testing. Management of new cases, support for diagnosis and receiving antiretroviral therapy, screening, and follow-up for tuberculosis is also provided through donor funding, in particular the PEPFAR project., Question: Have you gotten additional funds?, Answer: Yes. We just received additional funding from the UNAIDS Emergency Fund to purchase medicines, dressings and hygiene products for our clients. This is a very timely and essential help because many medical products like Fluconazole (antibiotic) are not affordable to our clients and they are not widely available anymore., Question: Natalia, you have been working in the HIV field for more than 20 years, have attitudes changed regarding people living with HIV and drug users?, Answer: In my opinion, the level of stigma and discrimination and the overall attitude toward our clients in medical settings and from health workers has changed dramatically. However, we still experience problems with the general population. People do not want to have our syringe exchange points and community centers near their houses. And they don't want to see people near them who can threaten their comfort, well-being and safety. This can be understood; so we try to explain to them why we are here, how these syringe exchange points and community centers work and we organise outings and sessions to explain the reality that people face. We must continually prove and demonstrate our worth in order to deliver services and keep the epidemics of HIV, TB and hepatitis under control., Ironically since the war started we provide shelter to people who live by our centres. As our syringe exchange points are usually in basements, when the sirens sound the neighbors come to us; and that means being in close contact with people living with HIV or people who use drugs., Question: What are the most pressing issues for you now?, Answer: At the moment we are experiencing difficulties in providing our customers with Naloxone, which can prevent drug overdoses. Although we are constantly working on counseling and informing people about signs of overdosing, with the war going on overdoses have increased. And because Naloxone is manufactured in the heavily bombed city of Kharkiv we have no more. We need it in any form, preferably ready-made, intranasal or injectable, as this would save many lives. And we need to sustain HIV services for people who use drugs together with providing them with urgent humanitarian aid.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sustaining-hiv-services-people-who-use-drugs-odesa
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 21 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,22 Apr 2022,"Date: 22 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 21 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 5,381 civilian casualties in the country: 2,435 killed and 2,946 injured. This included:, a total of 2,435 killed (746 men, 469 women, 48 girls, and 66 boys, as well as 70 children and 1,036 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,946 injured (345 men, 274 women, 62 girls, and 67 boys, as well as 157 children and 2,041 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,439 casualties (1,012 killed and 1,427 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,942 casualties (1,423 killed and 1,519 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 22 April (local time), 208 children had been killed and 386 injured., _________________________________________, An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 20 April 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 21 April only, as during these days OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 21 April have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-21-april-2022-enruuk

Complementary Information Note - Ukraine: Land Tenure Role in Building Back Better (April 2022),News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",22 Apr 2022,"The unfolding war in Ukraine has led to destruction of life and property, food insecurity and human rights violations. It also has immediate land access and tenure dimensions, including key land and geospatial information aspects., A. Land tenure and armed conflict, Armed conflict can lead to disintegration of property rights, and the importance of property, land, homeland, and territory to the cause and conduct of conflict presents particular dilemmas for a peace process. An end to armed conflict, especially prolonged civil conflict, creates a situation whereby a significant proportion of the affected population will begin to claim, re-claim, or access properties, lands, and land-based resources. The result is that land and property rights issues can be thrust to centre stage over large geographic areas in a short period of time for considerable numbers of people. And like the complex histories involving property, land, and territory that lead to conflict scenarios, post-war re-establishment of ownership, use, and access rights will likewise be complicated and problematic. Left unattended, land and property issues can provide significant potential for renewed confrontation. In order to address land tenure adequately it important to take into consideration the relevant questions to relevant to emergency, infrastructure and policy development and implementation phases (see annex)., FAO has provided technical assistance to improving access to land in a number of countries emerging from violent conflict within the context of food security, poverty alleviation and rural development. While every conflict situation is likely to be different, they nevertheless share a number of common characteristics. Attempting to address only pre-conflict territory, land, and property issues in a peace process (especially in a peace accord) can miss the very volatile tenure issues on the ground which develop during conflict, and which are most operative at the close of a conflict. While such issues can build upon pre-conflict tenure problems, they nonetheless act to thrust the post-conflict lands situation in new directions. This is primarily because the social and spatial repercussions of violence, dislocation, destruction of property, battlefield victory and loss, and food insecurity, together with the breakdown of administrative, enforcement, and other property-related institutions and norms, significantly alter ongoing relationships between people(s), land uses, production systems, and population patterns. Armed conflict and its repercussions reconfigure the network of social relations upon which all land tenure systems depend., FAO’s Land Tenure experience has observed that providing secure access to land is frequently not easy, and it is particularly complex in situations following violent conflicts: getting the answer right can go directly to the matter of achieving sustainable peace. The effects of violent conflicts are usually widespread in a country but they can be particularly severe in rural areas. Violent conflict in rural areas can result in vast numbers of people being displaced. Rural areas often lack access roads and other infrastructure and services, and their absence hampers the establishment of good governance during the transition to peace. Following conflicts, access to land in rural areas is required by those displaced. Of particular importance in such an environment is the recognition of the vulnerable which invariably include women and children, and may also include ethnic or political minorities and small scale farmers / family farming., While involving in land tenure issues is of lower priority in the emergency phase, tenure and land information have an essential role and should be at the centre in the recovery, reconstruction and prevention of such human-induced hazards in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/complementary-information-note-ukraine-land-tenure-role-building-back-better-april

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Apr 2022,"People in Need has delivered humanitarian aid to the devastated cities of Bucha, Irpin, and Chernihiv. In the east of Ukraine, we are distributing water and hygiene kits; in the west, we are distributing cash assistance. We have expanded our team in Ukraine from 111 to 142 staff members who are working directly in the affected areas., We are actively helping Ukrainians here, in half of the regions of the Czech Republic. We have distributed € 1,5 million to Czech aid organisations; we have extended the operating hours of the helpline for Ukrainians, and we are helping with the accommodation of refugees and the schooling of their children., Through donations to People in Need's SOS Ukraine Emergency Appeal, we have provided €14,4 million (351 142 082 CZK) worth of aid to the victims of the war since Russia invaded. Donors have contributed €68,5 million (€68 561 238 precisely) to the emergency appeal. Our appeal has provided €12,7 million worth of aid directly on-the-ground in Ukraine. Please read the latest summary of our efforts to assist victims of the war both in Ukraine and the Czech Republic., HELP FOR BUCHA, IRPIN AND CHERNIHIV, WE HAVE DELIVERED TRAINS AND TRUCKS FILLED WITH HUMANITARIAN AID TOTALING €10 291 287 TO UKRAINE., With the support of local volunteers and the Most (Bridge) organisation, we have transported humanitarian aid from the Czech Republic to areas around Kyiv, especially those from where the Russian army has withdrawn, namely: Bucha, Irpin, and Chernihiv. This aid consisted largely of food, water, and hygiene supplies., In the last week , we have dispatched thirteen trucks to the country's east. Two trucks with aid arrived in Kharkiv, two more in Zaporizhzhia, and the same number in Sumy; we have also delivered seven tonnes of food to the Luhansk region., Due to the fighting, there are currently six million people in Ukraine without access to water. Thus, we continue to distribute water in the east. For example, we are resupplying the Mykolaiv region, where we have already sent six trucks filled with water containers. Three trucks delivered 5-litre barrels. In the last load, we distributed 20 litres of drinking water per person, covering the weekly need for 7,000 people ., The shelling of Ukrainian railways and the complications of coordinating rail transport inside Ukraine have hampered our train assistance. “Unfortunately, with the Russian attacks on the Ukrainian railway in recent days, security for our trains has become more difficult, and train check-in is taking longer. However, we plan to continue to deliver aid by rail in combination with truck transport,” says Zuzana Steppanová, Head of Logistics at People in Need., We are preparing to distribute cash assistance to 18,900 people, Next week, we will start distributing financial aid in the form of cash assistance to 18,900 selected people in western Ukraine. We want to support the most vulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities., ""Cash assistance gives people the opportunity to decide what the money is best used for. We then prevent people from selling what they don't need below cost and allowing them to choose what to buy,"" says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for the Eastern Partnership countries at People in Need. Petr notes that this assistance is only possible in places where the market continues to work. Beneficiaries of the cash assistance scheme will receive the equivalent of about €70 a month, and this aid will also be combined with a housing allowance., In addition to financial assistance, we are also equipping collective centres for IDPs in western Ukraine. ""The quality of these centres varies greatly. Some are in good condition, but often they are schools or even wedding halls. These places need to be equipped so that people can live there temporarily,"" says Petr Drbohlav. Over the past week, we delivered bedding, mattresses, and other equipment to various collective centres. Last week we also started equipping the first collective centres in the Vinnytsia region., We have been working in Ukraine since the first Russian invasion in 2014. Since the second Russian invasion of February this year, we have recruited a further 31 new colleagues and currently have 142 staff directly assisting people in Ukraine., People in Need's work in Ukraine is funded by institutional donors such as the European Union through ECHO, the United States government through BHA, the Canadian government through GAC, UN agencies, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the King Baudouin Foundation, Stichting Vluchteling, and partner organisations from Alliance 2015, CARE and Oxfam., ""Thanks to the fact that People in Need was one of the first organisations to start helping directly in Ukraine on a large scale, many reputable organisations that want to support our work entrust us with funds,"" explains Jan Mrkvička, Director of the Humanitarian and Development Section of People in Need. ""Thanks to this, we will be able to help immediately and in the longer term,"" adds Mrkvička., IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, WE ARE HELPING UKRAINIANS IN HALF OF ALL CZECH REGIONS WE HAVE PROVIDED AID WORTH A TOTAL OF €1,68 MILLION TO ORGANISATIONS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, In the Czech Republic, new needs are developing due to the refugee influx from Ukraine. Our people continue to provide social assistance, counselling, and material and financial support. We also help with the education of Ukrainian children and Czech and Ukrainian educators, assistance with longer-term forms of housing, support for municipalities and the pursuit of systemic change., We are analysing the placement of refugees across the Czech Republic. We seek to understand where there are places with large numbers of Ukrainian citizens to facilitate the creation of a network of new advisors for this target group., In supporting our efforts to aid Ukrainians in the Czech Republic, we have thirty-two new colleagues. Those who speak Ukrainian make our assistance more efficient. ""We have created educational support for the new team to get them oriented on topics such as temporary protection (as a form of asylum), housing, health care, etc. We are also preparing psychosocial support for them because encountering the stories of their compatriots' can be emotionally stressful for them,"" says Head of Social Services Katerina Dosoudilova. Whilst we have worked previously with a focus on groups, we are now starting to focus on individual social work and support., The Refugee Helpline handles 40 cases a day, The PIN counselling centre also includes a Ukrainian Helpline, where Ukrainian-speaking counsellors are available at +420 770 600 800. Last week, the helpline extended its weekday opening hours to remain open until 10 pm., ""We get about forty inquiries a day. In addition to the new arrivals (refugees) who call us, with whom we often deal with housing, we are also contacted by people who have housed refugees temporarily. Now they are looking for what to do with them, and they don't find much in the offers,"" says Daniel Hůle, an expert on social inclusion. The phone counsellors are assisted by other workers who search for the information they need and make the necessary calls. Given the total number of hours worked by the people who process one request, these often resemble full consultations., We are providing material and financial assistance to those in need The need amongst displaced Ukrainians for material and financial assistance remains high. Our assistance goes directly to refugees who need to translate official documents or pay for travel. In case of emergency, we help with food aid. We have also financially supported local food banks. We continue to provide financial support to other aid organisations. We have already distributed €1,5 million. We have supported an adaptation centre for Ukrainian children, a centre for mothers with children, direct work with refugees and psychosocial assistance., We support a long-term housing plan, Based on the results of the analysis of the current placement of refugees and the Ukrainian minority in the Czech Republic, we propose a meaningful relocation in a way that makes sense not only in terms of housing availability but also in terms of job opportunities and school capacity. We also consider the situations in the poorest localities to ensure that we do not increase the burden on them., Support for the education of Ukrainian children and the support and education of Czech teachers We are organising several adaptation groups, specifically in Bílina and Pilsen. In Ústí nad Labem and Přerov, we are participating in work in children's groups. We are also preparing a crash course in conversational Ukrainian for staff., Across the Czech Republic, we are helping children and students with registration for kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools. In certain places, we also help Ukrainians find and join leisure groups., In addition, we are collaborating with Mall TV to prepare videos for parents, teachers and the broader public on respectful communication with Ukrainian classmates and others, emphasising mutual respect., Countering Russian propaganda, In the context of the massive propaganda and media manipulations surrounding the invasion of Ukraine, we have prepared two new and complex audio-visual lessons for schools. We are also continuing with our regular Studio JSNS, where pupils and students can ask questions live on-air to journalists, psychologists, and representatives of aid organisations about the war in Ukraine., IN MOLDOVA, WE ARE SUPPORTING NON-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS WITH AID WORTH €123,000 € 190,000 IN TOTAL AID IN FOR MOLDOVA AND ROMANIA, In Moldova—a country with one of the lowest GDP’s in Europe—we work in thirteen regions across the country. We have financially supported seventeen non-profit organisations with aid totalling €120,000. For example, the non-profit organisation ROMNI not only helps Roma materially but also offers legal services. In addition to helping NGOs, we are also helping Moldovan households that have housed refugees. Each household will receive a one-off grant of €185.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/people-need-has-provided-144-million-worth-aid-victims-war-ukraine-we-have-delivered

Water Sanitation Hygiene",22 Apr 2022,"This report is produced by OCHA Ukraine in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the period from 12:00 p.m. on 18 April to 12:00 p.m. on 21 April. The next report will be issued on or around 26 April., HIGHLIGHTS, • Eastern and southern parts of Ukraine continue to face the fiercest fighting, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis. As intense fighting and airstrikes continue to cause civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure across the country, the duration of martial law in Ukraine was extended until 25 May 2022., • According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 600,000 additional people were internally displaced in the first 17 days of April, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to 7.7 million. In total, nearly 12.8 million have been displaced internally or across borders since 24 February., • On 21 April, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine released a new US$50 million allocation from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF), the largest allocation of the Fund to date., • As of 21 April, the UN and its humanitarian partners have reached over 3.4 million people across Ukraine, including over 917,000 in Kharkivska oblast (east), more than 410,000 in Kyivska oblast (north), nearly 350,000 in Lvivska oblast (west) and over 218,000 in Zakarpatska oblast (west)., • The fifth UN-led inter-agency humanitarian convoy reached Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north) on 20 April. The convoy delivered nine trucks of critical relief supplies for more than 13,800 people in Chernihiv and nearby communities, which will be distributed by the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and their local partners., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. Over the reporting period, the hostilities continued to be concentrated in eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, primarily in eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts. As intense fighting and airstrikes continue to cause civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, the Parliament of Ukraine extended the duration of martial law for another month until 25 May 2022. While some provisions under martial law have been eased, the ban on leaving the country for men aged 18 to 60 years old remains in place., The civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive has now surpassed the 5,000 mark. As of 20 April, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 5,264, including 2,345 killed and 2,919 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and airstrikes. OHCHR believes the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration., Economic impact and food security. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its latest World Economic, has predicted a 35 per cent decrease in Ukraine’s economy this year and that the ongoing war would also negatively impact global commodity markets, trade and financial channels. Further, IMF reported that it could not forecast the situation in Ukraine beyond “a very strong recession” in 2022 because of the unusually high degree of uncertainty. IMF stressed that even if the war ended soon, the displacement and loss of people, as well as the destruction of physical capital, would seriously hamper economic activity for many years to come. Meanwhile, IMF forecasts that the Russian Federation’s gross domestic product would only decrease by 8.5 per cent this year and then a further 2.3 per cent in 2023. Further, IMF concluded that, beyond the immediate humanitarian impacts, the war in Ukraine would severely set back the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, slowing growth and increasing inflation even further., Separately, on 19 April, IMF announced that its Executive Board had approved the establishment of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help countries build resilience to such external shocks as the war in Ukraine and to ensure sustainable growth contributing to their long-term balance of payments stability. IMF said about three-quarters of its membership would be eligible for longer-term affordable financing from RST, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and lower-middle-income countries., The UN, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), has likewise been warning about how the worsening conflict negatively impacts the economy and livelihoods, food prices, and food security in Ukraine and around the world. On 19 April, FAO renewed its appeal to bolster agriculture and provide urgent support to vulnerable rural households, specifying that more than $115 million is urgently needed to assist Ukrainian farmers and rural households through December 2022. It said the funding would help prevent further deterioration of the food insecurity situation and worsen the disruption of food supply chains in Ukraine. There is an urgency to support Ukrainian farmers in planting vegetables and potatoes during this spring season, and farmers should be allowed and supported to go to their fields and save the winter wheat harvest. FAO has estimated that one-third of Ukrainian crops and agricultural land may not be harvested or cultivated in 2022., Eastern Ukraine. On 19 April, Geneva-based NGO ACAPS released a thematic report on “The Humanitarian Situation in Donetska, Kharkivska, and Luhanska Oblasts” that concludes in part that the three eastern oblasts have recorded around 50 per cent of all reported conflict events in Ukraine since 24 February. Together with high access constraints, the situation has led to severe information gaps around the needs and living conditions of people remaining in those oblasts. Access dynamics vary there and depend on the degree of active conflict, divided control over the territories, damage to roads and critical infrastructure, and landmine contamination. The humanitarian situation in areas of heavy conflict and shelling is dire, with civilians forced to find shelter and endure frequent electricity, heating, telecommunication and water cuts resulting from damage to critical infrastructure. Active hostilities drastically reduce the mobility of people and goods, threaten civilian lives, restrict aid delivery and prevent humanitarians from accessing people in need of life-saving aid. ACAPS added that the renewed hostilities starting around 18 April would likely only further negatively impact Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts. There are also concerns over international humanitarian law violations as related reports emerge from areas previously affected by intense fighting in the country., Northern Ukraine. Based on imagery collected on 31 March 2022 and 20 February 2022 by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT), analysts found that 147 structures in Bucha (Kyivska oblast) sustained damage visible in the satellite imagery. Out of these, 19 are destroyed, 72 severely damaged, 27 moderately damaged and 29 possibly damaged. This includes three health facilities. UNOSAT also reports that 77 per cent of Horenka, 71 per cent of Irpin, and 58 per cent of Hostomel city area (all in Kyivska oblast) suffered damage and destruction. In addition, around 1.4 per cent of the western part of Kyiv suffered significant damage., Western Ukraine. World Vision has released its Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) for people displaced from northern and eastern Ukraine conducted in Chernivtsi (Chernivetska oblast, west) from 6 to 8 April. Among the results, 85 per cent of assessed households said they did not plan to leave Ukraine, 95 per cent were staying in IDP centres, 68 per cent of families had not left anyone behind, and 31 per cent did leave family members behind – mainly adult men. Only 19 per cent of respondents reported being able to afford basic items, 41 per cent said they could afford most, 37 per cent only some and 3 per cent could meet none of their basic needs. On priorities in the following one-to-two weeks, 23 per cent of respondents said that it was affordable shelter, 21 per cent mentioned food, and 13 per cent finding work. Within the following one-to-two months, food was named as the priority by 46 per cent, affordable shelter by 37 per cent, clothing and shoes by 32 per cent, and finding work by 30 per cent of respondents., Displacement. According to IOM, 600,000 additional people were internally displaced in the first 17 days of April, bringing the total number of IDPs to 7.7 million. IOM estimates that 2.8 million have returned to their homes following earlier displacement, with an average length of displacement of 30 days. These returns may be both temporary or permanent. Moreover, 15 per cent of current IDPs plan to return to their homes in the next two weeks, mainly heading to Kyiv and the northern parts of the country. In addition, as of 20 April, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) informs that nearly 5.1 million people have crossed international borders since 24 February., The Ukrainian Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories reported that no evacuation routes from heavily-affected areas had been agreed on between 18 and 19 April (for the second and third consecutive days), while the hostilities reportedly continue to intensify in eastern Ukraine. That meant no agreements were reached to allow civilians to leave Mariupol (Donetska oblast). Nevertheless, on 20 April, four buses reportedly did pass through an evacuation corridor from Mariupol, according to the Deputy Prime Minister/Reintegration Minister of Ukraine. Even though a humanitarian corridor reportedly did not operate as agreed, four buses reportedly left the city bound for Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east). Also, reportedly, humanitarian corridors were expected to be opened on 21 April and allow for more evacuations from Mariupol and Khersonska oblast (south)., Separately, the Russian Federation reported that, since 24 February, more than 908,900 people, including more than 166,000 children, have crossed into its territory. The UN does not have the means to verify the number of people who crossed international borders reported by the UN Member States. At the same time, as of 20 April, UNHCR estimates that over 563,000 people have sought refuge in the Russian Federation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-21-april-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",22 Apr 2022,"The Norwegian Refugee Council is deeply worried that intensified fighting in eastern Ukraine will lead to besiegement of entire cities and towns. The immense suffering and bloodshed that engulfed Mariupol may be senselessly repeated elsewhere, as the country marks two months of war., “The escalation of war in east Ukraine will result in horrific bloodshed and mass displacement from the eastern regions, including Luhansk and Donetsk, re-traumatising communities who have already suffered eight years of hostilities. In some places the escalation may also lead to entire cities being besieged,” warned Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), on a five-day visit to Ukraine., “It’s heart-breaking to think about the horrors these people are forced to relive, and to know that we are unable to get lifesaving assistance into many affected areas. We call for an immediate ceasefire to stop this tidal wave of human suffering.”, Several areas in eastern Ukraine are already on fire or completely in ruins. Communities in Luhansk and Donetsk regions are fully dependent on humanitarian aid as markets in the east have collapsed. While many younger people have been able to flee from several locations, there are tens of thousands of elderly – many of them disabled – who are trapped and unable or unwilling to leave., “This week we worked with local partners to deliver emergency food parcels to people trapped amid hostilities in multiple villages across eastern Ukraine. We now fear this may be the last food parcels they receive,” said Egeland., Full and unimpeded humanitarian access to all communities in the east, and elsewhere across Ukraine, is a matter of life-or-death. Civilians caught up in fighting must be enabled to leave voluntarily and safely in any direction they choose. Adequate security allowing civilians to evacuate from the hardest-hit areas is crucial., Humanitarian needs across Ukraine continue to skyrocket as the country marks two months of war on 24 April. One in four Ukrainians – have been forced to flee their homes in the fastest mass flight this century. Hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in areas of active hostilities without access to food or water. Thousands have been killed in several parts of the country because of the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas., NRC staff report that entire communities have experienced massive trauma, with children terrified of the slightest noise. Families lack everything from cancer medication to baby diapers. Homes, hospitals and roads have been destroyed all over Ukraine., A recent missile attack in the western city of Lviv highlights that even those areas considered relatively safe, are not. Lviv serves as the largest transit point for displaced people, and NRC operates there to provide assistance to people fleeing fighting., NRC has set up a lifeline of trucks bringing emergency food, shelter and hygiene kits across the border from Romania and Poland to some of the worst affected areas in eastern Ukraine. Our teams are working around the clock to deliver relief under extremely challenging circumstances., “Families in Ukraine have been living through hell on earth the past two months. Spiralling humanitarian needs are now outpacing the money that has been generously given by governments and individuals across the world. Aid agencies need more funding faster to scale up aid operations and respond to the ever-increasing needs across the country,” said Egeland., Facts and figures:, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:, Multimedia:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fears-besiegement-bloodshed-and-displacement-eastern-regions
"Ukraine: People with chronic diseases face massive challenges in accessing healthcare, according to new WHO survey",News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",22 Apr 2022,"One in three households home to at least one person with a chronic condition is unable to secure medication and care, L’viv, 22 April 2022, At the two-month mark of the war in Ukraine, a new WHO survey illustrates the devastating impact of the humanitarian emergency on the health and wellbeing of millions of civilians, and the severe challenges facing the Ukrainian health system., Preliminary results from an ongoing nationwide health needs assessment conducted in partnership with Premise, finds that of the 1,000 households who have responded so far, one in three (30%) that have at least one person with a chronic disease have reported challenges in accessing care for those conditions. The survey also shows that two out of five households (39%) have at least one member with a chronic illness, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or cancer., Less than a third (30%) of respondents sought out healthcare services recently, and of those, two out of five (39%) cited the security situation as the main reason, while 27% reported no healthcare services were available at all in their area., Most households (70%) surveyed are sheltering in their own homes at this time, while one in ten (11%) are staying with friends and family members in relatively safer areas, 8% are on the move within Ukraine and 3% are in a shelter or camp for internally displaced people., “Two months into the war, our findings show the urgent need for continued health systems support in Ukraine,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine. “Through our long-standing engagement with the Ministry of Health, national health institutions and our many partners and donors, WHO has been able to reach nearly 7.5 million people over the past eight weeks with life-saving supplies, equipment and medicines. But we are still unable to reach some of the hardest-hit areas in the east where the health system has all but collapsed. We have received reports for instance that nearly all health facilities and hospitals in Luhansk oblast are either damaged or destroyed, and the situation is critical in several others. It is vital that we gain access so we can assess the health needs and move vital supplies into affected areas, including Mariupol. Civilians have a right to health, even in times of war”, Ukraine’s health system is facing multiple challenges, with the situation growing more dire by the day. The risk of infectious diseases, and increasingly water-borne diseases, is significant, and routine immunization including COVID-19 vaccination is greatly diminished because of the war. Access to reproductive, maternal and antenatal care, as well as mental health care, is severely impacted due to security concerns, restricted mobility, broken supply chains and mass displacement. And healthcare continues to come under attack, with more than 160 verified incidents since 24 February., “As the UN’s health agency, WHO is in a unique position to engage in dialogue with all parties to press for, and secure, safe passage for critical health and medical supplies nationwide,” explained Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Through our Regional and Country Offices, we are constantly in touch with Health Minister Viktor Liashko and Ukrainian health authorities, collectively strategizing to ensure as best we can that health care providers and facilities can continue to function.”, Working closely with partners on the ground and through the generosity of a range of donors and funders, WHO has to date managed to deliver specialized medical and emergency supplies, deployed medical teams in hard-to-reach areas, and helped minimize disruptions to critical services, including treatment of conditions like HIV, tuberculosis and diabetes, as well as routine immunization and mental health support., Together with a range of partners, in the past two months WHO has:, As of 21 April, WHO has received $26.3 million (58%) against its appeal for $45 million covering the three months from March to May. A further $18 million has been pledged. These funds will enable WHO to reach six million people with healthcare assistance., “WHO is grateful to all the governments, individuals, corporations, and organizations contributing to our Ukraine Appeal. We would like to thank Canada, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, Novo Nordisk Foundation, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, The Asia-Europe Foundation, and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund for their timely contributions,” said Dr Habicht. “Flexible funding remains critical to enable WHO to deliver urgent life-saving assistance where it’s most needed.”, According to the UN, more than 12 million people have been forcibly displaced by the Russian invasion: 7.1 million people displaced within Ukraine and more than 5 million refugees outside Ukraine. Another 2.9 million are considering leaving their homes due to the war., “Addressing the health impacts of the war in Ukraine and the surrounding countries remains my highest priority,” said Dr Kluge. “During, my recent visit to Ukraine on World Health Day, I was deeply impressed by the resilience of the health workers I met, who are going over and above the call of duty to treat patients and serve their communities, despite the difficult circumstances. I complimented as well the Ministry of Health for their efforts. WHO/Europe is committed to supporting Ukraine now and in the future. As we respond to the immediate humanitarian needs, we must also plan for reconstruction and rehabilitation in parallel. The challenges are formidable, but WHO will work with national authorities and partners every step of the way, striving to achieve health and wellbeing for all.”, ENDS, Bhanu Bhatnagar, WHO Spokesperson in Ukraine, bbhatnagar@who.int, WHO/Europe Press Office, eupress@who.int, Notes to editors:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-people-chronic-diseases-face-massive-challenges-accessing-healthcare

Direct Relief Awards More than $12 Million in Grants for Ukraine War Relief,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Food and Nutrition
Health",21 Apr 2022,"The grants, made possible by donations from people in 79 countries, will fund prescription medications, equipment costs, first responder transportation and equipment, and other vital needs for organizations working on the ground., By Talya Meyers, Since the invasion of Ukraine, Direct Relief has granted more than $12 million to nine organizations working on the ground to address the health impacts of the Ukraine war, whether in Ukraine itself or surrounding countries receiving refugees., The grant funding adds to the more than 508,000 pounds (230,425 kg) of direct medical aid provided by Direct Relief since February 24, 2022, when Russia first invaded Ukraine, to groups helping refugees, internally displaced persons, and others affected by the ongoing crisis., The Ukraine war has created shortages of vital medications, including insulin, oncology drugs, and thyroid medicines, while increasing the need for medical aid such as PPE, wound care, antibiotics, and even an antidote to chemical weapons. Direct Relief has provided all these medications and supplies to partners working in the region., However, the situation has also created needs that cannot be answered by shipments of medical aid. Ukrainians who have fled the country are finding themselves with no means to pay for urgently needed prescription medications. A Kyiv hospital offering free care to people injured or affected by the war is unable to pay its medical staff their salaries. A coalition of first responders, invited by the Ukrainian government to conduct search-and-rescue operations in the country, needs transportation and equipment., The grants provided by Direct Relief will help with these costs, and much more., Recipients of grants provided or committed include the following:, Direct Cash Assistance to Ukrainian Refugees ($10 million provided): Ukrainian refugees in Poland will receive medical care, but face high copays for prescription medications that many, fleeing without income or resources, will not have the means to pay. With a focus on mothers and their children, along with older adults, this grant will be used to pay prescription copays for Ukrainian refugees at pharmacies throughout Poland. The program is a joint initiative between Direct Relief and Pelion, Poland’s largest healthcare company., Charity Fund Modern Village and Town ($250,000 provided): This Ukrainian NGO has established a distribution center in central Ukraine, where they have procured medicine, medical supplies, and hygiene items for people fleeing the violence. Two $100,000 grants were used to help defray operational costs, such as for trucking and generators. In addition, the organization has been tasked with emergency patient transfers out of conflict zones in eastern Ukraine, for patients with cancer, cystic fibrosis, pericarditis, and other conditions requiring urgent medical attention. An additional $50,000 was granted to help Charity Fund continue these services in the coming months. , Ukrainian Diabetes Federation ($150,000 provided): The war in Ukraine has created severe logistical hurdles for people with diabetes, making it difficult to access insulin, glucose monitoring equipment, and even food. This in-country organization distributes medical equipment and is currently monitoring where people who need insulin are located and where they are fleeing. This grant will be used for operational costs so that they can distribute material aid, also provided by Direct Relief, and continue gathering and sharing vital information. , Polish National Agency for Strategic Reserves ($350,000 committed): The Polish government has appointed this organization to act as a hub for humanitarian aid, including medical and other needed materials. In this role, they have been working with Direct Relief to store medical aid safely. They will use the funding to continue their humanitarian operations.  , Project Joint Guardian ($50,000 provided): This organization is a coalition of U.S. and international firefighters that support first responder and search and rescue efforts around the world. At the invitation of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the group will send 20 representatives out to conduct search and rescue and first responder operations, as well as training Ukrainian responders in some rescue techniques. (Direct Relief is providing logistical services to send search and rescue equipment items to Ukraine, and the 20 representatives will also use Direct Relief emergency medical backpacks.) The funding will be used to cover transportation costs and purchase needed equipment. , Society for Critical Care Medicine ($750,000 provided): This organization is a global community of clinicians who care for critically ill or injured patients in over 100 countries. Members in Ukraine and the surrounding countries have identified critical medical aid needed for people affected by the ongoing war. The funding will be used to procure medication and supplies needed most urgently by intensivists in these countries, using well-established supply chains. , Polish Diabetes Federation ($102,000 committed): This organization is a senior member of the International Diabetes Federation. They have identified 500 Ukrainian refugees in Poland who have diabetes, need help, and will use the funding for pharmacy and food vouchers for these patients. , Dobrobut Hospital ($750,000 provided): Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this was a private hospital network in Kyiv with a large fleet of ambulances. Once the war began, they began acting as a nonprofit hospital, providing care on a pay-if-you-can basis and sending ambulances into the community to find victims of attacks and bring them to hospitals. The grant will allow them to provide free care to all patients, and pay salaries and supply food for medical staff over the coming months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/direct-relief-awards-more-12-million-grants-ukraine-war-relief

At the request of the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), a Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) was launched with the support of REACH in order to inform humanitarian actors responding to the displacement crisis., Data was collected through 47 structured phone interviews with NGO and local authority key informants (KIs) in 16 settlements of southern and eastern oblasts between 24 of March - April 6. In addition, three qualitative individual interviews were conducted with KIs working in oblast centers (Mykolaiv, Odessa and Zaporizhzhia city). For quantitative data collection, a minimum of five settlements were sampled in each oblast, with the possibility to interview more than one KI per settlement (KI-level data was then aggregated at the settlement level).
Given the lack of granular data on the distribution of IDPs in Ukraine, enumerators were initially directed to interview KIs in the four largest settlements of each oblast. The list of settlements considered to be of interest for data collection was however flexible. During data collection, the list was adapted to disregard pre-identified settlements should KIs report that the settlement was not hosting a large IDP population. Conversely, the assessment team had the possibility to incorporate new IDP hosting settlements into the list of settlements of interest., While the assessment was conducted countrywide, this brief provides key findings for southern (Mykolaivska, Odeska) and eastern (Zaporizka) oblasts. The two microregions were aggregated because of the lack of accessible information by region. The same weights were given to all oblasts. Three other factsheets were produced, covering the rest of the country.

Update 59 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (21 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,21 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that staff rotation at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) was now “taking place regularly and according to plan”, three weeks after Russian forces withdrew from the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General said the development represented major progress both for the well-being of the NPP’s personnel – who have been living and working under extremely stressful circumstances during the conflict – and for the safe and secure operation of the plant. Ukraine told the IAEA on 10 April that it had carried out the first staff rotation at the Chornobyl NPP in three weeks and only the second since Russian forces seized the site on 24 February and held it for five weeks., “It is very positive that staff at this important nuclear facility can now carry out their activities in a more normal situation after many weeks of working in very difficult conditions, allowing them to go home for rest and to see their families on a regular basis. They have demonstrated admirable courage and resilience in continuing to conduct their vital duties also during the conflict. When I visit the site later this month, I will be able to thank them personally,” he said., Director General Grossi plans to head a mission of IAEA experts to Chornobyl later in April to conduct nuclear safety, security and radiological assessments, deliver vital equipment and repair the Agency’s remote safeguards monitoring systems there., One of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety that he outlined at the beginning of the conflict states that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure.”, Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said it was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-59-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-21-april-2022

Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Apr 2022,"Dominik Stillhart, the director of operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), visited Ukraine this week where he saw the devastating human cost of urban warfare in Irpin and Bucha and visited the ICRC’s urban water project, which will restore water supplies in the area., “The damage that you see here is really impressive. After just a few weeks of hostilities, the number of houses that are destroyed, pumping stations that have been destroyed, water pipes... You can really see that the war here took a very heavy toll,” said Dominik Stillhart., Conflict is uprooting lives in Ukraine, with civilians bearing the brunt of intense fighting in particular in the South and the Donbas area. Besides destruction and damage to civilian buildings and critical infrastructure, hostilities disrupt the urban services that are indispensable for sustaining life. People suffer from a lack of food, water, sanitation, electricity and health care., At the same time, humanitarian access continues to be limited where hostilities are taking place, and this must change. Parties must do everything possible to ensure that people in cities affected by hostilities have access to vital humanitarian aid. “There is an urgent need for better respect of International Humanitarian Law, because if what we see here after only a few weeks of fighting is repeated in the east and in the south, we can expect the worst,” Mr Stillhart said., The ICRC pursues its efforts to address the consequences of damaged vital infrastructures and the resulting disruptions of the supply of water, electricity and gaz. These efforts include the rehabilitation of a water pipeline between Kyiv and Irpin for the benefit of over 200,000 people., The ICRC has called since 2014 on the parties to respect their legal obligations under international humanitarian law. Civilians and civilian infrastructure, medical facilities, vehicles and personnel must be protected and spared from the fighting. The ICRC calls on the parties to ensure unimpeded access for impartial humanitarian relief and safe passage for medical personnel and for civilians seeking safety., See video here, Note to editors:, The ICRC has been working for the people affected by the conflict in Ukraine since 2014. Our operations in the country are among the ten largest ICRC operations worldwide. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, we provide emergency assistance such as food, water, and other essential items. Our emergency health response has reached 145,000 people, across 75 health facilities in Ukraine. This includes medical supplies, treatment, evacuations and the deployment of 50 medical personnel who are delivering assistance and training across Ukraine. We support authorities to repair essential infrastructure, provide cash assistance to vulnerable people affected by conflict and help people who lost contact with their loved ones, among other activities., Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

I cannot begin to imagine their suffering""., He reminded that attacking noncombatants or civilian infrastructure is ""a clear violation of international humanitarian law,"" calling for it to stop and for civilians to be protected and allowed safe passage., Humanitarians, returnees, At the same time, humanitarians face tremendous challenges that often prevent them from delivering assistance to areas where people are in desperate need., ""I appeal for safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance,"" said the UN official., Mr. Awad also pointed out that some of the over 12 million people who have been displaced are now returning home., ""As United Nations, and together with our humanitarian and development partners, we must be ready to support their durable solution from the start""., He underscored the Secretary-General's call for a humanitarian pause and the need to ""put aside divisions and focus on converging interests to end this senseless war""., New funds allocated, The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, informed the media that the UN humanitarian office, OCHA, has released to aid organizations an additional $50 million on top of the $158 million already provided for life-saving operations., This included nearly $98 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF), the largest allotment since it was established in 2019, and $60 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)., Amidst mounting allegations of rape, she said that part of the money would be directed to prevent any form of gender-based violence and to support survivors., ""Thanks to the timely support of our donors, these funds will allow us to reach millions of people -- mainly in the most affected oblasts in the east of the country --with the support they need to survive and face probably one of the biggest challenges of their lives,"" Ms. Lubrani said., People fleeing the heavily bombed city of Mykolaiv pass through Lviv, western Ukraine, en route to Poland., Consequences of war, Nearly two months of intense and escalating hostilities in Ukraine continue to have horrific repercussions for civilians and caused a grave humanitarian crisis., ""Aid workers from local and international NGOs and UN agencies have worked day and night to scale up our response to assist more than 3.3 million people.

This included:, a total of 2,345 killed (703 men, 429 women, 44 girls, and 63 boys, as well as 70 children and 1,036 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,919 injured (339 men, 271 women, 61 girls, and 66 boys, as well as 158 children and 2,024 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,344 casualties (930 killed and 1,414 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,939 casualties (851 killed and 1,088 injured)

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 21 April (local time), 208 children had been killed and 376 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-20-april-2022-enruuk

Protection and Human Rights",21 Apr 2022,"The international development agency, Christian Aid, will spend £8m on vital supplies over the next six months to help the Ukrainian people., The money comes from donations to DEC, the Disasters Emergency Committee, that has raised more than £300m for Ukraine. That’s around £3 on average donated by every person in the UK., Michael Mosselmans, Christian Aid Head of Humanitarian, said:, “Amidst all the carnage of war, it always fills me with hope when I see how people - like in previous emergencies around the world - support their neighbours, communities and complete strangers.”, Through its local partners, Christian Aid has already provided medical supplies, first aid kits, baby incubators as well as food and shelter for refugees in Ukraine and Hungary., Christian Aid and its partners are now rapidly expanding their capacity and will focus on sustaining community-led initiatives because local people know what’s most important for their own situation., For example, helping people like Olga – a former dance teacher in her mid-20s who has become one of Christian Aid’s “accidental humanitarians” by pausing her previous life to help mothers and children in a community shelter., Michael Mosselmans, Christian Aid Head of Humanitarian, continued:, “The protection of vulnerable displaced people is central to humanitarian action and this response is no different. To this end, Christian Aid’s local partner has distributed 5,000 SIM cards so that families can keep in touch and set up safe zones at train stations to ensure women and children are not exploited by predatory gangs of people traffickers., “Many challenges remain. The latest assault by Russian forces might mean another surge of refugees and displaced people heading west. It’s not just the risk from Russian attacks but also navigating Ukraine’s martial law and getting humanitarian aid licences.”, ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/christian-aid-spends-8m-british-people-help-ukraine
UN allocates an additional $50 million to extend urgent relief operations in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,OCHA,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",21 Apr 2022,"Since the start of the war in Ukraine two months ago, OCHA’s managed humanitarian funds have released over US$158 million to enable aid organizations to rapidly scale up their operations, (Lviv, 21 April 2022): The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, has today announced the release of an additional US$50 million from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) to support nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and United Nations agencies to continue to expand their life-saving work, following the most recent escalation of the war in the country. This is the largest allocation in the history of the fund, established in 2019. With this new disbursement, OCHA’s humanitarian funds will have allocated over $158 million for life-saving operations in Ukraine since Russia Federation’s invasion on 24 February, including nearly $98 million from the UHF and $60 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)., “Thanks to the timely support of our donors, these funds will allow us to reach millions of people— mainly in the most affected oblasts in the east of the country—with the support they need to survive and face probably one of the biggest challenges of their lives,” said Ms. Lubrani, during a press conference in Lviv today. Highlighting the specific challenges and risks faced by women and girls in Ukraine due to the intense fighting, amidst mounting allegations of rape, the Humanitarian Coordinator informed that part of the funds will be directed to prevent any form of gender-based violence and to support survivors., Nearly two months of intense and escalating hostilities in Ukraine continue to have horrific consequences for civilians and cause a grave humanitarian crisis. Massive devastation in urban centres and the destruction of civilian infrastructure has made life unbearable for millions and severely disrupted vital services, especially access to water and health care. Over 15.7 million people—more than 25 per cent of the country’s entire population—urgently need life-saving assistance and protection. It includes over 7.7 million people who are now internally displaced across Ukraine, trying to find safety far from their homes. Since 24 February, another 5 million people have been forced to leave Ukraine and seek refuge in other countries., “During the last two months, aid workers from local and international NGOs and UN agencies have worked day and night to scale up our response to assist more than 3.3 million people. This is alongside the incredible work done by volunteers across the country,” explained Osnat Lubrani, adding that just yesterday the UN managed to deliver nine trucks of relief items to the until shortly ago besieged city of Chernihiv. The Humanitarian Coordinator also gave examples of how over 145,000 people in nonGovernment-controlled areas of Luhanska oblast are receiving protection services or dozens of thousands of people displaced in transit areas of Lviv have received hygiene kits as they moved in search of safety, thanks to the UHF’s implementing partners alone., However, much more is required to meet the needs of the people of Ukraine. “It is remarkable how the humanitarian community here managed, in a few weeks, to expand from delivering assistance in two areas of eastern Ukraine to now operating across all 24 oblasts. However, we are still not able or have been prevented from reaching areas where people are in dire need of assistance, including Mariupol and Kherson,” said Ms. Lubrani.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-allocates-additional-50-million-extend-urgent-relief-operations-ukraine-enuk

More than half of internally displaced persons – mainly in the east of Ukraine – reported a lack of some food products; 28 per cent of families with children under the age of five say they experience problems getting enough food for their children since the start of the war compared to 25 per cent in the 1 April report., The most pressing needs identified included cash and access to financial support, followed by medicines and medical supplies.
“Women and children, the elderly, and people with disabilities have been disproportionately affected as they all represent a highly vulnerable group of people,” said IOM Director General António Vitorino., “Our work in support of those forced to flee their homes and all vulnerable populations affected by the war continues, but a humanitarian ceasefire is crucial to allow for aid delivery and access to hard-to-reach communities.”, Among those currently displaced, 15 per cent plan to return to their homes in the next two weeks, heading mostly to Kyiv and the north of the country, while 8 per cent of the general population report having had their homes damaged by attacks., In addition to ongoing large-scale deliveries of humanitarian supplies, IOM has identified cash-based interventions as one of the most feasible, efficient, and effective ways to reach people in need both inside Ukraine and in the neighboring countries. Preparations are ongoing to scale up this assistance in close coordination with UN agencies, the Government of Ukraine and the local authorities. IOM is also launching a broad shelter rehabilitation programme to provide displaced persons staying at collective centres access to safe and dignified living conditions., Since the beginning of the war, at least 150,000 people have received direct assistance from IOM in Ukraine, including food, non-food and hygiene items, cash, mental health and psychosocial support, as well as via information campaigns to help prevent human trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse., ***, *For more information, please contact:, In Geneva:

"Atrocity Alert No. 297: Ukraine, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Myanmar (Burma)",News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",20 Apr 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS FOUND EXECUTED AROUND KYIV, UKRAINE, Following the retreat of Russian forces from the suburbs of Kyiv, Ukraine, at the end of March, reports emerged of hundreds of civilian casualties in previously Russian-occupied areas. While early reports focused on evidence of targeted killings in the city of Bucha, on Friday, 15 April, Kyiv’s regional police force reported that the bodies of more than 900 civilians have been discovered in the region. According to the police, nearly 95 percent of the people had been fatally shot, with many bodies abandoned in the streets or given temporary burials. Andriy Nebytov, head of the regional police force, said that, “consequently, we understand that under the (Russian) occupation, people were simply executed in the streets” and alleged that Russian troops had “tracked down” people who expressed strong pro-Ukrainian views., Since 15 April Russian forces have carried out hundreds of missile strikes in Ukraine, targeting locations in cities throughout the country, including Kharkiv in the east, the port city of Mykolaiv in the south, and Lviv along the western border with Poland. While many of the missile strikes hit military targets, Russian forces have also continued their assault on critical civilian infrastructure, including health care facilities. Lviv currently hosts tens of thousands of civilians who previously fled fighting in eastern Ukraine. The missile strikes come as Russian forces launched an anticipated ground offensive in the Donbas region, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked would be a “new phase” in his government’s so-called special operation in Ukraine., Meanwhile, Russian forces continue their 7-week siege of the port city of Mariupol, where thousands of civilians remain trapped without access to food, water, heat or electricity. As Russian forces attempt to take control of the city, the defense ministry has issued several surrender-or-die ultimatums for hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians hiding in the city’s Azovstal steel plant., On Tuesday, 19 April, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that amidst “the intense concentration of forces and firepower… The onslaught and terrible toll on civilians we have seen so far could pale in comparison to the horror that lies ahead,” and called for a “4-day Holy Week humanitarian pause,” coinciding with Orthodox Easter. The Secretary-General noted that a humanitarian pause could provide the necessary conditions to allow for the safe passage of all civilians willing to leave areas of current and expected confrontation, as well as for the safe delivery of humanitarian aid to people in the hardest-hit areas., HUNDREDS DETAINED AND INJURED DURING RAIDS BY ISRAELI FORCES IN EAST JERUSALEM, Over 150 Palestinians were injured and at least 300 detained during two large-scale raids by Israeli police on 15 and 17 April at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). Israeli police used disproportionate force, tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets to forcefully remove Palestinians from the compound. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed deep concern for the deteriorating situation in East Jerusalem and called “for the status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem to be upheld and respected.”, The recent violent incidents at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound were reminiscent of similar raids carried out by Israeli forces during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in May 2021. Following weeks of escalating tensions and protests, over 1,000 Palestinians were injured in a series of raids from 7-10 May. The violence rapidly escalated and from 10-21 May Hamas indiscriminately fired rockets into Israel while Israel engaged in retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza. Israeli airstrikes killed and injured an estimated 2,170 Palestinians while indiscriminate rockets by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed at least 12 Israelis., Ahead of last week’s raids at al-Aqsa, targeted attacks had been escalating over the past month. Since 22 March five Palestinian assailants perpetrated four attacks in Israeli cities, killing 14 people. The violence prompted Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to grant “all security forces full freedom” of operations in an attempt to prevent further attacks. Israeli forces then launched widespread raids across the occupied West Bank, killing more than 25 Palestinians., The recent violence is occurring amidst systematic human rights violations in the OPT, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. On 9 April Israel implemented a set of sweeping economic sanctions against residents of Jenin city that potentially amount to collective punishment. Last month the UN Special Rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 concluded that Israel’s two-tier legal and political system amounts to the international crime of apartheid. Under the International Convention Against Apartheid and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, apartheid is a crime against humanity., The international community should immediately condemn the violence at al-Aqsa Mosque and call upon Israeli forces to refrain from using disproportionate force. The international community should urgently ensure accountability for ongoing atrocity crimes perpetrated in Israel and the OPT, including the crime of apartheid. UN members states should implement a series of measures in line with international legal principles to bring Israel’s 55-year occupation and apartheid practices to an end., MYANMAR’S HEALTH SYSTEM IN COLLAPSE AS THE MILITARY TARGETS MEDICAL WORKERS, Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – is intensifying its crackdown on the country’s healthcare system as part of its broader campaign to repress ongoing anti-coup resistance throughout the country. Since the coup, military forces have arrested doctors, revoked the licenses of prominent physicians, searched hospitals for wounded resistance fighters and threatened to close health care facilities that employ anti-junta doctors. According to Physicians for Human Rights, Myanmar is the one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a health worker, with more documented attacks against healthcare in 2021 than any other country., The military has consistently targeted Myanmar’s doctors since the February 2021 coup, with attacks against health care workers increasing from September – January 2022 amid escalating violence across the country. Physicians for Human Rights estimated in January that the military had killed at least 30 doctors, arbitrarily arrested or detained over 286 health workers and attacked 128 health facilities since the coup. The military has also occupied dozens of hospitals and used them as military bases, in violation of International Humanitarian Law, discouraging patients from seeking medical help. The Tatmadaw’s intentional targeting of hospitals may amount to war crimes., The collapse of Myanmar’s healthcare system is having devastating consequences for civilians. Access to healthcare is severely limited amidst a significant shortage of doctors, lack of essential resources and closure of many medical facilities. Anti-junta doctors estimate that hundreds of people die every week as a result of the collapsed healthcare system while the UN Children’s Fund has reported that almost one million children are not receiving routine immunizations. The situation is especially dire for regions facing heightened violent conflict, where government-run hospitals often do not operate. Some doctors who refuse to work at military hospitals offer free services at private and underground clinics; however, the military is also targeting those facilities and has deemed the people who are seeking care from these clinics as “illegal patients.”, The deliberate targeting of health care workers and facilities underscores the severity of the military’s broader campaign to quash resistance. Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “as the Tatmadaw continues to harass and target anti-regime doctors, the human rights and health catastrophes will grow increasingly grave. The dire situation demonstrates the urgent need for increased international action.” The UN Security Council should immediately impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and sanction the country’s oil and gas sector. UN member states must provide support to humanitarian organizations seeking to address the healthcare crisis in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-297-ukraine-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory-and-myanmar
Ukraine: Russian Forces’ Trail of Death in Bucha,Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,21 Apr 2022,"Preserving Evidence Critical for War Crimes Prosecutions, Russian forces committed a litany of apparent war crimes during their occupation of Bucha, a town about 30 kilometers northwest of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, from March 4 to 31, 2022, Human Rights Watch said in a detailed report released today., Human Rights Watch researchers who worked in Bucha from April 4 to 10, days after Russian forces withdrew from the area, found extensive evidence of summary executions, other unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, and torture, all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity., “Nearly every corner in Bucha is now a crime scene, and it felt like death was everywhere,” said Richard Weir, crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The evidence indicates that Russian forces occupying Bucha showed contempt and disregard for civilian life and the most fundamental principles of the laws of war.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed 32 Bucha residents in person and 5 others by phone, including victims and witnesses, emergency responders, morgue workers, doctors, a nurse, and local officials. Human Rights Watch also documented and analyzed physical evidence in the town, original photographs and videos provided by witnesses and victims, and satellite imagery., The cases documented represent a fraction of Russian forces’ apparent war crimes in Bucha during their occupation of the town., The chief regional prosecutor in Bucha, Ruslan Kravchenko, told Human Rights Watch on April 15 that 278 bodies had been found in the town since Russian forces withdrew, the vast majority of them civilians, and that the number was expected to rise as more bodies are discovered. Prior to the conflict, Bucha had a population of about 36,000., Serhii Kaplychnyi, head of the municipal funeral home in Bucha, said that, during the Russian occupation, his team placed dozens of bodies in communal graves outside the Church of St. Andrew and All Saints, after they ran out of space in the morgue. Only two of those buried were members of the Ukrainian military; the rest were civilians, he said. As of April 14, local authorities had exhumed more than 70 bodies from the church site., Another funeral home worker, Serhii Matiuk, who helped collect bodies, said that he had personally collected about 200 bodies from the streets since the Russian invasion began on February 24. Most of the victims were men, he said, but some were women and children. Almost all of them had bullet wounds, he said, including around 50 whose hands were tied and whose bodies had signs of torture. Bodies found with hands tied strongly suggests that the victims had been detained and summarily executed., Human Rights Watch documented the details of 16 apparently unlawful killings in Bucha, including nine summary executions and seven indiscriminate killings of civilians – 15 men and a woman. In two other documented cases, civilians were shot and wounded, including a man shot in the neck, as he was standing in his apartment on an enclosed balcony with his family, and a 9-year-old girl who was shot in the shoulder while trying to run away from Russian forces., Human Rights Watch had previously documented a summary execution in Bucha that occurred on March 4, based on information from witnesses who had managed to flee Bucha. In that case, Russian forces rounded up five men and shot one of them in the back of the head, a witness said. In another case documented previously, on March 5, 48-year-old Viktor Koval died when Russian forces attacked the house where he and other civilians had been sheltering., The Russian Defense Ministry denied allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, stating in a Telegram post on April 3 that “not a single local resident has suffered from any violent action” while Bucha was “under the control of the Russian armed forces,” and claiming instead that the evidence of crimes was a “hoax, a staged production and provocation” by authorities in Kyiv., Bucha residents said that Russian forces first entered Bucha on February 27, but were pushed out of the central part of the town during heavy fighting. On March 4, Russian forces returned, and largely took control of the town by March 5. Bucha then became a strategic base for the Russian forces’ efforts to advance toward Kyiv. Witnesses said that several Russian military units operated in Bucha during the occupation., Soon after they occupied the city, Russian forces went door to door, searching residential buildings, claiming they were “hunting Nazis.” In multiple locations they looked for weapons, interrogated residents, and sometimes detained the men, allegedly for failure to comply with orders, or without providing a specific reason. Family members of those detained said they were not told where their male relatives were taken, and were unable to get information later about where they were being held. This amounts to an enforced disappearance, a crime under international law in all circumstances., The bodies of some of those forcibly disappeared, including in two of the cases Human Rights Watch documented, were found on streets, in yards, or in basements after the Russian forces retreated – some with signs that they had been tortured. Ukrainian de-mining authorities said they found victim-activated booby traps placed on at least two dead bodies., Russian forces occupied civilian homes and other buildings, including at least two schools, making these locations military targets. Two residents in one apartment building said that Russian forces ordered those remaining in the building to move into the basement, but to leave their apartment doors unlocked. Russian forces then moved in. When they found a locked door, they forced it open and wrecked the apartment, residents said., Many residents said that Russian forces shot indiscriminately at civilians who had ventured outside. Vasyl Yushenko, 32, was shot in the neck as he went to smoke a cigarette in the enclosed balcony of his apartment. A nurse said she treated 10 people with serious injuries, including the girl who was shot while trying to run away from Russian forces. The man she was running with was killed and the girl’s arm had to be amputated., Some people were injured or killed during explosions, funeral home workers said, most likely when the Russian forces were shelling the town at the start of their offensive or during artillery exchanges between Russian and Ukrainian forces., Russian forces damaged the homes and apartments where they had stayed and also took private property, including, residents said, valuables such as television sets and jewelry. While occupying forces can requisition property for their use in exchange for compensation, looting – or pillaging as it is called under the laws of war – is strictly prohibited, in particular when property is taken for personal or private use., Residents said they had limited access to water, food, electricity, heating, and mobile phone service during the occupation. One man said he buried his older neighbor, who had relied on an oxygen concentrator and died when the power went off and the machine failed., Human Rights Watch has documented and received reports about other apparent war crimes in other towns occupied by Russian forces, such as Adriviika, Hostomel, and Motzyhn, and more evidence will likely emerge as access to other locations improves. A senior Ukrainian police official announced on April 15 that the authorities had identified 900 Ukrainian citizens across the Kyiv region who had been killed by Russian forces during their occupation but the circumstances of those deaths remains unclear., Bucha’s chief regional prosecutor told Human Rights Watch on April 15 that over 600 bodies had been found across Bucha district, which is within the Kyiv region and has a population of about 362,000. Human Rights Watch has not verified these figures., All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation. International human rights law, which is applicable at all times, also applies., The laws of war prohibit willful and indiscriminate killing, torture, enforced disappearances, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Pillage or looting is also prohibited. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., Ukrainian authorities should prioritize efforts to preserve evidence that could be critical for future war crime prosecutions, including by cordoning off mass gravesites until professional exhumations are conducted, taking photos of bodies and the surrounding area before burial, recording causes of death when possible, recording names of victims and identifying witnesses, and looking for identifying material that Russian forces may have left behind., Other governments, organizations, and institutions seeking to assist with war crimes investigations should work closely with Ukrainian authorities to ensure effective and efficient cooperation., To support accountability efforts for serious international crimes, Ukraine should urgently ratify the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty and formally become a member of the court, and authorities should work to align Ukraine’s national legislation with international law., “The victims of apparent war crimes in Bucha deserve justice,” Weir said. “Ukrainian authorities, with international support, should prioritize preserving evidence, which is critical for ensuring that those responsible for these crimes will one day be held to account.”, Summary Executions, Human Rights Watch documented nine apparent summary executions in Bucha. Russian forces detained the men, in some cases forcibly disappeared and tortured them, and then executed them. Funeral home workers who buried the dead described seeing the bodies of dozens of other men who may have also been victims of summary executions. Many bodies were found on or around Yablunska Street, near the highway to Kyiv and just south of the train station., Summary executions, irrespective of the victim’s status as a civilian, prisoner of war, or otherwise as a captured combatant, are strictly prohibited as a crime under international law and may be prosecuted as war crimes or crimes against humanity, depending on the context., Execution on Yablunska Street, Iryna, 48, said that Russian soldiers shot at her two-story, multi-unit house on the corner of Yablunska and Vokzalna Streets at the start of their occupation on March 5. After an explosion and gunfire, the house caught fire. Iryna, who was at home with her husband, Oleh Abramova, and her father, Volodymyr, said that Oleh shouted that they were peaceful civilians and begged the Russian forces not to shoot. Four soldiers ordered them to come out of the house with their hands above their heads. The soldiers said they were there to free them from the “Nazis” and demanded to know where the Nazis were hiding., “The soldiers accused us of killing people in Donbas,” Iryna said. “They accused us of killing the Berkut in Maidan as well [referring to the since-dissolved riot police unit that killed dozens of protesters during 014 Maidan protests in Kyiv]. They concluded that we were guilty and should be punished.” The soldiers ordered Oleh, 40, and Volodymyr, a pensioner, to extinguish the fire., One soldier continued to question Iryna while three others took Oleh and Volodymyr to the northeast corner of the fenced-in yard. Volodymyr told Human Rights Watch that two soldiers then took Oleh out of the yard. Volodymyr said he pleaded for them to let Oleh come back to help put out the fire. One soldier went to look for Oleh outside the gate, but returned and said, “Oleh will not return.”, Within minutes, Volodymyr and Iryna said, they found Oleh’s body on the sidewalk outside the fence. “I saw that he was lying with his face down, and blood was pumping out of his left ear,” Iryna said. “The right side of his face was missing, and brain tissue and blood were coming out of his wound.” She said a group of soldiers was standing no more than five meters away, “watching the event as if they thought it was theater.”, Soldiers then told Iryna and Volodymyr to leave or they would be shot. Oleh’s body remained on the sidewalk until the Russian forces retreated on March 31 and the authorities removed it. On April 4 and 5, Human Rights Watch inspected the site and saw a large blood stain and what appeared to be human tissue on the pavement., Enforced Disappearance, Apparent Torture, and Execution, In an apartment complex on Sadova Street, parallel to Yablunska, Russian forces detained Vasily Nedashkivskyi, 47, and his wife Tanya, 57, on or around March 17, after troops searched their home and found several weapons. Tanya said that Russian forces took them to the second floor of an adjacent apartment building, where they were held in separate bedrooms of a family’s apartment. Hours later, the Russian forces took Vasily out of the building and a soldier told Tanya that he would be taken to “headquarters” for questioning., On April 6, Human Rights Watch visited the apartment and found traces of what appeared to be blood on the stairs leading to the apartment in which Vasily and Tanya were held, and evidence of the presence of Russian troops, including Russian military rations and camouflage clothing with patterns consistent with Russian uniforms., Tanya said she was subsequently released, but the Russian soldiers did not give her any information about her husband’s whereabouts. Both Tanya and her neighbor, Oleksii Tarasevych, whom Human Rights Watch also interviewed, said that Russian forces generally prohibited residents in the neighborhood from leaving their buildings, except to get water, and even this was at times forbidden., Vasily’s whereabouts remained unknown for nearly two weeks, Tanya said. His body was found in an outdoor basement stairwell in the building where they had been detained, along with the body of another man in civilian clothes, Igor Lytvynenko. Human Rights Watch reviewed photographs Tarasevych took on April 1. Human Rights Watch found two large dark red stains on the stairwell, apparently blood, that were consistent with the position of the bodies from the photographs., In the photos, Vasily had severe lacerations on his hands, bruises on his lower abdomen, and what appeared to be blunt force trauma to his head. Tarasevych, who helped recover and bury Vasily’s body, said that they were not able to fully examine the body before burying him in a shallow grave behind the apartment building where Vasily and Tanya lived. Human Rights Watch visited the gravesite., The fact that Vasily was last seen alive in the custody of Russian soldiers, and that his body had marks consistent with abuse, strongly suggest that after he was detained, he was tortured and summarily killed., Execution in a Courtyard, On or around March 20, in the late morning, Russian forces occupying an apartment building on the corner of Poltavaska and Shevchenka Streets shot an unidentified man wearing a black track suit. A man and his 14-year-old son who lived in the building next door said they heard the shooting., The father and son, interviewed together, said they were outside when Russian soldiers told them to go into their apartment and stay inside. Once in their apartment, both said, they heard a man quarreling with Russian troops in the rear courtyard of the adjacent building. Shortly afterward, the man yelled “Slava Ukraini!” [“Glory to Ukraine!” in Ukrainian]. Both the father and son then said they heard up to three shots. They looked out their apartment window and saw a man in a black track suit lying face down on the ground., Because of the constant presence of Russian troops in the courtyard, where the soldiers often cooked food, it was two days before the father and two other men could bury the man’s body next to the apartment building in a shallow grave. Human Rights Watch separately interviewed one of those two men, a neighbor, who corroborated the father’s account of the burial but had not seen or heard the killing. Ukrainian authorities collected the man’s body on April 9; the father, son, and three other neighbors who had recently returned to the apartment building said they still did not know who he was., Human Rights Watch visited the apartment building and saw the shallow grave and three apparent impacts from small caliber ammunition near where the father and neighbor said they had found the body., Human Rights Watch reviewed two photos circulated on social media purporting to be of the body as it lay in the courtyard. In the photos, the man had duct tape wrapped around the upper portion of his head and around one of his wrists. From the photos, it appeared that his hands had been taped together but it is not clear if they were when he was killed., Five Bodies in a Children’s Camp, On April 4, Human Rights Watch saw five bodies in the basement of a dormitory building in a children’s camp on Vokzalna St, 123, which some Russian forces in Bucha had used as their base. The bodies were of men wearing civilian clothes who appeared to have been killed by gunshot. There were three distinct bloodstains on the wall of the room. The hands of four of the men were zip-tied behind their backs. The fifth man appeared to have been shot twice in the chest – the stuffing of his thick jacket was protruding at two locations on his chest, which was covered in dried blood. One media report said that the authorities had identified the men as Serhiy Mateshko, Dmytro Shulmeister, Volodymyr Boychenko, Valery Prudko, and Viktor Prudko. The circumstances of their detention, including how they got to the basement, remains unclear., There was extensive evidence that Russian forces had occupied the area, including two large “V”s – a symbol of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – painted on the outside walls of the camp, discarded and consumed Russian rations, discarded uniforms of the pattern worn by Russian soldiers, and areas set up for making and eating food. Human Rights Watch observed evidence of tracked vehicle movement around the location and three positions for armored vehicles dug into the ground within 100 meters of the basement where the bodies were found. Human Rights Watch also saw three private vehicles in the children’s park, two with graffiti with the letter “V” alongside some numbers and the letters “RUS.”, Satellite imagery of the area on February 28 showed two large military vehicles at the camp entrance, next to a church. Satellite imagery from March 10 shows more vehicle tracks at the site. Satellite imagery from March 15 shows the three private vehicles at the site, two of them with the graffiti., Bodies on the Northeast End of Yablunska Street, Human Rights Watch interviewed Denys Davydov, who recorded video footage as he walked along the northeast end of Yablunska street on April 1, just after the withdrawal of Russian troops. The video, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, shows seven bodies in civilian clothes, at least one of them with his hands tied behind his back., The identities of the seven people and how they died remains unknown., A video recorded from a moving car that was posted to Facebook on April 2 shows the same bodies in the same location. The video was recorded from a car as it drove in a convoy of at least three vehicles, one of which contains at least three uniformed Ukrainian soldiers, wearing blue armbands. Photographs taken on April 3 and published by Reuters show four of the bodies., The man found with his hands tied behind his back was likely the victim of a summary execution., Accounts from Funeral Home Workers, Serhii Kaplychnyi, the head of Bucha’s municipal funeral home, said he left the town on March 14 due to the deteriorating situation. When he returned on April 1, he said he found bodies at numerous locations with fatal wounds that indicate the people were likely to have been executed. “On Yablunska Street 144, I saw eight bodies of people who were shot, six of them with tied hands,” he said. “And the ninth body [at the same address] was a young man who we found inside on the stairs leading to the second floor. At first, I didn’t see any wounds. But when I was looking for documents and opened his coat, I saw a bullet wound in his heart.”, Further down Yablunska Street, Kaplychnyi said, funeral home workers collected about 20 other bodies, at least 10 of which had their hands tied. “In general, most bodies were shot from close range, mostly in the head, but not all of them,” he said., Another funeral home worker, Serhii Matiuk, said he personally collected about 200 bodies from the streets of Bucha, starting in late February. “Almost all were killed with a bullet shot from a close distance, either in the head or in an eye,” he said. “Some lay on the sidewalk, some were in cars. Some of them were women.”, Matiuk said he encountered the first bodies with bound hands between March 4 and 6. “During the time of the occupation, I saw in total approximately 50 bodies with tied hands,” all of them men, he said. “The bodies had signs of torture. Their hands and legs were shot through. Some of their skulls were broken with blunt objects.”, Unlawful Killings of Civilians, Human Rights Watch documented seven cases of apparent indiscriminate killings of civilians by Russian forces in Bucha, as well as two cases of civilians wounded by Russian forces. Under the circumstances, Russian forces may have opened fire without knowing whether the person was a civilian. However, occupying forces are not permitted to presume that someone is a combatant, or poses a lethal threat, but must take steps to distinguish between civilians and military targets. Indiscriminate killings and indiscriminate use of force against civilians are prohibited under international law., Killing on Yablunska Street, On March 5, on the northeast end of Yablunska Street, a man who wished to remain anonymous and his son-in-law, Roman, were hiding in their basement with their family due to the intense shelling and gunfire in the area. At about 4:30 p.m., the man said, when things were quieter, they opened their front gate to assess the damage. As Roman stepped out of the yard, his father-in-law heard a muffled sound and Roman fell to the ground. “I approached him and asked him if he was okay, and he just started moaning,” the man said. “I saw his coat from the left side was torn open.”, He and another family member immediately dragged Roman into the house. Roman’s sister-in-law, Tetiana, said they tried unsuccessfully to call a hospital and the Ukrainian territorial defense forces for help. Roman suffered all night and died the following morning at about 8 a.m. The family buried him in a shallow grave in their yard. Local authorities removed the body on April 6., Shot and Injured While Smoking in His Apartment, A Bucha resident, Nikolaii, said that Russian forces fired at him and three members of his family at about 4 p.m. on March 7 when they were in the enclosed balcony area of their sixth floor apartment, where they had gone to smoke. Nikolaii and his sister, Iushenko Iryna, said that a single round pierced the glass in the exterior wall of the northeast-facing building and struck Iryna’s husband, Vasyl Yushenko, 32, just as he reached up to light his cigarette. The bullet tore through the front portion of his throat and hit the room beyond the enclosed balcony, where two children were sitting., The family immediately took Vasyl out of sight of the glass enclosing the balcony, Nikolaii said. Minutes later, another shot hit the glass less than 10 centimeters from the first shot. The second bullet struck the wooden cabinet in the room beyond the window to the balcony area. A neighbor performed first aid and managed to save Vasyl’s life, Iryna said. The next day, Nikolaii, Iryna, and two neighbors took Vasyl two-and-a-half kilometers in a wheelbarrow to the hospital. He was later evacuated to Kyiv, where he was operated on twice and later discharged., Human Rights Watch visited Nikolaii’s apartment on April 6 and observed the two impacts to the glass on the outside of the balcony area, blood spatters on the ground and against the window behind where Nikolaii said Vasyl was standing, what appeared to be remnants of human tissue, and two impacts of small caliber ammunition in the cabinets and wall behind the balcony. Based on the bullet impacts in the glass, cabinets, and wall, the shots were fired from somewhere northeast of the building. The fact that the two shots both hit nearly the same location indicates that these were not stray bullets and that Russian forces aimed at the figures they saw through the glass in the balcony area., Shot and Killed While Getting Food, On March 20, Russian forces shot and killed Artem, 37, in his garage, where he had apparently gone to get jars of food after emerging from the basement of his apartment where he and his neighbors had been sheltering. Artem’s neighbor, Svitlana Nechypurenko, said that she saw two Russian soldiers near Artem’s garage, just south of Yablunska Street, from the window of her eighth-floor apartment. “I saw that they opened one of the garages, over there, with two ventilation pipes,” she said, pointing in the direction of the garage. “They opened the door, fired, and then they immediately shut the door and proceeded in the same direction. I heard two shots.” Residents speculated that Russian forces simply opened the garage door because they saw it was unlocked and then fired on whoever they saw inside., Another neighbor, Andrii, said he went into the garage and found Artem’s body on March 20. He was lying on his back with a broken glass jar of Adjika, a spicy dipping sauce, at his feet, with the sauce covering his legs. Andrii later buried Artem’s body behind the garage., Before the Russian invasion, Artem had worked on a military base painting vehicles for the Ukrainian military, but he had spent the prior 15 days sheltering in the basement, Andrii said. Nechypurenko, who was sheltering with Artem, said that Artem had routinely provided food from his supplies to others in the shelter during the occupation., Killing Near Yablunska Street, On the evening of March 12, Russian soldiers shot and killed Ilia Navalnyi, 61, near an apartment complex on Yablunska Street as he left the home of his friend, Alexii, 71. Alexii did not witness the killing, but he and another building resident said that, just before the killing, they saw a Russian soldier outside the building, firing his weapon across the yard. In the morning, another neighbor found Ilia’s body, Alexii said. When Alexii got to the location, about 15 meters from the entrance to his building, he found the pages of Ilia’s national ID torn out and scattered across the ground around the body., Older Man Killed, Two Bucha residents, Mykola and Serhii B., interviewed separately, both said that on or around March 8 they saw the body of an older man slumped over on his side next to his walker near a memorial to Soviet soldiers at the corner of Nove Highway and Vokzalna Streets. The two men said he appeared to have been shot. Human Rights Watch inspected the location and found extensive damage to the surrounding buildings, damaged vehicles, and vehicle tracks around the memorial, indicating that this was likely an area where Russian forces had operated. Who the man was and how he died remain unclear., Man Killed and Young Girl Injured on Yablunska Street, Around March 5, Russian forces shot and killed Volodymyr Rubailo, and seriously injured a 9-year-old girl who was with him in the arm, as they were running from Russian forces on Yablunska Street. Rubailo apparently died in front of an apartment building., Two witnesses, interviewed separately, said that neighbors took the girl into the basement of a nearby building, where they attempted to treat her wounds. Victoria, an emergency nurse who lives in a house next to that building, went to help two days later, when the girl’s condition deteriorated. Victoria said that the tissue of the girl’s shoulder had already begun to die and that the girl’s arm was later amputated at the hospital. Human Rights Watch was not able to identify the girl or verify this claim., Human Rights Watch, with another neighbor, Oleksii, 71, visited the site on April 5 where Rubailo and the girl were shot and observed large blood stains on the ground approximately 5 meters apart from one another., Missing Man Later Found Dead, A resident of Bucha, Oleh, 33, had been missing since March 19, said Luda, a neighbor. Twelve days later after the Russian forces had retreated, residents found his body under a pile of metal sheeting, meters from his apartment building, she said., Human Rights Watch visited the site where his body was allegedly found and saw a large blood stain. It was about 10 meters from the house where the commander of one of the Russian military units was reportedly staying, local residents said. Human Rights Watch visited that building and found Russian camouflage uniforms and ration packages. Satellite imagery collected on March 11 shows a military vehicle parked at the site where Oleh’s body was found., Human Rights Watch could not establish how long Oleh’s body had been where it was found, but the large amount of blood at the site suggests that he was either killed there or was placed there while severely injured. The continuous presence of Russian forces in that area means that they most likely would have known about the killing. It is unclear whether Russian forces made any attempt to locate Oleh’s family, but one resident interviewed said that Oleh’s wife learned of his death only after Russian troops had left and residents found the body., Russian Armored Vehicles Fire at a Woman with Bicycle, Killing Her, Iryna, the wife of Oleh Abramov, who was killed on March 5, said that she saw the body of a woman lying next to a bicycle a few meters from their gate, just after Russian forces shot and killed her husband and then ordered her to walk southeast down Yablunska Street., The woman near the bicycle is most likely the same person whose death was captured on aerial footage that was posted to Telegram on April 5. The video, analyzed by the New York Times, shows a cyclist dismount from their bicycle as she turns down Yablunska Street before being fired upon by two Russian armored vehicles. At least 19 military vehicles line Yablunska Street and the parallel streets., Satellite imagery analysis indicates that the aerial footage was recorded sometime between February 28 and March 9. Satellite imagery from February 28 shows the same destroyed armored vehicles that are visible in the footage, while imagery from March 9 shows destroyed houses that are still intact in the video., Victim-Activated Antipersonnel Mines and Booby Traps, Human Rights Watch spoke with the head of the Ukrainian government’s de-mining unit for Bucha region, Lt. Col. Roman Shutylo, as well as the commander of an anti-tank brigade assisting with demining in Bucha, Ihor Ostrovsky. Both reported that victim-activated booby traps had been used in the town. Shutylo said that on April 8 the deminers had found two dead bodies that had victim-activated booby traps placed on them. In total, they found 20 victim-activated booby traps and anti-personnel mines, including those constructed with the F-1 and RGD-5 fragmentation hand grenades, as well as MON-50, MON-100, and OZM-72 mines., Ostrovsky shared video of an ordnance item attached to wire, which he said was found in a yard in Bucha, that had been configured to detonate when enough tension is exerted on the wire. The de-mining team said they found at least one other similar device in a building that Russian troops had occupied. A third de-miner in Bucha showed Human Rights Watch a photograph on his phone that he took of one of the two victim-activated improvised explosive devices his team uncovered in Bucha., The 1997 International Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of antipersonnel mines and other devices such as victim-activated booby traps. While Ukraine signed the international mine ban treaty in 1999 and became a state party in 2006, Russia is not among the 164 countries that have joined the treaty., Looting by Russian Soldiers, Human Rights Watch found evidence in multiple locations across Bucha that Russian soldiers used and damaged homes, some of which they occupied, and also took provisions, household goods, and other personal belongings including valuables such as appliances, television sets, and jewelry. One man said that Russian soldiers broke in and looted his and his neighbor’s home after they had fled Bucha. In the homes, Human Rights Watch saw Russian equipment and bloodied bandages, as well as damage to the two properties., Denys said that he saw household items piled onto military vehicles as Russian forces left his neighborhood on March 31. “I was looking out of my house to see if I could see any of my personal belongings or my neighbors’ as they drove away,” he said. He added that the Russian forces who had entered his home used a grinder to open his personal safe where he kept important documents, and they also damaged numerous other items in his home., Tarasevych, who lived in another neighborhood, took a photograph on March 21 that Human Rights Watch reviewed of a Russian vehicle loaded with items on the roof, which included personal belongings of residents as the soldiers left the apartment complex that they had occupied. Tarasevych said that when another group of Russian soldiers left the same apartment complex on March 31 at about 5 a.m., they also carried away personal items from the apartments that they had occupied. “I saw trucks packed with big civilian bags, and it was obvious that it wasn’t military equipment,” he said. Human Rights Watch is aware of alleged intercepts and reports of Russian soldiers discussing luxury goods they have stolen to bring home, but has not been able to verify these reports., Russian Forces Endangering Civilians in Bucha, Based on interviews with residents, satellite imagery analysis, and site inspections, Human Rights Watch was able to trace the position of Russian forces at various stages during the time they occupied Bucha. Human Rights Watch heard that Russian soldiers ordered Ukrainian civilians to stay in residential buildings, but then positioned their personnel and equipment near those buildings during their occupation, thereby failing to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects., Satellite imagery collected on March 19 shows at least two military vehicles parked on the adjacent streets of an apartment complex 350 meters north of Yablunska Street. Satellite imagery collected on March 31 shows vehicle track marks on the pavement all around, indicating the regular passage of Russian military vehicles in that area. This is consistent with the videos and photos that Tarasevych shared. He took photos and videos of Russian personnel, military vehicles, and equipment during multiple days of the occupation. Russian forces also maintained an 82-millimeter mortar position about 20 meters from where civilians were living along Sadova Street., Human Rights Watch also found that Russian forces occupied the grounds of two schools in Bucha. At one location Human Rights Watch found extensive evidence that Russian forces had used it as a firing position for artillery., The Safe Schools Declaration, endorsed by Ukraine and 113 other countries but not Russia, says that countries should not use educational facilities for military purposes and should take other steps to protect education from attack., Evidence Preservation, From April 4 to 10, Human Rights Watch had access to sites where evidence of apparent war crimes remained after the Russian forces retreated, and was intermittently present during the handling of war crimes evidence in Bucha, including the exhumation of human bodies from a communal grave located next to the Church of St. Andrew and All Saints., On April 4, authorities removed the bodies of five men who appear to have been executed by Russian forces from the basement of one of the dormitories at a children’s camp on Vokzalna Street 123. Human Rights Watch, along with dozens of media personnel, were allowed to access the site prior to removal of the bodies but is not aware what steps were taken to log and preserve physical evidence at the site prior to being granted access. When the authorities removed the bodies, they placed them in the courtyard in open body bags. Officials then cut the zip ties off the wrists of four men in front of the media, discarding the zip ties on the ground. They were subsequently removed., For at least a week after the Russian forces retreated, bodies were strewn along the streets and in various other locations, with others hastily buried in shallow graves. Physical evidence, such as bloodied clothing and personal effects, were still at the sites where bodies were recovered. Other possible evidence, such as bullet casings, littered the streets of Bucha. Human Rights Watch is not aware of the steps taken by authorities to secure this evidence., On April 8, authorities began exhuming bodies from the communal grave located next to the Church of St. Andrew and All Saints. Human Rights Watch observed the exhumations on April 8 and 10 and saw that authorities were wearing protective clothing and engaged in photo and video documentation of the bodies throughout the process, recording information about each of the bodies before removing them from the site., Physical evidence will be most valuable for future war crimes prosecutions if it is well-documented and preserved as soon as possible following the commission of the alleged crimes, limiting opportunities for evidence to be damaged or destroyed. In addition to prioritizing efforts to document and preserve physical evidence in Bucha and other areas, Ukrainian authorities and their international partners should work to develop robust systems for storing and organizing evidence. Efforts should also be made to enhance coordination among the various actors supporting national, regional, and international investigations., Bolstering Accountability Efforts, Various national and international jurisdictions have opened investigations into apparent war crimes and other serious crimes committed in Ukraine, including Ukrainian authorities, the ICC, and third countries, such as Germany, using the principle of universal jurisdiction. The United Nations Human Rights Council also established a Commission of Inquiry into serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations in Ukraine, and its work could provide important assistance to the ICC and other judicial authorities., To support these and other accountability efforts, Ukraine should urgently ratify the ICC treaty and formally become a member of the court. National and international civil society have for years been pressing the authorities to join the court. Ukraine is not a member of the ICC, but it accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed on its territory since November 2013. On March 2, 2022, a group of ICC member countries referred the situation in Ukraine to the court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, for investigation. After receipt of the referral, Khan announced that his office would immediately proceed with an inquiry and has since traveled to Ukraine., A domestic law aligning Ukraine’s national legislation with international law is also needed to bolster national authorities’ ability to build the legal framework necessary to support the effective domestic investigation and prosecution of international crimes. The absence of domestic legislation has been one of the key barriers in domestic accountability efforts. A bill adopted by Ukraine’s parliament on May 20, 2021 could help authorities prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity domestically. However, it has not been signed into law by Ukraine’s president and there is no update on its status., Methodology, Human Rights Watch first traveled to Bucha on April 4 with an organized media tour that was mandated by the Ukrainian government for access to the area due to security. During that trip, the group was taken to see a children’s camp where five dead bodies lay in the basement of a building that was guarded by police. Human Rights Watch was able to visit multiple sites around Yabalunska Street without supervision., From April 5-10, Human Rights Watch worked alone and unhindered in Bucha, visiting sites and interviewing witnesses, victims, and local officials. During this time and thereafter, Human Rights Watch also analyzed satellite imagery and photos and videos provided directly by witnesses and victims, as well as those posted online., Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian with the assistance of an interpreter. Many of the people interviewed requested anonymity or use of only their first name due to security concerns. No benefits or compensation were offered or provided to people interviewed., Human Rights Watch previously started researching incidents in Bucha and environs from around March 7, while Russian forces still occupied the area, through telephone interviews and in-person interviews with people who had managed to flee the area.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-forces-trail-death-bucha

OSCE distributes awareness-raising materials to help Ukrainian civilians mitigate increased chemical security risks [EN/UK],News and Press Release,OSCE,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",20 Apr 2022,"The OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine has published a collection of leaflets and publications on chemical security risks to help civilians take care of their safety in the conditions of ongoing hostilities., “Military campaigns in such an industrialized country as Ukraine bear serious risks of incidents with the release of toxic chemicals, endangering people and the environment. Interruptions in work of enterprises, targeted or accidental hits of industrial facilities in the course of combat or as a result of air and rocket strikes – these factors increase chemical security risks immensely,” said Ambassador Henrik Villadsen, the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine., An assessment produced by Ukrainian State Emergency Service in 2018, mentioned that 655 facilities across the country stored more than 216,000 tons of dangerous chemicals. Research on the environmental impact of hostilities in Donbas, performed with the support of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator, highlighted severe chemical security concerns, as more than 500 major interruptions of work for enterprises in the eastern part of Ukraine were recorded between 2014 and 2017., The awareness-raising materials include a leaflet, “Chemical Incidents. Leaflet on Risks and Safety Measures” that provides generalized guidance on safety measures related to accidents with toxic substances. Four other leaflets contain specific guidance for occasions of release or spills of most widespread chemicals – ammonia, mercury, chlorine and nitric acid. They also contain practical advice on administering medical assistance in such cases. In addition, the Co-ordinator is organizing a webinar for journalists to help them better understand the risks in this context., The collection also contains publications, created specifically for the training of emergency response personnel, which will also be the basis for further production of awareness-raising materials and as a useful source of information for local authorities and other civilian services in planning measures in response to possible emergencies., These materials, updated according to the recent developments, were developed by the OSCE Project Co-ordinator with the financial support of the European Union, United States of America, and Germany as one of the project’s activities aimed at enhancing chemical safety and security in Ukraine., Contacts, Andrii Dziubenko

"Salesians provide education, socialization and ongoing support",News and Press Release,Salesians,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",20 Apr 2022,"(MissionNewswire) Salesian missionaries in Ukraine and bordering countries are supporting youth in their schools, centers and oratories. About 2,000 Ukrainian youth have received support from the Salesians in Ukraine, Poland and Slovakia. This does not account for youth who have fled to other countries in Europe. During this emergency, Salesians are focused on trying to help youth live as normal a life as possible through education, socialization and ongoing support., “First, our schools serve children during their normal hours of work,” explained Father George Menamparampil, head of the Salesian General Coordination for Emergency Response. “Furthermore, our oratories are open for children every day and for daytime activities. The minors who currently reside in Salesian homes receive lodging, food, and all the help they need 24 hours a day, including education, recreation, and the care that every child or young person needs.”, Salesian centers in Ukraine have all remained open. In an interview for Avvenire, the Catholic daily newspaper, Father Daniel Antúnez, president of Don Bosco Mission in Turin, Italy, who visited Salesian centers in Ukraine and Poland, said, “We asked ourselves what we could do and decided to make ourselves available to the people, those who were living there and those who have been displaced.”, Even while cities in Ukraine have been devastated by bombings and attacks, 680 youth — equal to 80 percent of students prior to the invasion — continue to attend classes at Salesian educational centers through distance learning. Oratories are providing support to 208 youth, and 70 children and older youth are taking shelter in Salesian centers and houses., In Poland, 398 Ukrainian youth are in Salesian schools, 309 are in oratories, and 210 are in Salesian homes. In Slovakia, there are 60 Ukrainian children in oratories and 50 have been welcomed into Salesian homes., While there is no official account of youth in Salesian programs in Moldova, it has been reported that the Salesian house in Chișinău is currently hosting close to 40 refugees, and since the beginning of the war, the Salesian center has offered care to more than 1,000 people., ###, Sources:, ANS Photo (usage permissions and guidelines must be requested from ANS), ANS – Ukraine – Salesian houses: oases always open to help and accompany young people, Salesian Missions",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/salesians-provide-education-socialization-and-ongoing-support
Hope still standing: MCC partner in Ukraine cares for the most vulnerable in Kharkiv,News and Press Release,MCC,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2022,"By Jason Dueck, On the day that rockets began to rain down onto Kharkiv, Ukraine, Pavel* and a group from his church stepped outside, raised their hands and prayed. They turned in faith to God, seeking the protection of a seniors' home, House of Hope. The residence is in a village close to Kharkiv, where Pavel has been providing relief for people fleeing the conflict. And after more than a month of the continued destruction in Kharkiv and the surrounding area, House of Hope is still standing., Still standing, too, is the hope that Pavel maintains. He is the leader of an MCC Ukrainian partner Kharkiv Independent ECB Churches (KECB), which works to support the elderly, the sick and the poor. KECB is helping the most vulnerable escape the danger of the conflict by moving them to smaller villages around Kharkiv that have been less directly targeted., Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city and has been the site of some of the worst destruction by Russian military forces. Much of the city that once was home to 1.4 million people has been reduced to unlivable rubble. Some 80% of the population has fled the city and the area around it. And while many have escaped to neighboring countries seeking refuge, many Ukrainians are unable to flee the death and destruction, particularly those who are disabled, sick or very old., KECB is based out of a village* near Kharkiv that is home to around 4,300 people. In addition to transporting people to safety, KECB is buying and making food and, more importantly, says Pavel, purchasing much-needed medicine., ""We have 47 people with epilepsy in this district and the authorities came to us with a request to help with medicine for these people. There are also 57 with diabetes, 54 with cancer, 27 including some children with asthma and 63 with thyroid conditions. We need very special medicine, not just what you buy when you have a cold."", Through the incredible outpouring of support from MCC donors across the world, KECB has received support to continue this life-saving work., ""For the people who are sick or disabled, it's very hard for them,"" says Pavel. ""We've taken people out of places that the battle lines are very close to, like Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Just yesterday, some brothers [from the church] set up a toilet so it could be adapted for those who can't move around on their own."", And for many of the people KECB is helping, physical needs are only one component of caring for them., ""There was an 84-year-old woman who was brought to us from the hospital. She did not see all the destruction and can't fully realize and believe that all this is actually happening. She needs to talk about it all the time. She has a house, which is now partially destroyed. She lives in the area of constant shelling, and it is not possible to return there now."", KECB's small fleet of vehicles travels to several villages in the area around Kharkiv every day, looking for anyone left behind who needs help. And through their base at House of Hope and the Christian school next door, they also prepare meals and food packages for as many people as they can, baking their own bread multiple times a day. Pavel says once the relief supplies have been distributed, the buckets that MCC relief kits are packaged in make great vessels for proofing large batches of dough., ""If we can't use all the bread in one day, we cut it and dry it so it can be eaten tomorrow or in the food packages,"" he says, holding up a five-gallon pail filled to the top with dried cubes of bread. ""And we've distributed more than 11,000 food packages so far."", *Last names and specific locations are not used for security purposes",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/hope-still-standing-mcc-partner-ukraine-cares-most-vulnerable-kharkiv

Yellen, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued additional public guidance, “Fact Sheet: Preserving Agricultural Trade, Access to Communication, and Other Support to Those Impacted by Russia’s War Against Ukraine”. This guidance outlines the many humanitarian and food-related authorizations issued by OFAC in support of people impacted by Russia’s war. At today’s meeting, attendees discussed the need for an urgent response to the threat of rising food insecurity exacerbated by Russia’s war against Ukraine. As part of that response, this guidance provides consolidated information for financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and market participants to more easily assess whether they are engaging in authorized or exempt transactions. In addition, OFAC issued a new Russia-related general license (GL) to authorize transactions related to certain activities of NGOs in Russia and Ukraine., Beyond its toll on human life, Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing significant harm in the region and the rest of the world. It has disrupted supply chains of agricultural commodities, destroyed agricultural and transportation infrastructure in Ukraine, and driven up food and energy costs, putting millions at increased risk of food insecurity. Treasury is deeply concerned about the risks to global food supplies and food prices brought on by Putin’s war at a time when many emerging market and developing countries are still struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic., Since the start of Russia’s further invasion in February 2022, the United States and its allies and partners have sought to hold Russia accountable through expansive financial pressure while seeking to minimize spillover effects around the world. To that end, OFAC has issued many general licenses (GLs) to mitigate unintended effects of sanctions imposed by the United States on Russia. In particular, Treasury has focused on preserving global food supply chains through GL 6A, which provides, among other things, a carve-out for transactions related to the exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities to, from, or transiting Russia., Across multiple sanctions programs, Treasury has also issued humanitarian-related or other GLs in support of the people impacted by Russia’s war related to:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fact-sheet-preserving-agricultural-trade-access-communication-and-other-support-those

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 19 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,20 Apr 2022,"Date: 20 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 19 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 5,121 civilian casualties in the country: 2,224 killed and 2,897 injured. This included:, a total of 2,224 killed (631 men, 383 women, 42 girls, and 61 boys, as well as 70 children and 1,037 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,897 injured (335 men, 271 women, 59 girls, and 64 boys, as well as 157 children and 2,011 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,228 casualties (825 killed and 1,403 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,824 casualties (746 killed and 1,078 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 404 casualties (79 killed and 325 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,893 casualties (1,399 killed and 1,494 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 20 April (local time), 205 children had been killed and 373 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-19-april-2022-enruuk

Over 4 million have fled the country as refugees. 7.1 million are estimated to be internally displaced. This represents over a quarter of the Ukrainian population, a level of displacement that was only witnessed in Syria after a decade of conflict. The intense military escalation has resulted in loss of life, injuries and mass movement of civilian populations throughout the country and across borders, as well as in the severe destruction of civilian infrastructure and residential housing., Hard to reach populations in conflict-affected urban centers in the north, east and south of Ukraine continue to have most serious needs, with residents facing critical shortages of food, water, medicine, and electricity. Many people are unable to seek safe haven through humanitarian corridors or reside in areas that have been by conflict without access to essential services or markets. The delivery of immediate life-saving food assistance for populations in encircled, partially encircled and recently devastated cities is of paramount importance., Conflict-affected populations are starting to deploy coping strategies, such as cutting down on meals or limiting portion sizes. Almost half of all internally displaced persons (IDPs) are worried about not having enough to eat in coming days, and 1 on 3 reported that they ate less than two meals per day., Exceptional efforts are being undertaken to ensure humanitarian assistance is targeted to the most vulnerable populations in line with humanitarian principles and regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with a focus on providing critical support to women, children, older and disabled people directly affected by the current conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-addressing-acute-needs-protecting-displaced-populations-and

SC/14865
19 APRIL 2022, Voicing Shock at Escalating Violence, Massive Displacement, Speakers Urge Nationwide Ceasefire, As the humanitarian situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate — at an alarming scale and speed of displacement not seen since the Second World War — briefers and delegates in the Council today called for the Russian Federation to uphold their international-law obligations, cease attacks on civilians and end the war., Kelly T. Clements, United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, briefed the Council via video-teleconference from Hungary, where almost a half million Ukrainians have fled — a fraction of the almost 5 million who have been forced to leave their country and the 7 million people displaced within Ukraine. The United Nations also estimates that 13 million more Ukrainians are in the hardest hit areas, many unable to move and difficult to safely reach with aid. The sheer scale and speed of displacement are immense, with women, children, and the aged having left behind their homes, lives, sons, fathers and husbands, forced to make impossible, heart-breaking decisions., However, she cited remarkable acts of humanity in many States, with borders kept open and local authorities, communities and individuals providing food, medicine, transportation and a place to sleep. While commending the courage and strength of the refugees themselves, she recalled that Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator, had described the chilling scene in Bucha in the Council last week. As well, Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, called for the Government of Ukraine to scale up assistance to reach 360,000 people inside the country. “But no pile of blankets, no sum of cash, no amount of medicine is going to halt the death and destruction,” she emphasized, adding: “While we will continue our job to deliver aid, we need this Council to do its job too” — calling on all Member States to find a way to end this horrific and senseless war., Antonio Vitorino, Director-General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), also briefing the Council via video-teleconference, noted that more than one quarter of Ukraine’s total population has been forced to leave their homes in little more than seven weeks — a speed and magnitude of displacement not seen in Europe since the end of the Second World War. Expressing concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he called on parties to the conflict to uphold their international-law obligations to protect civilians, their homes and civilian infrastructure. The situation of women and children is particularly concerning; trafficking in persons was a known phenomenon in the region. He urged all neighbouring and impacted countries to ensure the immediate identification and registration of unaccompanied and separated children fleeing from Ukraine., Because internally displaced people tend to move to urban areas in search of work opportunities and social services, he highlighted the urgent need to scale-up services to meet the needs of an increased population. Cash-based interventions are one of the most efficient and effective ways to reach people in need both inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. The IOM has already started providing multi-purpose cash assistance in Ukraine and in several neighbouring countries, intending to reach up to 500,000 individuals in the next three months. Moving forward, it is necessary to better understand the intentions of those fleeing., In the ensuing debate, Council members stressed the importance of the Secretary-General’s call for a nationwide ceasefire, voicing their shock at the destruction of Bucha and Mariupol and the escalating violence in the Donbas region. A number of delegates highlighted the dangers of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and human trafficking driven by the displacement throughout Ukraine., Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Ireland, reporting on his visit to Ukraine last week, said that Bucha now lies in ruins, “with the stench of burning buildings and bodies in the air”. Remarking that he knows the difference between truth and staged propaganda, he emphasized that there was nothing fabricated about what he had seen. “I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued,” he told the Council. Out of those bodies, 503 civilians had been identified, along with just four combatants. He stressed that in all situations where war crimes may have been committed, timely, credible investigations must be undertaken. While it has been said that “peace is only possible after the battle for Donbas”, he pointed out that such logic leads directly to further death, suffering and displacement., Echoing those concerns, the representative of Albania said: “We are running out of words” to describe the continued human suffering and deliberate large-scale destruction in Ukraine. “But we are not running out of rage and condemnation for what should have never happened in the first place,” he added. Everything is under attack in Ukraine — freedom, property, rights and life itself — amidst alarming reports of arbitrary detention and forced deportation. Underscoring that the events of the last seven weeks show that misreading history leads to disaster, he recalled Joseph Stalin’s failed invasion of Finland in November 1939. “No might can defeat the brave hearts of the right,” he said., Kenya’s representative commended the rapid mobilization of humanitarian actors, urging them to redouble their efforts to ensure that refugees from Ukraine are protected from forms of modern slavery, such as forced labour and forced marriage. He stressed that the Russian Federation must end the war and return to its critical responsibility of protecting international peace and security., However, the delegate of China — emphasizing the need for diplomatic negotiation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine towards a ceasefire — underscored that all other parties must also focus on supporting that goal, as continuing to send weapons will only escalate the conflict and aggravate the humanitarian catastrophe. The international community should also eliminate the negative impact of sanctions, work to keep the prices of food and energy stable and avoid unnecessary export restrictions. The arbitrary freeze of foreign exchange reserves is a violation of sovereignty “tantamount to weaponizing economic independence”, he added., The Russian Federation’s representative, reporting that his country’s economy is doing fine under sanctions, with new developments and reliable partners, said that the President of the Council tried to portray Ukraine as “some kind of pure, innocent white lamb”, while ignoring its eight-year war against its own residents in the east. It was an attempt to rewrite history and omit the role of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in liberating Europe and the world from fascism. The only State that is losing is Ukraine, he said — which ordinary Ukrainians understand, having faced not terror or shelling, but just ruthless indifference by Ukrainian neo-Nazis and radicals. The objectives of the special military operation will certainly be achieved, he stressed., Ukraine’s representative said that with the battle for Ukrainian Donbas unfolding, Russian forces are trying to raze towns to the ground, Mariupol being the most critical situation. Filtration camps and torture chambers are being set up in Russian Federation-controlled areas, forcibly transferring citizens to Russian Federation territory — with 20,000 people kept in one camp, and 5,000 to 7,000 in another. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been forcibly transferred, which qualifies as kidnapping, with 5 million people turned into refugees and 7 million displaced, including 2.5 million children. Calling on the Council to save innocent civilians, he pointed out that the 15-nation organ has held more than a dozen meetings on the aggression on Ukraine since January. Yet it failed to prevent the war and is still failing now. He urged the Council to address the Russian Federation’s dubious presence as a full and legitimate permanent member, adding that that country must be stopped., Also speaking today were the representatives of Mexico, France, Gabon, Norway, United States, Brazil, India, Ghana, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Sweden (also for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway), Italy, Poland, Estonia (also for Latvia and Lithuania) and Slovakia., The meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 5:44 p.m., Briefings, KELLY T. CLEMENTS, United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, spoke via video teleconference from Hungary, where almost a half million Ukrainians have fled, a fraction of the almost 5 million who have been forced to leave their country. In addition, over 7 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. The United Nations also estimates that 13 million more are in the hardest hit areas, many unable to move and difficult to reach with aid safely. Having also visited the Czech Republic and Austria, she said the compassion and solidarity in those and other countries continues to be unprecedented., While the sheer scale and speed of displacement is immense, she noted that those figures mean United Nations teams on the ground continue to be confronted by the same scenes and shared stories, with women, children, and the aged having left behind their homes, lives, sons, fathers and husbands. She cited the story of Lupa, 25, of Odessa, forced to leave her father, a military reservist, there with her mother, while her grandmother west of Mariupol has been completely unreachable since the war began two months ago. Each of the millions displaced have been forced to make impossible, heart-breaking decisions, leaving behind almost everything they hold dear., However, she pointed out that there have also been remarkable acts of humanity in many States, with messages of support posted everywhere, and local authorities, communities and individuals providing food, medicine, transportation and a place to sleep. Borders have been kept open and those seeking safety are given protection and aid. She called for that to continue in a non-discriminatory manner for all in need and cited the strength and composure of the refugees themselves, showing courage, many staying close to Ukraine and hoping to return as soon as possible., She noted that Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator, had addressed the Council last week, describing the chilling scene in Bucha and throughout Ukraine, with dire humanitarian conditions for civilians forced to withstand fighting. He had also spotlighted the tireless efforts to help besieged people in areas like Mariupol. Two weeks ago, Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, called for the Government of Ukraine to scale up assistance to reach 360,000 people inside the country. She reported that the Agency will continue to expand lifesaving aid throughout the country — especially in the centre and the East, where a brutal humanitarian nightmare is unfolding, requiring not just resources, but safe and unhindered access to people in need. People are still fleeing, she stressed — and not just from Ukraine but Yemen, Myanmar, Ethiopia, Syria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Council must consider the needs of all refugees worldwide., In Ukraine, the vast majority of those on the move are women and children, and the risks of gender-based violence, trafficking, and sexual exploitation and abuse are high, she said. The Agency, along with the International Organization for Migration, is working to prevent, mitigate and respond to sexual trafficking and other risks. Their efforts also aim to strengthen gender-based violence programmes, deploying expert coordinators to prevent sexual exploitation, and partnering with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on safe spaces called “Blue Dots” at main border crossing points. However, she called on States to play the strongest role, ending the impunity of traffickers and identifying international protection needs of survivors and persons at risk., “But no pile of blankets, no sum of cash, no amount of medicine, is going to halt the death and destruction,” she emphasized, adding: “While we will continue our job to deliver aid, we need this Council to do its job too.” When the High Commissioner last addressed the Council, he warned that without an immediate end to the shelling, they were planning for up to 4 million refugees; eight weeks into the conflict, there are 5 million and counting. Despite the deep divisions in the Council, she called on all Member States to find a way to end this horrific and senseless war., ANTÓNIO VITORINO, Director-General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), also speaking via video-teleconference, noted that more than one quarter of Ukraine’s total population has been forced to leave their homes in little more than seven weeks. The speed and magnitude of this displacement had not been seen in Europe since the end of the Second World War. Expressing concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he said that the increased targeting of cities will lead to more suffering, civilian casualties and displacement, both internal and external. Against that backdrop, he called on parties to the conflict to uphold their international-law obligations to protect civilians, their homes and civilian infrastructure., He then highlighted several specific risks faced by internally displaced people, refugees and third-country nationals. In situations of mass displacement, up to 30 per cent of the population will experience some form of negative psychological impact. Of particular concern is the situation of women and children who have fled or been displaced; trafficking in persons was a known phenomenon in the region and past crises have demonstrated that large-scale displacement, family separation and disruption of civil protection and community networks render these individuals vulnerable to violence, exploitation and abuse. He urged all neighbouring and impacted countries to ensure the immediate identification and registration of unaccompanied and separated children fleeing from Ukraine., Also underscoring that internally displaced people tend to move to urban areas in search of work opportunities and social services, he pointed out the urgent need to scale up services to meet the needs of an increased population in that regard. Cash-based interventions are one of the most feasible, efficient and effective ways to reach people in need both inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. For its part, the International Organization for Migration has already started providing multi-purpose cash assistance in Ukraine and in several neighbouring countries and, with its partners, intends to reach up to 500,000 individuals in the next three months., He went on to say that, moving forward, it is necessary to better understand the intentions of those fleeing, those forced to leave their homes and those who have been separated from their families due to the ongoing conflict. IOM will continue, through its teams on the ground, to collect and disseminate information critical to this effort to ensure that targeted actions are taken to improve the well-being of all those affected by the war. As more displacements are likely, it is also crucial to plan ahead and ensure that all those fleeing the war have access to adequate support and services. He added that IOM stands ready to assist those — notably, third-country nationals — who have fled Ukraine but may not always benefit from the European Union’s temporary-protective directive., Statements, SIMON COVENEY, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Ireland, said that he travelled to Kyiv last week to see for himself the situation on the ground. “What I saw was profoundly shocking”, he said. Bucha now lies in ruins, “with the stench of burning buildings and bodies in the air”. Hundreds of family homes, shops and other civilian infrastructure have been blackened, burned, looted, damaged and destroyed. Family cars were riddled with bullets and had windshields smashed, with bloodstains still evident. Remarking that he knew the difference between truth and staged propaganda, he emphasized that there was nothing fabricated about what he had seen. “I stood at the edge of one of the mass graves, where the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued,” he said. Out of those bodies, 503 civilians had been identified, along with just four combatants. Noting the use of explosive weapons — including prohibited cluster munitions — he said that it speaks to “an utter disregard by Russian forces for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians”., During his visit, people spoke with him about the urgent need for accountability, he continued. Thus, in all situations where war crimes may have been committed, timely, credible investigations must be undertaken. The Russian Federation’s war has driven millions of Ukrainians from their homes. Almost 5 million people have become refugees and over 7 million have been displaced within Ukraine. The humanitarian consequences of the war are being felt thousands of miles from Ukraine. The prices of wheat and oil have risen by 300 per cent in Somalia, where more than 700,000 people are already displaced by drought. Wheat reserves in Palestine could be depleted in as little as three weeks. He also noted that some progress has been made in Istanbul between the parties on key issues and there is a basis for a peace agreement. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has constantly remained open to diplomatic solutions, in the face of aggression and brutality against the people of Ukraine. It has been said in many quarters that “peace is only possible after the battle for Donbas”, he said, noting that he cannot accept that logic, as it leads directly to further death, suffering and displacement. The Security Council must challenge that thinking and demand more., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said his country and France had requested today’s meeting in light of the many humanitarian consequences of the Ukraine conflict. With those in the east forced to flee west, he cited the deplorable recent attack on a city that has welcomed hundreds of internally displaced persons. With 7 million displaced and 5 million refugees, 90 per cent of them women and children exposed to abuses, he stressed that all measures must be taken by the Council to prevent gender-based violence and human trafficking. He recognized crucial and laudable efforts to provide mental health and psychosocial support and the “Blue Dots” programme, as well as the solidarity shown by neighbouring States welcoming millions of refugees. However, there is no justification for the horrific images of discrimination and xenophobia against third-country nationals seeking refuge. Voicing support for the Secretary-General’s new call for a humanitarian pause, and the need to investigate any incident, he stressed the need for safe, unimpeded humanitarian access. He called for an end to the war and support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) stressed that the international community’s efforts must focus on delivering assistance and aiding refugees without discrimination, as the ongoing Russian aggression will inevitably continue to force displacement. Highlighting the European Union’s temporary-protection directive, he said the same has delivered prompt assistance to those fleeing the war, providing refugees inside the European Union with access to education, medical care and employment. He went on to say that the Russian army has been killing civilians, journalists and humanitarian and medical personnel for nearly two months, as well as destroying schools, water infrastructure and hospitals. He also underscored that the murder and maiming of children, along with attacks targeting schools and hospitals, are grave crimes that will not go unpunished. Calling on the Russian Federation to respect the International Court of Justice’s ruling and end its war of aggression against Ukraine, he spotlighted the overriding need to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian access., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that day-to-day there is a heavier toll caused by the war in Ukraine; some 12 million people have been impacted since the beginning of hostilities. There are over 4 million refugees, mostly women and children, who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, including 200,000 citizens from other countries, who do not deserve less compassion than other victims of the war. The welcoming ability of United Nations agencies can barely cover the needs of the number of people on the move and humanitarian organizations in and around Ukraine are all at bursting point, he said, expressing support for all humanitarian workers and applauding the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and IOM. Without this assistance, the daily life of refugees would be even worse. Noting that the Council had recently met to address allegations of sexual crimes and the risk of trafficking, he underscored that it is now common for trafficking networks to become “vultures” towards those who are without defence and need protection. Vigilance is needed in order to stop them in their tracks and stop all these networks, be they in Ukraine or elsewhere, he cautioned., MONA JUUL (Norway) said her delegation is appalled by the Russian Federation’s ongoing offensive in Donbas and the relentless attacks against civilians and vital civilian infrastructure across Ukraine, including in urban areas. “Russia has intentionally created a humanitarian disaster,” she said, calling for an end to all attacks on civilians and welcoming the investigations of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity opened by the International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor, as well as the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry for Ukraine. Joining other speakers in echoing the Secretary-General’s call for a humanitarian pause, she said the sheer scale of the crisis demands protection responses at unprecedented levels. All countries receiving displaced people must ensure their immediate identification and registration and put in place measures to protect them from further risks and harm. Further, access to education and health services — including for sexual and reproductive health — must be a top priority., DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said that since 2014 his country has suffered the consequences of the deteriorating situation of Ukraine, due to the anti-constitutional coup, a war on the Russian language and the destruction of the residents of the East from the Maidan lawlessness. As well, since 2014, at least 1.7 million people have turned to the Russian Federation for citizenship or refuge after shelling of Donbas by Ukrainians. The mass exodus of Ukrainians is nothing new; the population went from 54 to 41 million between 1990 and 2021. Western colleagues overlook the corruption and political murders, repression of opposition leaders and closure of media outlets in that country. The President of the Council tried to portray Ukraine as “some kind of pure, innocent white lamb”, which does not include the eight-year war against its own residents in the east. Efforts to depict events since 24 February as a war of choice hypocritically make it appear as if nothing worse transpired in the world since the Second World War, he said, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of victims of Western aggression in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. This was an attempt to rewrite history and omit the role of the Union of Soviet Socials Republics in liberating Europe and the world from fascism, he said, adding that such a view also overlooks the Nazism in Ukraine, one of reasons for the current special military operation., Weapons producers “are eagerly rubbing their hands over increased profits”, he continued, noting stock in the leading United Kingdom producer, BAE Systems, has increased by 24 per cent. The same trends were occurring in the United States war industry — to the delight of Eastern European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) looking to rid themselves of obsolete Russian weapons. Meanwhile, they were sending obsolete equipment to Ukraine, which he said the Russian Federation will “grind and crush”. Washington also intends to have other States become addicted to its gas products, which are more expensive than those of the Russian Federation. However, the Russian Federation economy is doing fine under sanctions, with new developments and reliable partners. The only State that is losing is Ukraine, which ordinary Ukrainians understand. They have not been experiencing terror or shelling — just ruthless indifference by Ukrainian neo-Nazis and radicals. Incidents in Bucha and Mariupol are reminiscent of the tradition of Joseph Goebbels. The special operation does not seek support from the Security Council, he said, pointing out that they are using it as a geopolitical game with Ukraine as a mere pawn. Under those circumstances, calls for a ceasefire sound mendacious, allowing radicals to regroup and receive more weapons. The objectives of the special military operation will certainly be achieved, he stressed., ZHANG JUN (China), underscoring the importance of reducing harm to civilians, called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint, protect civilians, facilitate humanitarian-assistance operations and strengthen communication on humanitarian issues. Further, the international community should bolster coordination and provide increased support to refugee-receiving countries in the spirit of shared responsibility. All refugees — regardless of nationality, race or religion — should be treated equally, and the international community must combat human trafficking and other criminal activities targeting women and children seeking refuge. He also stressed the need to urgently promote diplomatic negotiation, calling on the Russian Federation and Ukraine to work towards a ceasefire. All other parties must focus on supporting the same, as continuing to send weapons will not bring peace; rather, it will only escalate the conflict and aggravate the humanitarian catastrophe. The international community should also eliminate the negative impact of sanctions, work to keep the prices of food and energy stable and avoid unnecessary export restrictions. The arbitrary freeze of foreign exchange reserves also constitutes a violation of sovereignty and is “tantamount to weaponizing economic independence”, he added., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that she was heartbroken to hear about the Caritas aid workers killed in Mariupol. “Their deaths are tragic and unacceptable,” she said. Humanitarian workers are impartial and save lives. They should be protected and not shelled indiscriminately. The Russian Federation’s war keeps generating new sobering milestones. Some 5 million refugees have left, and the number of internally displaced persons is even greater, she said, adding that such numbers are alarming. She thanked the countries who have taken in the vast number of refugees, noting that when she visited the Republic of Moldova and Romania she saw the difficulty of integrating refugees in a short period of time. Yet, those countries have shown the world what it means to be hospitable and kind. Many refugees from Ukraine are also being hosted by other European countries, and the United States is welcoming up to 100,000 Ukrainians and funding efforts to support all those who have fled. Nonetheless, just as much support and grace needs to be given to the many third-country nationals fleeing Ukraine. The threat of human trafficking also needs to be addressed. Because refugees have limited access to resources — including employment — they are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, she said, noting that women and children make up 90 per cent of the refugee population., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil), noting that Europe is facing the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War, voiced concern that nearly one quarter of Ukraine’s population has been displaced. Many more may follow. All parties have an obligation to protect civilians and their infrastructure and allow unimpeded humanitarian access, especially in eastern Ukraine. However, only a nationwide ceasefire will allow for civilians to have real protection. The conflict is creating a looming food crisis, with Ukraine’s productive capacities on one side and unilateral sanctions on the other, while developing countries still struggle with the consequences of the pandemic. The World Food Programme announcement of a reduction of aid to Africa and the Middle East illustrates the problem, he said, stressing that the world should not take from the hungry to feed the starving. Developing States host 85 per cent of refugees, while food prices are 40 per cent higher than last year. Further, fertilizer prices have doubled. Noting that since 3 March Brazilian embassies in several countries in the conflict region have granted special visas for displaced Ukrainians, he stated that no person fleeing armed conflicts should ever face discrimination, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality or any other status., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) called for guarantees of safe passage to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies, especially through the establishment of permanent humanitarian corridors. India has ensured the safe return of 22,500 Indians from Ukraine through “Operation Ganga” and has helped nationals from 18 other countries in that process. He also drew attention to rising food and energy costs in emphasizing the collective interest of working both inside and outside the United Nations to resolve the situation. He welcomed the recommendation by the Global Crisis Response Group to exempt World Food Programme food purchases from export restrictions, with immediate effect, adding that the growing shortages can only be addressed by “going beyond constraints that bind us presently”. He called for an immediate halt to the violence and pursuit of diplomacy and dialogue. “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option,” he insisted., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), observing that every briefer echoes the same concerns, pointed out that “we are running out of words” to describe the continued human suffering and deliberate large-scale destruction in Ukraine. “But we are not running out of rage and condemnation for what should have never happened in the first place”, he added. Much of Ukraine’s population have been forced to leave everything behind, have lost their homes, been deprived of their dreams and have only been left with “made-in-Russia nightmares”, he said. Everything is under attack in Ukraine — freedom, property, rights and life itself — amidst alarming reports of arbitrary detention, forced deportation and increased conflict-related sexual violence. These acts are appalling and must be investigated, as accountability is essential to suppressing and preventing acts of aggression. Underscoring that the events of the last seven weeks show that reality is hard to deny, and that misreading history leads to disaster, he recalled Joseph Stalin’s failed invasion of Finland in November 1939. “No might can defeat the brave hearts of the right,” he said., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said that in just seven weeks, almost 5 million people in Ukraine have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries. He commended the willingness of those countries for opening their borders to receive the exodus of people arriving daily. Reports of discriminatory treatment of third-party nationals in their attempts to cross the borders into neighbouring countries were concerning, he said, condemning treatment based on race or nationality and calling for the equal treatment of all refugees. He urged countries to refrain from enforced deportations and instead provide third-party nationals with information to remain or to return voluntarily to their home country. He called for the prioritizing of the sick, women, children and the elderly, among others. Cases of trafficking and sexual violence against women and girls must be investigated and the perpetrators held to account. There must be negotiated humanitarian pauses for the safe passage of persons leaving the war-torn country. He also called on parties to respect their obligations under international law and refrain from attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), commending the rapid mobilization of humanitarian actors in and around Ukraine, urged them to redouble their efforts to ensure that refugees from Ukraine are protected from forms of modern slavery, such as forced labour and forced marriage. The security services of receiving countries should also make every effort to ensure that those victims of war are protected, without discrimination based on race, national origin or religion. He called on the Russian Federation to end the war and return to its critical responsibility of protecting international peace and security. Continuing the current course will only lead to more suffering and a steady erosion of the legitimacy and status of the United Nations — “no matter its efforts to provide humanitarian relief”. Also calling for safe humanitarian corridors in Mariupol, Kherson and other besieged cities, he added that the African nationals trapped there must be protected by all actors., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), observing that more than a quarter of Ukrainians have fled their homes during the conflict, noted that 90 per cent are women and children. Calling on all parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, he reiterated the importance of an immediate cessation of hostilities. Dialogue remains the only way to sustainably end the conflict, he said, stressing the need to ensure women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all peace efforts. He went on to commend neighbouring countries in hosting large numbers of refugees, particularly Poland and Romania who, together, have taken in more than 3.4 million Ukrainians, and the Republic of Moldova, which has taken in more than 400,000 refugees, amounting to 15 per cent of its total population. Also commending the European Union for its ongoing support amid the refugee crisis, he called for pathways to allow civilians to safely and voluntarily evacuate and for humanitarian aid to reach those in need. Because of the increasing reports of human trafficking among refugees, he emphasized the need to ensure structured systems are in place at border crossings. The humanitarian response to Ukraine must include the voices of women, he said. He also underlined the need to address the global impacts of the conflict in Ukraine urgently and effectively, pointing to the sharp rise in food and commodity prices in many countries., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), Council President for April, spoke in her national capacity, noting that millions of Ukrainians face even more suffering as the Russian Federation begins a new offensive in the Donbas region. Against that backdrop, humanitarian considerations must be guided by two overarching principles — the protection of innocent civilians and prosecution of war crimes. The majority of those displaced after 55 days of war are women and girls, as well as members of other vulnerable groups such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and third-country nationals. Many innocent Ukrainians have been forcibly deported, against their will, to the Russian Federation. “We all have a responsibility to put an end to this suffering,” she emphasized, noting that the United Kingdom has pledged nearly £400 million in aid to Ukraine and is a leading humanitarian donor, providing £220 million in humanitarian assistance to countries receiving and hosting refugees. Echoing calls for a humanitarian pause to help civilians in the hardest-hit areas, she added that “Ukraine is now a crime scene.” Justice must be sought for the crimes against humanity committed there., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), describing how surgeons in Lviv operated on a three-year-old boy, internally displaced from Kharkiv, who survived a missile strike, asked ”Putin’s representative” how that attempted murder was protecting Donbas from neo-Nazis. The question, he noted, would just produce another lie to justify the unjustifiable. The Russian Federation Sixty-Fourth Brigade, cited for mass heroism and valour by President Putin, had been deployed in Bucha in March for a month of terror, its soldiers already identified as responsible for mass atrocities. Observing that the Russian interpretation of heroism and courage includes killing and rape, he commented on the troops’ “tenacity” in keeping their lootings while fleeing Ukrainian forces and leaving behind their munitions. Stolen items included computers, phones, televisions and even toilets, as about one quarter of Russian Federation residents still do not have access to indoor plumbing. With the battle for Ukrainian Donbas unfolding, Russian forces are trying to raze towns to the ground, Mariupol being the most critical situation, with thousands remaining in shelter in the Azovstal plant while the Russian Federation shells and denies humanitarian convoys., Calling on the Council to save the innocent civilians, he acknowledged the Secretary-General’s call for a humanitarian pause. However, he noted the “Putinite” in the Council had said calls for a ceasefire sound false and insincere — “followed by a torrent of tommyrot and drivel”. Calling for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide special cash assistance for internally displaced persons, he stressed that the magnitude of the crisis requires scaled-up humanitarian response and aid. Filtration camps and torture chambers are being set up in Russian Federation-controlled areas, forcibly transferring citizens to Russian Federation territory — with 20,000 people kept in one camp, and 5,000 to 7,000 in another. More than 500,000 Ukrainians have been forcibly transferred, which qualifies as kidnapping, with 5 million people turned into refugees and 7 million displaced, including 2.5 million children. Noting that since January the Council has held more than a dozen meetings on the Russian Federation aggression on Ukraine, he asked how many will be held without changing that State’s role. The Council failed to prevent the war and is still failing now, while the subjects of a future war trial are still making statements in the chamber. He urged the Council to address the Russian Federation’s dubious presence as a full and legitimate permanent member, adding that that country must be stopped., ANNA KARIN ENESTRÖM (Sweden), also speaking for Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway, pointed out that the humanitarian efforts have been dwarfed by Russian aggression against Ukraine. Commending the generosity of neighbouring countries hosting refugees from Ukraine, she noted that the bloc has mustered an impressive response to the initial humanitarian appeal of $1.1 billion. To further improve the efficiency of humanitarian work, she noted that safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access must be granted, not least to the hardest-hit areas, but also to places such as Mariupol and Kharkiv. She also welcomed the efforts to negotiate a humanitarian ceasefire., Protection and assistance must take into account the needs of everyone living in a situation of vulnerability, she added, pointing to the heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence and difficulty faced by people with disabilities when evacuating. Civilians must never be a target, and civilian infrastructure must be protected. “No amount of denial and disinformation will prevent accountability for serious international crimes, including war crimes,” she said, recalling the two resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the order by the International Court of Justice recently, which urge the Russian Federation to stop the war. However, she stated: “This aggression should have never had been launched in the first place and it must end now. It is never too late to make the right choice.”, MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy) expressed deep concern over repeated attacks on civilians and over reports of war crimes and other serious violations of international law perpetrated by the Russian armed forces. Pointing out that human displacement is an inevitable reaction to the scourge of war, he said that, even though numbers of internally displaced persons and refugees are already shocking, “they continue to grow as we speak”. For its part, Italy has contributed €20 million to the United Nations flash appeal and €6 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist the same. Further, it has welcomed almost 100,000 refugees from Ukraine. He stressed, however, that this crisis is one of protection for women and children — who constitute 90 per cent of those fleeing the war — as they are subject to the risks of trafficking, violence and psychological trauma. Given the gender profile of the refugee outflow, these risks are incredibly high. He went on to say that testimonies of rape and sexual violence perpetrated by Russian troops are disturbing, underscoring that full accountability must be ensured for individuals committing such violations to avoid any form of impunity., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) noted that his country remains open to those fleeing the atrocities of the Russian aggression. With almost 15 million households in Poland, nearly 3 million people from Ukraine have been welcomed in; that means that 1 in 5 Polish families lives now with guests from abroad. However, despite the exceptional outpouring of solidarity and political support from many corners of the world — as well as condemnations of the aggressor and sanctions imposed on Moscow — it is obvious that Poland and other neighbouring countries will not be able to shoulder the burden of the crisis on their own. More coordination is needed, he said, recalling that since the start of the war the Government of Poland, non-governmental organizations and individuals have been delivering aid to Ukraine and helping to facilitate aid from other countries., Urging the United Nations and its partners to use the well-functioning logistical systems in Poland and Ukraine to step up their efforts, he said Poland today announced the opening of its first “container town” for internally displaced persons in Lviv, as well as similar projects to be launched around Kyiv. There is also an urgent need to adequately respond to and prevent the risks related to displacement, such as human trafficking and abuse, he said, noting that the Polish Border Guard, police and other authorities have increased their efforts in that regard. “In view of this enormous humanitarian crisis, much more can be done by the international community to respond to rapidly raising challenges,” he said, spotlighting an upcoming donors conference on 5 May — organized by Poland and Sweden — and encouraging States to make broad, high-level and generous contributions., SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia), also speaking for Latvia and Lithuania, said that 5 million people have been forced to flee Ukraine in less than two months, most of them women and children. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania continued to assist the nearly 110,000 refugees arriving in their countries, sending medical and shelter supplies, food aid, and other support. Their combined humanitarian assistance, including from the State and individuals, companies and civil society organizations amounts to £66 million. One in every three Estonians has made a charitable donation to help the people in Ukraine, he said, including their support to the United Nations Humanitarian Flash Appeal and the Regional Refugee Response Plan, as well as to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross., He went on to express concern about the reports of Ukrainians, including children, forcibly moved to “filtration camps” and then to the territory of the Russian Federation, often without their parents. Describing the humanitarian situation of those trapped in the sieged cities as “hell”, he called for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Mariupol and other besieged cities, as well as safe passage to allow civilians to safely and voluntarily leave conflict-affected areas. Spotlighting the country bloc’s support for the international mechanisms on the investigation concerning alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine, he underlined the importance of continued United Nations monitoring, documenting and reporting on violations against civilians, including women and children., RÓBERT CHATRNÚCH (Slovakia) said that the Security Council has held multiple meetings because of the Russian Federation’s decision to start a senseless war. The consequences of this aggression are unprecedented and outrageous. The briefers have confirmed grave concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he said, noting the growing number of civilian causalities and damage to civilian infrastructure. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2072 civilians have been killed since the war began and the reality will be much worse. He expressed his alarm over the refugee crisis that is the result of the Russian Federation’s aggression., Since the beginning of the aggression, about 345,000 refugees have entered Slovakia, he continued. His Government has adopted numerous legislative measures for refuge for people crossing its border. Further, 7,000 children from Ukraine are receiving education in Slovakia’s schools. His country is determined to provide humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people and it stands with them in challenging times. Causing this suffering is barbaric and the aggressor accountable for this situation is evident, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to cease its hostilities against Ukraine, particularly its attacks against civilians and civilian objects. The Russian Federation should implement the humanitarian resolution passed by the General Assembly on 24 March 2022, he said., * *** *, For information media.

"Terrible civilian toll could pale against horror that lies ahead, Secretary-General warns in remarks on Easter appeal for Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2022,"SG/SM/21240
19 APRIL 2022, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the press on the Easter appeal for Ukraine today:, In five days, Ukrainians and Russians will mark Easter. This holiday unites the Orthodox Christians in both Russia and Ukraine — as well as Catholic Ukrainians — in celebration., Easter is a season for renewal, resurrection and hope. It is a time for reflection on the meaning of suffering, sacrifice, death — and rebirth. It is meant to be a moment of unity., But this year, Holy Week is being observed under the cloud of a war that represents the total negation of the Easter message. Instead of celebration of a new life, this Easter coincides with a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine., The intense concentration of forces and firepower makes this battle inevitably more violent, bloody and destructive. The onslaught and terrible toll on civilians we have seen so far could pale in comparison to the horror that lies ahead. This cannot be allowed to happen., Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance. Many good-faith efforts by many parties to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed. Today, I am calling for a four-day Holy Week humanitarian pause beginning on Holy Thursday and running through Easter Sunday, 24 April, to allow for the opening of a series of humanitarian corridors., The humanitarian pause would provide the necessary conditions to meet two crucial imperatives. First, safe passage of all civilians willing to leave the areas of current and expected confrontation, in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Second, beyond humanitarian operations already taking place, a pause will allow for the safe delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid to people in the hardest-hit areas such as Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk., The United Nations is ready to send humanitarian aid convoys during this period to these locations. We are submitting detailed plans to the parties. Humanitarian needs are dire. People do not have food, water, supplies to treat the sick or wounded, or simply to live day to day., More than 12 million people need humanitarian assistance in Ukraine today. Of those, more than one third are in Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. We anticipate that this figure will increase to 15.7 million — that’s about 40 per cent of all Ukrainians still left in the country., There is a measure of progress to build upon. Some 2.5 million people have been provided with assistance in the past seven weeks, including many in the east. For all these life-or-death reasons, I call on Russians and Ukrainians to silence the guns and forge a path to safety for so many at immediate risk., The four-day Easter period should be a moment to unite around saving lives and furthering dialogue to end the suffering in Ukraine. This morning, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, briefed the Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations — including Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and Jewish leaders. I welcome their support., Inspired by Holy Week and all that it represents, I urge all parties — and all champions of peace around the world — to join my Easter appeal. Save lives. Stop the bloodshed and destruction. Open a window for dialogue and peace and keep faith with the meaning and the message of Easter., For information media.

The UN Reiterates the Call for an Easter Truce in Ukraine Amid a Growing Humanitarian Crisis and Mounting Displacement,News and Press Release,UNCT Ukraine,Protection and Human Rights,20 Apr 2022,"Kyiv, 20 April 2022 – The United Nations today (Wednesday) said it was gravely alarmed by the mounting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine amid an intensifying Russian offensive in the east of the country., “The loss of life and severe trauma caused by attacks on hospitals, schools and places of refuge is utterly shocking, as is the devastation of critical civilian infrastructure in the country” said Assistant Secretary-General and UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad., The war has caused the largest and fastest wave of displacement in recent memory. Of the 12 million displaced, more than 5 million have fled the country and at least 7.1 million remain displaced within Ukraine, many of them without water and electricity. Another 12 million are affected by economic hardship and decline in services., Water infrastructure and power outages have left some 1.4 million people in the eastern part of the country without access to running water, including in besieged Mariupol. Millions more have only very limited access to water and electricity. Some 136 attacks on healthcare facilities were recorded since the start of the hostilities, accounting for more than 68% of worldwide attacks on health care so far this year. Growing insecurity, including due to contamination with explosive devices, is a significant obstacle to accessing hard to reach areas in the east., “This terrible toll on civilians must come to an end,” said Awad, warning that the war’s devastating impact could affect Ukraine for generations and echoing the UN Secretary-General’s recent call for restraint and a humanitarian pause. Awad said this would allow for safe passage of civilians willing to leave conflict areas and for the safe delivery of urgent humanitarian aid to people in the hardest hit areas of Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk., “During this week which marks a rare calendar alignment of the three of the most sacred religious holidays of Christian Orthodox Easter, Jewish Passover and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan it is the time to focus on converging interests and set aside our differences. The immediate impact of this senseless war is the gravest here in Ukraine but it could have global ramifications, putting 1.7 billion people worldwide at risk of poverty, hunger and destitution” Awad concluded., Since the beginning of the hostilities, the United Nations and partners scaled up relief operations to reach 2.5 million people across Ukraine. The UN is working closely with the Government of Ukraine to further boost the humanitarian response in the country and strengthen coordination through a newly established high-level National Coordination Platform., For more information contact:

Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Apr 2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now focused on the eastern part of the country. Here, people are now facing the fiercest fighting. Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv Oblasts are the most affected, and the humanitarian situation of hundreds of thousands of people continue to deteriorate. The Office for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) reports that nearly 45% of all corroborated casualties in Ukraine were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts., More than seven weeks of intense fighting in Ukraine have devastated gas, water, and electricity networks, leaving 1.4 million people without access to safe water in the east of the country, according to UNICEF. Over 6 million people in Ukraine are struggling every day to access drinking water, one of the most essential human needs., According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 12 April, almost 96,000 people in 30 settlements across the eastern oblasts were without electricity, while water supplies had been completely cut off in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk. Since the start of the war, at least 20 separate incidents of damage to water infrastructure have been recorded in eastern Ukraine alone, the UN reports., ""In places like Sieverodonetsk or Izium, people's homes are repeatedly hit by shelling. Constant hostilities are preventing people from evacuating safely or at least to secure basic food and hygiene items. Many people stay in their homes and basements,"" says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for the Eastern Partnership and the Balkans., Older residents are particularly vulnerable. Many times they are ignored and left to survive alone. Even before the Russian invasion, one-third of Ukrainians trapped by the on-going conflict in eastern Ukraine and requiring assistance were over 60, making this the world's ""oldest"" humanitarian crisis., A survey at the beginning of March, conducted by HelpAge International---PIN's long-term partner in Ukraine---found that 99% of older people in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts had no plans to leave. For many, mobility difficulties mean leaving is impossible, many do not have family nearby to help, and most cannot even reach and access local shelters., HelpAge notes that older people often remain at home in times of ongoing fighting because they often do not want to be a burden, they want to protect their homes, or because they have already moved many times before. ""The biggest worries are that with more fighting, more elderly will be left behind, isolated and in urgent need of food, water and health and mental health support,"" says Petr Drbohlav., PIN continues to support people in eastern Ukraine, as we have constantly done since 2014. Most of the humanitarian aid is delivered by trains from the Czech Republic to Dnipro. The aid continues further east by trucks or vans, sometimes within convoys organized by the United Nations. Local partners such as Right to Protection, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, and others distribute it to the most vulnerable people., In the past week alone, People in Need delivered two trucks full of humanitarian aid to Zaporizhzhia, a further two to Donetsk Oblast, two to Kharkiv, and two trucks reached Sumska Oblast. Additionally, three trucks filled with five-litre water bottles for Mykolaiv to cover the drinking water needs for 6930 people. Additionally, hygiene items and food reached Luhansk Oblast. We also continued distributions of cash assistance. Some trains with humanitarian aid also reached Kyiv. ""Humanitarian aid from these trains reached through our partner organization Bucha, Irpin or Chernihiv, places that were besieged for long weeks,"" notes Petr Drbohlav., According to the United Nations, 12 million people in Ukraine require humanitarian aid. The number of people displaced by the ongoing fighting has surpassed the 12 million mark: over 4.9 million people have crossed international borders, and at least 7.1 million have been displaced internally since 24 February. A significant number of people are also returning to Ukraine. According to the United Nations, 30,000 Ukrainians are returning every single day. Altogether over 870,000 people have already returned to Ukraine since the invasion., People in Need's assistance to people in Ukraine is possible thanks to donations from the public and private sectors to the PIN Ukraine Emergency Appeal, financial contributions from Alliance2015, CARE, Stichting Vluchteling, King Baudouin Foundation and partnership with the European Union, Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic or World Food Programme.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/people-need-delivers-aid-eastern-ukraine-where-people-are-suffering-fiercest-fighting

Estonia has provided humanitarian aid to the people of Ukraine and will continue doing so. Around €3 million has been allocated for humanitarian aid in the supplementary budget. “Russia’s attacks involve the deliberate killing and injuring of innocent people, including grave abuses of women and children.

More than 4.9 million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 7.1 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine., *‘This war has led to so much suffering, and displacement on an unprecedented scale. The needs are huge and growing by the minute. The Ukrainian government was fast to adapt its social protection programmes and IDP registration to respond to the emerging needs. But a crisis of this magnitude needs everyone’s support. This partnership will further strengthen our collective efforts to help displaced people access assistance and services, and rebuild their lives wherever they have found safety in the country’ *said Karolina Lindholm Billing., One of the ways UNHCR supports displaced people in Ukraine is through its multi-purpose cash programme. This programme, which is aligned with and complementary to the Government’s and Ministry of Social Policy’s social assistance programmes, is being rolled-out in all the oblasts hosting large numbers of displaced people. The cash assistance provided by UNHCR to displaced people in a particularly vulnerable situation, like pensioners with low income, helps the beneficiaries meet their basic needs such as rent, food, and hygiene items., ‘The Government of Ukraine and the Ministry of Social Policy strongly leads in the provision of different forms of assistance to people impacted by the hostilities, and UNHCR is grateful for the excellent cooperation extended to ensure that the support and assistance provided by our humanitarian organisation complements and reinforces the national programs’, stressed Lindholm Billing., Through this MoU, UNHCR will also contribute to the further development of the national legal and policy framework on social protection by providing legal and other advice, including on international practices, and support the capacity of social protection departments around the country to service the higher number of persons in need of social services due to the war., ‘UNHCR’s interventions will be guided by the views, needs and capacities of displaced people and the local communities. We will therefore continue to work at community level and engage local communities and service providers in the development of programs that affect their lives. This is key for sustainability – there should be nothing for the people without the people’, added Lindholm Billing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/minister-social-policy-ukraine-and-unhcr-ukraine-representative-sign-agreement-expand

Norway is increasing its support for the people in Ukraine and displaced Ukrainians with a view to enhancing food security, combating human trafficking, and providing transport and medical evacuation,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt., Russia’s war in Ukraine has already caused widespread suffering and civilian losses and the destruction of vital infrastructure. The scale of the crisis is growing with each passing day, and the humanitarian needs are enormous. More than seven million people are internally displaced and over four million have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries. These numbers are rising every day., The Government decided on 27 February that Norway would provide NOK 2 billion to Ukraine and its neighbouring countries in connection with Russia’s war of aggression. One of the neighbouring countries under the greatest pressure is Moldova. Norway has therefore earmarked NOK 100 million for Moldova., So far, NOK 1.3 billion has been disbursed. The Government has now decided how to distribute the remaining support. The new measures are listed below., Food security and the fight against hunger, ‘The Ukrainian authorities have contacted Norway directly with a request for food aid. It is essential to address the need to increase access to food in Ukraine. That is why we have chosen to allocate NOK 215 million in funding to the World Food Programme,’ said Foreign Minister Huitfeldt., The World Food Programme (WFP) is already distributing food and cash assistance. The organisation plans to scale up its efforts significantly in order to help the millions of people affected by the conflict in Ukraine., Humanitarian assistance via Norwegian partner organisations, Due to the security situation in Ukraine, the delivery of humanitarian assistance entails considerable risks. The Norwegian humanitarian organisations are on the ground doing an invaluable job in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. These organisations are providing a range of services, including health care and sanitation, food and water, cash payments, shelter, education, protection and efforts to reunite families., Norwegian organisations have been present or carrying out activities in eastern Ukraine, directly or through partners, since 2014. Since the start of the war, these organisations have scaled up their efforts to encompass larger parts of Ukraine and the neighbouring countries that have taken in many refugees. NOK 155 million has been distributed to Norwegian organisations so far, and an additional NOK 100 million has now been allocated., EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), Requests for assistance to Ukraine and its neighbouring countries are also received via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), in which Norway participates., So far during the Ukraine crisis, Norway has donated equipment and medical assistance valued at approximately NOK 100 million via the UCPM. This has included ambulances, medical equipment, protective gear, medicines/pharmaceutical products, tents and camp beds. This support is now being increased by a further NOK 150 million., In addition, Norway will provide NOK 115 million via UCPM for medical evacuation., ‘Norway operates an air ambulance for the EU civil emergency authorities, and will cover the costs of using this to evacuate Ukrainian patients. Together with the EU, we will also provide funding for airlifting patients, either through Armed Forces agreements or the private sector. This will be an important, much-needed contribution in Europe’s joint humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine,’ said Minister of Health and Care Services Ingvild Kjerkol., The situation in Ukraine is changing all the time, and new humanitarian needs may suddenly arise. Norway has set aside a reserve of roughly NOK 178 million for this purpose., Fact box, Norway has decided to provide NOK 2 billion in support to Ukraine. An overview of how this funding has been allocated is given below., The most recent allocation, amounting to NOK 758 million, is being distributed as follows:, NOK 1.3 billion has already been distributed as follows:, Norway’s core support to the UN Refugee Agency, the World Food Programme, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund comes in addition to this.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/increased-humanitarian-assistance-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries
Ukraine launches new e-service for internally displaced persons [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",20 Apr 2022,"The service to register as IDP is now also available on the Diia application, Kyiv, 20 April 2022 – The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine has presented a new public digital online service on the Diia mobile application – registration as an internally-displaced person (IDP). The Ministry of Digital Transformation developed the service in cooperation with the Ministry of Social Policy and with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine and the Government of Sweden., Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said thousands of Ukrainians who were forced to leave their homes and move to other cities due to the war will now be able to register as IDPs easily and conveniently. “Even during the war, digitalization in Ukraine continues. We keep launching new services, which are necessary for both the military and civilians,” the Minister said. “Our next service is IDP registration. Now there is no need for Ukrainians to go to public institutions with documents to register. After all, it can all be done simply on a smartphone on the Diia application. Without unnecessary bureaucracy and papers. The service will be provided automatically, without human intervention. Therefore, applications will be processed very quickly.”, The service was created following the innovative “mobile-first” development principle, meaning that the service was originally designed for smartphones to ensure ease of use., Social Policy Minister Maryna Lazebna said the Government of Ukraine decided to provide internally displaced persons with a monthly allowance, which they will be able to apply for on the application, for oneself and children. “The monthly allowance is of UAH 2,000 per person, UAH 3,000 per child or person with disabilities and will be provided during martial law and one month after martical law is cancelled,” she added., In late March, the Ministry of Social Policy expanded the list of institutions that can register IDPs and issue certificates. In addition to social protection bodies at the district level and in principle regional cities, authorized persons in territorial communities and administrative services centres are also able to provide these services. This became possible due to the updating the relevant software of the PC “Social Community,” which was also supported by UNDP and the Government of Sweden., Tobias Thyberg, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Sweden to Ukraine emphasized that Sweden will continue to support Ukraine through the acute humanitarian crisis caused by war. “Sweden is committed to supporting Ukraine and its citizens, especially the most vulnerable,” he said. “Digitalization of public services is meant to serve the people affected by the war, and creating a digital IDP registration service through DIA will enable them to get the help they need more quickly.”, Manal Fouani, UNDP Ukraine Resident Representative a.i. said the Government of Ukraine’s progress in digitalizing public services before the war had enabled them to rapidly respond to the crisis in a technically savvy and unprecedented manner. “The new e-service will help millions of displaced Ukrainians access emergency state support without concerns of travel and movement,” Fouani said. “UNDP, with the strategic support of the Government of Sweden, reiterates the importance of relying on development investments in the service of humanitarian assistance. The scale and intensity of this war requires joint efforts and a cohesive vision, so we can all better serve the most vulnerable populations and no one is left behind.”, This is already the fourth service for internally displaced persons developed by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine in partnership with UNDP and with the support of Sweden. In May 2021, they presented an electronic service for participation in the state programme of subsidised mortgage loans. Officially registered IDPs were able to apply for the programme through the Diia portal. And on 8 February, 2022, the Ministry of Digital Transformation presented two new services for IDPs, developed with the support of UNDP and Sweden, on the Diia portal – the prolongation or termination of monthly targeted assistance to cover living expenses, including housing and communal services. This year, for the first time, UNDP supported offline services for IDPs as part of the Diia Support Project, in particular in expanding the provision of IDP registration services in administrative services centres and territorial communities., Background, The service of IDP registration and application for a monthly allowance in the Diia application was developed within the project “Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine Project” (DIA Support Project), which UNDP implements in Ukraine with the financial support of Sweden. The DIA Support Project was launched in 2021 and aims to bridge the digital divide between different generations and different social groups. Its main goal is to increase the accessibility of new digital solutions so that every man and woman in the country can use public electronic services and no one is left behind., Media inquiries:, Yuliia Samus, Communications Team Leader, UNDP in Ukraine, Yuliia.Samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-launches-new-e-service-internally-displaced-persons-enuk
"Ukraine: Remarks by IOM Director General, Antonio Vitorino, at the UN Security Council",News and Press Release,IOM,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2022,"Thank you so much Madame President, and thank you for giving IOM the opportunity to speak to you today.  , As it has just been said by Kelly, more than 12 million Ukrainians and Third Country Nationals have already been forced to leave their homes since the beginning of this war., About 5 million people have fled the country, according to the data collected by UNHCR. Another 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine, according to the latest assessment by IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix., Through our displacement tool, I hope that, by the end of this week, I can provide you with an update of the overall figures concerning new displacements, secondary movements, stranded populations as well as the increasing numbers of returns to Ukraine and inside the country returning to their regions of origin., We remain deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Ukraine as we anticipate an increase in displacements, internal as well as external., Therefore, I appeal to parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, their homes, and civilian infrastructure., When I recently visited some of the concerned neighboring countries, I saw first-hand the price that civilians are paying for this conflict: Women and children, the elderly, and people with disabilities have been disproportionately affected as they all represent a highly vulnerable group of people., Madame President,, From our assessments and work with all UN Agencies in Ukraine and our NGO partners, we have identified specific risks for internally displaced people, refugees and third country nationals, and I would like to highlight a few of them to you today:  , First, in situations of mass displacement, one can expect up to 30 percent of the population to experience some form of negative psychological impact and mental health problems.  , However, as the war continues and intensifies, psychosocial needs will undoubtedly further increase. We are scaling-up our efforts to address them in Ukraine and in neighboring countries through activities ranging from training first line responders in psychosocial first aid to increasing the capacity of our established hotlines that provide psychosocial support., For that purpose we are benefitting from the mobilization of the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide. , Second, we remain particularly concerned about the situation of women and children who have fled Ukraine or who are internally displaced. Trafficking in persons was unfortunately a known phenomenon in the region, and as observed in past crises, large-scale displacement, family separation, and disruption of civil protection and community networks render populations vulnerable to violence, exploitation, and abuse., Therefore, I think that it is of utmost concern that gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, has been reported in increasing numbers. Setting referral mechanisms and developing close cooperation with law enforcement agencies is essential to prevent the operation of criminal networks, of trafficking and abuses. , We know that more than half of the children in Ukraine have been displaced., Unaccompanied or separated children are particularly vulnerable and measures to protect them must be strengthened. I urge the neighboring and impacted countries to ensure the immediate identification and registration of unaccompanied and separated children fleeing from Ukraine is done. Effective international cooperation is required urgently to reunite children with their caregivers and families., Third, we applaud all of Ukraine’s neighboring countries for the solidarity and openness they have shown, and the enormous efforts undertaken by their governments, civil society organizations and private individuals to support arriving Ukrainians and more than 218,000 third country nationals.  , Despite the overwhelmingly positive response, we have unfortunately witnessed cases of discrimination, violence and xenophobia against third country nationals fleeing Ukraine. Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality or migration status, in my view, is not acceptable., I call on all states to ensure that protection and immediate assistance is provided in a non-discriminatory manner, particularly in border crossing points., From our side, we have set up information and support hotlines for affected populations in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and Slovakia, and have established a referral mechanism to facilitate contact between third country nationals and relevant consulates, and to ensure safe, dignified, and non-discriminatory support, information sharing and advice, transportation and medical assistance and support to return to their countries of origin., We see now that internally displaced people tend to move to urban areas in search of possible employment opportunities and social services. There will be an urgent need to scale up the services and the assistance to meet the needs of an increased population in these areas as we are doing in close cooperation with the Social Policy Ministry of the Ukrainian Government. Of particular concern is the situation in the East of Ukraine in terms of access to food and water., Since the start of the response to the crisis, we have all identified cash-based interventions as one of the most feasible, efficient and effective ways to reach people in need both inside Ukraine and in the neighboring countries., IOM has already started providing multi-purpose cash assistance in Ukraine and in some of the neighboring countries, and as Kelly has just mentioned to you, preparations are ongoing to scale up this assistance in close coordination with UNHCR and WFP, and with the Government of Ukraine and the local authorities – but funding for this purpose is badly needed indeed., Madame President,, Moving forward, it is necessary that we seek to better understand the intentions of those who are fleeing, those forced to leave their homes, and those who have been separated from their families due to the ongoing conflict., Many – particularly in neighboring countries – are willing to return to Ukraine as soon as possible, but of course return must be safe. We are working with the Government and local authorities concerning, above all, those internally displaced in order to support the identification of stable and safe solutions., For those who have left the country, it is crucial to plan ahead and invest in order to ensure that all have access to adequate support and services, and to facilitate their full inclusion in educational and health systems, into the labor market, and to provide language opportunities, social housing and other needed support., We welcome the decision by the European Union to offer temporary protection to those fleeing Ukraine and I reiterate our readiness to support with implementing the Directive., Madame President,, Let me just conclude by reiterating our commitment to stay and deliver in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries, to support and to provide assistance to Ukrainians and third country nationals that are so severely impacted by the war, and I will just add that I want to reiterate and strongly echo the Secretary-General’s repeated calls for an urgent, very urgent, humanitarian ceasefire and for above all, for peace. Yes, for peace. , I thank you, Madame President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-remarks-iom-director-general-antonio-vitorino-un-security-council
A Message to all UN Member States and Leaders of the United Nations,News and Press Release,SDSN,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,14 Apr 2022,"From Members of the Leadership Council of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Members of the SDSN Community [1], The war in Ukraine threatens not only sustainable development, but the survival of humanity. We call on all nations, operating in accordance with the UN Charter, to put diplomacy to the service of humanity by ending the war through negotiations before the war ends all of us., The world must urgently return to the path of peace. Blessed are the peacemakers, teaches Jesus in the Gospels. The Qur’an invites the righteous to the Dar as-Salam, the abode of peace. Buddha teaches Ahimsa, nonviolence to all living beings. Isaiah prophesizes the day when nation will no longer fight against nation, nor train for war anymore., International peace and security are the first purposes of the United Nations. The world’s nations dare not fail to bring peace to Ukraine in the momentous hours ahead., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is repugnant, cruel, and sacrilegious, in the words of Pope Francis, making the search for peace our most urgent need. This is especially true as an even more devastating military confrontation builds in Eastern Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has recently declared the peace talks at a “dead end.” The world cannot accept this. All nations and the United Nations must do all in their power to revive the peace talks and bring the parties to a successful and rapid agreement., Peace requires dialogue and diplomacy, not more heavy weaponry that will ultimately lay Ukraine to utter ruin. The path of military escalation in Ukraine is one of guaranteed suffering and despair. Still worse, military escalation risks a conflict that spirals to Armageddon., History shows that the Cuban Missile Crisis nearly led to nuclear war even after the leaders of the US and Soviet Union had reached a diplomatic solution. Because of misunderstandings, a disabled Soviet submarine nearly launched a nuclear-tipped torpedo that could have triggered a full nuclear response by the United States. Only the brave actions of a single Soviet party officer on the submarine halted the firing of the torpedo, thereby saving the world., Russia and Ukraine can certainly reach an agreement that fulfills the two fundamental aims of the UN Charter: territorial integrity and security for both Ukraine and Russia., President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has already identified a diplomatic solution: Ukraine’s neutrality – no NATO membership – and its territorial integrity secured by international law. Russia’s troops must leave Ukraine, but not to be replaced by NATO’s troops or heavy weaponry. We note that the UN Charter uses the words “peace” and “peaceful” 49 times, but never once uses the word “alliance” or the phrase “military alliance.”, Escalation of conflicts comes all too easily, while negotiation requires wisdom and willpower. UN members are deeply divided in their understandings of the conflict, but they should be completely united by their shared interest in an immediate ceasefire, halt to attacks on civilians, and return to peace. The war is causing horrific deaths and staggering destruction – hundreds of billions of dollars of damage to Ukraine’s cities, which have been reduced to rubble in mere weeks – and growing economic chaos worldwide: soaring food prices and shortages, millions of refugees, the breakdown of global trade and supply chains, and rising political instability around the world, hitting the poorest nations and households with devastating burdens., The UN Security Council (UNSC) has the world’s sacred responsibility to keep the peace. Some say that the UNSC cannot play this role with Russia on the Security Council. Yet this view is completely mistaken. The UNSC can secure the peace precisely because Russia, China, the US, France, and the United Kingdom are all permanent members. These five permanent members, together with the other ten members of the UNSC, must negotiate with each other to find a way forward that preserves the territorial integrity of Ukraine while meeting the security needs of Ukraine, Russia, and indeed the other 191 UN member states., We applaud the bold and creative efforts of President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to help the two parties to find an agreement, yet we bemoan the lack of direct talks within the UN Security Council. We are not calling for more soundbites in which diplomats hurl invectives at each other. We are calling for true negotiations guided by the UN Charter. We are talking about peace through the UN rule of law, not through power, threats, and divisive military alliances., We should not have to remind the world’s nations of the harrowing fragility of these days. The war threatens to escalate by the hour. And this occurs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which claims around 5,000 lives each day. Even now, in the third year of the pandemic, the world has failed to provide vaccine doses for the world’s poor and vulnerable and has failed in no small part because of the geopolitical tensions among the vaccine-producing nations., The massive displacement of refugees and rising hunger worldwide due to the war in Ukraine now threaten an even greater surge of disease, death, and instability and deeper financial hardship for poor nations. And lurking behind the war and pandemic is the slow-moving beast of human-induced climate change, another woe pulling humanity towards the cliff. The most recent IPCC report reminds us that we have exhausted the margin of climate safety. We need immediate climate action. Yet the war drains the attention, multilateral cooperation, and the financing needed to rescue us from our manmade climate emergency., As educators and university leaders, we also recognize our own heightened responsibilities to our students. We must teach not only scientific and technical know-how to achieve sustainable development, as important as those topics are today, but also the pathways to peace, problem solving, and conflict resolution. We must educate young people so that today’s youth gain the wisdom to respect global diversity and to settle disputes peacefully, through thoughtful negotiation and compromise., In the spirit of the UN Charter and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we call on all nations of the UN General Assembly, unanimously and without exception, to adopt a resolution calling for an urgent negotiated peace that meets the needs and security of Ukraine, Russia, and all other nations., We call on the UN Security Council to meet in an emergency session, for as long as necessary, to ensure that the full weight of the UN Charter is brought to bear to end the war in Ukraine through diplomatic means., We call on permanent members of the UNSC to negotiate with diplomacy rather than rancor and to recognize that true peace must meet the security needs of all countries. There is no need or room for a veto; a just agreement will be supported by all nations and can be backed by UN peacekeepers., Ukraine, to its profound credit, has signaled its readiness to meet Russia on reasonable terms; Russia now must also do the same. And the world must help these two nations to accomplish this difficult task, Finally, we call on all governments and politicians to emphasize the cause of diplomacy and to tamp down the vitriol, calls for escalation, and even open contemplation of a global war. Global war today must remain unthinkable, as it would be nothing other than a suicide pact for humanity, or a murderous pact of politicians., Peace is not appeasement, and peacemakers are not cowards. Peacemakers are the bravest defenders of humanity., Jeffrey Sachs, President, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN); University Professor, Columbia University, Anthony Annett, Gabelli Fellow, Fordham University, Tamer Atabarut, Director, Bogazici University Lifelong Learning Centre (BULLC); Board Member, Sustainability Academy (SA); High Council Member & Readers’ Representative, Press Council of Turkey; Steering Committee Member & Past President, Council of Turkish Universities Continuing Education Centres (TUSEM), Ambassador Richard L.

Update 58 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (20 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,20 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the general situation in the area around the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) “remained difficult” due to destroyed bridges and demining activities and that the national regulator had still not had an “opportunity to inspect” the facility, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Since Russian forces withdrew from Chornobyl on 31 March after five weeks, Ukraine has taken significant steps for the safe and secure operation of the site of the 1986 accident, carrying out the first rotation of staff in three weeks by boat from the nearby city of Slavutych and earlier this week re-establishing direct communications between the NPP and the regulator that had been down for more than a month, the Director General said., But much work remains to return the site to normality, as highlighted by Ukraine in today’s update to the IAEA, he said., To support Ukraine in achieving this, Director General Grossi plans to head a mission of IAEA experts to the Chornobyl site later this month to conduct nuclear safety, security and radiological assessments, deliver vital equipment and repair the Agency’s remote safeguards monitoring systems there., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said it was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-58-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-20-april-2022
