"""This war must end"": The Ukraine crisis seven months on",News and Press Release,WFP,"Food and Nutrition
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding",15 Sep 2022,"The World Food Programme's regional chief, Corinne Fleischer, on why peace is the best long-term solution for the country and those around the world dependent on its grain., 15 September 2022, Peyvand Khorsandi, ""We all hoped it wouldn't happen,"" says Corinne Fleischer. ""We were prepared, but we were not expecting that scale. Nobody was ... we had no presence, no staff, no suppliers, no partners."", WFP Regional Director Corinne Fleischer speaks with Ukrainian refugees in Moldova. Photo: WFP/Giulio d'Adamo, The Regional Director for World Food Programme's Middle East, Northern Africa and Eastern Europe (MENAEE) bureau was in Yemen on 24 February, when war broke out in Ukraine, accompanying WFP's executive director David Beasley on mission., ""Yemen was our big concern at that time,"" she adds - their intention even before the war was to highlight a year of unprecedented needs., Few could have imagined that Ukraine would come to join Yemen as one of the biggest humanitarian emergencies WFP is responding to. More than six million people have left the country over nearly seven months and an equal number are internally displaced., Still, ""within two weeks of the war breaking out, we had 200 staff in the operation, we had offices, warehouses, partners and a footprint,"" says Fleischer., Two years of the COVID-19 pandemic had already smashed so much of the progress WFP had made in development in contexts already suffering the effects of conflict and climate change., WFP Executive Director David Beasley surveys destruction in Bucha, Ukraine. Photo: WFP/Marco Frattini, The Ukraine war, Beasley said, was ""catastrophe on top of catastrophe."", ""We get 50 percent of our grains out of the Ukraine-Russia area,"" he added in a video tweet, surrounded by rows of cooking oil bottles and bags of grain at a distribution point in Yemen's capital, Sanaa., ""It's going to have a dramatic impact on food costs, shipping costs, oil and fuel - just when you think it couldn't get worse, it's going to get worse."", And worse it got., The closure of key Black Sea ports - and the effective removal of Ukrainian and Russian grain, vegetable oil and other foods from supply chains - disrupted food systems around the world., Access to nutrition for millions was reduced as the prices of food, fuel and fertilizer skyrocketed, furthering the relentless cost increases of 2021., Before the war Ukraine exported up to six million tons of grain a month; today, it exports 1.5 million tons per month., This spells disaster for the record 345 million people in 82 countries currently facing acute food insecurity; and for the up to 50 million people in 45 countries who are right on the edge of famine - and who risk tipping over without humanitarian support., WFP is particularly concerned about famine taking lives in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, currently the five biggest hunger hotspots., WFP-chartered ship carrying Ukrainian grain heads to Yemen. Photo: Ukraine Armed Forces/Nataliia Humeniuk, Thanks to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed not a minute too soon on 27 July, ships loaded with grain are again allowed to the 'breadbasket' of Europe., Less than a month later, a WFP-chartered vessel set sail from the port of Pivdennyi in Yuzhny, Odesa province, to Djibouti, carrying 23 thousand metric tons of grain, as part of WFP's response to crippling drought in the Horn of Africa., Things have come a long way. One month into the war , WFP assistance had reached 1 million people in Ukraine; by July it was 2.9 million. That is thanks to WFP's well-oiled emergency response machine, says Fleischer, who was appointed the Corporate Response Director for the Ukraine emergency., Ever hands-on, she wasted no time to get to the region., ""From Yemen I returned to Cairo, said goodbye to my husband: 'Let's see when we meet again',"" she recalls. ""Then I went to Geneva, because that's where the coordination started ... then I went to Krakow (in Poland), Moldova and also Ukraine., ""The impact of Ukraine was felt dramatically. When prices go up, people can't buy food for their families anymore,"" Fleischer adds. ""But if this war persists, we will not only face a food access problem, but also an availability problem."", Such price increases make firefighting hunger very difficult for governments and humanitarian groups alike, Fleischer notes., ""Right now, we have to do massive cuts in the region,"" she says. ""In many of our 15 operations, people receive 50 percent of a daily emergency ration. So, we are very concerned about hunger rising to numbers we haven't seen before, particularly in places like Yemen."", Without additional money, ""there will be famine,"" she adds., And then there's climate change., ""Water scarcity is a big issue,"" says Fleischer. ""Our region has one-sixth of the world's population and 1 percent of the freshwater resources. This region is not only going hungry, it's going thirsty."", Looking to the year ahead, she says, ""ending the war is critical. And if it doesn't end, well, it's going to require even more funds."", ""The war in Ukraine must end so that markets can stabilize again,"" she adds. ""We have had 11 years of conflict in Syria, seven years of conflict in Yemen. And we can't just add conflicts and add, with that, people who need us."", However, ending conflict is ""not what WFP can do. But at least we can ensure that people who are affected by it have the food they need to survive."", Meeting people in need, ""I had two quite stark encounters,"" says Fleischer. ""I met a woman called Elena (in Chisinau, Moldova) who had to decide whether to stay with her husband in Ukraine to give birth to her first child into an uncertain and unsafe future, or leave her support system behind, in the hope of providing at least safety, food and shelter to her soon-to-be born baby. And she chose the second one. That's a very, very tough decision to make for any mother, especially a first-time mother."", Then ""there was this little girl from Donetsk displaced in Vinnytsia (Ukraine), in the Government registration Centre for internally displaced persons. She was with her family, registering for cash assistance,"" she adds. ""The girl was carrying a drawing of her family. Pointing to a man, she said, ""That's my father, who is in the army. That's my house, which I had to leave,"" Fleischer recalls. ""And we need to buy food, which we have no money for because my mother lost her job.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-must-end-ukraine-crisis-seven-months
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (13 August-9 September 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,9 Sep 2022,"Over the past month in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued into its seventh month, with Ukrainian forces conducting successful counterattacks in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions. Violence related to the Russian invasion also continued to spill across the border into Russia. The six-month anniversary of the invasion, which coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day on 24 August, drove demonstration activity across the region. Fighting along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact escalated following a recent transfer of the Lachin corridor to Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, demonstrations in support of LGBT+ rights, against climate change, and related to the current cost of living crisis were recorded across the region., In Ukraine, fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces continued in the southern and eastern regions of the country over the past month. In the first nine days of September, Ukrainian forces successfully pushed back Russian forces in the Kharkiv region, regaining control over an estimated 2,500 square kilometers as of 9 September (ISW, 9 September 2022).1 On 29 August, Ukrainian forces also launched offensive operations in the southern part of the country, attacking Russian supply lines and liberating several settlements in the Kherson region (New York Times, 29 August 2022; RFE/RL, 30 August 2022; CNN, 7 September 2022). Heavy fighting continued in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces conducted ground assaults in the areas of Bakhmut and Avdiivka; however, they did not lead to significant changes to the frontline (ISW, 9 September 2022)., Ukrainian partisan activity also continued amid the recent counteroffensives of the Ukrainian army. Partisan activity was particularly pronounced in the Zaporizhia region, but also present in the Kherson, Donetsk, and Crimea regions. Over the past month, partisan groups carried out a series of explosions targeting Russia-appointed officials, alleged Russian collaborators, and Russian soldiers, as well as railway tracks, trains, and barges used by Russian forces for resupply., Meanwhile, shelling intensified in Enerhodar in the Zaporizhia region over the past month, causing several incidents of power outages and external power supply loss at the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) (IAEA, 5 September 2022). Ukrainian and Russian officials blamed each other for the increased shelling ahead of and during the visit of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 1 September (CNN, 1 September 2022; Ukrainska Pravda, 28 August 2022). The threat of a potential nuclear emergency prompted the United Nations Secretary-General to call for a demilitarized area around the NPP on 6 September (The Guardian, 6 September 2022). Shelling also intensified in other areas along the frontline in the Zaporizhia region, where Russian forces have launched heavy artillery and rocket barrages on Orikhiv, Huliaipole, and a number of other locations, amid a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation (WSJ, 16 August 2022; Ukrinform, 7 September 2022)., Russian forces have continued targeting civilian infrastructure along the frontline with shelling, airstrikes, and missile attacks, reportedly killing over 150 civilians in the past month.2 This includes a Russian missile strike on a railway station in Chaplyne in the Dnipropetrovsk region on 25 August that killed 25 civilians, and shelling of Kharkiv on 17 August that took the lives of 19 people (Euromaidanpress, 25 August 2022; Ukrinform, 22 August 2022). Russian forces also abducted dozens of civilians in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions over this period., In Russia, incidents of cross-border shelling were reported in several villages in the Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk regions bordering Ukraine during the past month. Meanwhile, members and activists of the Communist Party (KPRF) faced attacks and harassment in the run-up to municipal elections on 11 September. These attacks included unidentified perpertators setting fire to the house of a KPRF activist in Ryazan and attacking a KPRF candidate and a party activist in Moscow and Yekaterinburg, respectively. Meanwhile, state forces arrested protesters taking part in a KPRF-organised rally for fair elections in Moscow (OVD Info, 3 September 2022). Separately, on 20 August, a car explosion killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian far-right public figure and Vladimir Putin supporter, Aleksander Dugin (MediaZone, 21 August 2022). This violence contributed to the 54% increase in weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Demonstration activity against the war and in support of Ukraine continued throughout the region, with an outbreak of demonstration activity on Ukraine's Independence Day on 24 August, which coincided with the six-month anniversary of the invasion. Rallies in support of Ukraine were held in Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, and the Netherlands. In Russia, police broke up a small protest against the invasion, arresting all demonstrators. Pro-Ukraine demonstrations not linked to Ukraine's Independence Day were also recorded in Belgium and Ireland., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, clashes continued over the past month. Fighting escalated last week, resulting in the death of one Armenian serviceman, with ceasefire violations recorded in the Shahumyan, Kashatagh, and Tovuz regions of Azerbaijan, and the Gegharkunik region of Armenia. This violence contributed to the 260% increase in violent events in Azerbaijan and Artsakh last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the region during the preceding four weeks., Meanwhile, Berdzor, Aghavno, and Sus settlements in the Lachin (Kashatagh) region were handed over to Azerbaijan on 26 August (168 Hours; 26 August 2022). The settlements are located along the Lachin corridor, the only available route connecting Armenia to the Artsakh Republic. An alternative route is currently under construction (Caucasian Knot, 5 August 2022). The transfer of territory caused ongoing anti-governmental protests both in Armenia and Artsakh. Meanwhile, five Armenian prisoners of war were returned to Armenia on 8 September as ""a step towards the normalization of relations"" following a meeting between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev that took place in Brussels on 31 August (Jam News, 9 September 2022)., Environmental and climate activists continued to demonstrate across Europe over the past month. Demonstration activity was recorded in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The police intervened and arrested activists on a number of occasions in the United Kingdom. Animal Rebellion activists demonstrated for a plant-based future by blocking access to meat and milk aisles in several supermarkets across the country and staged several other sit-in protests at dairy product distribution centers. Meanwhile, Just Stop Oil members blocked several service stations to put pressure on the government to end new oil and gas projects. Activists also damaged properties on a few occasions (Essex Live, 29 August 2022; The Argus, 24 August 2022)., Meanwhile, demonstration activity linked to rising costs of living, inflation, and high energy prices were recorded in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Moldova, Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Workers from various industry sectors staged demonstrations to demand salary increases in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Romania, North Macedonia, and Kazakhstan., Demonstrators gathered in support of LGBT+ rights in France, Germany, Malta, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, Norway, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, protesters gathered to demand the cancellation of children's events organized within the framework of the Drag Queen Story Hour tour of libraries., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the latest four weeks of data released by ACLED.

Denmark contributes $3.6 million to protect women and girls' health and rights in Ukraine and Moldova,News and Press Release,UNCT Ukraine,"Gender
Health
Protection and Human Rights",13 Sep 2022,"The Government of Denmark has contributed 25 million Danish Krone (US$3.6 million) to UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, for its humanitarian response in Ukraine and Moldova. The funding will enable UNFPA to continue prioritizing the reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls affected by the war in Ukraine., As the conflict enters its seventh month, UNFPA remains dedicated to upholding the rights of women and girls whose lives have been upended by the war. The vast majority of people who have fled the country are women and children, who urgently need health and protection assistance. In the last six months, UNFPA has reached over 6 million people with humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including through the provision of more than 95 tons of sexual and reproductive health medicines and supplies distributed across Ukraine and Moldova, and the delivery of 25,000 dignity kits., Denmark’s contribution will help support UNFPA’s humanitarian response to ensure safe births, reproductive health, and address gender-based violence and mental trauma among women and young people. With more than 530 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, reported by WHO as of 12 September, pregnant women are being forced to leave war-torn areas and traveling to other regions of the country to seek help, where staff and supplies are increasingly scarce. UNFPA will scale up its sexual and reproductive health services and increase access to medical assistance for women and girls, particularly in conflict-ridden and hard-to-reach areas., UNFPA is also scaling up and strengthening its mental health support , especially for women, girls and young people who have lost relatives, homes, education and career opportunities. UNFPA is running integrated psychosocial programmes to help improve the mental health and well-being of young people affected by the war. In Moldova, UNFPA-supported “Orange Safe Spaces” and mobile teams are offering immediate support and counseling to women and girls, and serve as an entry point for services and referrals for gender-based violence and reproductive health., “This new contribution from Denmark will go a long way in assisting women and girls who are lacking access to quality reproductive health and protection services as a result of the war,” said Florence Bauer, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “This will allow UNFPA to continue prioritizing the unique needs of women and girls in the midst of conflict.”, The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the lives of women and girls, in Ukraine, and around the world. UNFPA requires flexible resources to meet the needs of women and girls and to safeguard their rights and choices. In 2021, Denmark was the sixth-highest core contributor to UNFPA. The country has been a longstanding partner in support of UNFPA’s humanitarian action to end gender-based violence and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights., “More than 6 months of war have taken a dramatic toll on the people of Ukraine,” said Mr. Flemming Møller Mortensen, Minister for Development Cooperation and Minister for Nordic Cooperation of Denmark. “Denmark supports UNFPA in prioritizing the protection and reproductive health needs of women and young people affected by the war.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/denmark-contributes-36-million-protect-women-and-girls-health-and-rights-ukraine-and-moldova

Shelter and Non-Food Items",13 Sep 2022,"Odesa, Ukraine, September 13, 2022 — As conflict continues to escalate across Ukraine and cities in locations in the eastern regions of Kharkiv and Kherson fall back under Ukrainian control, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) warns that winter will be especially hard for civilians as the full extent of damage is assessed., Thousands of residential buildings have been destroyed since 24th February, alongside schools, health centres and community buildings. This collapse in infrastructure has meant that millions of people are at risk of losing access to electricity and water supplies, as well as vital shelter., The IRC is scaling up its response in Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro and Donetsk oblasts, as heavy fighting and shifts in territorial control causes an increase in the number of internally displaced people across southern and eastern Ukraine. Our teams and partners are delivering cash support to families so they can purchase essential supplies, increasing capacities of health care facilities to cope with greater numbers of patients, providing protection services including psychological first aid, and scaling up preparation for winter to ensure that people are prepared for the drop in temperatures and harsh weather conditions., Meanwhile, the IRC is preparing assessments in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv to identify immediate needs and prepare a timely and coordinated response to the increase in number of those internally displaced., Marysia Zapasnik, IRC Ukraine Director, said,, “Ongoing hostilities are having grave consequences for families living across southern and eastern Ukraine, and our teams are desperately worried that the destruction will spell disaster as winter draws closer. As large-scale damage of residential buildings and civilian infrastructure in areas such as Kharkiv, Kherson and Mykolaiv causes an increase in internally displaced populations , systems and infrastructure in oblasts receiving people seeking safety are being strained more than ever before., “Some 17.7 million Ukrainians are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, partly due to damaged infrastructure, and millions more are living in homes damaged by conflict. IRC teams are continuing to work around the clock to make sure our teams and partners in the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine are able to respond to the increase in humanitarian needs that will come with a harsh winter. We are most fearful for the internally displaced people who are seeking shelter and safety in buildings ill-suited to providing sufficient protection from a sudden drop in temperature and heavy snowfall that will come with the winter months., “The humanitarian needs of those who remain in Ukraine - as well as those who have fled - will outlast the conflict. This apparent break in the deadlock is a critical moment for the future of the conflict, and it is crucial that the international community continues to apply diplomatic pressure on all warring parties to bring about a political settlement and an end to the violence. Meanwhile, the world must maintain the investment in humanitarian relief services so that organisations like the IRC can continue to reach those most in need.”, The IRC launched an emergency response to the Ukraine Crisis in February 2022 and has been working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. We are in Poland, Ukraine and Moldova, delivering vital services such as cash assistance, mental health support, and safe healing and learning spaces for children., MEDIA CONTACTS

"In response to today’s State of the European Union speech, director of Save the Children Europe Ylva Sperling issued the following statement:",News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,14 Sep 2022,"BRUSSELS, 14 September 2022 -- ""In today's State of the European Union address, President Ursula von Der Leyen spoke of the massive challenges that children face as a result of the conflict in Ukraine., Since February, over 3 million children have been internally displaced and approximately 2 million children have fled Ukraine to the EU. Save the Children welcomes the President's recognition of the harm children face, her commitment to fund the aid response, including the specific investment of 100 million EUR to reconstruct destroyed schools, and her steadfast solidarity with refugees from Ukraine., We also strongly agree with President von Der Leyen that the welcome shown to Ukrainian refugees in the EU must not be an exception, and should be the blueprint for moving towards a Europe that treats all children on the move with dignity and respect. Today, too many children at Europe's borders face violence and denial of asylum or adequate services - the response to the arrival of refugees from Ukraine shows that another way is possible., The impacts of the conflict extend far beyond children from Ukraine, however, and children in Europe and around the world are at a critical juncture. The economic shocks from the Ukraine conflict are creating an unprecedented energy and cost-of-living crisis in the EU, and President von Der Leyen's recognition that much more needs to be done is important. Key instruments like the Child Guarantee should be fully and urgently implemented and EU funds such as the ESF+ should be strategically allocated to support struggling children and families., The shocks are also exacerbating an already critical global food crisis, with some 60 million children around the world acutely malnourished. These children must not be forgotten or deprioritised., We welcome President von Der Leyen's commitments to future generations, particularly in the face of the escalating climate crisis. Following through on climate commitments and redoubling efforts to phase out fossil fuels are of critical, existential importance., We strongly support the need to ensure the ideas and values of the younger generation are at the centre of the EU's democratic process, and welcome the announcement that 2023 will be Europe's Year of Education and Training. Save the Children looks forward to engaging in the upcoming Child Participation platform to ensure that the views of children, especially marginalized and vulnerable children, are included in the upcoming European Convention., Save the Children will continue working with and for children in Europe and around the world, and is ready to support the European Union institutions and Member States in delivering their commitments to build a fairer society."", For further enquiries please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/response-todays-state-european-union-speech-director-save-children-europe-ylva-sperling-issued-following-statement

Return to Ukraine and back in the warzone,News and Press Release,DRC,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"In the crowd of people gathered in the high ceiling waiting room at the first floor of Lviv Railway Station is a small elderly lady trying to find her way to the queue in front of the Ukraposhta (national post service) counter. Her name is Maria*, an 81-year-old Ukrainian woman from east Ukraine, looking for help., Just as the waiting room itself has been transformed into an emergency shelter facility, the postal office counter is now functioning as a service point that offers government subsidies in the form of emergency cash assistance to internally displaced persons., Legal aid to people on the move, Lviv Railway station, being a main infrastructure hub for people leaving or returning to Ukraine from Poland, is also one of the locations where DRC is present with legal advisors and protection expertise to help people who may need guidance., Maria is here with four family members, among them her daughter and grandchild, as they have just arrived back from Poland to where they fled in the first instance. That was on 8 March, two weeks after the recent conflict erupted on 24 February, and when air alarms and intense shelling made them fear for the lives and decide that it was no longer possible to stay on., Leaving home last minute, ‘We tried to stay home at first. But there were air raid alarms nearly constantly and shelling rained on us, even in the residential areas. In no time, everything around us was destroyed. We didn’t dare waiting and had to leave with a short notice,’ she tells., All they brought were a few bags with ID papers and documents, a few thin blankets, pieces of clothes and some toys for the child. Their village was already by then heavily destroyed. It has seen further waves of attacks ever since with heavy bombardments of the district from where also Ukraine’s President Zelensky originally comes., Maria has been a day labourer there for most of her life working with paint repair of houses. She liked it in the beginning, but it was hard work and badly paid, she recalls, and explains how she made 80-90 Rubles a month, a small amount and not enough to get by. In 1995, she eventually retired and has lived from her government pension since then, hoping for a peaceful life with her family in the village. Her husband died seven years ago, but she was able to remain in their third-floor flat., Conflict since 2014, Conflict has affected Ukraine’s eastern and southern regions since decades, including since 2014 when the Russo-Ukrainian war between the Russian Federation - supported by pro-Russian separatists – and Ukraine. It was focused initially on the status of the Crimean Peninsula and the eastern Donbas-region that are internationally recognised as parts of Ukraine., As most of the residents of eastern and southern Ukraine, people there have lived for years with effects of the conflict and had become used to maneuvering in an environment heavily affected not only by political tensions, but also actual fighting. They have had no other option than to live with the insecurity and witnessed frequent shelling of residential areas, leaving vast areas of land used for farming to be heavily contaminated by mines and unexploded remnants of war that make every step and movement there too dangerous to the local population. But like Maria and her family, they stayed on, got used to the dangers and managed to continue daily lives - until 24 February this year, when the full-fledged Russian Federation-led offensive was launched in Ukraine., Five months abroad, ‘We have stayed nearly five months in Poland, and they hosted us there for free, but it was no longer an option, and we could not afford to stay on when we had to pay. So, we took the train back to Ukraine. We have decided that it is time to go back home to where we belong and where I and the new generations belong. So, we want to travel back to our village. My daughter’s husband is still there. We also have a family member who as passed away and should be at the funeral. And it’s my birthday next week where I will turn 82,’ Maria tells, as the family prepares to take the train back to Dnipro., ‘I look forward to going back,’ says Maria with a smile, ‘and to see my flat. I’m old and don’t walk so well, but there is a lift in our block. I like that place - and I miss being home.’, * Name changed",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/return-ukraine-and-back-warzone

We meet some of them at key locations and places like this - Lviv Railway Station – for example when people arrive on evacuation trains from the east or return from places abroad or within the country where they have been seeking refuge so far,"" tells Vsevolod Borovets., Since he completed his medical education as a psychiatrist in 2018, Vsevolod worked at psychiatric hospitals in Lviv in western Ukraine, and later in 2021, added a specialisation in Public Health., Martial Law and new duties, But everything changed in Ukraine with the blink of an eye on 24 February 2022 – a Thursday morning at 05:00, when the Russian Federation, Ukraine’s neighbour to the north and east, launched a so-called ‘special military operation’, an offensive that goes on till this day, and now, marking six months duration during which thousands have been killed and millions displaced., On 25 February 2022, the day after the Russian Federation offensive was launched in Ukraine, Vsevolod was part of the workforce for whom the Martial Law in Ukraine meant a change of duties., ""My brother and I went to the local authorities on 25 February to see how to best offer our time - and being a doctor, I was immediately referred to other service,"" tells Vsevolod., In his case, he could continue practicing as a psychiatrist, but was requested to volunteer to also conduct first aid trainings., I wanted to help, Vsevolod continued to practice both as a psychiatrist and to also deliver trainings in first aid. But as days went by, he saw the suffering of people around him, met more displaced women and children, and learned about the increasing number of cases of gender-based violence. He then decided to make different use of his education and skills., ""I wanted to do something to help. At first, I conducted trainings in first aid for people with health responsibilities in areas closer to the frontline. Eventually, I decided to find a job where I could play another role, use myself better and be more efficient."", DRC’s Protection teams count medical staff like Vsevolod as well as a growing number of lawyers who are offering critical services and guidance to people in need of urgent assistance., ‘We meet men, women and children who have suffered a lot, talk to them and try to help as best as we can. Whenever we can help directly, we do so and if need be, refer to other organisations or institutions to direct them to the right type of assistance.’, Needs growing by the day, Sometimes, it is hard to comprehend the level of trauma that people are going through and to accept that it is not always possible to help here and now, tells Vsevolod., ‘There was recently a 40-year-old man who arrived here in Lviv alone from the east with an evacuation train and came to us for help. This man had lost his daughter, his wife, his home, and had no place to go, no shelter, no money – nothing. He was desperate,’ remembers Vsevolod., ‘He turned to us because he did not have any documents – a type of problem where we are usually able to assist people in applying for new papers. He was also looking for shelter. Unfortunately, we couldn't help him then. There was simply no shelter left that day from among the places we refer to. Even hospitals are evacuated now and turned into emergency use only. We recorded his details to later refer this case to the (governmental) multi-purpose cash department. So at least he got some help. As far as I remember, he couldn't even find shelter. I think he lives on the street now.’, Not enough emergency shelter, Abandoned buildings are currently turned into shelter and basic refurbishing is badly needed to make them functional. DRC is among the NGO that works to improve access to emergency shelter and has supported multiple projects across Ukraine in the past months thereby creating room for more people. But needs a growing by the day, and Vsevolod Borovets and his colleagues in DRC’s mobile Protection teams regularly comes across similar cases., ""We have a lot of such cases and yes, luckily, we are often able to help – but sometimes not, and then people are quickly moving on. This is the reality right now. Many people are lost and have no other options than to live on the street in Lviv,"" tells Vsevolod., Winter approaching - crisis deepens and spreads, For each day passing, the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is deepening. It is by now affecting the entire country and its population of 44 million people, having displaced more than every third Ukrainian, creating the largest displacement crisis since World War II., As homelessness increase by the day in Ukraine and shelter spaces are far from enough, people continue to search for options wherever possible – in parks, abandoned houses and public buildings. The summer season and temperatures still being warm at least for another couple of months, is likely to trigger even more displaced people to attempt to get by on their own by living outdoors., This, however, will soon change as winter and freezing temperatures are approaching. Ukraine is known for its cold winters with harsh weather conditions and minus degrees that will challenge the needs for shelter and protection and make life in the streets even more dangerous., Back at Lviv Railway station, Vsevolod and the DRC Protection team are getting ready to receive the next train coming in. They know that there will be people whom they can help in the search for new documents, shelter, and access to emergency cash distribution points, but they also know that help will still be far from enough for the people seeking refuge in Lviv.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/growing-needs-protection-and-shelter-ukraine
DRC street lawyers offer legal aid at shelters for displaced in Ukraine,News and Press Release,DRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",24 Aug 2022,"Arriving often with nothing or perhaps only a small bag and a few personal belongings, internally displaced people in Ukraine desperately need support – from a safe place to stay, water, food, clothes - and time to sleep, rest and recover from weeks of fear and uncertainty before deciding what is next., ‘We meet people where they are and set up counseling posts – on railway stations or as here in this shelter facility that houses hundreds of internally displaced people, most of them being women and children,’ tells Orest Moskva. He is part of DRC’s legal aid outreach in Ukraine and several other countries around Europe. They meet people at key locations such as border crossing points, railway stations of shelter facilities where people arrive for shorter or longer-term stays depending on their options and possibilities to move on., Today, Orest Moskva and the DRC Protection team - counting legal, health, and related expertise equipped and trained to guide and counsel people in need – are at an interim shelter site in Lviv, western Ukraine, at an undisclosed location to protect people living and working here., Support to people on the move, ‘We make sure people see us and know that we are present at key points along evacuation routes – among them on the railway station platforms to meet people arriving with the evacuation trains, at aid distribution sites, or in places like this shelter,’ explains Orest Moskva, who like many other DRC employees are internally displaced themselves, but now relocated and working from where they with DRC, coming himself from eastern Ukraine., ‘There are two evacuations trains every day and the people coming in are of course very exhausted and shocked from what they have seen and been through. Some of them would be directed to shelters like this, when there are spaces available. But all too many have nowhere to go.’, The shelter managers announce at the canteen of the sports venue that is now serving lunch for IDPs, that DRC legal aid teams are there and people who need help may go and speak to them., And the number of people patiently waiting in line demonstrate that legal aid services are badly needed also here., A safe place to stay, Oksana, 32, from Donetsk Oblast is one of them, seven months pregnant and traveling with a group of 10 people, six of them children and among them her 12-year-old son. They all left together on 19 July after shelling and active fighting hit their area., ‘I have a house back home but have applied for interim housing offered by the government here. If that does not work out, then I will have to look for a room to rent somewhere.’ Oksana is a single-mother and the breadwinner of her family and explains that she used to work at the bakery factory and has her own house back home. Now, she does not know when, or if, it will be possible to return., ‘I’m in touch with people back home and call them to hear how it is going. Yesterday they told me that five people were killed in our area.’, Oksana wants to speak with DRC lawyers to see how DRC can help her better understand what her options are for help and assistance in Ukraine. She has no plans to leave Ukraine. Her main aim is a safe place to stay for now, not least as she is unable to move around much and expects to deliver her second child in two months' time., ‘Many Ukrainians have lost documents, need for example birth certificates, renewed ID, or are concerned about their rights and options in Ukraine and abroad, and some look for interim shelter, food, clothes or medical aid,’ says Orest Moskva. ‘And it has become even more difficult now to find out what the latest rules and regulations are.’, New rules and regulations in Ukraine, Legislation is changing fast in Ukraine since 24 February and during times of Martial Law, with many being worried about rights or new obligations impacting for example access to pension, impact on mortgages, labour law, official documents and much more creating constant needs to adapt. This makes the role of DRC lawyers even more critical., ‘We meet everyday people from the worst-affected areas of Ukraine which have been under heavy shelling for months who have found their workplaces, houses or apartments damaged or in ruins, who have lost all assets, jobs, businesses, farmland etc. or whose passport or documents are expired or gone. Others need help to simply register as internally displaced where they arrive in order to qualify for government subsidies and other emergency aid,’ says Orest Moskva., The escape, Svitlana used to have a flower shop back home for the past 12 years in her hometown 30 kilometers from the border to the Russian Federation. Since the early morning of the 24 February when the first attacks started, there has been no quiet days, she says, explaining that she has been at the shelter since mid-April when she managed to escape along with her mother and father., For more than a month and a half, they had tried to stay on and cope as best as they could. She tells that she started planting blue and yellow flowers in the garden and wanted to create a flowerbed shaped as the Ukranian flag outside her house. But she never finished the project. There were missile strikes and shelling coming from all four sides of the house. It was a Saturday morning that she will never forget, she says, when she and her parents decided within minutes that it was time to leave as massive shelling started again and came even closer. Svitlana recalls how they had to leave so fast that there was no time to pack or prepare., Trying to call for taxis that could take them quickly to the train station, nobody was willing to take the risk and all refused to come. Eventually, a friend took them to the station where they got on an evacuation train. Only then Svetlana realised that her mother had not even managed to put on her clothes but were covered only in the winter coat that she managed to grab on the way out., The evacuation train they boarded were headed to Vinitsya in central Ukraine, but shelling in areas they had to pass, forced the evacuation train to change the route. That is how they ended travelling across the country over several days in the train, from far east of Ukraine to in Lviv in the western part of the country., ‘Two of my friends who are still there and have been to my home. They tell me that there are some damages, but the walls are still standing. I hope it will soon be possible to return to home and I also want to complete the flowerbed with the flag in our garden’ shares Svitlana.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/drc-street-lawyers-offer-legal-aid-shelters-displaced-ukraine
Local charity assembles aid kits to civilians caught in Ukraine conflict,News and Press Release,DRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",24 Aug 2022,"Lend a hand to save Ukranian lives – says the slogan of Palianytsia Fund, named after a traditional type of bread in Ukraine - a private fund set up as an initiative run by a group of businesspeople in Ukraine. Denys Drach is one of them, usually engaged in managing the dealership of one of the world’s big car brands in Ukraine. Now, his is one of the entrepreneurs behind this private charity initiative that has created a local humanitarian hub with the aim to organise and distribute in-kind donations. They manage to receive and ship off nearly anything from food, toys and clothes to ambulances and emergency aid kits., The initiative is run from a warehouse offered by one of the parties involved, located in the outskirts of Lviv. This is a relatively safe part of Ukraine, in the west a couple of hours drive from the border to Poland, and earlier on also a preferred spot for Polish and local tourism. But now people arrive here with a few or no belongings, fleeing shelling, homes in ruins, and traumatised by experiences., Lviv is now among the cities in Ukraine that has evolved into key locations hosting millions of internally displaced men, women and children who are seeking shelter and protection in past months. Others need support and help as they pass through Lviv on their way to Poland, Romania and Moldova or further afar in Europe along the routes of millions of displaced since 24 February 2022., ‘We are running this initiative based on goodwill from businesspeople in Ukraine and abroad, as well through contributions from organisations like DRC Danish Refugee Council. That's how we managed to quickly set up this facility to receive, package and send off thousands of boxes with basic supplies. We felt that we had to come together and do what we could in this current crisis in our country,’ tells Denys Drach from Palianytsia., He explains how they ensure guidance from medical expertise to advise on first aid boxes allowing for people to treat infections, minor injuries, and other types of situations that can be handled without hospitalisation., Marianne is one of them, a Ukrainian doctor usually working as a dental surgeon and who has traveled extensively across the country, including to eastern Ukraine. She is now among the key forces behind the private charity initiative, and tells how martial law, emergency needs and treatment for her goes way beyond issues such as Covid-19 that used to top the agenda., ‘For me, Covid somehow ended on 24 February when the offensive was launched,’ says Marianne. ‘Some problems are simply superseded by others. There is war in our country, and no time or room right now to focus on other than getting help to where it is needed to save lives.’, ‘We want to direct resources to where they are most needed. That is why only those who pack and organise goods are hired and paid salaries in Palianytsia,’ explains Denys Drach. ‘The rest of us behind this initiative contribute our own money and time and we see this as key to our mission and how we operate. We want to be efficient and deliver goods as fast as possible, which is why the processes are based on principles used in our own lines of work and respective businesses,’ explains Denys Drach., A long assembly line is set up in one end of the warehouse where the aid kits are being put together. It’s built on wooden pallets, next to them are hundreds of boxes, just folded and ready to be filled with goods from the meter high and densely packed shelves organised in themes and relevance to the different types of aid boxes and shipments. Once ready, these are sent to remote areas of east Ukraine and around the country where emergency aid and supplies are desperately needed., ‘With the contributions from DRC, we have been able to deliver 200 kits to people currently hosted in one of our large shelters here in Lviv. We are now looking at organising new kits that will address some of the needs we will see when winter comes and freezing temperatures will become a new challenge,’ says Denys Drach., The content of the boxes differs and are compiled based on assessments from humanitarian stakeholders as well as information Palianytsia receive from people and communities in need., ‘Our aim is to make use of all paths and infrastructure available, formal and informal, but to make sure that we try everything possible to reach people in need where they are. We also manage to get aid to people who have either decided to stay behind because they are not capable of fleeing, or to some who are waiting right now for evacuation,’ says Denys Drach., More boxes wait to be filled. With blankets, cereal, canned meat, coffee, tea, cookies, and more of the items that keep coming in from Ukrainians and others wanting to help Palianytsia make a difference in Ukraine., Displayed on the walls in the warehouse are hundreds of colourful drawings sent in gratitude to Denys Drach and his team at Palianytsia from children all over Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/local-charity-assembles-aid-kits-civilians-caught-ukraine-conflict
Ukraine: Abandoned dormitory transforms into emergency shelter,News and Press Release,DRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items",24 Aug 2022,"The Soviet-era dormitory building looks empty, just until the door opens and a couple of children appear in the doorway and run out to play in the empty parking lot outside. They are far from where they origin in east Ukraine, but the dormitory is their shelter and home for now., Not long ago, nobody even passed by on the small road that leads to the former Commercial Academy that had been empty for several years. But the worn-out building has suddenly come to use as emergency shelter, and people are now desperately waiting for more spaces to become available there., ‘We are slowly making progress and take more people in whenever and wherever we can,’ tells Svitlana., She retired as a teacher a few years back, but when the crisis started evolving after 24 February this year, and millions of people were displaced in just days and weeks, fleeing from intense shelling in east towards safer areas in west, Svitlana knew that it was time for her to act. Thousands of people from the Donbas-region and southern parts of Ukraine arrived in Lviv and needed shelter and protection. She volunteered and was sent to the dormitory to open and run the shelter there., Basic repairs, The dormitory was originally built with rooms for 600 students, but the abandoned blocks can potentially accommodate up to 1,000 internally displaced persons. Facilities are run down and needs to be prepared and slightly improved to become livable after being left for years., One family is living in what used to be the reception of the dormitory and all thinkable vacant rooms and spaces are turned into some use as soon as the basics are in place with beds, blankets, access to toilets, water, showers, interim kitchens and other shared facilities in communal areas., ‘We have managed to create room so far for a little over 400 people and more are coming as we get the work done,’ Svitlana tells as she opens the doors to yet another floor and shows the improvements underway in the first block. Each student room hosts on average three people, and for every eight rooms – meaning 24 people – there is now access to one shower., A constant race against time, Next step is to start work on another block and free more rooms, and, when possible, to change some of the old and broken windows before the winter sets in soon., When asked about a typical workday and the scope of her responsibilities, Svitlana tells how there is no longer time to rest and that she needs to deal with everything from counseling people to distribute food, find more space for newly displaced, keeping her at the shelter from five in the morning till after midnight., ‘Sometimes, the most important thing is to just listen to people and let them share their grief and their individual stories – and the suffering seems to know no limits,’ she tells., Safe spaces, ‘People at all ages have found their way here - young and old, alone or in groups, injured, disabled or traumatised – and they have been on horrific journeys across frontlines, even multiple times fleeing from one place to another. Everyone here has all either seen or experienced things that will mark them for life,’ says Svitlana. ‘But they feel safer here and we try to give them some peace of mind.’, Most people are arriving from badly affected areas such as Mariupol, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Odesa and other parts of the eastern and southern Ukraine. They cannot even be among others right away and often need extended periods of time on their own to be able to get back on their feet, explains Svitlana who are amazed of the resources and strength of the people around her. Her new assistant is among those who recently managed to escape from Mariupol., Four weddings and the birth of a baby, In the midst of fear and suffering, there are also rays of hope., ‘So far, we have had four weddings in the shelter, and a baby was born here recently,’ tells Svitlana proudly. A playroom has been set up functioning as a kindergarten run by the internally displaced people themselves. Toys and furniture are donated by local citizens., There are currently 147 children among the people sheltering in the old dormitory housing primarily women. Svitlana tries to support them all and to make the outside world aware of the needs there. There is still much to be done and still too many displaced people she must reject., Katarina made it to here with two children – her 11-year-old son and a daughter who is 7. They came in July from Luhansk Oblast in the east, when shelling and active fighting intensified in their area and several large explosions hit nearby. The damages had affected also infrastructure there – as has been seen many places in the east – and left them without access to gas, electricity and water which was cut off due to damages from shelling and attacks., Her husband who used to work in the coal mine before that too was gone, remained there when they decided it was time for her and the children to hurry to safer areas in west Ukraine as it was too dangerous for them to stay. Shortly after, he also left the area. Now, they are all together in the dormitory., ‘I’m planning for today and maybe for tomorrow, but other than that I don’t know. We have no plan. I just want to go back to my home and to return to our village as soon as possible when the situation allows for us to travel there again.’, While some may stay only briefly at the emergency shelter in Lviv and try to go back home, Svitlana continues to work to improve and expand space at the dormitory to house more people there. Those who find room here, also find peace at least for some time., ‘We need help to make sure there is more and better space, warmth, food and safety for just some of all those who are homeless, traumatised, and desperately need shelter and protection.’",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-abandoned-dormitory-transforms-emergency-shelter

Shelter and Non-Food Items",24 Aug 2022,"Escaping areas hit by intense shelling for months in eastern Ukraine, 20 people find interim homes and peace of mind in a national park in western Ukraine where foresters are working to turn all extra space into desperately needed shelter for displaced., It used to be students and researchers living in the houses attached to this national reserve in western Ukraine, but now the people hosted here are people who have had no other choice than to flee their homes and seek refuge and protection away from the battle zones in east and south of the country, as well as areas north-west of the capital Kyiv when it was under attack in the first weeks and months after 24 February 2022., ‘We are working hard to host as many people here as possible and we are working every day to find ways and means to expand even further,’ says Danchyyk Olek oversees the UNESCO protected bio reserve., There are several houses in the reserve used earlier on by local Ukrainian universities from around the country who would send staff and students to spend time here. Now, all resources from organisations, charity and local goodwill are turned into use. Danchyyk Olek and the foresters here are trying to mobilse further support to restore the buildings and make them suitable for interim housing for more people and not least to prepare them for the winter, as some have been left empty for years., A new purpose, Danchyyk Olek explains how they have entirely shifted their focus from running the national park, its exhibition spaces and animal sanctuary. In the past months, their time and resources are dedicated solely to efforts related to accommodating more people who they know so desperately need shelter, protection and not least time to recover from extreme stress and trauma., ‘Our exhibition would usually have school classes visiting, but now we can open our doors to children from among the displaced families. Similarly, our meeting room is used as a classroom – and all space we can avail is offered to some of the many people who need shelter right now.’, Some rooms and spaces need better water supplies, electricity, sewage, beds, some mattresses and basic facilities to be transformed into housing that can be offered. A storage room with a kitchen that used to be used for preparing food for wounded animals in the sanctuary is now home to a family from Kherson with fridge, table, chairs and toys for the children brought in by the local community near the national park., ‘We passed perhaps 30 checkpoints and saw many horrors and casualties on the road during our escape and shelling was constant, tells a man who is here with his wife, their son and the bird they managed to rescue.’, Many Ukrainians have managed to bring with them a few belongings, some ID papers and key documents, but also their pets. The boy in the family from Kherson carried during their journey a small cage with his bird named Gosha., ‘We feel very lucky to be here now, and to have found a place where we can breathe and be safe for now,’ says the father who managed to drive the family to safety across the country in their old car parked now in the outskirts of the national park., Legal aid from DRC, A team of lawyers and protection expertise from DRC visits shelters hosting IDPs to offer legal guidance and when need be, referral to treatments and other services offer by local and international institutions. They explain to the new inhabitants in the national park how it is possible restore documents, what services they can expect since recent and constant changes to legislation in Ukraine, and how they can request for support and guidance in case of specific questions or needs., The DRC mobile protection and legal aid teams are able to solve some requests right away and other cases needing more in-depth work and legal analysis are handled by the team right after. Legal aid to people on the move and in displacement are among the core activities offered by DRC across Ukraine – and key infrastructure hubs and locations where internally displaced are hosted., A safe haven far from home, In another house, eight people are currently living in areas that have been turned into two separate apartments. The mother, a musical teacher, tells how they had little time to leave as shelling came close to their homes. They escaped and thought the place they managed to get to after hours on the road was safe. But some days later, they had to flee again., ‘My son is one year and eight months old and even though he is just a small child, he seems to understand all too well what is happening around us. When we arrived here at the national park, he was sitting next to the door for four days and wanted nothing but to go home.’, Right outside the window are pine trees and birds are singing. The reserve is a unique haven out of harm's way for the internally displaced and if they managed to raise enough funds, will be able to house another 100 people, meaning in total 120. Those who have made their way here feel lucky, but they are longing for the time when they can return to their homes. A woman housed in the shelter, tells how she has been in touch recently with some of the people who stayed behind in the area she fled from, including the woman who owns the flat she lives in back home., ‘She has gone to see the place and told me that it looks fine. There are some damages there like everywhere else in the areas that have been shelled, but most of our things are there. And she told me that the flowers I keep inside the apartment are now blossoming.’",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fleeing-woods

Back in Chernihiv, where their hometown is located, DRC meets them at what they describe as a site marked by great misfortune and incredible luck., 26-year-old Oleksii remembers the moment all too well – it was on Monday 7 March around noon, a dark and cold winter day, when the car he was in made a turn to cross a country road he had passed so often - but this time, it hit a landmine. It was just 50 meters from his home, in the middle of the road, dug down in the narrow grass-covered path dividing the lanes and where nobody had expected that an anti-vehicle landmine could be hiding in the soil., The explosion came from the ground right under my feet, as I was standing up in the car with one other person next to me, and three seated in the front cabin. The blast affected me the most and threw me out of the car.
Oleksii, 26, “I was finishing a second trip to the forest where we were fetching wood for construction nearby. My father who had been with us in the first group, had waited for me to return. That was when the explosion came from the ground right under my feet as I was standing up in the car with one other person next to me, and three seated in the front cabin. The blast affected me the most and threw me out of the car,” tells Oleksii, sitting at a small wooden chair and often looking down at his still swollen feet with multiple scars witnessing of pain and complicated surgery. After five months he is finally out of the wheelchair and now moving cautiously around with a walker., Oleksii’s father managed to quickly bring his son to a hospital over 100 kilometers away where he could get treatment. Both parents – the mother being a nurse, the father an oxygen tank mechanic and both usually working elsewhere - decided to stay near their son at the hospital to be able to better help., The missile, Exactly one week later, on Monday 13 March, when they were still at the hospital caring for Oleksii, a phone call brought them shocking news from their village. A missile had hit right in the middle of the house – their home since more than 22 years - now, a site of ashes, debris, and all their belongings vanished or melted into bits and pieces hardly recognisable., While trying to grasp how to deal with yet another tragedy, Oleksii’s mother tells how in that moment they also reasoned that being with their injured son had perhaps saved their lives., ""If our son had not been at the hospital, and us with him there, we would probably have been at home and seeking shelter in the basement from the shelling. But all is gone now, including part of the basement, and from the damages we now see, we would never have survived the strike.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-we-are-lucky-be-alive

The initiative is guided by the CWG Task Team 4 on Monitoring (CWG TT4), led by ACTED and REACH and supported by the CWG members., Marketplaces across Ukraine are assessed on a monthly basis. In each location, field teams record prices and other market indicators through retailer and customer interviews. In addition to the interviews, REACH conducts online price monitoring across the country.

Close consultations are also being held with Presidential advisors, key ministries, mayors in several cities (including through Child and Youth Friendly Cities) and the Ombudspersons Office. Through its long-standing presence in Ukraine, UNICEF has established partnerships in key hromadas (municipalities) and continues to expand these in all oblasts (regions). Around 92 government and civil society partners have been engaged with UNICEF to respond to the critical needs of children and families across Ukraine., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, The situation in Ukraine remains highly complex. Active fighting continues and has become more intense in the south, with a continuous flow of internally displaced people away from the frontline. In Zaporijiia and Kryvyi Rih, there are reports of 1,000 people leaving a day. In addition, the situation is worrying in Mykolaiv with water supply infrastructure seriously damaged. The residents of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv regions are also expected to undergo mandatory evacuation, in addition to the Donetsk region., Shelling around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southwestern Ukraine – Europe’s largest nuclear plant – has also continued, increasing the risk of a nuclear accident. Monitors from the nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, visited the station in late August and called for an end to shelling and the establishment of a safety and security protection zone around the plant., Other complexities of the emergency include the uncertainty regarding new potential targets or intensified confrontations, humanitarian access constraints in non-government-controlled areas, increasing family vulnerability due to a lack of sustained income sources, and the approaching winter with a heightened risk of electricity, fuel and gas shortages. It is expected that between 30,000 and 50,000 families with children will arrive in Odesa from the northern parts of Ukraine and neighbouring Odesa oblasts by the end of September 2022 because of winter. Most likely, those families will be settled down in Odesa and will not move abroad., The new school year started on 1 September but in varied formats depending on the situation on the ground. In Odesa city in the south, for example, 97 per cent of schools opted for online education, according to city authorities. Out of 737 schools in Odesa oblast, only 326 were opened. Fifty-nine schools are fully operational, while the rest are scheduled to provide mixed online and offline education. Out of 855 kindergartens, only 267 were opened. No school is open in Mykolaiv city, with very few providing mixed (online and offline) modes of education in Mykolaiv oblast.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-20-24-august-6-september-2022

Logistics and Telecommunications",13 Sep 2022,"Black Sea Grain Initiative, The Initiative was launched by the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine, and the United Nations on 22 July 2022 to enable the resumption of exports from Ukraine of grain, other foodstuffs, and fertilizer, including ammonia, through a safe maritime humanitarian corridor from three key Ukrainian ports, Chornomorsk, Odesa and Yuzhny/Pivdennyi, in the Black Sea to the rest of the world. The Initiative is based on the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended, (SOLAS) and the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code). The Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) was established under the Initiative in Istanbul and comprises senior representatives from the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine, and the United Nations., Vessel Movements, ▪ As of noon on 12 September, 2.7 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs were moved from the three Ukrainian ports. So far, 53% of the cargo was corn, 23% wheat, 12% sunflower products, 6% barley, 5% rapeseed, 1% soya beans, with other products making up the remainder., ▪ Destinations: 28% to low and lower-middle income1 countries: Egypt (10%), Iran and India (5%), Sudan and Kenya (2%), and Djibouti, Lebanon, Somalia, and Yemen (1%); 27% to upper-middle income countries: Türkiye (19%), China (8%), and Bulgaria (<1%); and 44% to high-income countries: Spain (13%), The Netherlands (8%), Italy (7%), Republic of Korea (5%), Romania (4%), Germany (2%), and France, Greece, Ireland and Israel (1%). Destinations indicated are based on information received at the JCC and may change based on commercial activity. Grains that reach a destination may go through processing and be transshipped to other countries. Detailed movement reports can be found here: https://www.un.org/en/black-sea-graininitiative/vessel-movements, ▪ On 2 September, the FAO announced that world food prices dipped for the fifth month in a row. The FAO Cereal Price Index decreased by 1.4% from August, a drop driven by a 5.1% decline in international wheat prices reflecting improved production prospects in North America and the Russian Federation as well as the resumption of exports from the Black Sea ports in Ukraine., ▪ Since 1 August, the JCC has enabled the safe movement of 122 voyages from Ukraine and 144 voyages to Ukraine. As part of its responsibilities, the JCC has been closely monitoring the inbound and outbound movement of vessels through the maritime humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea. On several occasions, it has observed vessels deviating from the corridor and it has responded appropriately by contacting captains and advising them to follow the coordinates. In some cases, the JCC made formal contact in writing when the same vessels deviated several times. The JCC is also providing pre-transit briefs to inbound captains during the inspection process in Istanbul. The JCC continues to assess and review the procedures put in place to ensure the safe passage of vessels through the maritime humanitarian corridor. On 25 August the JCC revised the Maritime Humanitarian Corridor and issued fresh procedures., ▪ A first UN World Food Programme-chartered vessel, BRAVE COMMANDER (IMO 9136931), docked in Djibouti on 30 August to support the drought response in the Horn of Africa. A second WFP-chartered vessel, KARTERIA (IMO 9236092) loaded with 37,500 metric tons of wheat sailed on 30 August and docked in Türkiye on 3 September, where the wheat will be milled to flour and shipped to Yemen in two different vessels. This flour will then be loaded onto a different ship that will head to Yemen to support World Food Programme’s humanitarian response there. A third WFP-chartered vessel, IKARIA ANGEL (IMO 9194397) is en route to Chornomorsk, where it will load 30,000 metric tons of wheat destined for Djibouti, further supporting humanitarian efforts in the Horn of Africa.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/black-sea-grain-initiative-joint-coordination-centre-factsheet-12-september-2022
Update 102 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (13 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,13 Sep 2022,"Ukrainian engineers have made further headway in repairing vital power infrastructure in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), providing the plant with renewed access to a third back-up power line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site today., The 150 kilovolt (kV) back-up line was made available to the ZNPP again after the repair of an electrical switchyard at a nearby thermal power plant, a few days after it was damaged by shelling that also plunged the city of Enerhodar into darkness., This means that all three back-up power lines to the ZNPP – Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – have been restored over the past few days. One of them, a 750/330 kilovolt (kV) line, is now providing the ZNPP with the external electricity it needs for cooling and other essential safety functions. The 330 kV and the 150 kV lines are being held in reserve. All the ZNPP’s six reactors are in a cold shutdown state, but they still require power to maintain necessary safety functions., As a result of the repair of the switchyard, some people in Enerhodar – which suffered a complete blackout last week – are again receiving electricity. While the thermal power plant is not operating, its switchyard can be used to access electricity from the Ukrainian network., Despite these developments related to the plant’s power situation, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi again stressed that the nuclear safety and security situation at the plant – held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff in the middle of a war zone – remained precarious. While there has been no shelling at or near the ZNPP in recent days, it was still occurring in the wider area, he said. The ZNPP’s four main external power lines are all down and it is not currently providing electricity to households, factories and others., To help stabilise the situation, the Director General has initiated consultations with the relevant parties aimed at the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP. Earlier this month, he established a continuous IAEA presence at the ZNPP after leading a team of experts to the site., Separately today, as part of continuing IAEA-led support for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, Director General Grossi said a second major assistance shipment had arrived in the country, including radiation monitoring and personal protective equipment provided by Hungary, Romania and Spain., The delivery to Ukraine’s Rivne and South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plants, as well as the country’s regulator and its state emergency service, was organized through the IAEA’s Response and Assistance Network (RANET), where countries can register their capabilities for support in areas ranging from radiation dose assessments and decontamination to nuclear installation assessment and advice, radioactive source search and recovery, and much else. It follows an earlier shipment of equipment to Ukraine in July.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-102-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-13-sep-2022

Ukraine Focus on Food: Staple Starches - July 2022,News and Press Release,REACH,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",31 Jul 2022,"Price monitoring of staple starches, Since February 2022, grains have become more expensive across the board. Bread, wheat flour, buckwheat and rice are staple food items and feature in the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) basket (a subset of the Minimum Expenditure Basket maintained by the SSSU)., Buckwheat and rice in particular have experienced dramatic price hikes., In 2021, Ukraine sourced most of its buckwheat from Russia, followed by Kazakhstan and Belarus. Prices of this staple grain have soared since GoU banned Russian imports in March. As for rice, most imports came from India, China, Pakistan and Thailand through Black Sea ports in 2021, which, following the escalation of hostilities earlier this year, were entirely blocked until 1 August 2022. The domestic rice production that does exist is located in the conflictaffected oblasts of Odesa and Kherson.

Before the war, Ukraine exported 6 million tonnes of grain monthly through its seaports., • As of 23 August 2022, the estimated number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Ukraine has increased to 6.9 million. This increase of 330 000 IDPs from last month’s figure is largely fueled by new displacements in the east and south of Ukraine. Cash remains the most pressing need for 60 percent of IDPs., • The revised Rapid Response Plan (RRP) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) requires USD 115.4 million to assist 979 320 people in rural areas through December 2022., • To address the grain storage crisis, FAO has developed a Grain Storage Support Strategy (GSSS), requiring an additional USD 65 million, as an extension of the RRP, to deploy 4.07 million tonnes of storage capacity in Ukraine – 25 percent of the estimated overall need.
In addition, the strategy will strengthen government capacity for food commodity testing and certifications necessary for export at border facilities., • To date, FAO has raised USD 73.6 million against the total of USD 180.4 million under the RRP and GSSS, leaving a gap of USD 106.8 million, which are urgently needed to support vulnerable households and increase agricultural production in rural areas., • FAO continues to work on the ground in Ukraine with a team of over 95 members, including technical and operational personnel deployed to support the scale‑up.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fao-humanitarian-response-update-12-september-2022

Protection and Human Rights",13 Sep 2022,"War has destroyed much of nine-year-old Diana’s neighborhood in the Saltivka area of Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine. Every apartment building in her complex is damaged., “When the war started I thought it was thunder,” she recalls. “There was light in the distance and it turned out that it was [missiles]. We all ran into the basement to hide there during the first couple of days""., The war has destroyed or damaged an estimated 10 per cent of Ukraine’s schools over the past six months, Diana’s school is one of them., Across the country, unabated attacks have left children sleeping and studying in basements, bomb shelters, underground stations and temporary accommodation., As the new school term gets underway, UNICEF is working in partnership with the Government of Ukraine, determined to get every child back to learning safely., Diana’s school was reduced to ruins by the fighting, so she is attending online in the meantime. She longs for the building to reopen., Seven-year-old Davyd is from Kramatorsk. The family had been at the train station enquiring about evacuation. Later that day, 52 people were killed in an attack there., “Every time the air raid sirens sound, Davyd gets scared and cries,” says his grandmother. “So I always try to be nearby to comfort him whenever that happens.”, The youngster misses the school and friends he left behind in Kramatorsk., ""I want to go to school and meet many new friends,” says Davyd. “I like to study maths, writing and reading. I like to play during the break and I like the after-school activities.”, At the height of violence in the village of Olyzarivka, on the outskirts of Kyiv, 13-year-old Nazar and his mother, Alina, would pore over textbooks together in their basement, to the sound of shelling and bombing above., Denys, 8, and his younger sister are from Kherson in the south of Ukraine, on the Dnipro River, where they liked to swim., During the fighting, their mother was caught in the crossfire and detained. After her release, they fled. “Denys was begging me to take his toys,” says Nadiya., “He likes his teacher and misses her,” she continues. “He would ask me, ‘Mommy, when can I go back to school?’”, This September, Denys started at a new school in Lviv, repeating his first grade so he can catch up on the fundamentals. “I like school because we can play there,” he says, happily. “When I grow up, I want to become a policeman because they have nice cars, and they protect the shops from being robbed.”, Mariia, 12, lives in her home city of Kharkiv. “My school was hit about a month ago, in July,” she says, sadly. “I don’t know why they bombed it. I thought COVID was bad, but this has been the worst time of my life.”, Over time, Mariia has found strength in adversity – and hopes to help others find the same. “Since I was not spending time with my friends because all of them were gone and I didn’t go to school, I could continue my self-development in other ways,” she says. “I started a gratitude journal and started meditating. I started getting interested in psychology even more, and I realized who I want to be in the future and what I need for that.”, “I like to talk to people to learn about them and I want to help with their mental illness or difficulties,” she continues., “I like my school because of the teachers, who respect and love us and try to teach us a lot,” says Mariia. “I prefer studying at school because I have friends there, and I enjoy seeing them and chatting with them.”, Nazar, 12, is from Zaporizhzhia, in southeastern Ukraine., When they fled the fighting, Nazar’s mother, who worked in an orphanage back home, helped to evacuate 100 children from the city., ""In my free time, I like learning about programming,” says Nazar, who is has also started starting an online school programme this September. “When I grow up, I want to work in IT and do programming because programmers earn a lot of money and it's very interesting. I want to create my own company that will be creating video games.”, In Lviv, Nazar met his new friend, Karyna, 10., Karyna and her mother fled their home city of Myrnohrad at the beginning of August. She and Nazar love to play Jenga and games in a nearby park., “Last year, I went to school just half of the time because of COVID-19 and the war.”, “I miss my classmates,” Karyna continues. “Many of my friends left for different cities and countries. I want to go back to see my friends and play and be able to sit at the same desk as them.”, When Sofiia, 13, and her family fled attacks in Irpin, they only narrowly escaped, navigating a maze of destroyed buildings and bridges just before the people who were left in the city became trapped by fighting., “The past six months were difficult for me,” says Sofiia. “I was thinking about the war all the time. But I was doing my best to cope with it. I did not go to school.”, Now the family has returned home. “I was really frightened at first, but then I saw all the people starting to live their lives like normal again and I had hope for our future,” says her sister Lyudmyla, 16., “My favorite subject is history,” says Sofiia. “I think I'm going to choose a job that will help me to interact with a lot of people, maybe a journalist or a news presenter. I'll need to study a lot for that, maybe I'll need to improve my English skills. I hope that in 20 years I'll have my own place, will be doing a job that I like and will live my life the way I want.”, “I really want the war to be over,” she sighs. “I want it to be peaceful, so we can have a good life.”, Ukraine’s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services , and psychosocial support.

All ongoing and future trials over alleged war crimes must meet fair trial standards.”, “In what appears to be a response to Ukraine’s military gains, Russia has launched attacks that caused significant damage to critical civilian infrastructure, including a power plant strike that led to power and water outages and disrupted civilian activities. We remind Russia that deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure may amount to war crimes. These strikes must be investigated with a view to ensuring that anyone suspected of criminal responsibility is brought to justice.”, Background, In recent days, Ukrainian forces have reportedly regained control of over 3,000 square kilometres of territory previously occupied by Russia, including Izyum and Kupiansk, two key towns in Kharkiv oblast., As Russian forces retreat, evidence of alleged war crimes committed by them and Russia-backed armed groups is emerging in the form of testimonies, video footage and photographs., On 10 September, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies reported that police officers had exhumed the bodies of two men allegedly tortured and killed by Russian forces in Hrakove village, Kharkiv oblast, in March., On 11 and 12 September, Russian military strikes damaged critical energy infrastructure, resulting in major disruptions to electricity and water supplies as well as train services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-ukraine-retakes-territory-russia-securing-evidence-alleged-war-crimes-crucial
The enormous mental health needs for displaced people in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,MSF,Health,13 Sep 2022,"Voices from the Field, The war in Ukraine has continued to rage for over six months, causing millions of people to flee their homes in a desperate attempt to escape death and injuries. Many people have lost their family members and are traumatised by the war – either physically and/or emotionally., Mental health needs are enormous and addressing them is a priority for our teams. Below are testimonies from our patients who have been directly impacted by the fighting and whose stories illustrate the devastation caused by the war., Yevhenia is from a village in the Kherson region, now under Russian military control. She now lives in a centre for displaced people in the Dnipropetrovsk region., “When the Russian soldiers came to our yard, we were in the basement. They told us to come outside, checked our documents and then sent us back to the basement. Then they moved into our house and started living there., When the Ukrainian soldiers entered our village, they asked if anyone wanted to leave. On the same day, we went to Kryvyi Rih. We have friends here who sheltered us, there were 14 people living in their house, including us., “Later on we asked for a place to stay at the displacement shelter; we had been sleeping on the floor at our friends' house, and my husband was recovering from surgery., He had been shot in the back when we were still at home. After being shot, he stayed in the basement for a month and a half without treatment or medicine – we had nothing. Everything was destroyed., On 3 April we found out that my son had died. They told us that his body was in a morgue in Kryvyi Rih and now we have buried him., We are recovering, but we can’t forget what we went through. We have no home now, it was destroyed. But we still want to return and rebuild our village. We thank this city for sheltering us. But home is home.”, Alla was displaced from her village in the Kherson region after the war began., When the war began, Kherson was taken under Russian military control. After several attempts, Alla finally escaped from Kherson, and now lives in a displaced people's centre in the Dnipropetrovsk region., “There was shelling every minute, every second – day and night. Every missile was a roll of the dice, they hit places randomly and people died. I knew so many people who died, including my friend., My mother and I used to shelter in the basement. But the basement is so deep, and my mother is 86… it wasn’t easy. The first time we tried to leave home, we travelled with our neighbours by car but we were turned back at a checkpoint. We were not allowed to leave., “I left my mother at the checkpoint, and went home to get my bicycle so my mother could lean on it while she walked. This made it easier for us to reach another checkpoint, but once again we were turned back., My mother got on the bicycle and I started to wheel her home, but then we met another woman who told us that it was finally possible to pass the checkpoints., It was still so hard to leave home. We didn’t reach the displacement shelter and dormitory until midnight. We’re here now but we still want to go home. Everything is destroyed there, but even if it’s just rubble, it’s still our home.”, Tetiana was displaced from her village in the Kherson region. Now she lives in a displaced people's centre in the Dnipropetrovsk region., “I lived, worked my whole career, and retired in the same village. We were preparing to get older, we wanted to live in comfort., Then, on 27 March, there was shelling and we were forced to leave our home. I didn't want to hide in the basement, because I was afraid that the house would collapse on us., “We have an outhouse that we use as a kitchen in summer. The walls there are thick, and I felt we would be safer there. There was shelling through the night, and we stayed in the outhouse. When morning came, I realised I just couldn't do that anymore, so we decided to travel to Nikopol., We were staying in Nikopol but my husband had to return home to work. I decided to go with him., It was Easter when our house was destroyed. Our friends told us to come and stay in their house… but as soon as we got there, the shelling began., We stayed there for several days, after that I could not do it anymore. My husband stayed in the village, and I arrived in the city of Kryvyi Rih on 19 July., My granddaughter is seven years old. She talks about building new things to comfort me. When we ask what her greatest wish is, she says, ‘I want to have my own home.’”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/enormous-mental-health-needs-displaced-people-ukraine-enuk
"Situation at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant ‘Untenable,’ Protection Zone Needed, IAEA’s Grossi tells Board",News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Sep 2022,"In his opening address to the IAEA’s Board of Governors today, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi reiterated his call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine., Mr Grossi described the precarious situation at the plant caused by weeks of shelling in the area that has damaged vital power infrastructure and prompted operators to put the last reactor into shutdown., He told the 35-member Board: “This situation is untenable, and we are playing with fire. We cannot continue this situation where we are one step away from a nuclear accident. The safety of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is hanging by a thread.” Initial consultations with Ukraine and Russia to establish a protection zone have begun, he added., At the end of August, Mr Grossi led the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ISAMZ). The mission established a continuous IAEA presence at the site to help ensure nuclear safety and security; it also allowed inspectors to complete vital safeguards activities. Mr Grossi said that, based on the evaluation of all safeguards relevant information available to the IAEA, the Agency had found no indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern., Verification and monitoring, Since 23 February 2021, the Agency’s verification and monitoring of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA have been seriously affected by Iran’s decision to stop the implementation of those commitments, including its commitments under the Additional Protocol. In the Director General’s report on verification and monitoring in Iran, he highlighted that in the event of a full resumption of Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA, the Agency would need to address the gap in its knowledge of what took place while its surveillance and monitoring equipment was not in operation., With regard to the NPT Safeguards Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr Grossi said: “Unless and until Iran provides technically credible explanations of [the] presence of uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at three undeclared locations, we are not going to be able to confirm… the completeness and the correctness of their declarations.”, Mr Grossi said that he hoped the Agency would be able to re-engage appropriately with Iran, “so that we can continue this indispensable work for international peace and security and for Iran to continue with its peaceful nuclear activities.”, The IAEA continues to monitor the nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Mr Grossi told the Board, expressing concern about activities indicating the reopening of its nuclear test site. He said that the continuation of the DPRK’s nuclear programme was a violation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions., AUKUS discussion, Mr Grossi presented a report to the Board on IAEA safeguards in relation to AUKUS. Under AUKUS, the United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to assist Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines. He explained the report served as an informative summary of the Agency’s activities thus far. Mr Grossi emphasized the Agency will have its verification and non-proliferation mandate as its guiding principle., Nuclear safety and security Mr Grossi highlighted some of the latest developments in nuclear safety and security, including the Seventh Review Meeting of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (Joint Convention) which the IAEA hosted earlier this year. The Joint Convention, which has been in force since 2001 and is under the auspices of the IAEA, is the only international legally binding instrument addressing the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management on a global scale., The Agency has also made progress in the safety review of Japan’s plans and activities related to the discharge of the treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, he said, highlighting that the IAEA will provide technical assistance before, during and after the discharge of the treated water. The IAEA Task Force set up to undertake the review has released a first report on safety of the planned water discharge, and a second report on regulatory aspects. A third report is expected to be released later this year and will provide a comprehensive overview of the IAEA’s planned activities to corroborate relevant radiological data under its broader safety review., Nuclear solutions for global challenges, The IAEA continues to assist countries in addressing some of their most pressing development challenges by assisting with the expansion in their capacity to use nuclear science and technology. To date, more than 900 participants from over 95 Member States have been trained through Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action’s (ZODIAC) virtual interregional training courses, and the first ZODIAC fellows from Indonesia, Senegal and Tunisia have completed their training on whole-genome sequencing at the Seibersdorf laboratories. The laboratories the IAEA has been equipping under ZODIAC will be instrumental in better understanding and responding to such diseases. Recently Mr Grossi discussed with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, the two organizations’ extensive collaboration including with regard to the increasing threat of zoonotic disease outbreaks affecting people across the world., Helping countries adapt to climate change and ensure a secure supply of food and water, is an important area of the IAEA’s work thanks to game-changing solutions offered by nuclear science and technology. Last week, Mr Grossi met with Qu Dongyu, Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in Rome, where they discussed how to further strengthen their cooperation, in particular in the area of food security, he said., In relation to the energy and climate crisis, the IAEA together with the United States, will host the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century, in Washington DC, from 26 to 28 October. It will offer a forum for government leaders, industry representatives, policy makers and experts from around the world to discuss the key challenges and opportunities nuclear power presents in the context of energy security and climate change. Mr Grossi encouraged all Member States to take part in this unique event., Following the Ministerial Conference, the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27, will take place in Egypt. There, the IAEA will build on its achievements at last year’s COP by highlighting the key role of nuclear science and technology in supporting climate change mitigation and adaptation, Mr Grossi said., The Board of Governors is meeting at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna from 12-16 September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/situation-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant-untenable-protection-zone-needed-iaeas-grossi-tells-board

Denmark contributes $3.6 million to protect women's and girls' health and rights in Ukraine and Moldova,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Contributions
Health
Protection and Human Rights",12 Sep 2022,"UNITED NATIONS, New York - The Government of Denmark has contributed 25 million Danish Krone (US$3.6 million) to UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, for its humanitarian response in Ukraine and Moldova. The funding will enable UNFPA to continue prioritizing the reproductive health and protection needs of women and girls affected by the war in Ukraine., As the conflict enters its seventh month, UNFPA remains dedicated to upholding the rights of women and girls whose lives have been upended by the war. The vast majority of people who have fled the country are women and children, who urgently need health and protection assistance. In the last six months, UNFPA has reached over 6 million people with humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including through the provision of more than 95 tons of sexual and reproductive health medicines and supplies distributed across Ukraine and Moldova, and the delivery of 25,000 dignity kits., Denmark’s contribution will help support UNFPA’s humanitarian response to ensure safe births, reproductive health, and address gender-based violence and mental trauma among women and young people. With more than 530 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, reported by WHO as of 12 September, pregnant women are being forced to leave war-torn areas and traveling to other regions of the country to seek help, where staff and supplies are increasingly scarce. UNFPA will scale up its sexual and reproductive health services and increase access to medical assistance for women and girls, particularly in conflict-ridden and hard-to-reach areas., UNFPA is also scaling up and strengthening its mental health support , especially for women, girls and young people who have lost relatives, homes, education and career opportunities. UNFPA is running integrated psychosocial programmes to help improve the mental health and well-being of young people affected by the war. In Moldova, UNFPA-supported “Orange Safe Spaces” and mobile teams are offering immediate support and counseling to women and girls, and serve as an entry point for services and referrals for gender-based violence and reproductive health., “This new contribution from Denmark will go a long way in assisting women and girls who are lacking access to quality reproductive health and protection services as a result of the war,” said Florence Bauer, UNFPA Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “This will allow UNFPA to continue prioritizing the unique needs of women and girls in the midst of conflict.”, The war in Ukraine is having a devastating impact on the lives of women and girls, in Ukraine, and around the world. UNFPA requires flexible resources to meet the needs of women and girls and to safeguard their rights and choices. In 2021, Denmark was the sixth-highest core contributor to UNFPA. The country has been a longstanding partner in support of UNFPA’s humanitarian action to end gender-based violence and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights., “More than 6 months of war have taken a dramatic toll on the people of Ukraine,” said Mr. Flemming Møller Mortensen, Minister for Development Cooperation and Minister for Nordic Cooperation of Denmark. “Denmark supports UNFPA in prioritizing the protection and reproductive health needs of women and young people affected by the war.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/denmark-contributes-36-million-protect-womens-and-girls-health-and-rights-ukraine-and-moldova
Update 101 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (12 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Sep 2022,"A second back-up power line to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has been restored, enabling the operator to keep one line in reserve while the other provides the plant with the external electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions during shutdown, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) learnt at the site today., In another development significant for nuclear safety at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, a reactor unit that was shut down yesterday has now entered a cold shutdown state like the facility’s five other reactors, meaning it will require less power for cooling., It was the ZNPP’s last operating reactor, and it was shut down after the restoration on Saturday of a 330 kilovolt (kV) power line allowed the plant to access off-site electricity from the grid instead of relying on the reactor itself for power. A 750/330 kV line has now also been restored and it is being used to provide the plant with power required for its safety functions, with the restored 330 kV line held in reserve. The two restored lines can both receive power from the grid through the switchyard of a nearby thermal power station., Despite these developments related to the plant’s access to external power, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi emphasised that the nuclear safety and security situation at the plant – located in the middle of a war zone – remained precarious. The ZNPP’s four main external power lines are all down and it is not currently providing electricity to households, factories and others., “A nuclear safety and security protection zone is urgently needed and I have begun initial consultations with the relevant Parties,” the Director General said in a statement to the IAEA Board of Governors today.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-101-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-sep-2022

This figure is expected to grow in the coming months as the war continues., The Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA) presents the first comprehensive evaluation of war impacts across twenty different sectors following the Russian invasion. It also lays out the financing needs for a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable recovery and reconstruction and provides a roadmap for planning., President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Ukraine is fighting for democracy and our common values. The EU cannot match the sacrifice Ukraine is enduring but we are mobilising all our instruments to address the most immediate needs, including for housing for internally displaced populations and to repair critical infrastructure. Since the start of Russia’s brutal and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU has mobilised 10 billion euro in financing, humanitarian, emergency and military assistance for Ukraine and another 5 billion euros in financing are in the pipeline. The EU will walk every step of the way with Ukraine to rebuild a democratic, independent and prosperous country on its path to the EU.”, ""With joint efforts, we have already started reconstruction in the de-occupied Ukrainian territories, but reconstruction requires a comprehensive approach and the mobilization of joint resources of the Ukrainian government and international partners. The assessment of the destruction and the identification of reconstruction needs creates a solid basis for the national Reconstruction Plan and is a prerequisite for effective financing. After all, only for the first stage, rapid recovery, $17 billion is needed, of which Ukraine needs $3.4 billion already this year,"" said Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal., The assessment covers the impacts of the war sustained between February 24 and June 1, 2022, and found that physical damage from the war reached over $97 billion. It was particularly high in the housing, transport, commerce and industry sectors. The destruction was concentrated in the Chernihivska, Donetska, Luhanska, Kharkivska, Kyivska, and Zaporizka oblasts., The RDNA results are preliminary, and damage and needs should be considered as minimums., “The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to exact a terrible toll, from significant civilian casualties and the displacement of millions of people to the widespread destruction of homes, businesses, social institutions, and economic activity,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Regional Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. “The Government of Ukraine now faces the difficult task of balancing recovery with the country’s immediate needs, including core public services such as health, education and social protection, which are critical to preventing further deterioration in living conditions and poverty in Ukraine. The RDNA will help in identifying priorities for recovery while we continue to support the continuation of essential core services.”, The report found that recovery and reconstruction needs across social, productive, and infrastructure sectors total $349 billion, which is more than 1.5 times the 2021 GDP of Ukraine. Over the next 36 months the RDNA assesses that $105 billion is needed to address urgent needs such as restoring education and health systems and infrastructure, preparing for the upcoming winter through restoration of heating and energy to homes, support to agriculture, and repair of vital transport routes. The safe management of debris and explosives, including landmines, also pose a substantial cost., The Government of Ukraine is looking at the specific needs across the different regions ahead of the winter. Based on the highest priorities, tailored recovery and reconstruction plans are being developed to guide a program in each area., The World Bank and the European Commission confirmed their continued support for the Government of Ukraine.

The destruction was concentrated in the Chernihivska, Donetska, Luhanska, Kharkivska, Kyivska, and Zaporizka oblasts., The RDNA results are preliminary, and damage and needs should be considered as minimums., “The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to exact a terrible toll, from significant civilian casualties and the displacement of millions of people to the widespread destruction of homes, businesses, social institutions, and economic activity,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Regional Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. “The Government of Ukraine now faces the difficult task of balancing recovery with the country’s immediate needs, including core public services such as health, education and social protection, which are critical to preventing further deterioration in living conditions and poverty in Ukraine. The RDNA will help in identifying priorities for recovery while we continue to support the continuation of essential core services.”, The report found that recovery and reconstruction needs across social, productive, and infrastructure sectors total $349 billion, which is more than 1.5 times the 2021 GDP of Ukraine. Over the next 36 months the RDNA assesses that $105 billion is needed to address urgent needs such as restoring education and health systems and infrastructure, preparing for the upcoming winter through restoration of heating and energy to homes, support to agriculture, and repair of vital transport routes. The safe management of debris and explosives, including landmines, also pose a substantial cost., The Government of Ukraine is looking at the specific needs across the different regions ahead of the winter. Based on the highest priorities, tailored recovery and reconstruction plans are being developed to guide a program in each area., The World Bank and the European Commission confirmed their continued support for the Government of Ukraine. Given the ongoing war, there will be a need for future assessments of damage, loss and reconstruction/recovery needs in Ukraine. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) has committed financial support for this purpose., The Ukraine RDNA full report can be downloaded here (Ukrainian version full report downloadable here). Summary reports: English version, Ukrainian version., The RDNA benefited from the generous support of the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s Good Governance Fund; the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR); the United States Government, including the State Department; and the Swiss Government through the Sustaining Health Sector Reforms in Ukraine Trust Fund, supported by the Swiss Development Cooperation., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/11, Contacts, In Washington:

Update 100 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (11 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,11 Sep 2022,"A back-up power line to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has been restored, providing the plant with the external electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) learnt at the site today., Yesterday evening’s restoration of a 330 kilovolt (kV) reserve line – which connects Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian network through the switchyard of a thermal power station in the nearby city of Enerhodar – enabled the ZNPP to shut down its last operating reactor early this morning. This reactor had over the past week provided the ZNPP with power after the facility was disconnected from the grid. With the line restoration, electricity needed for nuclear safety at the ZNPP once again comes from the external grid., Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi welcomed the latest developments regarding the ZNPP’s power status – which were also confirmed by Ukraine – but he stressed that the situation at the plant remained precarious after weeks of shelling in the area that damaged vital power infrastructure. Even with all the reactors in shutdown, power is still required for reactor cooling and other systems needed to maintain safety., “Despite this damage, plant operators and engineers have been able to restore one of the reserve power lines, in very challenging circumstances, to provide the ZNPP with badly-needed external electricity,” Director General Grossi said. “However, I remain gravely concerned about the situation at the plant, which remains in danger as long as any shelling continues. To address this serious situation, consultations have begun on the urgent need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).”, A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety and preventing a nuclear accident, even when the reactors are no longer operating. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., IAEA experts present at the site of the ZNPP since 1 September – as part of the team led by Director General Grossi to establish the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) at the facility – were informed by senior Ukrainian plant staff that reactor unit 6 was shut down at 03:41am local time (02:41am CET). The other five units were already in cold shutdown and the plant is currently not providing any electricity to households, factories and others relying on it for their needs. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., In addition to the restored 330 kV line, work is under way to bring back other power lines. Reactor unit 6 had been providing power to the ZNPP since the plant was disconnected from the grid on 5 September. But operating a reactor at low power is not a sustainable solution for a longer period because it could over time damage key equipment of the nuclear power plant, such as electricity-producing turbines and pumps., The ZNPP also has 20 emergency diesel generators available if needed, with supplies for at least 10 days of operation. There was no need to operate the generators during this operational change. Although the Enerhodar thermal power station remains down, the now restored power line provides the ZNPP with power from the Ukrainian grid transported through the station’s switchyard., As is the case for the five other reactor units, ZNPP operating staff plan to bring unit 6 to a cold shutdown state, which can take about 30 hours. The ZNPP will still need electricity for safety-related functions. However, in this state only power from one diesel generator per reactor is needed to maintain safety., In a report on nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine that was issued on 6 September ahead of his briefing to the United Nations Security Council, Director General Grossi noted that the ZNPP on several occasions “lost, fully or partially, the off-site power supply as a result of military activities in the area”. He recommended that off-site power supply line diversity and redundancy “should be re-established and available at any time, and that all military activities that may affect the power supply systems end.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-100-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-11-sep-2022

Localizing the International Humanitarian Response in Ukraine,Analysis,RI,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",9 Sep 2022,"Summary and Recommendations, Ukraine’s government and civil society have managed an impressive humanitarian response to the displacement and destruction ongoing since Russia invaded the country in February 2022. Without much early help from international actors, most of whom were slow to mobilize or scale up their presence in the country, local and largely volunteer-driven efforts served as the backbone of the initial relief operation. But these efforts can no longer sustain themselves without external resources., Thankfully, donors have rapidly stepped up, committing more than $12 billion to help meet Ukraine’s humanitarian needs in the last six months—a record amount of time. That funding, however, is almost all going to the United Nations and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). International aid agencies then largely pass resources on to Ukrainian organizations that are overwhelmingly the ones delivering aid to beneficiaries. But this creates a circuitous and costly process that often results in delays and complications for both national NGOs and the people they aim to serve., Most importantly, this internationalization undermines Ukrainian organizations’ leadership and ownership of the response. It runs counter to commitments the aid community has made—most notably in the Grand Bargain, which commits donors and aid organizations to provide 25 percent of global humanitarian funding to local actors—to center and empower local actors in the humanitarian system. Instead, an international aid economy is fast emerging in which foreign humanitarian actors are empowered while Ukrainian organizations serve as partners or sub-grantees attached to the budgets and strategic decision-making of INGOs and UN agencies., Moreover, the flood of funding to international organizations is increasingly diverting human capital from Ukraine’s own civil society, private sector, and government—much as it has in other emergencies. At the same time, it is drawing significant human resources from INGO operations elsewhere in the world, arguably hindering those responses in countries where the needs are no less urgent. A proposed exemption from military conscription for staff of humanitarian agencies as currently drafted could further privilege international organizations over local entities., Given the strength of the public, private, and civil society sectors, the Ukraine context clearly illustrates the dangers and missed opportunities of building parallel aid structures that disempower local, democratically oriented governance structures. It is therefore no surprise that a backlash seems to be building against the internationalization of the humanitarian response. Ukrainian and even some international actors warn that undermining local capacity could prove particularly debilitating as the war grinds on and in its wake. As the focus shifts to reconstruction and re-integrating people who were displaced, and as international actors inevitably withdraw at some point, Ukraine must be able to rely on its domestic capacity. To ensure that it can, several steps should be taken as soon as possible:, Donors, INGOs, and UN agencies should move beyond aspirational objectives to concrete planning for a localization strategy. This strategy should set out specific targets and benchmarks to steadily move the ownership of funding and programs from international to local entities. The strategy should include short-term targets with a view to shift the current trajectory of funds in the next 6-12 months towards local entities and to engage more local entities as the majority stakeholders in coordination mechanisms like the Humanitarian Country Team., Donors, INGOs, and UN agencies should set targets for localization in Ukraine that exceed the aim of the Grand Bargain. As part of a new localization strategy for Ukraine, donors should seize the opportunity afforded by the relatively high degree of development and institutional capacity in the country to stake out more ambitious medium- and long-term targets., Donors should expand the use of the UN Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) to channel resources to local organizations. Despite its slow progress on localization since the February invasion, the UN’s $200 million pooled humanitarian fund for Ukraine is well-placed organizationally to rapidly execute a shift towards funding local relief groups. The UHF has operated in the country for years. In 2021, the fund succeeded in channeling 50 percent of its money to local organizations., Donors should demonstrate flexibility and adjust their risk tolerance to empower Ukrainian civil society and volunteer networks. Donors maintain rigorous requirements and systems for implementing partners, which are designed to ensure accountability and effective aid delivery. But donors will need to accept more risk to accelerate localization. For example, Ukraine offers the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) an important opportunity to carry out its recent commitment to accept a high level of risk to shift ownership, authority, and responsibility to local groups across the globe. For the EU, this would mean allowing its main aid agency, the Directorate General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), to relax its restriction on funding non-EU-based organizations to allow Ukrainian NGOs to directly apply for funding. This would require a legislative change but, as Ukraine is now an EU candidate country it would seem, politically at least, a quite reasonable step., Donors should invest in capacity building for local actors receptive to technical assistance. A top priority would be to build the skills and capacities required for donors to make Ukrainian NGOs direct grantees rather than sub-grantees. International NGOs and foreign experts with a long history of navigating complex aid regimes could play an important role in this effort. This is particularly true for those INGOs that have already having built and managed donor-funded projects in Ukraine., Donors should support local consortia led by well-established, national NGOs. These consortia could serve as vehicles for distributing funds to smaller Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer networks. Here as well, INGOs could provide technical support to ensure that the local consortia have the capacity to meet donor requirements. By going directly to Ukrainian organizations, donors can save money and then use those savings to spread existing humanitarian funding over a longer timeframe., As has long been called for by supporters of the Grand Bargain, donors should ensure fairness in covering the overhead costs and security expenses of local partners. This would mean mandating that international actors who partner with local entities apply an adequate, if not equal, overhead percentage and security budget for the local entity as they do for themselves. This would ensure that Ukrainian organizations can better cover their own core operational costs while protecting their staff and operations as well as international actors do., Donors should invest in anticorruption systems embedded inside Ukrainian organizations. Rather than build parallel systems to exert more international control over aid and avoid the potential costs of corruption, donors should invest in embedding more anti-corruption systems within Ukrainian governmental bodies and NGOs. This could also entail a wider engagement with local anti-corruption organizations – some of which already have a deep experience in the fight against corruption. These efforts should enable the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian NGOs to strengthen their management of the country’s social protection mechanisms., Donors and aid agencies should strengthen support for Ukrainian organizations willing to separate humanitarian operations from the military effort. Donors should fund specific interventions to help Ukrainian organizations who wish to act as principled humanitarian actors separate their humanitarian assistance from support for the military effort. In all cases though, more direct donor funding to Ukrainian entities will inevitably lessen the corrosive impact of aid mixing with which many INGOs and UN agencies are currently grappling.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/localizing-international-humanitarian-response-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Sep 2022,"(Excerpts), Ukraine, Turning to Ukraine, the Humanitarian Coordinator, Denise Brown, and the Emergency Coordinator for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Ukraine, Matthew Hollingworth, today condemned an attack that took place yesterday and killed and injured civilians who were queuing up to receive aid in the small village of Mala Tokmachka, in the Zaporizka oblast. Our humanitarian colleagues tell us that the centre that was hit had been used by local authorities to distribute assistance for civilians since the war started. When it was hit yesterday, food, hygiene kits and other supplies were being distributed. We send our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery. It goes without saying that civilian infrastructure, including facilities where assistance is being provided, should never be targeted., On the response front, earlier this week, on Monday we, along with our humanitarian colleagues, delivered a new convoy with 65 metric tonnes of relief items for people living in settlements close to the front lines in Donetska oblast. The six-truck convoy brought food, water, medical and hygiene kits, and tarpaulins that will cover the immediate needs for over 5,000 people in about four towns. Across Ukraine, nearly 13 million people have received critical humanitarian assistance since this phase of the war began earlier this year. But, only about 1 million people have received assistance in non-Government-controlled areas, and that continues to be a great challenge for us. We continue our negotiations to make sure to seek free and unimpeded access so we can support people on both sides of the front line., Ethiopia, Turning to Ethiopia, with a link to the conflict in Ukraine, the World Food Programme’s first humanitarian shipment of grain from Ukraine that was delivered under the Black Sea Grain Initiative has started to arrive in Ethiopia. As you will recall, the MV Brave Commander arrived in Djibouti on 30 August, and this is one of the vessels that the Secretary-General was able to see in the Bosphorus. WFP says the grain will support one month of assistance for over 1.5 million people who have been displaced by drought and conflict. The grain is currently being unloaded in WFP’s main warehouse in the city of Adama and will be distributed in the coming weeks. Conflict, drought and rising costs are driving food insecurity across Ethiopia. With 20 million people in need of food aid in Ethiopia, the World Food Programme says supply chain stability is critical to its work., Also on Ethiopia, we’re being told by our humanitarian colleagues that fighting in the north of the country continues to impact vulnerable people and the delivery of aid. In parts of Tigray, Amhara and Afar regions, tens of thousands of people are reportedly being displaced by fighting and insecurity. There have been no humanitarian convoy movements into Tigray since 23 August. This is preventing the delivery of supplies, including additional fertilizer for the upcoming planting season. The twice-weekly UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) flights between Addis Ababa and Mekelle have also been halted since 25 August. Within Tigray, we continue to distribute available fertilizers and other aid, as much as we can., On a positive note, our partners were able to reach a site hosting internally displaced people in the Benishangul Gumuz region of western Ethiopia for the first time in more than one year. They provided water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter, emergency health supplies, dignity kits and other items. In eastern and southern Ethiopia, the drought continues, with more than 16 million people targeted for humanitarian assistance. In Ethiopia, more than 8 million people impacted by drought have received food aid this year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/daily-press-briefing-office-spokesperson-secretary-general-08-september-2022-ukraine-ethiopia
"Press briefing on the situation in Ukraine - Matilda Bogner, 09 September 2022",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,9 Sep 2022,"DELIVERED BY
Head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine: Matilda Bogner, FROM
Ukraine (via zoom), Good morning,, Today I am joining you from Odesa – a city in the south of Ukraine where the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission has been present since 2014. Every day, we speak to people across the country and hear from victims who have suffered human rights violations in the context of the armed conflict, which escalated following the armed attack of the Russian Federation., We will be publishing our next report later this month but let me give you an update on some of our recent findings., To date we have corroborated 14,059 civilian casualties: 5,767 civilians were killed and 8,292 injured by hostilities. As we have repeatedly said, we know that actual numbers are likely considerably higher., Since 24 February, our Mission has verified that at least 416 people have been victims of arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances in territory occupied by the Russian Federation or in areas controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups at the time. Of those, 16 were found dead and 166 released. We also documented 51 arbitrary arrests and 30 more cases that may amount to enforced disappearance perpetrated by Ukrainian law enforcement bodies., We have documented a range of violations against prisoners of war. We have been granted unimpeded access to places of internment and detention in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine. However, the Russian Federation has not provided access to prisoners of war held on its territory or in territory under its occupation, including areas controlled by its armed forces and affiliated armed groups., This is all the more worrying since we have documented that prisoners of war in the power of the Russian Federation and held by the Russian Federation’s armed forces or by affiliated armed groups have suffered torture and ill-treatment, and in some places of detention lack adequate food, water, healthcare and sanitation. We received information about a dire health situation in the penal colony in Olenivka, where many Ukrainian prisoners of war reportedly have been suffering from infectious diseases, including hepatitis A and tuberculosis. We have also documented many cases where Ukrainian prisoners of war have not been allowed to contact their relatives to tell them of their capture, their location and their health condition. This leaves families of captured soldiers desperate for information, deprived of their right to know what has happened to their loved ones., We have also been following the cases of several pregnant prisoners of war interned in places controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. We urge the Russian Federation, as the detaining power, to consider the immediate release of these women on humanitarian grounds., In Government-controlled territory, we have also documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war, usually upon capture, during initial interrogations or transportation to camps for internment. Our Mission has been able to visit a Ukrainian prisoner of war camp. We note, however, that most prisoners of war continue to be held in penitentiary facilities, violating the rule that prisoners of war shall not be interned in close confinement., While Crimea, occupied by the Russian Federation since 2014, has received less attention in recent months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the situation there. This includes restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms, torture and ill-treatment, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests, and violations of the right to a fair trial, as well as lack of accountability for such human rights violations. We are concerned that patterns of human rights violations documented in Crimea since 2014 may be repeated in territory newly occupied by the Russian Federation across Ukraine., In Crimea, the Russian Federation continues to clamp down on freedom of expression by applying vague and ill-defined legislation, penalizing real or perceived criticism of the Russian Federation and its armed forces. Since March, we have documented the prosecution of 89 individuals in Crimea for – and I quote - “public actions directed at discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation”., Teachers in Crimea who refused to endorse the so-called – and I quote – “special military operation” face retaliation and sanctions. Human rights defenders have been arrested and prosecuted for their work, and defence lawyers intimidated. We have documented arbitrary arrests and torture of individuals apprehended in the Russian-occupied Kherson region and transferred to Crimea. In addition, men who cross the administrative boundary line from mainland Ukraine to Crimea have been subjected to so-called ‘filtration’ by the Russian Federal Security Service at checkpoints. According to credible reports received by our Mission, this exposes them to the risk of enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest, torture and ill-treatment., Crimean Tatars continue to face intimidation and harassment, police raids and house searches, and prosecution under terrorism and extremism-related offences in proceedings, which often fall short of human rights standards. Furthermore, Crimean Tatar detainees continue to be deported to remote areas of the Russian Federation to serve their sentences., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine will continue to document and report the facts on the ground and the voices of victims. We consider this to be an essential part of seeking to prevent further violations and to hold those accountable for the violations already committed. More of our findings on the impact of the armed attack by the Russian Federation on human rights in Ukraine will be presented in our next report, which will be issued on 27 September., Thank you., For more information and media requests, please contact:, In Geneva, Liz Throssell - + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or

Director General’s Statement on Serious Situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Sep 2022,"Today, I have learned from IAEA staff on the site of the serious situation that developed last night at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP)., The power infrastructure feeding the city of Enerhodar, home to the NPP’s operators and their families, has been destroyed by shelling of the switchyard at the city’s thermal power plant, leading to a complete power black-out in Enerhodar: no running water, no power, no sewage., Given the increased and continued shelling, there is little likelihood of re-establishing reliable offsite power to the ZNPP, especially as the shelling continually and repeatedly damages the power infrastructure., As a result, the IAEA understands that the operator, having no longer confidence in the restoration of offsite power, is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. The entire power plant would then be fully reliant on emergency diesel generators for ensuring vital nuclear safety and security functions. And as a consequence, the operator would not be able to re-start the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established., Furthermore, there are indications that, with the increasingly dire circumstances that the people of Energodar are facing, there is the significant risk of an impact on the availability of essential staff on site to continue to safely and securely operate ZNPP., This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar has gone dark. The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again., This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand., I therefore urgently call for the immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area. Only this will ensure the safety and security of operating staff and allow the durable restoration of power to Enerhodar and to the power plant., This dramatic development demonstrates the absolute imperative to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone now., This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/director-generals-statement-serious-situation-ukraines-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant

Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 Sep 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, ANALYSIS, General security and humanitarian situation, Active hostilities continued to be concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of the country during the reporting period, with more attempts by civilians to flee the hard-hit areas being reported. Separate attacks have also affected humanitarian assets in Donetska oblast and civilians receiving aid in Zaporizka oblast in the past week. The security situation in the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) area remained tense, and the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is located, was cut off from the power supply due to shelling. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission arrived in Enerhodar on 1 September to inspect the NPP., The heaviest fighting was reported in Donetska oblast in eastern Ukraine. At least 50 civilian casualties were reported there during the 2-4 September weekend alone, reportedly including in the front-line cities of Bakhmut, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in Government-controlled areas (GCA) of the oblast and in Donetsk, Horlivka and Makiivka in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA). Scores of houses and other civilian infrastructure were also reportedly damaged. And the INGO World Central Kitchen (WCK) reported that shrapnel and fire from explosions near its warehouse in Kramatorsk destroyed some food supplies and damaged three trucks. An earlier missile strike on 15 June that hit a train in Donetska oblast reportedly destroyed a wagon of food from WCK. Meanwhile, there were more reports of shelling and civilian casualties throughout the week in both Donetska and Kharkivska oblasts., In other parts of Ukraine, the southern Mykolaivska oblast continued to report missile strikes and shelling on a daily basis – including on 3 September, when a missile reportedly struck a house in the village of Vysunsk, killing one child and injuring three more children and one adult. On 4 September a grain elevator in the city of Ochakiv was destroyed, and the administrative centre of Mykolaiv came under massive shelling that damaged buildings including three health-care and three educational facilities. Ongoing damage to civilian infrastructure only increases the challenges Mykolaivska oblast faces preparing for winter – with over 700 damaged buildings needing their windows replaced in Mykolaiv alone., In the central Dnipropetrovska oblast, 10 civilians were reportedly injured and a dozen buildings damaged in shelling in the city of Zelenodolsk on 3 September, an older woman was reportedly killed and three other residents injured by rocket strikes in Apostolove on 5 September, and the city of Nikopol – located across the Dnipro River from Enerhodar and the Zaporizhzhia NPP in NGCA of the south-eastern Zaporizka oblast – reportedly continued to be impacted by repeated strikes. Then, on 6 September, the Zaporizka oblast authorities reported that three civilians were killed and five more were seriously injured when the village of Mala Tokmachka was shelled while they were queueing to receive humanitarian aid. The humanitarian aid that was distributed by local authorities at the site was provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), the INGO People in Need and other humanitarian actors. In response to the attack, Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown and WFP Emergency Coordinator Matthew Hollingworth stressed that “people must be able to safely access the essential supplies they desperately need after enduring 196 days of a ferocious war.”, Developments concerning Zaporizhzhia NPP featured the arrival on 1 September of Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and his team from IAEA, which announced they had begun their safety inspection of the plant and planned to maintain an indefinite presence there. But then developments also featured reports in the following days of continued fighting and shelling on and around the territory of the plant – resulting in damage to the remaining power lines connecting the plant to the Ukrainian electricity network and, so, continuing to affect ZNPP’s ability to operate and to raise safety concerns. Ukrainian operator Energoatom reported that the intense shelling had sparked a fire on 5 September that forced the temporary disconnection of a backup power line and, so, the disconnection from the electricity network of reactor No. 6, then the plant’s only operational reactor. IAEA reported that it was told by Ukrainian staff that the backup power line would be reconnected after the fire was extinguished and that they also planned to repair a damaged main power line. But the situation at ZNPP remained concerning, with calls by IAEA and the UN for the area to be demilitarized reportedly going unheeded. Furthermore, intense shelling on 6 and 7 September reportedly left Enerhodar without electricity and water supply, at least temporarily. Separately, on 6 September, IAEA published its 2nd Summary Report: Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine, covering the period from 28 April to 5 September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-7-sep-2022-enukru
"DiCarlo: ""We need peace in Ukraine, peace founded on respect for the UN Charter and international law.""",News and Press Release,UN DPPA,Protection and Human Rights,7 Sep 2022,"Mr. President,, As we are painfully aware, the war in Ukraine continues to rage. Since I briefed this Council on 24 August, because of the fighting, at least 104 civilians, including 10 children have died and at least 253 civilians, including 25 children have been injured according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)., This brings the total number to 13,917 civilian casualties: 5,718 killed, including 372 children, and 8,199 injured, including 635 children. These are only verified figures and the actual numbers are likely significantly higher., The war also continued to drive large-scale displacement., Over 6.9 million people are internally displaced, a jump of 330,000 since my last briefing. Most of the newly displaced are coming from eastern and southern Ukraine., The current number of Ukrainian refugees recorded across Europe has surpassed 7 million, up from 6.7 million just two weeks ago., Ukrainian women, who constitute half of these refugees, continue to face significantly increased security risks, including sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, exploitation, and abuse., Thousands of people in the conflict-affected areas of the Donetsk region, and most acutely in the city of Mariupol, lack access to reliable running water, increasing the risk of communicable disease., All these numbers and facts, though shocking, cannot convey the full scale of the tragedy., But in the face of the international community’s incapacity to stop this senseless war, we must continue to record its horrific consequences as faithfully and accurately as possible., It is our responsibility, and indeed the very least we can do - to help prevent the war from escalating further and to deter other potential violent conflicts., Mr. President,, The UN continues to mobilize to address the massive impact of the war on civilians., UNDP has launched an assessment of the consequences of the war on living conditions, health, access to education, livelihoods, food security, social status, as well as on overall levels of poverty and human development. Results are expected to be available in December 2022., As humanitarian needs rapidly rise, the UN’s response has scaled-up and now reaches 12.7 million people with various forms of assistance., Over 560 humanitarian organizations – more than 60 percent of them national NGOs – are now operating countrywide. This fully complements the incredible work that thousands of Ukrainian volunteers are carrying out in their country., The UN is actively seeking to ensure that protection and assistance are available in all areas of Ukraine. We remain extremely concerned about the lack of access to Ukrainians living in areas that are currently not under the control of the Government of Ukraine., Our humanitarian response includes only one million people in these areas, despite the confirmed enormous humanitarian needs., The Secretary-General has spoken at length about the impact of the war around the world, especially on shortages of food and fertilizer., As we have stressed before, the effects on countries already severely hit by climate change, drought or instability have been extremely worrying., Somalia, for example, a country that before February sourced at least 90 per cent of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, is on the brink of famine., The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warns that there are “concrete indications” that famine will occur later this year in the southern Bay region of the country., Thousands are dying in a historic drought made worse by the effects of the war in Ukraine., We are grateful that the Black Sea Initiative continues to enable food exports from Ukraine. Since 1 August, 100 ships have left Ukrainian ports carrying over 2,300,000 metric tons of grain across three continents, including 30 percent to low and lower-middle income countries., The World Food Programme has thus far chartered three vessels to transport wheat from Ukraine in support of its humanitarian operations., Thanks in part to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, world food commodity prices are coming down, the FAO reports, though they remain elevated., But to ensure that food reaches all in need, Russian fertilizers and food products must reach foreign markets. The UN continues its efforts to facilitate access to these products, which are not under international sanctions, to world markets., Mr. President,, The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains a concern. The Council heard briefings yesterday from the Secretary-General and the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the dangers of continued military activity at the plant., As the Secretary-General said yesterday, we welcome the IAEA mission as a first step to de-escalate the situation at Zaporizhzhia., The IAEA mission report contains recommendations to further de-escalate the situation at the plant, including a proposal to create a Nuclear Safety and Security Protection Zone (NSSPZ) in Zaporizhzhia to ensure the safety of the operating staff and maintain the physical integrity of the plant., As an immediate step, I reiterate the Secretary-General’s urgent call for a complete cessation of military activity in and around the plant. Demilitarization is the only answer to ensure the safety of this facility., Mr. President,, The Fact-Finding mission to Olenivka is set to deploy in the coming days to look into the incident on 29 July that led to the death of 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war. Between 75 and 130 more were injured., The head of the mission, Lieutenant General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, is accompanied by an experienced team of senior officials and experts., The mission must be able to conduct its work without any interference and have safe, secure and unfettered access to people, places and evidence., I want to thank Ukraine and Russia for their constructive approach in enabling preparations for the mission. We count on their continued support., At my last briefing, I stressed that we were concerned by treatment of prisoners of war by both sides., I want to reiterate that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine must have unimpeded access to all individuals detained in relation to the ongoing war., This includes access to places of internment of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilian detainees in the Russian Federation., Both sides to the conflict must fully abide by their obligations under international law., I welcome the parties’ continued engagement to agree on prisoner exchanges. Just last Friday, 14 prisoners were exchanged in the Donetsk region., Mr. President,, The persistent allegations of forced displacement, deportation and so-called “filtration camps” run by the Russian Federation and affiliated local forces are extremely disturbing., Such reports must be investigated with the cooperation of the competent authorities. Assistant Secretary-General Brands Kehris will provide more information on this issue., Mr. President,, We have repeatedly discussed in this Chamber how the war in Ukraine is devastating that country but also endangering regional and global stability., As you heard from the Secretary-General yesterday, just last week the 10th Review Conference of the parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons could not produce a substantive outcome after consensus was blocked because of issues related to the war., The NPT failure is only the latest example of how the conflict has affected international relations and cooperation. The longer it continues, the greater the risks it poses to international peace and security., We need peace in Ukraine, peace founded on respect for the UN Charter and international law., All wars are tragic, but none more than wars of choice., Thank you, Mr. President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dicarlo-we-need-peace-ukraine-peace-founded-respect-un-charter-and-international-law
"While Millions of Ukrainian Civilians Suffer, Russian Federation’s Delegate Tells Security Council ‘Destructive Process in Ukraine Far from Over’",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,8 Sep 2022,"9127TH MEETING (PM), SC/15024, Several Member States Question Merits for Convening Meeting on Weapons Transfers, A large-scale influx of weapons to conflict-affected zones raises many concerns, High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu told the Security Council today, as delegates convened for the third time in three days to discuss the situation in Ukraine, with many questioning the reasoning for the debate and what it could achieve for the millions of civilians suffering under near constant shelling., “These concerns should be taken with due regard,” she said as a matter of general statement on the topic of weapons transfers, encouraging States to make use of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms to enhance transparency., She said it is a matter of public record that, since the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February, Ukraine has received for its defence force transfers of weapons systems and ammunition from several States. Information about the transfers of such materiel has been widely publicized by the Governments involved., There have also been widespread and independently verified reports of the transfer of major conventional weapon systems to local armed groups in Ukraine, she explained., Under international humanitarian law, she said combatants must not direct attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and take all feasible precautions in the conduct of military operations to avoid, or at least minimize, incidental loss of civilian life. “The time to end this suffering is now,” she said., Dragana Trifković, Director of the Center for Geostrategic Studies, then compared the war in Ukraine to the one waged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, noting that, in both cases, there are examples of both direct interference in the conflict — where Western countries send weapons to the Ukrainian side — and the use of third countries to supply weapons., In the ensuing dialogue, Council members offered differing views on the merits of convening the meeting, with Ghana’s representative expressing concern that recent meetings have not supported diplomatic actions required to help end hostilities. Albania’s delegate took it a step further to suggest the meeting should have been held under a theme of support for a country whose neighbour aims to “wipe it from the map”. The representative of the United Arab Emirates, however, said that, “while the past cannot be changed, the Council can still have an impact on the present and future trajectory of this conflict”, which is why this topic deserves members’ attention, with the technical expertise required to fully discuss it., The Russian Federation’s delegate — whose country called the meeting — said the most modest assessments show that the United States and its allies spent $20 billion to support Ukraine in 2022. European countries are violating their “Common Position” rules, which ban the licensing of arms exports if they create a violation of international humanitarian law., Meanwhile, Ukrainians are being told that they will “become victorious” over the Russian Federation. “We are far from the end of this destructive process”, he clarified, stressing that Western weaponry is not playing a decisive role on the battlefield., In turn, the United States’ representative accused the Russian Federation of having the “gall” to accuse others of refusing to stand aside while it seeks to destroy another Member State, in violation of international law. His country is proud to provide vital security assistance to Ukraine in defence of its sovereignty. “We are not hiding this support,” he said, stressing that Ukrainians have every right to defend themselves. “We will not stop our support to Ukraine just because Russia is frustrated that its attempt at regime change has not gone to plan.”, The representative of France, Council President for September, spoke in his national capacity to stress that his country made a determined choice to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty. It was his country’s duty, and the purview of the Council, to defend values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. France is also working with the European Union where a collective decision was made to fund weapons, so Ukraine can withstand the aggression., To Kenya’s representative, the question of how to collectively build a peaceful world order underpins today’s discussions. The Council — and the international community — must fully face up to the strategic thinking that led to this war, and act to minimize the risk of escalation, while establishing channels of dialogue that will lead to a stable global order. Laying out the acute effects of the war in Africa, he described dashed aspirations for development, united action against climate change and security., Rounding out the meeting, Ukraine’s delegate said that, by the Russian Federation launching its aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and invading it in 2022, Moscow has violated nearly all international documents, including the Helsinki Final Act. From the permanent seat of the Soviet Union, it has paralysed the Council from ensuring peace and security in Ukraine. “We are defending ourselves, Europe, the world and the UN Charter,” he said. “The evil of Putin — as that of Hitler before him — requires a global response,” he insisted. Ukraine and its allies are doing their best to ensure it., Also speaking today were representatives of Gabon, United Kingdom, Mexico, India, Brazil, Ireland, Norway and China., The Council also observed a moment of silence in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who died today., The meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 5:05 p.m., Briefings, IZUMI NAKAMITSU, Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, said she had been requested to brief on the issue of “the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine”, noting it is a matter of public record that, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started on 24 February, Ukraine has received for their defence force transfers of weapons systems and ammunition from a number of States. Information about transfers of such materiel has been widely publicized by the Governments involved. These transfers have included heavy conventional weapons — including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large‑calibre artillery systems and uncrewed combat aerial vehicles — as well as small arms and light weapons., She said there have also been widespread and independently verified reports of the transfer of major conventional weapon systems to local armed groups in Ukraine, including artillery rocket systems. As a matter of general statement, the large-scale influx of weapons to conflict-affected zones raises many concerns, including the potential for diversion. “These concerns should be taken with due regard,” she said. The international community has instruments, such as the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, to enhance transparency in arms transfer and she encouraged States to make use of those mechanisms., Beyond the matter of weapons supply, she called for a focus on how these weapons are used, given the devastating impact on civilians and civilian infrastructure caused using heavy weapons in Ukraine. Noting that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 13,917 verified civilian casualties since 24 February, she said the actual numbers are believed to be significantly higher. Most civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including attacks by heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and aircraft., She noted that the war also continues to drive large-scale displacement, with more than 6.9 million people internally displaced and 7 million refugees recorded across Europe. The Secretary-General has consistently highlighted the severe humanitarian impact of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and she reiterated his call on parties to avoid their use in populated areas. Under international humanitarian law, combatants must not direct attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and take all feasible precautions in the conduct of military operations to avoid, or at least minimize, incidental loss of civilian life. “The time to end this suffering is now,” she said., DRAGANA TRIFKOVIĆ, Director of the Center for Geostrategic Studies, said that, when talking about the war in Ukraine, it is important to consider the arguments of both warring parties. Comparing the war in Ukraine to the one waged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, she gave several examples of external influence in preparing for war, along with direct and indirect participation in the war. Today, in Ukraine, there are also examples of both direct interference in the conflict — where Western countries send weapons to the Ukrainian side — and the use of third countries to supply weapons to Ukraine., Emphasizing that these weapons “are killing the civilian population without choosing whether they speak Ukrainian or Russian”, she detailed examples of the Ukrainian army using prohibited cluster weapons to target the civilian population in eastern Ukraine and using High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems provided by the United States to attack civilian objects and infrastructure in the Donetsk region, including on the detention centre in Olenivka. She said that, based on the above, “it can be concluded that the Ukrainian side perceives civilians — as well as prisoners of war — as legitimate targets and that its acts in order to achieve as many victims as possible among them”., She went on to say that, in many cases, the weapons that Western countries deliver to Ukraine end up in third countries, often in the hands of terrorists. Noting “well-founded suspicions” that some of the weapons from Ukraine have already been transferred to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, she said that this represents a potential danger for the outbreak of renewed conflicts. The situation threatens to turn into a direct conflict on a large scale, and the Council has a responsibility to facilitate the establishment of peace and security. This starts with the cessation of the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine and the closure of the black arms market, she added., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said Western colleagues have launched the largest‑scale proxy war against the Russian Federation using Ukrainians. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is manually directing Kyiv in the “theatre of war”; Ukraine is awash with Western military instructors, special services and mercenaries. As well, in a number of NATO countries, Ukrainian military units are being trained. According to the most modest assessments, the United States and its allies spent about $20 billion to support Ukraine in this year alone. American media reports that United States President Joseph R. Biden’s Administration intends to request another $20 billion in emergency funding only for the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, Ukrainians are being told consistently that, in using modern Western weapons — so called ""Wunderwaffe"" — they will be able to change the course of the military campaign and “become victorious” over the Russian Federation. Underscoring that “we are far from the end of this destructive process”, he said that Western weaponry is not playing a decisive role on the battlefield, regardless of what the Ukrainian vassals are saying. The Russian army, with minimal risk to its soldiers and civilians, is destroying not only the old weaponry of Soviet models, but also modern NATO weapons., However, using the long-range NATO artillery and rocket launchers, the Kyiv regime is now striking civilian and other infrastructure, resulting in the carnage in Yelenovka, the continuous shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and civilian areas in Donbas, he continued. Moreover, by ""pumping"" Ukraine with weaponry, which are used against civilian objects, European Union countries are violating their ""Common Position"" rules, which ban the licensing arms exports if it creates a violation of international humanitarian law. The main beneficiaries are those who are loudest in beating the ""drums of war"" — the United States and Great Britain, he said, noting that their military contractors are making huge profits. Addressing colleagues from developing countries, he said his delegation convened today's meeting so that they can understand the cynicism and mendacity of the countries in the collective West's appeals to stop our “so called ‘war of choice’”. “By creating a neo-Nazi hornet's nest on our borders and supporting the Kyiv regime's war against their own people in 2014, they left us no choice,” he said., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon), recalling the recent spate of Council meetings on Ukraine, stressed that the same must focus on looking for solutions to end the war, which has resulted in too many deaths, too much destruction of civilian infrastructure and too many economic consequences worldwide. Expressing concern that signs seem to be pointing towards a war of attrition, she emphasized that “humanity does not need that”. It is time to silence the guns in Ukraine; more weapons results in more death, destruction and misery. The correlation between the proliferation of weapons and insecurity is “evident and manifest”, she said, urging the parties to cease all forms of escalation, whether military or verbal. Stressing that the Security Council should be able to justify its name in each of these meetings, she urged the organ to work towards a solution to this conflict., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said Ukraine has every right to defend itself, legally and morally. It is fighting not just for its existence, but in defence of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations itself. “And Ukraine is succeeding,” she stated, noting the meeting lays bare the Russian Federation’s hypocrisy. She reported that President Vladimir Putin’s troops are tiring, his losses are colossal, supply lines are vulnerable and his territorial gains are ephemeral. She warned that Moscow is now turning to Iran to supply unmanned aerial vehicle, and — in a clear violation of United Nations sanctions — turning to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to supply ammunition. Calling for the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine so that its territorial integrity and sovereignty can be restored, she stressed that any negotiation must be premised on those fundamental principles. The United Kingdom will continue to support Ukraine, and to stand for freedom, democracy and the sovereignty of nations around the world, she said., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States) clarified that today’s meeting is an attempt to distract from the 7 September meeting on the forced displacement of Ukrainians amid reports of torture associated with the Russian Federation’s “abhorrent” use of filtration camps. The United States had warned about the Russian Federation’s premediated strategy to invade Ukraine, he said, recalling Moscow’s “fervent” insistence that its massive mobilization was only a routine military exercise. Now, it has the gall to accuse others of refusing to stand aside while it seeks to destroy another Member State, in violation of international law. The United States is proud to stand with Kyiv and its partners from more than 50 countries to provide vital security assistance to Ukraine in defence of its sovereignty. “We are not hiding this support,” he said, stressing that Ukrainians have every right to defend themselves. “We will not stop our support to Ukraine just because Russia is frustrated that its attempt at regime change has not gone to plan.” It bears repeating all countries have the inherent right to self-defence, he said, consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations., He encouraged Council members to consider what they would do if they were in Ukraine’s shoes, asking: “How would you respond if a bigger neighbour invaded you? What would you ask of the international community?” None would allow their cities to be shelled to rubble. The Russian Federation’s claims that the West is escalating the conflict are a cynical attempt to deflect attention from its role as the sole aggressor of a war for which the world is paying the price, he said. The United States is not using force against Russian Federation, nor seeking a war with it. However, the United States will not fail to condemn President Putin’s choice to pursue this invasion. Even now, Moscow is purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for use in Ukraine, which would violate Security Council resolutions. Before this invasion, the United States engaged in intense diplomacy seeking every avenue to address mutual concerns to address security in Europe. The Russian Federation did not take this path. The United States has provided security assistance not only to allow Ukraine to defend itself, but to help it deal with consequences with this awful war. It provided $1.9 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and the region since the Russian Federation invaded eight years ago. It also channelled $8.5 billion in budget support to Ukraine through World Bank mechanisms., KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) expressed concern that Council meetings have not constructively supported diplomatic actions required in the immediate term at ending the hostilities and assisting the parties in finding a mutually acceptable and lasting solution. She called on the international community to devote all efforts towards finding a pacific solution to the conflict — but in a manner which also ensures that that there are no benefits accorded to parties whose ab initio actions are unacceptable under international law. Warning of the real risk of the conflict engulfing the whole European continent, she further expressed concern over the resumption of shelling near the Zaporizhzhia power plant despite the looming risk it presents to Ukraine and the world at large. She voiced support for the sustained commitment of all parties and relevant actors to the Black Sea Grain Initiative to help bring critical food aid to people in other parts of the world where famine conditions exist. Similarly, rising fuel prices are rapidly translating to unprecedented cost of living standards, especially in developing countries. “We need peace in Ukraine, peace that is founded on nothing less than the norms and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations,” she stated., JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico), expressing surprise at the haste with which the meeting was convened, said that topics of this importance, especially when predictable, should be scheduled sufficiently in advance and without having to improvise. Moreover, the Council's consideration of the topic should lead to concrete steps to fulfil its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security, he said, voicing regret that the Council has limited itself to deliberating and continuing to deliberate. His concern about arms transfers includes arms transfers that had been happening since the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2013, he noted. As long as the Council does not assume its responsibility in this situation, he said he recognized the right to legitimate defence and the right to acquire arms for its defence. However, this should always go hand in hand with protections and safeguards necessary to minimize risks, avoid diversion or use of those weapons to commit severe and systematic violations of human rights or international humanitarian law, he said., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that the title for today’s meeting should have been “Worldwide Solidarity and Support for a Country that Has Been Brutally Attacked by its Neighbour Whose Intentions Are to Wipe It from the Map”. This is all the Council should discuss — not weapons, including those Iran and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are reportedly providing to the Russian Federation. Welcoming the international community’s solidarity and support for Ukraine, he said that this comes in different forms, including — “and so rightfully so” — direct defensive military aid to a Government and people who are under a premeditated, unjustified attack by a neighbour “who wishes you well by throwing bombs and destroying your homes”. Underscoring that there are no warring parties in Ukraine — “there is an aggressor and a country rightfully defending itself” — he said that Article 51 of the Charter provides an unquestionable legal basis for States to provide assistance to a country exercising its inherent right to self-defence. “Russia did not go to Ukraine with flowers, but with guns,” he stressed, adding that there should be no surprise “that it was not welcomed with flowers, but with guns and, as we see, outgunned”., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) noted that, since the commencement of the conflict in Ukraine, her country has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence, with dialogue and diplomacy the only way forward. It is therefore regrettable that the situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement — despite today’s Council meeting being the third in as many days in this week alone. Urging the international community to continue to respond to the call for humanitarian assistance, she noted India recently dispatched its twelfth consignment of aid to Ukraine, in keeping its national values which perceive the world as one family. Citing the collective interest in working constructively — both inside the United Nations and outside — towards seeking an early resolution to the conflict, she reiterated that the global order is anchored on international law, the Charter of the United Nations and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of States., MICHAEL KIBOINO (Kenya) said the question of how to collectively build a peaceful world order underpins today’s discussions. The Council — and the international community — must fully face up to the strategic thinking that led to this war, and act to minimize the risk of escalation, while establishing channels of dialogue that will lead to a stable global order. In Africa, aspirations for development, united action against climate change and security are degenerating, due to the war’s direct and indirect impacts. The use of militarized alliances, sanctions, blockades, cyberattacks and proxy in third countries, along with the undermining of multilateral institutions, are all blunting the ability to collectively solve today’s most serious challenges. They are distorting the global economy by shifting the patterns of trade and investment. “This is undermining the engine of globalization that most countries sought to recruit in their search for growth and development,” he warned. It is in the global interest to end this war and usher in a new age of global peace and cooperation. He urged warring parties and their allies to start discussions on guidelines to help modify their strategic posture, identifying areas where cooperation is necessary and achievable. They should honestly face each other’s most serious security concerns and undertake regular dialogue to clarify positions, minimize misunderstanding and reverse the risks of escalation. The United Nations Charter offers the fundamental template. He called for a cessation of hostilities and a political settlement that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said he could not but be disheartened at yet another Council meeting — the third this week — on the topic of Ukraine. The conflict has dragged on for over six months, and despite the constant discussions, “we have not been successful in fostering a suspension of hostilities”. Stressing that military action inflicts damage, undermines faith in international law and jeopardizes millions of people’s lives, he voiced concern over the humanitarian impact of the conflict. There is no alternative to the negotiation of a ceasefire as a first step on the way to solving the crisis. As a party to the Arms Trade Treaty, Brazil abides by its principles and believes they offer a valuable guideline for the transfer of arms. The Treaty highlights the importance of respecting and ensuring respect for international humanitarian law and for human rights law, regardless of military objectives or security concerns. The Treaty also urges States to “effectively regulate” their arms trade, so as to prevent diversion, through systems of effective national control. These principles should serve the objectives of promoting responsible action in arms trade, building confidence, reducing human suffering and contributing to international and regional peace, security and stability., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said what is happening in Ukraine is a result of the war. “While the past cannot be changed, the Council can still have an impact on the present and future trajectory of this conflict,” and make today’s meeting worthy and relevant, she said. After six months, the war risks settling into a protracted conflict. However, “we should not resign ourselves to this reality”, she said. She called for dialogue, sooner or later, and a political solution based on respect for sovereignty, international law and the Charter. It is crucial that the recipients of weapons be accounted for, so these arms do not inadvertently end up in terrorist hands. She noted with concern warnings by the Secretary-General of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) about the dangers of the availability of weapons and possibility of criminal groups exploiting their proliferation. She echoed the call for suppliers to track and trace weapons entering Ukraine. “Geopolitical tensions risk undermining the very mechanisms we have in place to manage conflict, promote stability and ensure prosperity,” she warned, pointing to the lack of an agreed outcome at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Recent terrorist attacks by Al Shabaab or the heavy weapons displays by the Houthis recall the risks associated with the limited enforcement of existing arms control mechanisms. Without action, proliferation will continue to grow exponentially., CÁIT MORAN (Ireland) said the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize as independent entities the non-Government‑controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine has not changed those borders “one iota”. They did not change in 2014, and they have not changed since. Ukraine did not commit or threaten to commit an armed attack against the Russian Federation. It was the Russian Federation that attacked Ukraine, and sought to justify its invasion by invoking Article 51 of the Charter, and which would now seek to deny a fellow United Nations Member State that same right of self-defence. There is no credible evidence of diversion and no indication that exports are taking place, other than in accordance with national laws and international procedure. This includes military support provided by the European Union to help Ukraine exercise its inherent right of self-defence and defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty. The Russian Federation should stop trying to use the Council as a platform for its disinformation campaign and stop painting itself as the victim of its aggression in the face of the heinous accusations it has committed in Ukraine, she said, calling on that country to desist., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) reiterated that the Russian Federation’s war on Ukraine is a serious violation of international law. It must abide by the order of the International Court of Justice and immediately suspend its military operations in that territory. She restated unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, unequivocally condemning all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law — including the reported killing of Ukrainian civilians and strikes on civilian infrastructure. She also affirmed that Ukraine has a right to defend itself against the armed attack as enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter, and that other States are entitled to respond positively to Ukraine’s call for assistance in the exercise of its legitimate self-defence. What is blatantly illegal, she stressed, is the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine. It must fully and unconditionally withdraw its forces and military equipment., GENG SHUANG (China) expressed concern that more munitions are flowing to the battlefield, giving rise to the prospect of prolonged conflict. He reiterated his country’s position that supplying weapons will not bring peace and that “adding fuel to fire” will only complicate the problem. Large amounts of materiel falling into the wrong hands will cause endless trouble and create security risks in Ukraine and the wider area. By way of example, he said that, in Afghanistan, up to $7 billion worth of weapons were discarded by withdrawing troops, and are now being sold on the black market in broad daylight. This will be a long-term obstacle to building lasting peace in Afghanistan and will pose security risks to the region. He also pointed out that firearms left by foreign troops in Somalia in the 1990s fell into the hands of terrorists and that, in the 1930s and 1940s, invaders left behind chemical weapons in China that still threaten lives, property and the environment. He stressed that only seeking common, cooperative and sustainable security will bring long-term stability to Europe and the world., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), Council President for September, spoke in his national capacity to say that the Russian Federation has imposed a war on the whole world with major humanitarian, food, energy and nuclear consequences. Because of that, France made a determined choice to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. ""Today, Ukraine is fighting for the values and principles, which are also ours, and are also the principles contained in the United Nations Charter,” he emphasized. It was his country’s duty, and the purview of the Council, to defend these rules, for peace and international stability. As such, France provides military support to Ukraine with the means to defend itself. It is working with the European Union where a collective decision was made to fund weapons, so Ukraine can withstand the Russian Federation’s aggression. “We would like to create the conditions, which would enable, at a time of Ukraine's choosing, either a military victory or a negotiated peace under the terms which would be different from the terms it would have to accept if we abandoned Ukraine to its fate,” he noted. The military assistance will continue for as long as Russian armed aggression continues as will its humanitarian, economic and political assistance to Ukraine, he said., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, pointed out that his Western colleagues did not discuss the topic at hand, shifting instead to again make accusations against Moscow. Noting speculations from the United States and the United Kingdom regarding filtration camps, brutality and torture, he said that he will not comment on this issue again as it has already been discussed. On statements by the “Western backers” of Kyiv that they have only provided defensive weaponry, he said that Ukraine is using these weapons to shell civilian residential areas in the Donbas. Recalling statements by the United States and the United Kingdom that the Russian Federation is buying weaponry from Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, he asked those countries to either provide evidence to substantiate these claims or to acknowledge that they are disseminating unreliable information in the Council., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) recalled a quote by Queen Elizabeth II who, near the time of the Russian Federation’s 2008 invasion of Georgia said: “When life seems hard the courageous do not lie down and accept defeat. They are all the more determined to struggle for a better future.” By launching its aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and invading Ukraine in 2022, the Russian Federation has violated the norms and principles of nearly all fundamental international documents, including the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of the United Nations. No one on this planet but Damascus and Pyongyang doubt this fact. Referring to the General Assembly resolution adopted on 2 March by an overwhelming majority of 141 Member States, deploring in the strongest terms the aggression against Ukraine in violation of the Charter’s Article 2, he said international law guards the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Not a single State present today, besides the Russian Federation, is responsible for the Council’s inability to perform its Charter functions. From the permanent seat of Soviet Union, it has immobilized the Council in ensuring the peace and security of Ukraine. “We are defending ourselves, Europe, the world and the UN Charter,” he said. “We will keep fighting until the last inch of sovereign territory of Ukraine, including Crimea, is liberated,” in line with Article 51 of the Charter., The only thing Vladimir Putin can do to save the lives of his soldiers is to order their immediate withdrawal. The level of destruction, and the global implications of the war make it clear that fighting him today can only be compared to the common fight against Adolf Hitler during the Second World War. He recalled that the Declaration by the United Nations — the first time the term “united nations” was used — was signed in 1942 in Washington, D.C., to unite the world’s peoples in their struggle against the Nazis. Nikita Khrushchev wrote that “if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war”. Even dictator Joseph Stalin offered the same opinion in 1943. It was due to this global unity, lend-lease and assistance by the United States and its allies that the world succeeded in defeating Hitler. “The evil of Putin — as that of Hitler before him — requires a global response,” he insisted. Ukraine and its allies are doing their best to ensure such a response. Stressing that the liberation of Ukraine’s territory is well under way, he said Kharkiv and Kherson serve as best proof of those efforts. Noting that the Russian Federation has abused the Security Council several times, he called on it to learn to respect the Chamber. There is only one right avenue to save Ukrainians and Russians alike: “surrender and withdraw” he said., For information media.

"Reports of Russian Federation Forces Putting Ukrainian Civilians in ‘Filtration’ Camps Must Be Investigated, Senior Officials Tell Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,7 Sep 2022,"SC/15023, 9126TH MEETING (PM), Disturbing reports of Ukrainian civilians subjected to forced displacement, deportation and “filtration” camps must be independently investigated, senior United Nations officials told the Security Council today, as speakers stressed that international humanitarian law — guaranteeing protection for such individuals — still holds in times of war., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, told the Council that “the war in Ukraine continues to rage”, with a total of 13,917 verified civilian casualties and large-scale displacement. Over 6.9 million people have been internally displaced and over 7 million refugees have been recorded across Europe. While these numbers “cannot convey the full scale of the tragedy”, she stressed that — in the face of the international community’s incapacity to stop this senseless war — “we must continue to record its horrific consequences as faithfully and accurately as possible”., Emphasizing that persistent allegations of forced displacement, deportation and so-called “filtration camps” run by the Russian Federation and affiliated local forces are “extremely disturbing”, she called for such reports to be investigated with the cooperation of competent authorities. Further, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine must have unimpeded access to all individuals detained in relation to the ongoing war. Urging peace in Ukraine, she added that “all wars are tragic, but none more than wars of choice”., Ilze Brands Kehris, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in New York, reported that OHCHR has verified that Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups are subjecting civilians to so-called “filtration” — a system of security checks and personal data collection. During this process, persons are undergoing body searches — sometimes involving forced nudity — along with detailed interrogations about personal background, family ties, political views and allegiances; women and girls are at risk of sexual abuse., In addition, OHCHR has further documented that men and women perceived as having ties to Ukrainian armed forces or State institutions — or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views — were being subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and forced disappearance, she said. She urged the Russian Federation to grant unimpeded, confidential access to OHCHR and other independent monitors to all places of detention under its control, as well as unhindered, timely humanitarian access to persons from conflict-affected areas., Oleksandra Drik, Coordinator for International Cooperation at the Center for Civil Liberties, then recounted the stories of several individuals who have passed through the “filtration” process, where they were interrogated, beaten, tortured and psychologically pressured. These are not just rare cases, she stressed. The Russian Federation has established a zone of complete lawlessness in the occupied territory of Ukraine and, by holding a fake referendum in such territory and subsequently declaring its independence, the Russian Federation seeks to distance itself from the atrocities being committed there. She underscored that if the Russian Federation is not stopped, these atrocities will continue and it will invade whichever country it wants next., In the ensuing debate, Council members expressed concern over the lack of negotiations to end the conflict and its ongoing effects on civilians. Many also called for United Nations and independent observers to have access to those held in filtration camps and detention centres, stressing that international law applies even in a state of war., The representative of Albania said that today’s briefing shows that strong concerns over the past six months about the possible detention of Ukrainian civilians are no longer allegations. Rather, they are painstakingly verified facts. Noting that these filtration camps are rooted in Russian history, he stressed that if the Russian Federation has nothing to hide it should give United Nations bodies unrestricted access., The United Kingdom’s representative also expressed concern over reports of the Russian Federation’s systematic detaining, processing and deporting Ukrainians, with “chilling echoes from European history”. Those forced deportations and displacement were being used to change the demographic makeup of parts of Ukraine. Stressing that the Russian Federation is not just trying to destroy Ukrainian democracy but also Ukrainian identity and culture, she said that “alleged de-Nazification is a cover for de-Ukrainianization”., The representative of the Russian Federation pointed out that the term “filtration” does not have a clear definition in international humanitarian law. If speakers were identifying those Ukrainian citizens who wish to come to the Russian Federation, then this is a normal practice for any army, he reminded them. Further, the Russian Federation is the largest recipient of Ukrainian refugees, who are living freely and voluntarily in his country. Displaced persons go through registration when they arrive at the Russian border — just like in other countries that process Ukrainian refugees — he said, underscoring that this process was one of registration, not “filtration”., Kenya’s representative, noting that the war in Ukraine has generated the fastest and largest mass displacement since the Second World War, called for an independent investigation into allegations that some forcibly displaced people are being subjected to filtration processes. Recalling the differential treatment Africans and people of African descent living in Ukraine received when they sought to escape the war as it began, he said that what transpired then still represents a call on all States to “uphold their duty to treat migrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the dignity they deserve”., The representative of the United Arab Emirates, also focusing on the rights of the displaced, pointed out that, like all wars, this one disproportionately affects women and children. “If ever there were a clear-cut illustration of the need for a gender-responsive humanitarian approach, this is it,” she stressed. Noting that, as with all wars, the human cost only worsens, she underscored that what is needed now are ideas and the political will to make them a reality., Speaking after Council members, the representative of Ukraine said that the Russian Federation has continued the forcible deportation of Ukrainian citizens to isolated and depressed regions. Most of those transferred to the Russian Federation have no travel documents, literally trapping those wishing to return home. Noting that children are returning to school in most countries, she said that the Russian Federation has regularly targeted educational facilities — damaging 2,177 and destroying 284 — while also continuing its “Russification” of education in the territories it has occupied since February. Further, children from occupied territories are being transferred to the Russian Federation for illegal adoption. She called for all Ukrainian children to be returned to their parents or legal guardians. “Until this happens, this crime needs the most powerful response by the international community,” she added., Also speaking were representatives of the United States, China, India, Brazil, Ghana, Norway, Mexico, Ireland, Gabon, France, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and Latvia (also for Estonia and Lithuania)., The meeting began at 3:09 p.m. and ended at 5:44 p.m., Briefings, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, briefed the Security Council that “as we are painfully aware, the war in Ukraine continues to rage”, with a total of 13,917 verified civilian casualties. “The actual numbers are likely significantly higher,” she said, also noting that the war continues to drive large-scale displacement, with over 6.9 million people internally displaced and over 7 million refugees recorded across Europe. Ukrainian women — half of the refugee population — continue to face significantly increased security risks, including sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, exploitation and abuse. Further, thousands of people in the conflict-affected areas of the Donetsk region lack access to reliable running water, which increases the risk of communicable disease. While these numbers “cannot convey the full scale of the tragedy”, she stressed that — in the face of the international community’s incapacity to stop this senseless war — “we must continue to record its horrific consequences as faithfully and accurately as possible”., Against that backdrop, she said that the United Nations continues to mobilize to address the massive impact of the war on civilians and, as humanitarian needs rapidly rise, the Organization’s response has scaled up, now reaching 12.7 million people with various forms of assistance. While the United Nations is actively seeking to ensure that protection and assistance are available in all areas of Ukraine, she expressed concern over the lack of access to Ukrainians living in areas outside of the Ukrainian Government’s control. Turning to the war’s impact around the world, she pointed out that its effects on countries already severely hit by climate change, drought or instability “have been extremely worrying” and spotlighted the situation in Somalia, which is “on the brink of famine”. She welcomed, however, the Black Sea Grain Initiative’s enabling of food exports from Ukraine, which has contributed to a decrease in global food prices. To ensure that food reaches all in need, Russian fertilizers and food products must reach foreign markets., She also expressed concern over the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, recalling the Council’s meeting on 6 September on this issue. Additionally, noting that the fact-finding mission to Olenivka is set to deploy in the coming days to investigate the 29 July incident that led to the death of 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war, she stressed that the mission must be able to conduct its work without interference, having safe, secure and unfettered access to people, places and evidence. Further, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine must have unimpeded access to all individuals detained in relation to the ongoing war, including access to places of internment of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilian detainees in the Russian Federation. Emphasizing that persistent allegations of forced displacement, deportation and so-called “filtration camps” run by the Russian Federation and affiliated local forces are “extremely disturbing”, she called for such reports to be investigated with the cooperation of competent authorities., Recalling previous Council discussions on how the war in Ukraine is not only devastating that country but also endangering regional and global stability, she pointed out that the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons could not produce a substantive outcome after consensus was blocked because of issues related to the war. This failure is the latest example of how the conflict has affected international relations and cooperation. Urging peace in Ukraine, she added that “all wars are tragic, but none more than wars of choice”., ILZE BRANDS KEHRIS, Assistant Secretary-General Head and of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), said the armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine has resulted in the mass forced displacement of civilians in Ukraine, with some 7 million people internally displaced and millions more having sought refuge outside of the country. Intense hostilities, including large-scale destruction of critical civilian infrastructure and housing, has forced many people to flee their homes. OHCHR has documented a significant number of cases of civilians who were displaced to the Russian Federation, including a dozen cases where members of the Russian armed forces ordered civilians in Mariupol to leave their homes or shelters and brought them to territory in Ukraine under their control, or to the Russian Federation. She noted there have been credible allegations of forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation itself., She voiced concern that Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families — stressing that under Article 50 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, Moscow is prohibited from changing the children’s personal status, including nationality. OHCHR has verified that Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups subject civilians to so-called “filtration” — a system of security checks and personal data collection. In cases that her Office has documented, during “filtration”, Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups have subjected persons to body searches, sometimes involving forced nudity, and detailed interrogations about personal background, family ties, political views and allegiances, with women and girls at risk of sexual abuse., OHCHR has further documented that men and women perceived as having ties with Ukrainian armed forces or State institutions, or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views, were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance — transferred to penal colonies, including the now infamous penal colony near Olenivka, where they were interrogated and sometimes tortured to extract a so-called “confession” of their cooperation with the Government of Ukraine. Her Office has been seeking access to individuals detained after failing to pass “filtration”, and to those who reportedly passed “filtration” but were nevertheless detained and sent to a “centre for evacuees” in Bezimenne, in Donetsk region. She expressed concern that those people may be subjected to torture or ill treatment while being held incommunicado. Risks of trafficking can also arise when people have exhausted their savings or when States reduce the scope of their protection or social assistance, she stressed — calling on receiving States to establish systematic protection and security measures, such as gender-based violence risk mitigation. She urged the Russian Federation to grant unimpeded and confidential access to her Office and other independent international monitors to all places of detention under their control, as well as unhindered, timely and safe humanitarian access to persons from conflict-affected areas., OLEKSANDRA DRIK, Coordinator for International Cooperation at the Center for Civil Liberties, next briefed the Council that her human-rights organization and its partners have documented over 17,000 potential crimes committed by the Russian army in Ukraine. Many of these occur during the so-called “filtration” process that the Russian Federation has been implementing in the occupied territories of Ukraine over the last eight years. She recounted the stories of several individuals who have passed through this filtration process, where they were interrogated, beaten, tortured with physical violence and electricity and psychologically pressured to renounce Ukrainian citizenship or provide information on their connections with the Ukrainian military. Those who have not passed through this process can be detained for months, she said, after which they are possibly sent to detention centres or prisons in occupied Ukraine or in the Russian Federation., She also recounted the stories of several civilians taken hostage and tortured to admit their relationship with the Ukrainian military, as if the Russian Federation needed to prepare these hostages as an “exchange fund”. There are also reports that those who fail to pass filtration are killed, and satellite images reveal mass graves situated close to filtration camps. All the people going through filtration procedures are civilian hostages, humiliated and kept in inhumane conditions without access to proper food, water or sanitation. These are not just rare cases, she stressed, noting that her organization alone has received information regarding at least 600 of such cases, often from relatives. This is a systematic, planned and organized activity that did not start with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022; rather, the Russian Federation has been utilizing this practice since its invasion of Crimea in 2014., The Russian Federation has “established a zone of complete lawlessness” in the occupied territory of Ukraine, she went on to say. Further, by holding a fake referendum in such territory and subsequently declaring its independence, the Russian Federation seeks to distance itself from the atrocities being committed there. Ukraine is not the first country that the Russian Federation has invaded in the last 30 years, she stressed, but that country “has always gotten away with it”. If the Russian Federation is not stopped, these atrocities will continue and that country will invade whichever country it wants. Against that backdrop, she called on the Council to create an effective mechanism to monitor the Russian Federation’s compliance with the norms of international law and to promote the establishment of an accountability mechanism necessary to bring Russian war criminals to justice., Statements, FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said today’s briefing shows that strong concerns over the past six months about alleged detentions of Ukrainian civilians are no longer allegations. These concerns are facts that have been confirmed and painstakingly verified by international human rights groups, media and others and such actions run against international law, he said, adding that the Russian Federation is conducting social engineering in Ukraine. No independent bodies have been allowed to visit the filtration camps. The reports note that people passing through the camps are abused, even physically tortured. In addition, there are forcible transfers of adults and children. Individuals have been detained and the fates of many people are unknown. Noting that these filtration camps are rooted in Russian Federation history, he said it is now estimated that 1.5 million people have passed through the camps as of June. This creates a bleak picture. Further, Russians have separated Ukrainian children from their families and have placed them with Russian families. International humanitarian law prohibits the forcible transfer of people, he pointed out, adding that the international crimes committed in Ukraine will not go unpunished. “This may only be the tip of iceberg,” he said. If the Russian Federation has nothing to hide, it should give United Nations bodies unrestricted access., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), spotlighting the filtration camps and violence against Ukrainians parents and children, noted that even the TASS Russian News Agency has reported on many Ukrainians being relocated to Russian Federation. Quoting a man who said “we felt like hostages” under Russian detention, she reported that those with pro-Ukrainian leanings are disappeared or further detained. She also recalled the words of a woman who heard a soldier say he had shot 10 people who did not pass filtration. Between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians are reported to have been removed to the Russian Federation. Further, the United States has information that officials from the Russian Federation presidential Administration are overseeing the operation. The word “filtered” does not begin to capture the horror of what is occurring, she stressed, as in July alone, more than 1,800 children were forcibly transferred from the Russian Federation-occupied areas of Ukraine — a grave breach of the Geneva Convention that constitutes a war crime. Asking why the Russian Federation is systematically cataloguing Ukrainians moving through the system and forcing them to apply for Russian Federation passports, she stressed that it is, in fact, an effort to erase the living memory of Ukraine and prepare for an annexation. The United States will never recognize Russian Federation’s forcible alteration of Ukraine’s borders, she stated, calling on Moscow to allow access to the United Nations and independent observers, and for all persons subject to filtration to have access to humanitarian aid., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) expressed concern over reports that the Russian Federation is systematically detaining, processing and deporting Ukrainian men, women and children “with chilling echoes from European history”. She called on the Russian Federation to allow the United Nations and other relevant international organizations immediate, full and unhindered access to those held in filtration camps and detention centres. She also expressed concern that the Russian Federation is potentially using forced deportations and displacement to forcibly change the demographic makeup of parts of Ukraine. This tells the world several things about the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine, including that it is not just an attempt to destroy Ukrainian democracy; rather, it also seeks to destroy Ukrainian identity and culture. “Alleged de-Nazification is a cover for de-Ukrainianization,” she said. Noting that the Russian army is not being welcomed as it enters Ukrainian territory, she underscored that this is a war of conquest, occupation and oppression, aimed at eliminating Ukraine. Against that backdrop, she called on the Russian Federation to fully observe its obligations under international law and end its illegal invasion of Ukraine., GENG SHUANG (China), noting that winter was approaching, said it is worrying that the conflict shows no sign of ending. Ukraine and its neighbouring countries are facing issues of great concern. He encouraged the parties to make all efforts to avoid further deterioration of the situation. Stressing that the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure is very important, he emphasized that the protection of civilians should come first. In addition, the legitimate rights of displaced refugees and international agencies should be protected. The safety of the power plant affects many people, and he called on all parties to follow the seven pillars outlined by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Humanitarian issues in Ukraine have always been close to China’s heart, he noted, encouraging the Russian Federation and Ukraine to maintain communications with that focus. He also called for the return of Ukrainian food and fertilizer to the international market. History has proven that diplomatic efforts and negotiations are the only viable way to resolve the crisis. All parties should continue engagement and refrain from confrontation., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) said the report of the Secretary-General paints a distressing picture of civilian suffering: over 11,000 civilian casualties in various conflicts in 2021, with over 45 per cent of these being in Afghanistan alone; more than 140 million people reeling under conflict-induced hunger; and 84 million being forcibly displaced, with women and children forming the large majority of internally displaced persons. Vulnerable groups, including women, children, and minorities, as well as indispensable civilian infrastructure, hospitals and irreplaceable cultural heritage, have been among the several collateral casualties of attacks in recent armed conflicts. It is regrettable that the situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the conflict and its humanitarian consequences, with deeply disturbing reports of civilian killings in Bucha. Calling for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies, she reported that India has recently dispatched its twelfth consignment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine. She also pointed out that the conflict has been exacerbating concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security, particularly in the developing countries. In that regard, in the last three months alone, India has exported more than 1.8 million tons of wheat to countries in need, including to Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan and Yemen., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) cited the bleak scenario of deaths, displaced persons and a deteriorating humanitarian situation, with conflict in winter threatening to worsen those conditions. Expressing concern over the safety of heavily populated areas and the security of Zaporizhzhia power plant, he stressed that it is even more disheartening to see no signs of peace negotiations, with both sides preparing for a long conflict — threatening both countries, their economies and the entire region. Citing previous comments by the United Arab Emirates representative, he emphasized that there is value in Council meetings on Ukraine when they are accompanied by action. Condemning the use of force to resolve any disputes between States, he also stressed that closing the door to dialogue or isolating any of the parties will not resolve the conflict. The arrival of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) personnel at Zaporizhzhia was evidence that respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations are the best way forward. He urged the parties to refrain from escalating the conflict and cease hostilities, prioritizing the well-being of their populations., KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) said that since the war’s beginning in February this year, at least 14 million people are estimated to have been forcibly displaced from their normal places of abode. Nearly 6.9 million people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries while some 7 million more people have been internally displaced. While some Ukrainian nationals have crossed back into Ukrainian territory, the numbers pale in comparison to those compelled to leave their homes on a daily basis. Moreso, women and children account for the greatest portion of displaced persons. She commended the neighbouring countries that have received millions of Ukrainians and provided them with needed assistance. These countries must be granted additional support, where possible, to enhance their response capacity. She also condemned all acts of human rights abuses against civilians, including the reported cases of filtration processes and other acts, adding that such operations can be inhumane and constitute violations of international humanitarian law and human rights laws. She called for thorough, impartial and independent investigations of such reports and allegations of abuses to establish the facts and ensure accountability on the part of the perpetrators and justice for the victims., MONA JUUL (Norway) said the number of civilian casualties amassed is alarming and unacceptable, with over 7 million fleeing and seeking protection in neighbouring and other countries, and roughly the same number internally displaced. The restoration of family links is of the utmost importance, and the international community must prevent and combat human trafficking and other abuses. As well, the international community must support Ukraine’s reconstruction efforts so that the millions of forcibly displaced persons one day can return to their homes. She voiced concern about reports of forcible transfers of civilians to the Russian Federation and of filtration facilities, with a growing body of independent information indicating serious human rights violations and abuses against civilian detainees and prisoners of war at these sites. She welcomed the update today on the fact-finding mission established by the Secretary-General pursuant to the incident of 29 July at the detention facility near the village of Olenivka. Recalling that all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition of an occupied territory are prohibited according to international humanitarian law, and may constitute war crimes, she stated that civilians forcibly transferred out of Ukraine who wish to return must be allowed to do so. “Russia chose to start this war, Russia can also choose to end it,” she stressed., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), noting that the “dirty methods of Western propogandists are familiar to us”, said that his country is now being blamed for “filtration” activities that it is allegedly carrying out against Ukrainian citizens. Recalling the statement by the representative of the United States, he noted that she recounted a story as if from a horror film and asked which film’s plot she was describing. “We’ve never seen that film,” he said, suggesting it was perhaps produced by Ukraine’s ministry of propaganda. Pointing out that the term “filtration” doesn’t have a clear definition in international humanitarian law, he said that, if those present are talking about identifying those Ukrainian citizens who wish to come to the Russian Federation, this is a normal practice for any army. He then asked if the United States allowed the United Nations to inspect prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, stressing that this discussion represents a cynical attempt to force an unsuspecting public to believe in the existence of “bizarre camps” in which Ukrainian citizens are being forced into the Russian Federation., He went on to point out that the Russian Federation is the largest recipient of Ukrainian refugees, who are not being kept in prisons; rather, they are living freely and voluntarily in the Russian Federation. Naturally, displaced persons go through registration when they arrive at the Russian border – just like in other countries that process Ukrainian refugees, he said, stressing that this process was one of registration, not “filtration”. He also asked how videos can depict Ukrainian criminals calmly crossing the Russian border if a so-called “police State” has introduced a network of filtration camps for Ukrainian citizens, and how mass voluntary movements of Ukrainians comport with accusations of forced deportation. He added that it is regrettable that campaigns to besmirch the Russian Federation have now extended to human-rights defenders, questioning how the same can be impartial when they only work from one side of the conflict. Emphasizing that the Council wasted time today in discussing conjectures, he proposed a meeting on 8 September on the real threats to international peace and security caused by foreign States supplying Ukraine with military equipment., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) said the war in Ukraine has generated the fastest and largest mass displacement since the Second World War. Last month alone, more than 330,000 people, mostly from the east and south of the country, where violence has been raging, were displaced. The claim that some of the forcibly displaced are being subjected to filtration processes is serious and alarming, he said, calling for an independent investigation into those allegations to establish the facts upon which the Council can take appropriate action. In that regard, the relevant United Nations agencies should be granted access to those that have been forcibly displaced, particularly those in or that have been in the alleged filtration camps. Recalling the International Day for People of African Descent on 30 August, he drew attention to the differential treatment Africans and people of African descent living in Ukraine received, when they, like millions of others, were seeking to escape when the war against Ukraine broke out. “What transpired then still represents a call on all States to review their laws and practices, to address racial discrimination, and uphold their duty to treat migrants, refugees and asylum seekers with the dignity they deserve,” he said., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said the conflict has led to serious consequences and forced millions of people to leave their homes and reside in other countries. Millions of people have not been able to return to their place of origin. He appealed to all parties to respect international human rights and humanitarian law. Parties to an international armed conflict may not deport or move by force the civilian population of an occupied area. Violation of this law is a war crime. Ukraine is a constantly changing crisis. Many United Nations agencies have warned of the risks faced by women, children and the elderly and disabled people. Women, for example, face health risks and are victims of sexual violence and forced trafficking. The elderly and persons with disabilities face limited access to shelter and services to address urgent conditions. He called for all necessary measures to be taken so civilians have safe shelter, food and health care. Regarding the so-called filtration process, it is crucial for the United Nations to have access to the sites without restriction. The only way to resolve this deplorable situation is an immediate cessation of hostilities, he added., FERGAL TOMAS MYTHEN (Ireland) called on the Russian Federation to comply with its international law obligations, stressing that there must be full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to civilians, including those who choose to remain in Ukraine or who are unable to leave. Those who seek to leave or those who are forced to leave must be allowed to do so safely and be allowed to leave for destinations of their own choosing. There is evidence of enforced deportations of Ukrainians and the worrying use of so-called “filtration centres” as part of this process. Those violations of international humanitarian and human rights law may constitute international crimes, including war crimes. Also recalling reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian soldiers against women, girls, men and boys, he stressed that there must be no impunity for such crimes. All prisoners of war must be treated humanely in all circumstances. Allegations or incidents of mistreatment must be properly investigated and perpetrators held accountable. Moreover, the International Committee of the Red Cross must be given access to all prisoners of war, he said., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) noted that, while parents in New York and around the world prepare their children for the return to school, it is hard to imagine that in the context of the Ukraine conflict. While highlighting the resilience of Ukrainian children, she noted the war has destroyed almost 300 educational institutions. Further, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that over 2 million children have fled their country; like all wars, this one disproportionately affects women and children. “If ever there were a clear-cut illustration of the need for a gender-responsive humanitarian approach, this is it,” she stressed. Protection must be provided without prejudice or discrimination, and those fleeing must be allowed to retain their dignity and agency. All parties must abide by their responsibilities under international law, with routes to safety being secured and infrastructure and life-sustaining services protected. With every passing day, the need to find a way to stem the violence and suffering only deepens. Citing food insecurity, she underscored that grain must continue to reach those most in need, not just those able to pay, and the need to get Russian fertilizer out to global markets for next year’s harvest. As with all wars, the human cost only worsens; what is needed now are ideas and the political will to make them a reality. Cessation of hostilities is the right starting point., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) emphasized, once again, that “civilians are paying too high a price” for the war in Ukraine and that belligerent parties must abide by the international instruments that guarantee their protection. The existence of cases of filtration, profiling, mistreatment, forced labour and torture are serious allegations that, if proven, would be “inconceivable”, she stressed, adding that “the state of war is not a state of lawlessness”. Further, human suffering cannot be the subject of speculation, blackmail or bartering. Impartial inquiries must be conducted to establish the facts and those responsible. She also urged the parties to cooperate with the United Nations and its specialized agencies to ensure civilians are protected in Ukraine and beyond and called for humanitarian workers to have unhindered access to the areas and peoples in need of support. She also urged the belligerents to engage in good-faith negotiations to end the war and reach “peaceful coexistence”., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), Council President for September, speaking in his national capacity, said the war of aggression that the Russian Federation has been waging for nearly seven months, in violation of all the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, has unbearable consequences for civilian populations. Expressing shock at reports of the forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians to Russian-occupied areas or to the Russian Federation — including children — he further noted that they have been subjected to inhumane detention conditions and to “filtration” processes. Such actions may clearly constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. The unbearable scenes and crimes committed in Ukraine are the subject of rigorous documentation, evidence collection and criminal law analysis, he said, adding that the perpetrators will have to be held accountable. The work of the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Commission of Inquiry created by the Human Rights Council is crucial to this effort to document, analyse and fight against impunity. He further expressed support for efforts by Ukrainian courts and the independent investigations they have opened., KHRYSTYNA HAYOVYSHYN (Ukraine) said, after nearly 200 days since the Russian invasion, Ukraine remains confident about its victory, with Ukrainian forces liberating territories and settlements in Kherson, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. However, as a part of its aggression, the Russian Federation has continued the forcible deportation of Ukrainian citizens to isolated and depressed regions, including Siberia and the Far East. According to available data, nearly 2.5 million Ukrainians, including about 38,000 children, have been transferred from southern and eastern regions of Ukraine. As part of the forced evacuation and deportation, the Russian Federation is detaining refugees in so-called “filtration camps”. According to Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General, these camps have been set up in the cities of Makiivka, Snizhne, Torez, Shakhtarsk, Khartsysk, Novoazovsk and Berdyansk, as well as the villages of Nikolske, Bezimenne, Yuryivka. The Ministry of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine states that only about 16,000 deported citizens were able to return to Ukraine. According to their accounts, most of those transferred to the Russian Federation have no travel documents. This makes people wishing to return back home literally trapped in the Russian Federation., Noting that it is back-to-school time in most countries, she reported the Russian Federation has regularly targeted education facilities, damaging 2,177 educational institutions and destroying 284. In addition, the Russian Federation is continuing its “Russification” of education to the territories it has occupied since February. The curriculum it imposes in those occupied territories does not provide for the studying of the Ukrainian language, literature and history. More so, children from the occupied territories are being transferred to the Russian Federation and illegally given up for adoption, a violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. On August 23, the Krasnodar Department of Family and Childhood in the Russian Federation publicly reported that more than 1,000 Ukrainian children from Mariupol had been illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai regions and more than 300 children were currently being held in specialized institutions in Krasnodar region. “We reiterate that all Ukrainian children, who were illegally displaced to the territory of Russia must be returned to their parents or legal guardians,” she said. “Until this happens, this crime needs the most powerful response by the international community.”, MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy) called on the Russian Federation to grant unfettered access for both United Nations bodies and international non-governmental organizations to freely and safely visit the temporary placement centres with direct and complete access to those civilians. He further called on the Russian Federation to ensure the immediate return of all forcibly transferred Ukrainian citizens, particularly women and children, to their territories of origin or their full freedom of movement towards third countries. The effective evacuation mechanism established in Mariupol, thanks to the coordination efforts of the United Nations and ICRC, is a clear example of how international humanitarian law cannot be left only to the voluntary compliance of armed and non-armed groups, he said, adding that it should be replicated to end the heinous filtration system. Accountability for the perpetrators of such severe breaches of international humanitarian law must be guaranteed, he said, reaffirming full support for the strengthening of the existing mechanisms of compliance, particularly the International Criminal Court., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) called on the international community to protect Ukrainian children’s right to identity, including their nationality, without unlawful interference. The Russian Federation’s forced transfers are yet another element on its long list of serious violations of the laws of war that may amount to war crimes and potentially crimes against humanity. He said it is even more deplorable that the Russian Federation is presenting all Ukrainians entering its territory — voluntarily or not — as refugees or migrants, whereas they are in fact the victims of Moscow’s violations of international law. For those reasons, accountability for violations of international law, including human rights law, committed in Ukraine by the Russian Federation, should remain the priority of the international community. His country has consistently called for bringing perpetrators of atrocities to justice. It continuously supports the work of fact-finding, investigative and accountability mechanisms mandated to examine those violations, and has supported the establishment of the dedicated Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry., RÓBERT CHATRNÚCH (Slovakia) voiced concern about the Russian Federation's intention to stage fraudulent referendums with the aim of illegally annexing the occupied territories of Ukraine. Those anticipated steps follow the same tactic the Russian Federation used in 2014 regarding Crimea, he pointed out, stressing that his country does not and will not recognize such an illegal annexation. He called for an immediate cessation of Russian military activities in Ukraine and unconditional withdrawal of all its troops from Ukraine. Also voicing concern about the reported forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians to areas of occupied territories of Ukraine and to the Russian Federation, he said that action may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. According to those reports, during the process of “filtration”, Ukrainian citizens are subject to compulsory security screening with collecting civilians’ biometric data, conducting body searches and questioning them about political views. There are serious grounds for concerns that these individuals are at particular risk of torture, he stressed, calling on the Russian Federation to seize that activity at once and allow all civilians forcibly transferred, who wish to return to Ukraine, to do so., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), speaking also on behalf of Estonia and Lithuania, called on the Russian Federation to immediately stop violating international humanitarian law and Ukrainians’ human rights. He condemned the forced “passportization” and conscription to the Russian armed forces of Ukrainian citizens, who live in the temporarily occupied territories. He further condemned the deportation of Ukrainian civilians to the Russian Federation, the forcible transfer of children, illegal adoption of Ukrainian children, and the abduction of civilians, including mayors and other democratically elected representatives, journalists and activists. Vulnerable groups, such as women, children, orphans and the elderly have suffered the most, he underscored. He said that he looks forward to receiving an update from OHCHR, which is looking into allegations that children in orphanages had been taken to the Russian Federation. He called on international human rights organizations to continue documenting cases of forcible transfer of Ukrainian citizens and providing regular and public reports about their findings. He called on the United Nations to establish a fact-finding mission to document deportation of Ukrainian citizens, similar to the fact-finding mission regarding the massacre of Ukrainian soldiers in Olenivka., For information media.

Russia: ‘Filtration’ of Ukrainian civilians a ‘shocking violation’ of people forced to flee war,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,8 Sep 2022,"Responding to the news that the UN has verified that Russian soldiers have subjected Ukrainian civilians to a rights-abusing process known as “filtration”, a practice independently verified by Amnesty International as deeply abusive and humiliating, Marie Struthers, Amnesty’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “The abusive and humiliating process known as ‘filtration’ is a shocking violation of international human rights and humanitarian law. Our research shows that many displaced Ukrainians end up inside Russia or Russia-occupied territories involuntarily, even if they are not physically forced to move. Deportation and forcible transfer of civilians in occupied territory are prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. Putting these forcibly displaced civilians through the abuses of ‘filtration’ is both cynical and cruel., “We are also concerned for vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied, separated, or orphaned children, older people, and people with disabilities, some of whom were prevented from fleeing towards Ukrainian-controlled territory by Russian soldiers. Many found themselves unable to leave Russia or Russian-occupied areas once transferred to such locations.”, “The Russian authorities must urgently allow the international community to access and monitor temporary placement shelters for Ukrainian civilians and evacuation procedures for civilians trapped in the conflict. They must also immediately ensure that Ukrainian civilians are able to safely leave warzones and enter Ukrainian-controlled territories. Those in Russia must be able to access resources that enable them to leave the country for Ukraine or a third country.”, Background, Amnesty International has documented several cases of Russian soldiers abusing detained Ukrainian civilians going through the ‘filtration’ procedures while exiting the warzone or crossing the border into or out of Russia., Some unaccompanied, separated, and orphaned children, as well as civilians from Mariupol-based institutions that care for older people and people with disabilities, were forcibly transferred to Donetsk. Some of the children and civilians were in the process of being evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled areas at the time., Older people in particular are at a greater risk of getting trapped in Russian-controlled areas or in Russia, due to a lack of information, funds and mobility issues., There appear to be no systems in place to facilitate the return of older people or people with disabilities from Russia or Russian-occupied territories to territories controlled by the government of Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-filtration-ukrainian-civilians-shocking-violation-people-forced-flee-war
Statement to the Security Council: Threats to International Peace and Security - Statement by Ms. Izumi Nakamitsu High Representative for Disarmament Affairs (8 September 2022),News and Press Release,UNODA,Protection and Human Rights,8 Sep 2022,"Mr. President,, Distinguished members of the Security Council,, Excellencies,, Ladies and gentlemen,, I have been requested to brief on the issue of “the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine”., It is a matter of public record that, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine which started on 24 February 2022, Ukraine has received for their defense force transfers of weapons systems and ammunition from a number of States., Information about transfers of such materiel has been widely publicized by the governments involved., These transfers have included heavy conventional weapons, including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery systems and uncrewed combat aerial vehicles, as well as small arms and light weapons., There have also been widespread and independently verified reports of the transfer of major conventional weapon systems to local armed groups in Ukraine, including artillery rocket systems., As a matter of general statement, large-scale influx of weapons to conflict-affected zones raises many concerns, including potential for diversion., Those concerns should be taken with due regard, and international community does have some instruments, such as UN Register of Conventional Arms, to enhance transparency in arms transfer. I encourage States to make use of those mechanisms., Beyond the matter of supply of weapons, we must focus on how these weapons are used, in particular considering the devastating impact on civilians and civilian infrastructure caused by the use of heavy weapons in Ukraine., The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 13,917 verified civilian casualties since 24 February. The actual numbers are believed to be significantly higher. Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including attacks by heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and aircraft., The war also continues to drive large-scale displacement, with over 6.9 million people internally displaced and over 7 million refugees recorded across Europe., The Secretary-General has consistently highlighted the severe humanitarian impact of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and has repeatedly called on parties to conflict to avoid their use in populated areas., I would like to strongly reiterate this call here today., Under international humanitarian law, combatants must not direct attacks against civilians or civilian infrastructure and take all feasible precautions in the conduct of military operations to avoid, or at least to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects., Mr. President,, On 24 August, the Secretary-General addressed this Council marking the sad and tragic milestone of six months since the invasion of Ukraine., Throughout this period, we have witnessed tremendous devastation – with thousands of civilians killed and injured, most as a result of the use of heavy conventional weapons., The time to end this suffering is now. Let us resolve to keep working for peace in line with international law and the United Nations Charter., I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-security-council-threats-international-peace-and-security-statement-ms-izumi-nakamitsu-high-representative-disarmament-affairs-8-september-2022

Update 99 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (7 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Sep 2022,"Renewed shelling has damaged a back-up power line between Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and a nearby thermal power station, further underlining significant nuclear safety risks at the facility, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) learnt at the site., The incident that occurred yesterday did not have an immediate impact on the ZNPP’s current operations as it had already been disconnected from the electricity grid two days ago when another reserve line was switched off in order to extinguish a fire., But the damage to the 750/330 kilovolt (kV) line once again demonstrated the difficulties and vulnerabilities the ZNPP is facing when it comes to external power supplies. The ZNPP lost the connection to all its four main external power lines earlier during the conflict, the last one on 2 September. Of the three back-up lines between the ZNPP and the thermal power station, one is now damaged by shelling, while the two others are disconnected, senior Ukrainian operating staff informed IAEA experts present at the plant since last week., In addition to the impact on the power line, shelling had also caused damage at the site’s switchyard, which the Ukrainian operating staff are planning to repair. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., For the last few days, the ZNPP has relied on its sole operating reactor for the power it needs for cooling and other safety functions. While the plant also has emergency diesel generators available if needed, Director General Grossi has repeatedly expressed concern about the power supply situation., In a report on nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine that was issued yesterday ahead of his briefing to the United Nations Security Council, the Director General noted that the ZNPP on several occasions “lost, fully or partially, the off-site power supply as a result of military activities in the area”. He recommended that the “off-site power supply line redundancy as designed should be re-established and available at any time, and that all military activities that may affect the power supply systems end.”, A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety and preventing a nuclear accident. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., Last week, after months of efforts, Director General Grossi established an IAEA presence at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant when he led a team of experts across the frontline to the facility. Two IAEA experts remain at the site, providing independent and objective monitoring and assessments of the situation there., Yesterday, the Director General recommended the urgent establishment of a Nuclear Safety and Security Protection Zone at the ZNPP, and he is having consultations aimed at implementing this plan.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-99-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-7-sep-2022
"Ukraine: Briefing, 7 September 2022",News and Press Release,Security Council Report,Protection and Human Rights,7 Sep 2022,"This afternoon (7 September), the Security Council will convene for an open briefing on the situation in Ukraine. The expected briefers are Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and head of the UN Human Rights Office in New York Ilze Brands Kehris, and a civil society representative. Ukraine, as well as Italy, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia, are expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure., Albania and the US, the penholders on Ukraine, requested the meeting with the aim of highlighting concerns about reports of the forced displacement of Ukrainian civilians and the use of ""filtration"" operations by Russian and Russian-affiliated forces. Such reports have been highlighted by Ukraine since the early days of Russia's military offensive against Ukraine, which commenced on 24 February., Ukrainian officials and civil society organisations have alleged that Russian authorities are forcibly deporting Ukrainian civilians---including children---from areas occupied by Russian and Russian-affiliated forces, such as the Donbas region in the east and the city of Mariupol in the south, to Russia or to Russian-held territory inside Ukraine. They claim that civilians who are fleeing the hostilities are processed in so-called filtration camps, where Russian forces detain and interrogate civilians, subjecting them to ill-treatment and difficult conditions. Russia has denied these allegations, arguing that it has offered humanitarian assistance to civilians fleeing the violence and that Ukrainian civilians who have relocated to Russia have done so voluntarily., The UN and other international organisations have not been able to access locations in which filtration operations are reportedly taking place. The UN has thus not been able to fully confirm such allegations and there is a lack of verifiable data on the filtration operations or on the forced deportation of civilians. In a 29 June report, covering the period between 24 February and 15 May, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) described the so-called filtration process, in part based on interviews with civilians who claimed to have undergone such processes. The report said that the apparent intent of the process is ""to identify current or former Ukrainian law enforcement officers, state officials, and members of the Ukrainian armed forces"", but ""practice shows that any individuals perceived as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views are also identified and are subject to violations and abuses of their rights"". It describes violations reportedly committed against individuals who underwent ""filtration"", including intimidation, beatings and sexual violence. The report references ""credible reports"" of some children having been separated from their parents when the accompanying adult did not pass the ""filtration"" process. It notes that as of 15 May, OHCHR has not been granted access to individuals detained after failing to pass ""filtration"", nor to those who reportedly passed ""filtration"" but were still detained., Other international organisations and human rights actors have also raised concerns. In a 14 July report, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Moscow Mechanism mission of experts---a fact-finding team established on 14 March by the OSCE to investigate violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in Ukraine---expressed concern about the establishment and use of so-called filtration centres. It further noted that during a visit of its experts to Ukraine between 20 and 23 June, the mission ""obtained confirmation of the existence of cases of deportations"", while adding that ""the precise number is difficult to determine""., On 25 August, the Conflict Observatory---a project aimed at collecting, analysing and making available evidence on crimes committed in Ukraine, which receives funding from the US State Department---issued a report that identified at least 21 facilities in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine used as part of the ""filtration"" system, based on open-source information and satellite imagery. In a 1 September report, Human Rights Watch provided a description of the forced transfer of civilians from the city of Mariupol and the Kharkiv region to Russia and Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, based on interviews with civilians who underwent such processes and their relatives. The report says that: ""[u]nlike combatants who, once captured, are held as prisoners of war (POWs) and may be moved to enemy territory, the forcible transfer of civilians is prohibited under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and can be prosecuted as a war crime and a crime against humanity."", At today's meeting, DiCarlo and Brands Kehris are expected to provide an overview of the adverse effects of the conflict in Ukraine on civilians. They might highlight the dangers faced by civilians who are displaced by hostilities, particularly unaccompanied children, and their heightened vulnerability to human rights violations and risks such as human trafficking. Brands Kehris may call on all parties to provide unimpeded access to the UN to all places of detention under their control., The US has been among the most vocal Council members on this issue. It has consistently referenced allegations of forced deportations and the use of ""filtration"" centres by Russian forces in Council meetings on Ukraine since April. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a 13 July statement that estimates from a variety of sources indicate that ""Russian authorities have interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainian citizens, including 260,000 children, from their homes to Russia"", adding that these practices are ""an apparent effort to change the demographic makeup of parts of Ukraine"". He called for accountability, saying that Russia will not be able to carry out such operations with impunity. Albania has also often expressed concern about the matter, most recently during a 29 July Council meeting on Ukraine, at which it said that ""the mass forcible transfer of civilians during a conflict to the territory of the occupying party is prohibited under the 1949 Geneva Conventions"", adding that it constitutes a war crime. These members may reiterate similar messages at today's meeting., European members of the Council may express concern about reports of ""filtration"" activities and call for the UN and other international organisations to be accorded unrestricted access to areas where civilians are detained. They might call on Russia to provide more information on civilians who have been moved to Russia, particularly children. It seems that the US and some European members are concerned that Russia's practice of ""filtration"" is aimed at identifying civilians who will oppose living under Russian rule. These members have expressed concern that Russia may stage fraudulent referendums to annex the territories it has occupied in Ukraine. At today's meeting, Russia is likely to seek to rebut such allegations, while denouncing the US and European countries for their treatment of refugees.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-briefing-7-september-2022
UN Security Council: IAEA Grossi Calls for Establishment of Nuclear Safety and Security Protection Zone at Zaporizhzhya NPP,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Sep 2022,"Estelle Marais, IAEA Office of Public Information and Communication
Michael Amdi Madsen, IAEA Office of Public Information and Communication, The establishment of a Nuclear Safety and Security Protection Zone at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Ukraine is urgently needed to ensure that the physical integrity of the plant is not compromised, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the UN Security Council yesterday. Zaporizhzya NPP has been controlled by Russian forces since March but is operated by its Ukrainian staff., In a session discussing threats to international peace and security, Mr Grossi outlined findings and recommendations from the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ), released on Tuesday in its Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine: 2nd Summary Report., Stressing the need for a protection zone, including an end to the shelling around the plant, he explained that the first important safety pillar that exists in any nuclear facility is not to violate its physical integrity. Mr Grossi said that unfortunately ""this has happened and this continues to happen,” adding that “we are playing with fire and something very catastrophic could take place.”, Mr Grossi told the Security Council that the IAEA through ISAMZ now has a continuous presence at Zaporizhzya NPP, with personnel on the ground at the plant providing first-hand neutral, impartial and technical information on the site’s status. Pointing out the value of the Agency’s continued presence at the plant, he said this provided the IAEA, and through it, the United Nations and the international community with the capacity to have a direct, immediate evaluation of the situation on the ground as it may happen., “This fact is unprecedented,” Mr Grossi said, stating that historically IAEA inspectors became involved after the facts in order to remediate something that had already happened. “We in this case have the historical, ethical imperative to prevent something from happening,” he said., “We can agree on a very simple, but incredibly necessary protective mechanism to avoid what is happening now, as we speak, which is the shelling of a nuclear power plant. Let’s seize this opportunity so fundamental for peace, for security and to protect the populations of Ukraine and beyond,” he added., Recommendations for re-establishing the pillars of nuclear safety and security, Mr Grossi stressed that the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security at Zaporizhzhya NPP must be maintained and detailed the IAEA’s recommendations to address violations of these pillars., Mr Grossi explained how ISAMZ had observed that operators at the plant were performing important safety and security tasks under extremely challenging circumstances, with military equipment and vehicles present on the site. With the second pillar stating that all safety and security systems and equipment should be fully functional, he recommended that the military vehicles and equipment on the site be removed so as not to interfere with normal operation of the nuclear safety and security systems., Under the third pillar, which requires operating staff to be able to fulfil their safety and security duties without undue pressures, Mr Grossi said that this is something that has been addressed time and again during this crisis and especially since the nuclear power plant was occupied last March. He recommended that the operator should be allowed to return to its clear and routine lines of responsibilities and authorities, and that an appropriate work environment be re-established, including with proper family support for the staff., Mr Grossi stressed the crucial importance of pillar four, which states that there must be secure off-site power supply from the grid, stating that: “A nuclear power plant without external power supply may lose crucial functionalities including the cooling of the reactors and the spent fuel. Without this we could have a very serious nuclear accident.” He recommended that off-site power supply line redundancy be re-established and available at any time, and said that for this to be possible, “all military activities that may affect the power supply systems must be stopped immediately.”, Referring to the fifth pillar, which requires uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transportation to and from the sites, Mr Grossi explained that the Zaporizhzhya NPP is ""a large industrial site requiring a constant flow of spare parts and other equipment — a situation that is of course abnormally interrupted now.” He recommended that all the parties should commit and contribute to ensuring effective supply chains, highlighting that IAEA assistance and support programmes can help in re-establishing a flow of supplies., Pillar six refers to the functioning of radiation monitoring systems, and Mr Grossi recommended that the site should continue ensuring this functionality, including by trainings and exercises, which he said the IAEA can help in ensuring., Finally, Mr Grossi highlighted that pillar seven states that there must be continued and reliable communications with the regulator and with others. “We have seen repeatedly that these lines of communication have been interrupted,” he said. He recommended that reliable and redundant communication means and channels be secured at all times., Mr Grossi thanked the United Nations Secretary General for his support in the ISAMZ mission to help stabilize the nuclear safety and security situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-security-council-iaea-grossi-calls-establishment-nuclear-safety-and-security-protection-zone-zaporizhzhya-npp

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Aug 2022,"Introduction, As of 23 June 2022, there were an estimated 6.4 million internally displaced persons (IDP) across Ukraine as well as 5.5 million people who have returned to their settlement.1 In early April, further escalation of the conflict was reported in the eastern part of the country, causing more damage to infrastructure and disruptions in access to services in affected areas, as well as additional displacement.2 In addition, as of 3rd of August the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reported that a new expected wave of displacement before the start of the winter could increase the severity of humanitarian needs. 3 To inform humanitarian actors, REACH launched a Humanitarian Situation Monitoring initiative across conflict-affected settlements and in areas hosting IDPs. After a baseline round of data collection (‘Rapid Needs Assessment’), REACH launched a second round of data collection, focused specifically on conflict-affected areas (CAA)4 in the east and south, as well as a selection of IDP-hosting settlements along evacuation routes or in key arrival hubs. Following two additional rounds of data collection, a fifth round was launched in government-controlled areas (GCA), covering conflict-affected, IDP-hosting areas and newly liberated areas.5 The fifth round of HSM aims to provide additional information to support the clusters and increase their awareness of the most pressing needs. In addition, the findings can be used to triangulate with findings from the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) 2023 and thus contribute to building a stronger and evidence-based response. However, this round cannot be used to calculate the People In Need (PiN) per se., While the current assessment was conducted in GCA settlements, concurrent data collection was conducted in non-government-controlled areas (NGCA). The findings of that assessment can be found in a separate factsheet (available upon request).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-august-2022

In Ukraine, at least 972 children have reportedly been killed or injured, nearly 18 million people need urgent assistance. 6.9 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, are refugees in Europe., • Fighting continues in eastern and southern Ukraine. Additional displacements from these areas, the socio-economic impacts of the war and the approaching harsh winter are expected to cause a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation., • With UNICEF support in and outside Ukraine, 4.1 million children and women are accessing primary health care, 1.9 million children and caregivers have received mental health and psychosocial support, 3.6 million people have access to safe water, 1.1 million children are accessing education, 170,456 households received humanitarian cash., Ukraine, • UNICEF and partners have helped nearly 4 million people to access health care; close to 3.5 million to access safe drinking water; over 1.7 million children and caregivers to access mental health and psychosocial support; and over 760,000 children to access formal or non-formal education, including early learning., • Over 600,000 people, from households with over three children or at least one child with a disability, have received UNICEF-funded humanitarian cash transfers., Refugee Response, • UNICEF is supporting governments to ensure access to services, protection and social assistance for Ukrainian children, their families and host communities in 13 countries., • 37,332 households have received humanitarian cash transfers, over 320,000 children have accessed education, and 5.4 million people have been reached with life-saving messaging on their rights and access to critical services. 40 UNICEF/UNHCR Blue Dots are also providing integrated services for affected families, having reached at least 234,000 children and caregivers., • UNICEF is strategically engaging with national governments to strengthen systems, influence policies and scale up refugees’ access to child-centered services, including building capacity of large municipalities, aiming at reaching over 780,000 refugees in Poland alone with technical assistance for system strengthening., Funding Overview & Partnerships, In line with initial interagency appeals, 1 UNICEF is seeking US$948.9 million under its Ukraine and Refugee Response Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) published in April. This includes US$624.2 for the response inside Ukraine (Pillar 1) and US$324.7 for the refugee response in Europe (Pillar 2). In August, UNOCHA released a final revision of the Ukraine Interagency Flash Appeal, reflecting needs and plans targeting 11.5 million people in Ukraine, with an overall financial requirement of US$4.29 billion to the end of December 2022. UNHCR is currently coordinating a recalibration of the 2022 Regional Refugee Response plan, to allow partners to reprioritize sectoral activities and budgets to reflect the evolving context and response strategy. With the war continuing to have a devastating impact on children and families in Ukraine and living as refugees, UNICEF is accordingly revising its overall HAC appeal to reflect financial requirements to scale up and sustain critical services and protection assistance, including priorities like back to learning and winter-specific interventions, until the end of the year. The revised HAC will be released in September., As of 22 August, UNICEF has received US$956 million against the total HAC funding ask, US$599.3 million for Pillar 1 and US$356.7 million for Pillar 2, out of which 66 per cent is unearmarked funding.
Generous contributions have come from the people and Governments of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, the United States of America,
Vietnam, the European Commission, and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). From the development donors, Education Cannot Wait Fund have provided generous contribution to HAC-Ukraine as well. Please see information on contributions received as of 22 August here., Ongoing fundraising campaigns by UNICEF National Committees (NatComs) and country offices have generated timely, flexible support from the private sector, including from corporate partners, foundations, philanthropy partners and individual donors, with actual funds already remitted amounting to US$617.9 million for both inside Ukraine and refugeehosting countries. Private sector support2 has been unprecedented with donations from over 719 businesses, 213 philanthropy partners, 119 foundations and a large base of individual donors across over 24 countries.
For its response inside and outside Ukraine, UNICEF continues to work with governments, United Nations (UN) agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs)/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other humanitarian partners., Close consultations are also being held with Presidential advisors, key ministries, city mayors and the Ombudspersons Office. Through its long-standing presence in Ukraine, UNICEF has established partnerships in key hromadas (municipalities) and will continue to expand these in all oblasts (regions). Around 92 government and civil society partners have been engaged with UNICEF to respond to the critical needs of children and families across Ukraine. In refugee-hosting countries, UNICEF is leveraging partnerships established through long-standing country programmes and a strong network of National Committees. In the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, alongside the advocacy work of the NatComs, UNICEF has established and is scaling up operational programming and relationships with governments, municipalities and CSOs, to support their national response efforts. UNICEF is also developing new multi-country relationships with key networks, like the World Organization of the Scouts Movement (WOSM), covering the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-and-central-asia-region-ecar-and-ukraine-ukraine-and-refugee-response-six-months-consolidated-humanitarian-situation-report-24-august-2022

Ukraine: Russia’s military activities at nuclear plant risk safety in region,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Disaster Management,6 Sep 2022,"Responding to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s findings that Russia is stationing forces in the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), confirming information that Amnesty International received in August, Denis Krivosheev, Deputy Director for Research in Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia office, said:, “By occupying the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Russian forces are not only endangering those in the plant and its surroundings, but also heightening the risk of a nuclear catastrophe across the region., “By placing its forces on the territory of the plant and in its immediate vicinity, Russia bears primary responsibility for the potentially devastating consequences of a nuclear accident. Amnesty International calls for full demilitarization of the power plant and its immediate surroundings., “On top of the obvious dangers of militarizing the power plant, a local resident told Amnesty that Ukrainians, including staff who Russian forces suspect of documenting their activities near the plant, have reportedly been subjected to brutal reprisals. Some were abducted and tortured in the basement of the building previously used by the Security Service of Ukraine.”, In August, Amnesty was also informed by a local resident and a member of ZNPP staff that Russian military personnel at the plant were restricting the movement of staff and also subjecting them to intrusive personal searches. Amnesty International was not able to verify these worrying allegations from other sources. However, the IAEA findings confirm the presence of Russian troops on the plant and restrictions of staff movement., IAEA has also reported physical damage to the ZNPP’s facilities resulting from the military activities in the vicinity, including shelling. Amnesty International’s local sources said that the damage was the result of Russian forces firing mortars from occupied Ukrainian territory, allegedly to blame the Ukrainian forces. Amnesty has been unable to verify these claims but is concerned to hear that IAEA confirms the damage resulting from shelling, including on dates specifically described by our local sources., IAEA stopped short of naming either side as responsible for the shelling and has demanded that both sides cease all such military activity., Background, IAEA has published its report: Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine, 2nd Summary Report by the Director General 28 April – 5 September 2022 (ukraine-2ndsummaryreport_sept2022.pdf (iaea.org), The IAEA reported its team observed “the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places at the ZNPP, including several military trucks on the ground floor of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 turbine halls and military vehicles stationed under the overpass connecting the reactor units”.

"Human rights concerns related to forced displacement in Ukraine: Ilze Brands Kehris, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights at Security Council Open Meeting on Ukraine",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,7 Sep 2022,"DELIVERED BY
Ilze Brands Kehris, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, AT
Security Council Open Meeting on Ukraine, Mr. President,, The armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which began on 24 February 2022, has resulted in the mass forced displacement of civilians in Ukraine. Some 7 million people are internally displaced in Ukraine, and millions more have sought refuge outside of the country., Intense hostilities, including large-scale destruction of critical civilian infrastructure and housing, have forced many people to flee their homes. Human rights violations in territory occupied by the Russian Federation, or controlled by affiliated armed groups, have also caused people to flee., These conditions have led to a situation in which those fleeing danger often felt compelled to evacuate in whichever direction was possible, irrespective of their preferences. Our Office has documented a significant number of cases of civilians who were displaced to the Russian Federation, including about a dozen cases where members of the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups ordered civilians in Mariupol to leave their homes or shelters, and brought them to territory in Ukraine under their control, or to the Russian Federation., Once displaced in the territory of the Russian Federation, in the cases documented by OHCHR, civilians have had freedom of movement. Many Ukrainians have chosen to either travel onward to other countries or to return to Ukraine. However, those who chose to return to Ukraine were not provided with financial resources or other support to do so. For those who have been taken to remote regions of the Russian Federation, the costs of return may be particularly prohibitive. OHCHR notes that in situations where persons have been ordered by the occupying power to evacuate for their own safety, or for imperative military reasons, those who wish to return must be brought back to their homes as soon as hostilities have ceased., There have been credible allegations of forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation itself. We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families. Under Article 50 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the Russian Federation is prohibited from changing these children’s personal status, including nationality. Moreover, we are particularly concerned that the announced plans of the Russian authorities to allow the movement of children from Ukraine to families in the Russian Federation do not appear to include steps for family reunification or in other ways ensure respect for the principle of the best interests of the child., Mr. President,, Our Office has verified that Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups subject civilians to so-called ‘filtration’, a system of security checks and personal data collection. Individuals subjected to ‘filtration’ include those leaving areas of ongoing or recent hostilities, and those residing in or moving through territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Although security checks are not prohibited under international humanitarian law, we are concerned that such checks, and detentions that may follow, take place outside any legal framework and do not respect the principles of necessity and proportionality. The practice has resulted, according to credible reports received by OHCHR, in numerous human rights violations, including of the rights to liberty, security of person and privacy., In cases that our Office has documented, during ‘filtration’, Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups have subjected persons to body searches, sometimes involving forced nudity, and detailed interrogations about the personal background, family ties, political views and allegiances of the individual concerned. They examined personal belongings, including mobile devices, and gathered personal identity data, pictures and fingerprints. In some cases, those awaiting ‘filtration’ spent nights in vehicles, or in unequipped and overcrowded premises, sometimes without adequate access to food, water and sanitation. We are particularly concerned that women and girls are at risk of sexual abuse during ‘filtration’ procedures., OHCHR has documented that men and women perceived as having ties with Ukrainian armed forces or state institutions, or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views, were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance. They were transferred to penal colonies, including the now infamous penal colony near Olenivka, and pre-trial detention centers, where they were interrogated and sometimes tortured to extract a so-called ‘confession’ of their active cooperation with the Government of Ukraine. Some detainees were released after one or two months, while others remain detained as of today, with no or little information for their families about their whereabouts and fate., Our Office has been seeking access to individuals detained after failing to pass ‘filtration’, and to those who reportedly passed ‘filtration’ but were nevertheless detained and sent to a ‘centre for evacuees’ in Bezimenne, in Donetsk region, close to the border with the Russian Federation. OHCHR has not been granted access to these individuals, and is concerned that they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment while being held incommunicado., Mr. President,, Forced displacement entails great risks for civilians. It not only gravely impacts their lives, dignity and health, but also negatively affects their economic and social rights. Since 24 February, we have documented a significant deterioration in access to adequate housing, social security and livelihood opportunities for displaced persons, in particular for people and groups in vulnerable situations, including persons with disabilities, Roma people, and older persons. Many of them are staying for prolonged periods of time in degrading conditions in ill-equipped short-term shelters. We also have concerns that the deterioration of the economic situation, mass displacement and destruction of social ties have heightened risks of sexual violence and trafficking, especially for women and girls, who make up the vast majority of refugees., OHCHR is closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and the broader region, paying particular attention to groups in vulnerable situations and at higher risks of human rights violations, including trafficking. Risks of trafficking can also arise in a later phase, when people have exhausted their savings or when States reduces the scope of their protection or social assistance. Receiving States should put in place systematic protection and security measures, such as gender-based violence risk mitigation with elements of prevention, reporting and services for survivors of violence, including trafficking and other forms of exploitation., Members of the Council,, We urge the Russian Federation to grant unimpeded and confidential access to our Office and other independent international monitors to all places of detention under their control, notably to places where people who underwent ‘filtration’ are being detained. The Russian Federation is also called upon to provide representatives of international human rights and humanitarian organizations with unhindered, timely and safe access to persons from conflict-affected areas of Ukraine that are now in the Russian Federation or in areas of Ukraine occupied by the Russian Federation., Lastly, we urge the international community to continue supporting citizens and residents of Ukraine who had to flee their home., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-concerns-related-forced-displacement-ukraine-ilze-brands-kehris-assistant-secretary-general-human-rights-security-council-open-meeting-ukraine
"Zaporizhzhia Plant Must Have Security Protection Zone Around It to Avoid Nuclear Catastrophe, International Atomic Energy Agency Director Warns Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Disaster Management,6 Sep 2022,"SC/15020, 9124TH MEETING (PM), The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called today for the creation of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the embattled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, warning the Security Council of a potential catastrophe should the facility sustain further physical assault amid reports of shelling., “We are playing with fire,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned, as he outlined the findings from the newly released report on the IAEA’s “historic” Mission to Zaporizhzhia last week to assess the conditions — a visit that resulted from “painstaking” efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months., Laying out the issues in stark terms, Mr. Grossi said the physical attacks sustained by the facility — and that he personally assessed — are simply unacceptable. Operators are working under “extremely challenging” circumstances. Military vehicles and equipment inside nuclear buildings must be removed so as not to interfere with the normal operations of the nuclear safety and security system., Further, he said operating staff must be allowed to return to the plant’s routine line of authority — an issue raised “time and again” since March, when the plant first became occupied. The off-site power line redundancy must be re-established. “Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,” he stressed., He pressed all parties to ensure the effective operation of supply chains, highlighting IAEA assistance and support programmes available to help re-establish them, as they did in Chernobyl. IAEA can also help monitor radiation systems, he said, stressing that all reliable means of communications must also be restored. “We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,” he said. The report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place., In line with those remarks, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia could spell catastrophe, adding that “all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario”., As a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards or from the plant site, he said. It must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter, and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it., He trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance, he said. “All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission.”, Taking the floor first in the ensuing debate, the Russian Federation’s representative said the visit offered IAEA an opportunity to see that the only threats were those from the shelling and sabotage by Ukrainian armed forces. This was evident in the Director General’s statement of concern over the plant’s physical integrity. “It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally,” he said., Most other delegations welcomed that the Mission could finally take place and that IAEA now has an ongoing presence at Zaporizhzhia, with Germany’s delegate pointing out that his country, in its national capacity and as the Group of 7 President, was among those that pushed for the IAEA Mission to be deployed as a matter of urgency., The United States representative stressed that, despite the Russian Federation’s “song and dance”, the situation stems from that country’s 4 March seizure of the plant and conduct of military operations in its vicinity. He — like several of his counterparts — called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations and to return full control to Ukraine., Albania’s delegate wondered aloud about the motive of the Russian Federation to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country. He also questioned why that country had not agreed to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents., To that point, the United Kingdom’s representative underscored that the situation was akin to “playing roulette with nuclear safety”. Describing the pressure under which the Plant’s staff were working, she said: “They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.”, Norway’s delegate took a step further to equate the seizure of the plant with the hostage taking of an essential source of power supply. It is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine, she said., Calling for an independent, impartial investigation to establish responsibility when military activity is damaging to nuclear facilities, Gabon’s representative stressed his delegation “cannot be satisfied by half measures, given the scope of the danger”. Existing rules of nuclear security must be abided to in order to ensure that the site is safe., Mexico’s delegate urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEA’s visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine, The representative of India, meanwhile, issued calls for diplomacy, pointing to the successful export of grains from Ukraine and food and fertilizers from the Russian Federation to make her point. “Differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue,” she said., To that idea, Ukraine’s representative countered that the only way to remove the nuclear threat is for the Russian Federation to withdraw its weapons and troops, and to return the station to the full legitimate control of his country. Under no circumstance has Ukraine ever used forceful military actions in relation to the plant, he insisted. Only by strengthening sanctions and officially recognizing the Russian Federation as a terrorist State, at all levels, will the situation be corrected., Also speaking today were representatives of Brazil, Ireland, United Arab Emirates, China, Ghana, Kenya and France., The meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 4:53 p.m., Briefings, ANTONIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said the United Nations Secretariat stated his proud support for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its critical task to ensure the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Thanking all colleagues assisting in the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia, especially the 13 United Nations support and security professionals who played an essential role in the deployment of the IAEA Mission, he expressed grave concern about the situation in and around the plant, including reports of recent shelling., “Let’s tell it like it is,” he said, stressing that any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia — or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine — “could spell catastrophe”, adding that “all steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario”. Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward. Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable. All efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital., As a first step, he said Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site, emphasizing that the Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations. As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it., For their part, operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained, he continued. “Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area,” he said, expressing regret that the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons fell victim to the war in Ukraine. While its outcome document sought to address the safety and security of nuclear power plants in armed conflict zones, including in Ukraine, the Conference failed to reach consensus on how to strengthen the Treaty. Looking ahead, he trusted that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia would be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security at the plant. “All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission,” he said. “Let us commit to do everything we can to support them.”, RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presenting the Agency’s report on its visit last week to the Zaporizhzhia plant, described it as the result of “painstaking” efforts to corroborate facts observed over six months. He outlined the findings in the context of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety, noting that the first pillar involves not violating a plant’s physical integrity. “Unfortunately […] this continues to happen,” he said. The physical attacks sustained by the facility — and that he personally assessed — are simply unacceptable. “We are playing with fire,” he warned. “Something very, very catastrophic could take place.” The report thus proposes the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone, limited to the perimeter and the plant itself., He said the second safety pillar states that all safety and security systems and equipment should operate normally. However, IAEA experts observed that operators were operating under extremely challenging circumstances, together with military equipment and vehicles in various parts. The report recommends that military vehicles and equipment that are currently inside nuclear buildings should be removed so as not to interfere with the nuclear safety and security system., The third pillar states that the operating staff must do their jobs without undue pressures, he continued, an issue that has been raised “time and again” since March, when the plant was first occupied. The report recommends that the operators be allowed to return to the plant’s routine line of authority and that an appropriate work environment be established. The fourth pillar — off-site power supply — is crucially important in that a nuclear plant without external power supply may lose functionality, including for the cooling of the reactors and spent fuel. “Without this, we could have a very serious nuclear accident,” he pointed out. IAEA recommends that off-site power line redundancy be re-established and available at any time, and that all military activities be stopped immediately., He said the fifth safety pillar involves uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transport to and from the site. Explaining that the Zaporizhzhia plant is the largest in Europe, requiring a constant flow of spare parts and other equipment, he recommended that all parties contribute to ensuring effective supply chains. Through IAEA assistance and support programmes, flows of supplies had been significantly re-established at Chernobyl. A similar mechanism could be applied in Zaporizhzhia, he said., On the sixth pillar — involving radiation monitoring systems — he said IAEA equipment monitoring has been effective. The report recommends that the site continue ensuring this functionality, including through exercises that IAEA can help to perform. The seventh pillar states that there must be continued and reliable communications with the Ukrainian regulator. “We’ve seen, repeatedly, that these lines of communications have been interrupted,” he said. IAEA recommends that reliable communications means and channels be secure at all times., He described last week’s Mission as “historic”, as it allowed IAEA to undertake a neutral, technical reading of the situation. The fact that IAEA inspectors remain at the site offers enormous value for the United Nations and international community in evaluating immediate conditions on the ground. “This fact is unprecedented,” he said, explaining that IAEA visits to areas undergoing difficult circumstances, such as Fukushima, had always been done “after the fact, to pick up the pieces”. At Zaporizhzhia, by agreeing to a special safety and security protection zone, there is an opportunity to prevent certain events from happening. “We are ready to consult quickly with the parties,” he said, adding that the report is considered an interim step until longer-term measures can be put in place., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the IAEA visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant allowed the IAEA Director General and his team to personally assess the situation and make sure that the seven principles of safety are strictly adhered to by the Russian Federation. “It is important that you were able to see with your own eyes that, thanks to cooperation between ZNPP staff and the Russian armed forces protecting the station, it is functioning normally and there are no internal threats to its security,” he said. Moreover, the visit was an excellent opportunity to see that the only threats to the plant are from the shelling and sabotage from the Ukrainian armed forces. This was seen in the conclusion at the Director-General’s briefing when he said that the Agency is most concerned by the physical security and integrity of the station, the risks for which have increased due to the shelling in August. However, it was regrettable that, in the report on the safeguards implementation in Ukraine from April to September this year, the source of shelling was not directly named. While his delegation understands the Director-General’s position as head of an international regulator, in the current situation it is extremely important to call things by their name, he said., JEFFREY DELAURENTIS (United States) welcomed the Agency’s technical report and added his support for the inspectors to continue to have unhindered and safe access to the facility. The Russian Federation should let Ukraine operators carry out all measures that they deem important to operate the plant and maintain its safety, he said, stressing that the danger is enormous. He also voiced his support for Ukraine’s call for demilitarization of the area surround the facility. Calling for the Russian Federation to withdraw from Ukraine, he said that despite that country’s “song and dance”, it has no right to expose the world to unnecessary risks. The situation is a result of the Russian Federation’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and its 4 March seizure of the plant. Russian troops continue to conduct military operations around the plant, which in turn create an increased risk of a disaster. Also of concern was the disconnection of the external power line over the weekend, he noted, adding that for now, it is generating enough power to operate its cooling system. He called on the Russian Federation to end all military operations around the plant and return full control to Ukraine. Underscoring that there is no excuse for a nuclear incident, he also voiced his rejection of all attempts of the Russian Federation to take power from Ukraine’s electric grid. The Russian Federation alone is responsible for this crisis and can resolve it. It must respect the Charter and Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) welcomed IAEA’s ongoing presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant and thanked Ukraine for facilitating the Agency’s visit. The physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times. With the publication of today’s report, IAEA confirmed the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment in the plant, she said, recalling that Russian military equipment has been as close as 60 metres from the nuclear reactors. The report also confirmed the immense pressure under which the Ukrainian staff are operating. “They are no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint,” she insisted. By choosing to invade a nuclear power plant, the Russian Federation is “playing roulette with nuclear safety”, she added. Any measures to ensure nuclear safety should involve the full withdrawal of Russian troops and personnel. Stressing that the situation at Zaporizhzhia is entirely of the Russian Federation’s making, she pointed out that its invasion has disrupted facilities across Ukraine and jeopardized the safety of millions. The Russian Federation can resolve the situation by immediately withdrawing its forces from all of Ukraine and ceasing its senseless, reckless aggression., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said the Agency’s Mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant was a positive development amid a conflict in which good news has been rare. The presence of IAEA inspectors allows the international community to know the real dimension of risks to the nuclear installation’s safety. Avoiding a nuclear catastrophe must be a priority, he said, adding: “We find it extremely concerning that the physical integrity of the plant has been violated repeatedly in recent weeks.” More worrying is that the prospect that an IAEA Mission was not enough to stop the bombings. He repeated an appeal for the immediate suspension of all actions that could jeopardize the security of Zaporizhzhia before damage to the plant results in irreparable consequences to human lives, the environment and the region’s safety. Attacks on nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes violate the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the Statute of the IAEA. He reminded parties of their responsibilities under multilateral instruments, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel, and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendment., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), noting that Member States know the origin of the problem, asked: “What is the business of Russia to attack, overrun, occupy and militarize a nuclear power plant in another country? Who is responsible in the first place that there is fighting in the surroundings of the power plant? Why has Russia not answered for demilitarizing that plant, hand it over to those it belongs — Ukraine — and agree to establish a secure perimeter in order to avoid any incidents?” A clear and straightforward answer to those questions would help provide more clarity, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces and all other unauthorized personnel from the Zaporizhzhia plant, its immediate surroundings, and all of Ukraine. Voicing concern that the widespread infrastructure damage and loss of off-site electricity could damage the cooling systems and lead to a nuclear meltdown, he condemned any act of violence perpetrated inside or near the plant or against its personnel. He also called for the immediate implementation of the IAEA’s recommendation to establish a secure perimeter around that facility and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine., CAIT MORAN (Ireland) said she welcomed the Director-General’s intention to maintain an ongoing IAEA presence at the plant. Emphasizing that the Agency has a key role in helping Ukraine uphold nuclear safety and security, she expressed concern by the situation at the plant, including the ongoing military activity and shelling. She urged the Russian Federation to stop its efforts to disconnect the plant from the main Ukrainian grid, which creates a significant risk of a catastrophic radiological incident. The Director-General has again clearly laid out the importance of the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security and how these are being flouted at Zaporizhzhia, due to the Russian Federation’s actions. She called on the Russian Federation and, indeed, all States to fully commit themselves to those seven pillars, for all nuclear facilities and materials, including in situations of armed conflict. “If Russia is serious about safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, it must end its illegal occupation of the site and withdraw its troops and munitions,” she said. It is essential so Ukrainian authorities, with the IAEA, can uphold their responsibilities for safety and security at the site., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) said IAEA’s continued presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant cannot be overstated. Commending the Ukrainian staff who continue to operate the plant under occupation by Russian forces, she called on the Russian Federation to return full control to its Ukrainian operator. Safety and security conditions at Zaporizhzhia have deteriorated solely because of the Russian Federation’s aggression, she said, emphasizing that it is totally unacceptable that a nuclear plant has become a frontline in the Russian war against Ukraine. Noting that IAEA identified the urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster, she said this can be achieved through the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. She reaffirmed the importance of the seven IAEA pillars and expressed support for the Agency’s efforts to ensure their implementation in Ukraine. She also voiced particular concern over the seizure of the plant as a means of taking hostage an essential source of electricity supply for Ukraine, stressing that the power rightly belongs to the people of Ukraine. Any attempts to disconnected it from the Ukrainian grid are unacceptable. The Russian Federation’s aggression has aggravated global food insecurity, affecting the most vulnerable the hardest, she added., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India), voicing appreciation for the IAEA’s recent visit to Ukraine, said her country continues to carefully follow developments regarding the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear power reactors and facilities. The Agency’s discharge of its safeguards and monitoring activities, in accordance with its Statute in an effective, non-discriminatory and efficient manner, is of high priority to her delegation. There must be a strict mutual restraint so as not to endanger the safety and security of nuclear facilities and personnel working there. Since the beginning of the conflict, her country has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. She urged both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, voicing support for all diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. She welcomed the Secretary-General-backed initiative to open the exports of grains from Ukraine via the Black Sea and the facilitation of the exports of Russian food and fertilizers, noting that those efforts demonstrate that differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), emphasizing that the IAEA’s Mission marked a crucial first step to assessing the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, voiced his hope that this spirit of technical cooperation will be extended to all such facilities in Ukraine. Expressing concern that the plant’s physical integrity has been violated several times, he underscored the need for measures to be put in place to prevent an accident that could arise from the physical damage. The recent news that the plant was disconnected from the grid due to a fire caused by shelling is a “serious concern”, he stressed, underscoring the critical importance of de-escalation. Disruption of the external power supply could have disastrous consequences. He recalled that nuclear plants are afforded special protection under international humanitarian law; such protections must be upheld. Calling on both sides to ensure the seven IAEA pillars are respected, he expressed alarm that all seven have been compromised. Going forward, the continued presence of IAEA inspectors will remain essential, he said, calling for the cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic end to the conflict., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) voiced concern about reports of several violations to the physical integrity of the nuclear power plant and disruption in electric supply. It is crucial and urgent to restore and preserve the physical integrity of the power station, he stressed, condemning any and all use or threat to use a nuclear facility for military purposes. He called for a cessation of all military activity within or near the nuclear power plant, noting that parties to the conflict must abstain from any attack against the site. He also called for an independent and impartial investigation to establish responsibility for all military activity when it is damaging to nuclear facilities. Parties to the conflict must abide by existing rules of nuclear security and cooperate with IAEA in a transparent manner to ensure that the site is safe. “We cannot be satisfied by half measures given the scope of the danger,” he said, stressing that good-faith negotiations must continue in order to put an end to the war. He encouraged all initiatives aimed at bringing parties to the negotiating table to stop the hostilities., GENG SHUANG (China) said the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant has been nerve-wracking for the international community. Noting that the Agency’s inspectors were able to carry out an objective inspection, he said he was pleased with the positive developments. However, despite repeated warnings, the shelling has continued, even after the inspectors had arrived. “This is truly worrying,” he said. Pointing out that the Chernobyl nuclear accident has not faded into memory, he emphasized that the world cannot afford another nuclear disaster. He called on all parties to act rationally and safely and to implement the seven pillars proposed by the Agency’s Director-General. He expressed his support for the inspectors’ long-term presence and said he hoped they can provide technical and safe support. He also encouraged the Agency to maintain its communication with relevant parties. The international community should step up diplomatic efforts to help achieve a ceasefire, with all parties adopting a safe approach to jointly maintain global security., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said ensuring the smooth security and operation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is essential in order to avoid a disaster. He called for avoiding any action that risks its physical integrity and that of IAEA experts, underscoring Mexico’s confidence in their impartiality. He voiced concern that the seven pillars are not being fully respected in the area, cautioning that any attack against a nuclear installation is a violation of international law. He urged the Agency to continue sharing with the Council any relevant information, expressing hope that IAEA’s visit and permanent presence at the plant will foster early negotiations to end hostilities in Ukraine. With that, he reiterated Mexico’s commitment to do its utmost to promote a diplomatic solution to end the war., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said today’s briefing reinforced his continuing concern about the rapidly escalating risk of a radioactive exposure resulting from the militarization of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the surrounding area. After the unrelenting shellfire at the facility on 25 August, which led to a temporary loss of the main power supply to the nuclear reactors, he said he was equally concerned to learn that the plant’s main connection to the power grid was lost on Saturday due to sustained shelling. These incidents compromise the cooling and safe functioning of the plant and elevate the risks of accidental or deliberate radioactive exposure. He added his full endorsement of the IAEA’s position that, pending the conflict’s end and the re-establishment of stable conditions, interim measures will be urgently needed to prevent a nuclear accident due to physical damage caused by military action. He also welcomed the permanent presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia at the facility and urged the parties to cooperate fully with the team. It is crucial for the Russian Federation to heed international calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its forces from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine and to pave the way for meaningful engagement between the parties towards a peaceful settlement., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) said as State party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Kenya upholds the treaty’s aims: to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology; to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and to further disarmament. He expressed his deep concern regarding the fragile nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine, particularly at the Zaporizhzhia plant. He welcomed the presence of the IAEA team there and urged full support and cooperation for them. The parties concerned must exercise restraint, act with caution, refrain from any action that may compromise nuclear safety and security, and work to minimize the possibility of accidents. He called for an immediate cessation of the war through diplomatic tools to spare further suffering for the Ukrainian people and he reaffirmed Kenya’s respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/zaporizhzhia-plant-must-have-security-protection-zone-around-it-avoid-nuclear-catastrophe-international-atomic-energy-agency-director-warns-security-council
"Common Sense, Cooperation Must Guide Way Forward towards Ensuring Safety of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Secretary-General Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SG,Disaster Management,6 Sep 2022,"SG/SM/21436, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security, in New York today:, Thank you for convening this briefing on developments in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. I want to salute the courageous efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the mission led by Director-General [Rafael] Grossi. Allow me to also thank the parties for their cooperation. I will leave it to Director General Grossi to provide an overview of what he and his team observed during their stay., The United Nations Secretariat proudly supported IAEA in its critical mission to ensure the safe operation of the plant. I want to personally thank all the colleagues assisting their mission, especially the 13 United Nations support and security professionals who played an essential role to allow for the successful deployment of the IAEA mission., I remain gravely concerned about the situation in and around the Zaporizhzhia plant, including reports of recent shelling. Let’s tell it like it is: Any damage, whether intentional or not, to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia — or to any other nuclear facility in Ukraine — could spell catastrophe, not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond. All steps must be taken to avoid such a scenario., Common sense and cooperation must guide the way forward. Any action that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant is unacceptable. All efforts to re-establish the plant as purely civilian infrastructure are vital., As a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces must commit not to engage in any military activity towards the plant site or from the plant site. The Zaporizhzhia facility and its surroundings must not be a target or a platform for military operations., As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarized perimeter should be secured. Specifically, that would include a commitment by Russian forces to withdraw all military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and a commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move into it., Operators at the plant must be able to carry out their responsibilities, and communications must be maintained. Now is the time to urgently agree on concrete measures to ensure the safety of the area., Regrettably, last month, the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, fell victim to the war in Ukraine. The outcome document sought to address the issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in armed conflict zones, including in Ukraine. But, the Conference failed to reach consensus to utilize the opportunity to strengthen the Treaty. I appeal to all States to use every avenue of dialogue and diplomacy to make progress on these critical issues., Looking ahead, I trust that the IAEA experts now deployed to Zaporizhzhia will be able to carry out their work without hindrance and contribute to ensuring lasting nuclear safety and security in the plant., All of us have a stake in the success of their critical mission. Let us commit to do everything we can to support them. And let us resolve to keep working for peace in line with international law and the United Nations Charter., For information media.

"Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine: 2nd Summary Report by the Director General, 28 April – 5 September 2022",Analysis,IAEA,Disaster Management,6 Sep 2022,"A. INTRODUCTION, On 24 February 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), through its Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC), was notified by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), in its capacity as a national competent authority under the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, of the imposition of martial law on the territory of Ukraine and of an alert at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP). Since 24 February, when the IEC was activated, it has remained in regular contact with Ukrainian authorities, and closely monitors the situation at nuclear facilities as well as activities involving radioactive sources and nuclear material in Ukraine, focusing on the implications for nuclear safety, security and safeguards. The IEC also monitors the websites and social media channels of SNRIU and other relevant Ukrainian government organizations, as well as other open-source information channels. Regular updates continue to be issued to the public., On 3 March, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution on the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine, which “deplores the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine”, expresses “grave concern that the Russian Federation’s aggression is impeding the Agency from fully and safely conducting safeguards verification activities”, and “requests that the Director General and the Secretariat continue to closely monitor the situation, with a special focus on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and report to the Board on these elements, as required”.1, On 4 March, Ukraine informed the IAEA that Russian forces had taken control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (ZNPP) site., On 28 April, the IAEA’s Director General published a summary report of the situation in Ukraine regarding nuclear safety, security and safeguards of nuclear facilities and activities involving radioactive sources in Ukraine2 . The report consolidated information that the IAEA had been communicating to the public since 24 February, including actions taken by the IAEA in response to Ukraine’s request for assistance in re-establishing, as appropriate, a sound nuclear safety and security regime at its nuclear facilities and in activities involving radioactive sources.
In addition, the summary report included findings from the IAEA expert missions led by the Director General to Ukraine in March and April 2022., In brief, the Director General expressed great concern regarding the situation and impact of the military conflict at the ChNPP site and the ZNPP (with respect to operating staff, physical integrity of the facilities, nuclear safety and security systems, communication and power supply) and reiterated the importance of the seven indispensable pillars for ensuring nuclear safety and security during an armed conflict (""Seven Pillars""). The report furthermore indicated that the Khmelnytskyy NPP, Rivne NPP and South Ukraine NPP had not been directly impacted by the Russian Federation’s actions and that the SNRIU had not reported any increase in radiation levels in the off-site data monitored around the five Radon facilities that would constitute a hazard to public health or the environment. The Neutron Source installation of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology had come under significant shelling, but this had not given rise to any radiological consequences and had not resulted in the loss of the fundamental safety functions for the confinement of radioactive material. Nevertheless, it was reported that the impact on the facility’s physical protection required further assessment once conditions in the field allowed. Based on the evaluation of all safeguards relevant information available to the IAEA until April 2022, no indication of the diversion of declared nuclear material or any indication that would give rise to a proliferation concern was found.4, With the worsening nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP since April, the Director General raised concerns in his public updates that any further escalation affecting the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave radiological consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere and that renewed shelling at or near the ZNPP was deeply troubling for nuclear safety and security at the facility, and reiterated his demand that all such military activity cease., Since April, the Director General has repeatedly made efforts to lead another expert mission to Ukraine, and in particular to the ZNPP, to allow the organization to carry out important technical activities in nuclear safety, security and safeguards, and at the same time provide a stabilizing influence for the nuclear safety and security situation at the site and reduce the risk of a severe nuclear accident in Europe. To support that endeavour, the Director General met with high level officials from Ukraine and the Russian Federation., The Director General reported on the situation of the nuclear facilities in Ukraine to the United Nations Security Council in March and, subsequently, on 11 August where he briefed on the nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP and his efforts to agree on and lead an IAEA expert mission to the site as soon as possible. He provided details on how the shelling of 5 and 6 August compromised all of the Seven Pillars that he had outlined at the beginning of the conflict almost half a year ago, including those related to an NPP’s physical integrity, functioning safety and security systems, staff and external power supply. The Director General briefed the Security Council about his plans and preparations to personally lead an IAEA mission to the site as the IAEA’s presence at the plant was of paramount importance to help reduce the danger of a possible nuclear disaster there., Arriving in Ukraine on 29 August, the Director General met with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and led the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) comprising a high-level delegation and technical team to help stabilize the nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP. The ISAMZ gave the IAEA a unique opportunity to closely observe the current situation related to nuclear safety and security at the ZNPP. The continued presence of IAEA experts at the plant will help further improve and deepen the understanding of the situation., This report provides a summary of the situation in Ukraine regarding the nuclear safety, security and safeguards of nuclear facilities and activities involving radioactive sources and nuclear material in Ukraine since the first report was published. In particular, the report:, • Focuses on the events at the ZNPP and surrounding area, and the preliminary nuclear safety and security findings arising from the expert mission to the ZNPP led by the Director General in August–September;, • Reports on outcomes and findings from the second mission to the Chornobyl NPP site on nuclear safety and security that took place in May;, • Provides a detailed update on the delivery of assistance to Ukraine to support nuclear safety and security;, • Summarizes relevant aspects of the implementation of safeguards in Ukraine under the comprehensive safeguards agreement between Ukraine and the IAEA; and • Outlines the next steps including the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nuclear-safety-security-and-safeguards-ukraine-2nd-summary-report-director-general-28-april-5-september-2022
Ukraine: Briefing on the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,News and Press Release,Security Council Report,Disaster Management,6 Sep 2022,"This afternoon (6 September), the Security Council will hold an open briefing on the situation in Ukraine under the agenda item “threats to international peace and security”. The meeting, which was requested by Russia, is expected to focus on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in the city of Enerhodar. Secretary-General António Guterres and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi are expected to brief. Germany and Ukraine are expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure., This will be the Council’s third meeting on the ZNPP, following meetings on the matter on 11 and 23 August, both of which were requested by Russia. (For more information, see our 11 August and 23 August What’s in Blue stories.) The ZNPP, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, had provided 30 percent of Ukraine’s electricity prior to Russia’s invasion in February. Russian forces have had control over the ZNPP since March, while Ukrainian technicians continue to operate the facility. In recent weeks, shelling around the site—for which both Ukraine and Russia blame each other—has raised concerns about a possible catastrophe., At today’s meeting, Grossi is expected to describe the findings of the IAEA’s 1 September visit to the ZNPP. The visit by the 14-member team of IAEA experts was negotiated for several weeks, amid a lack of agreement between Russia and Ukraine on the modalities for such a visit and precarious security conditions around the plant., Speaking to reporters on 2 September, Grossi said that none of what the agency refers to as the seven pillars of nuclear safety—which include physical integrity, reliable external power, and availability of spare parts—are intact at the ZNPP. He noted that the plant’s physical integrity has been “violated several times”, adding that most of the damage to the ZNPP occurred during shelling in August. Grossi warned that the gravest risk to the ZNPP is physical damage to equipment, from shelling, that could lead to a release of radiation, adding that disruptions in external power to cool reactor cores could lead to a meltdown., The IAEA released a report today (6 September) about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation at several nuclear facilities in Ukraine, which includes an overview of the findings of the IAEA’s 1 September visit. The report determines that although the ongoing shelling around the ZNPP “has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency”, it continues to “represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance”. It calls for the immediate cessation of shelling of the site and in its vicinity and says that to facilitate the plant’s secure and safe operations, all relevant parties need to agree on the establishment of “a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP”. In the report, the IAEA expresses its readiness to start consultations with the sides on the establishment of such a protection zone., Since the 1 September visit, two IAEA experts have remained at the ZNPP as part of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia (ISAMZ). The ISAMZ will “assess the physical damage to the plant’s facilities, determine the functionality of the main and back-up safety and security systems and evaluate the staff’s working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site”, according to the IAEA. Grossi highlighted the importance of the IAEA’s continued presence at the site, noting that it will help provide an impartial assessment when issues arise at the plant. In a 3 September statement, Grossi underscored his ongoing concern about the situation at the ZNPP, while adding that the IAEA’s presence “will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilise the situation”. Grossi may reiterate these messages at today’s meeting, while emphasising the need to demilitarise the area around the ZNPP to facilitate the IAEA’s continued presence there., At today’s meeting, Grossi may also provide an update about recent security incidents at the plant. Shelling around the ZNPP has continued despite the ISAMZ’s presence, and yesterday (5 September) led to an outbreak of fire in the plant. Previous shelling has damaged the plant’s connection to four high-voltage external power lines, forcing it to rely on a lower-voltage reserve line to power the cooling equipment needed to prevent meltdowns. As a result of yesterday’s fire, the reserve power line was disconnected, leading to the plant’s disconnection from Ukraine’s national power grid. According to the IAEA, the reserve line was not damaged in the fire and will be re-connected once the fire is extinguished. It added that the “ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor”. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the fire was extinguished and when the reserve power line would be reconnected., Council members are likely to express a common position on the importance of ensuring the safety of the ZNPP. However, they will present diverging opinions about which side is responsible for instigating attacks in and around the site. The US and European Council members are expected to condemn the seizure of Ukrainian nuclear facilities by Russian forces and to call on Moscow to hand back control of the ZNPP to Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies have accused Russia of deploying heavy weaponry at the site and using it as a staging ground to launch attacks against Ukraine, knowing that the latter will not fire back out of fear of risking the integrity of the plant. Moscow has denied such allegations and blamed Kyiv for attempting to recapture the area by force—claims that Ukraine has denied., The issue of the IAEA’s presence at the ZNPP is also likely to be discussed at today’s meeting. Several members may express support for a permanent presence of the ISAMZ at the site. These members may seek further information from Grossi about the necessary security conditions to facilitate this presence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-briefing-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant
"Grim milestone reached in Ukraine: 1,000 children confirmed killed or injured",News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,6 Sep 2022,"KYIV, 6 September 2022 — The number of children confirmed killed or injured in Ukraine passed 1,000 today, a grim milestone after six months of war, Save the Children said today., Since 24 February, an average of five children have been killed or injured in Ukraine every day, according to a Save the Children analysis of verified UN data. At least 372 children have been killed and 635 children injured in the six months since the war escalated., As fighting continues across urban centres in the east and south of the country and the threat of airstrikes continues nationwide, many children are still sheltering inside buildings that are coming under attack --- those who survive are at severe risk of physical and emotional harm., The hostilities across the country have reduced some neighbourhoods into rubble, with the country estimated to be suffering US$4.5 billion worth of damage every week. More than 100,000 buildings in the country are estimated to be damaged, including more than 2,400 education facilities., Sonia Khush, Save the Children's Country Director in Ukraine, said:, ""This grim milestone marks another dark day in this senseless war. Innocent children are being injured and killed nearly every day in Ukraine., ""Ruthless violence, including the use of explosive weapons in urban areas, has taken a big toll on children over the past six months. This is on top of eight brutal years of conflict in the east of the country., ""Our teams inside Ukraine continue to witness the devastating impact this war is having on children and families who have endured more than eight years of conflict. The world must act now."", Save the Children is calling on all parties to the conflict adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, including those on proportionality and discrimination in the targeting and carrying out of operations., Inside Ukraine, Save the Children and local partners are providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, and baby and hygiene kits to displaced families., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families.

Update 98 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (5 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,5 Sep 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that a back-up power line between the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and a nearby thermal power station was deliberately disconnected today in order to extinguish a fire, but the line itself was not damaged. The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor., After the ZNPP’s connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) line was lost late on Friday, the 330 kV reserve line had been used to deliver electricity from the ZNPP to the grid. Ukraine informed IAEA that this back-up line will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished., One of the ZNPP’s six reactors continues to produce the electricity the plant requires for cooling and other nuclear safety functions. The reactor will be connected to the grid when the 330 kV line is switched on again., Also today, four IAEA experts left the ZNPP as planned after several days of essential nuclear safety, security and safeguards work. Two others are staying to maintain a continuing IAEA presence at the site, enabling the Agency to observe the situation there and provide independent assessments., The six experts arrived at the ZNPP on 1 September as part of a team led by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi that crossed the frontline to establish the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) at the plant in southern Ukraine. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., The IAEA experts on the ground have been assessing the physical damage at the ZNPP, determining the functionality of the main and back-up nuclear safety and security systems and evaluating the staff’s working conditions as well as the plant’s current emergency response capacities, among other important activities. Over the past few days, safeguards inspectors have also performed urgent safeguards activities on the site., The plant’s Ukrainian staff told the IAEA experts today that they plan to repair the 750 kV line that went down on Friday but that it would take several days to do so., A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., Over the past month, there have been numerous shelling incidents at or near the ZNPP, causing damage at the facility and raising widespread concern about the risk of a severe nuclear accident potentially jeopardizing human health and the environment. Shelling at the ZNPP on 1 September damaged an oil tank containing turbine lubrication oil, and there was renewed shelling today., Director General Grossi will on Tuesday issue a report about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine – including the findings from the mission to the ZNPP – and later the same day brief the United Nations Security Council about the mission to the plant.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-98-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-5-sep-2022

Four preschools a day damaged or destroyed in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",2 Sep 2022,"KYIV, 5 September 2022-- An average of four preschools a day have been damaged or destroyed in the war in Ukraine, putting children's early development in jeopardy as the new school year begins, Save the Children., Since the war escalated on 24 February, 822 preschools have come under attack, including 74 that have been completely destroyed, according to the Ministry of Education and Science., Parents in many parts of Ukraine are now struggling to ensure their young children's early learning needs are met while their country is at war., Darya*, 28, fled her home in eastern Ukraine with her three-year-old daughter earlier this year. Darya explained that she has felt lost playing the role of teacher while preschool is closed., ""It is very difficult for me to contribute to my children's learning process. We have been displaced from our home so all my thoughts are busy looking for work and housing,"" said Darya, whose daughter has become very withdrawn since the war escalated and does not make eye contact with other people., The war has severely reduced access to in-person learning for all students in Ukraine, with more than 2,400 education facilities from preschool to university damaged or destroyed in six months of war. Numerous other schools have been converted into shelters for displaced families., While many children in Ukraine will keep up with school through online learning, others have had to put their education on hold, especially those living in areas with active fighting and limited access to internet or devices, and those fleeing the country., Only 50% of schools in Ukraine will be open for in-person learning this September, according to the Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine. Students can return to the classroom in places where it is safe to do so and if their school has a protective structure in case of an attack. However, many schools remain closed as authorities continue to build shelters and repair damage from shelling and bombing., Save the Children is concerned that reduced early learning opportunities will take a toll on young children's futures and widen pre-existing learning gaps, impacting students in areas with active fighting the hardest., Sonia Khush, Save the Children's Country Director in Ukraine, said:, ""One of the best ways for young children to learn is through structured play. Although online preschool can be effective, you have to ensure young children are learning in a safe environment, have the opportunity to socialise with other children, and a parent or guardian is present to help guide the lessons if needed. That's not always possible for families in parts of Ukraine who are fleeing violence, have poor Internet connectivity, or have more children than they do computers., ""A child's right to quality education does not end in times of emergency. Access to safe education provides stability and protects children from harm. It also gives them a sense of normalcy, and the chance to play and have fun."", Preschool is a critical time in a child's life for growth and development and helps them build a solid foundation for their future. In times of crisis, preschool can help children cope with their grief through arts and crafts., Anna is a psychologist working at a Save the Children supported summer school in Poland for children who have fled Ukraine. She explained that she finds the best way to support displaced children is to make sure they feel heard., ""Attention is very important for them right now. Each of them comes up to me and takes my hand, says: 'Look, this is my drawing.' I only have 45 minutes for each group, but it is important for me to pay attention to every child. They really need their pain and fear to be heard now,"" said Anna., The prolonged exposure to war, stress and uncertainty can be extremely upsetting for all children and lead to a state of toxic stress, the most dangerous form of stress a child can experience. Toxic stress is caused by strong, frequent or prolonged adversity without adequate support. If left untreated, toxic stress can have a long-lasting effects on children's health and wellbeing., Khush continued*: ""*Whether children from Ukraine are learning online or offline this academic year, it must be in best interest of the child. All children must have access to a safe learning environment where they can receive a quality education and access mental health support to cope with their grief. This is why it is imperative that damaged schools in Ukraine are repaired, internally displaced families living in classrooms have alternative housing, and that all children can safely get back to school."", All children have the right to a safe education under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)., While fighting is ongoing, there are international legal obligations to take all necessary precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects, including schools and hospitals, which are protected under International Humanitarian Law. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas must be avoided as it puts children at risk of bodily harm., Inside Ukraine, Save the Children and local partners are providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, and baby and hygiene kits to displaced families., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to access education and other critical services., ENDS, Notes to Editor, As of August 13, 2022, 748 preschools have been damaged, and 74 have been completely destroyed, according to the Ministry of Education and Science., Since February 24, 2,405 education facilities have been damaged and 207 have been destroyed, according to the Ministry of Education and Science, For further enquiries please contact:, Samantha Halyk Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org, Global Media Unit GMU@savethechildren.org, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/four-preschools-day-damaged-or-destroyed-ukraine

Update 97 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (3 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Sep 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has once again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but the facility is continuing to supply electricity to the grid through a reserve line, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site today., Less than 48 hours after Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi on Thursday established the presence of the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) at the facility in southern Ukraine, the Agency’s experts were told by senior Ukrainian staff that the ZNPP’s fourth operational 750 Kilovolt (kV) power line was down. The three others were lost earlier during the conflict., However, the IAEA experts – now present at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in the middle of a war zone – also learnt that the 330/750 kV reserve line linking the facility to a nearby thermal power plant was delivering the electricity the ZNPP generates to the external grid. The same reserve line can also provide back-up power to the ZNPP if needed., In addition, plant management informed the IAEA team that one of the ZNPP’s two operating units was disconnected in the afternoon today due to grid restrictions. The same unit 5 was disconnected also on 1 September – the day of Director General Grossi’s arrival at the site – due to an internal electrical failure but it was reconnected the following day., One reactor is still operating and producing electricity both for cooling and other essential safety functions at the site and for households, factories and others through the grid. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces since early March, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., “Our team on the ground received direct, fast and reliable information about the latest significant development affecting the plant’s external power situation, as well as the operational status of the reactors. We already have a better understanding of the functionality of the reserve power line in connecting the facility to the grid. This is crucial information in assessing the overall situation there,” Director General Grossi said., “The great value of finally having the IAEA permanently present at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is already abundantly clear. It is a game changer,” he said, adding that the IAEA remained in close contact with its Ukrainian counterparts and continued to receive valuable updates about the situation from them., Friday evening’s disconnection of the 750 kV power line – which happened temporarily also on 25 August – followed renewed shelling in the area, Ukraine separately informed the IAEA., A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict. At a press conference on Friday evening after returning to Vienna, he expressed his concern about the off-site power supply situation at the ZNPP by marking this pillar half red, half yellow in a traffic light-style infographic about the plant’s safety status., Further underlining the fragile nuclear safety and security situation, there had been continued shelling of the site from 29 August up to the day before the Director General and his team arrived at the ZNPP. There was damage to the facility’s solid radioactive waste storage, the ventilation pipe of special building 1, and the ZNPP training building., At the ZNPP, the ISAMZ experts will carry out detailed and continuous work to assess the physical damage to the plant’s facilities, determine the functionality of the main and back-up safety and security systems and evaluate the staff’s working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site., “The difference between having the IAEA at the site and not having us there is like day and night. I remain gravely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant – this hasn’t changed – but the continued presence of the IAEA will be of paramount importance in helping to stabilise the situation. I’m immensely proud of the critically important and courageous work the IAEA team is now able to perform at the ZNPP,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General will early next week issue a report about the safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine including the findings from his mission to the ZNPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-97-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-3-sep-2022

Ukraine: Red Cross Committed to Addressing Challenges as Conflict Continues,News and Press Release,American Red Cross,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 Sep 2022,"Six months of conflict in Ukraine has left behind insurmountable suffering and destruction. Millions of people, many of whom are women, children, older people and those with disabilities, have fled, leaving everything behind. These families are in limbo as they try to figure out their next move — starting over in a new place or returning to uncertainty or possibly danger. During this time, Red Cross teams have been there to answer the call — providing essential humanitarian aid to those who need it most during these challenging and uncertain times., Global Red Cross Response, Around the clock, global Red Cross teams continue providing critical service to the people of Ukraine. In the past six months, the Red Cross has ensured that:, Our collective response includes the following:, Needs Remain as Conflict Continues, People are facing uncertainty as the conflict continues. The numbers are staggering — 6 million people are internally displaced; 10 million people have fled Ukraine; and 15 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. The residual effects of the conflict – mental health challenges, wage losses, family separation – impact both those who have fled and those who remain., Although there has been unimaginable suffering, we have also witnessed the true power of humanity at a time when people need it most. Across Ukraine and surrounding countries where people have fled, the global Red Cross network has been working around the clock to address the needs of those impacted. With the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and 47 National Societies rallying to support the Ukraine humanitarian crisis, it has truly been a global response. Red Cross teams have provided essential humanitarian aid, healthcare, cash and voucher assistance, water and sanitation services and even assisted with voluntary evacuations., Looking Forward and Addressing Future Challenges, Red Cross teams have helped millions of people who need it most in Ukraine, the seven bordering countries — Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, Belarus, and Russia — and 17 other countries across Europe and beyond. In the first few urgent months since the escalation, the Red Cross has focused on providing rapid relief supplies including food, clothing, and hygiene supplies; cash and voucher assistance; health and care, including mental health and psychosocial support; first aid; child-friendly spaces and protection services. As the conflict continues, Red Cross teams are now scaling up with the growing humanitarian needs with cash and voucher assistance — giving people the power and dignity to cover what they need it most., In Ukraine, health systems are buckling under the pressure and people require long term mental health support. Critical medical supplies are becoming increasingly scarce. Limited health-care capacity coupled with a lack of safe drinking water in some areas is increasing the risk of outbreaks. In neighboring countries, health systems are also struggling with the increased demand. IFRC is providing critical health, including clinics at the border, mobile health teams in Ukraine and first aid posts across several countries. It is essential that those impacted also receive early and consistent mental health support., Going forward, Red Cross teams are working to ensure that they respond to the needs of displaced people and host communities. The influx of people can put an additional strain on housing, health care, jobs and schools, which has the potential to lead to tension in host communities. Programs that promote social inclusion — including language courses and job training — can help people feel more settled in their new communities and enable them to contribute to their local economies. Additionally, providing cash assistance and supplies to host families can also help alleviate some of the additional strain placed on them., As the seasons change, Red Cross teams are preparing for the cold winter months ahead to ensure those impacted are safe and warm. With colder temperatures on the way, many of the humanitarian needs will become more pronounced. People will need warm shelter, clothing, fuel and insulation and support for additional heating costs. Red Cross teams are already planning alongside local partners and authorities to ensure we are ready to support those impacted through the winter months., As the conflict continues, more people may be forced to flee, while others may struggle to meet even their most basic needs. And even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities, homes, families and people. The Red Cross stands ready to answer the call and help the most vulnerable impacted by this crisis., Role of the American Red Cross, Since the conflict escalated in February, the American Red Cross has contributed over $53 million to Ukraine crisis relief efforts. This includes over $40 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to support the most vital humanitarian needs of those affected, including food, shelter, critical care items and first aid., The American Red Cross has also contributed $2 million to the ICRC to support their life-saving efforts within Ukraine. Additional contributions include $8.8 million to the Danish Red Cross and $1.9 million to the Romanian Red Cross for relief efforts within Ukraine to provide food and non-perishable food items, first aid kits, blankets and hygiene kits to people displaced within Ukraine., The American Red Cross has committed an additional $12.5 million to partners on the ground — including World Central Kitchen, CORE and International Medical Corps — to provide food, shelter, aid and medical supplies within Ukraine and other impacted countries., The American Red Cross has deployed 26 international crisis responders to Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania to provide humanitarian relief in support of the international Red Cross operation helping families who fled their homes. These highly trained crisis responders—who are lending skills such as information management, cash assistance programming, GIS systems, communications and crisis leadership — are supporting on-the-ground relief efforts alongside local teams, including the Polish Red Cross, Moldovan Red Cross and Romanian Red Cross., Additionally, in line with its work supporting military families, the American Red Cross has sent 50 trained staff to Europe to support emergency communication needs of U.S. military members so they can stay in touch with family members back home. The Red Cross Hero Care Network is a Congressionally-chartered program that connects service members and their families in times of need. Red Crossers are also distributing comfort kits containing hygiene items and other necessities to service members and U.S. State Department staff., Can I Volunteer or Donate Goods?, In countries around the world, Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations have their own staff and volunteers who are trained to respond to large-scale disaster operations. The American Red Cross sends highly specialized and experienced professionals with technical skills and expertise abroad only after the Red Cross or Red Crescent team requests assistance. Those not already on the Red Cross’s international disaster roster will not have the opportunity to deploy at this time. We encourage you to connect with your local Red Cross chapter for future opportunities or to visit redcross.org/volunteer for more information., While we are grateful for the outpouring of support, it’s important to know that neither the American Red Cross, nor our global Red Cross partners, are accepting the donation of in-kind goods such as food, clothing, blankets or toys at this time. These items can be difficult to manage on the ground and divert resources from our mission. Other charitable organizations are better suited to manage such donations., International Humanitarian Law, ICRC called on authorities to adhere to international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and infrastructure delivering essential services, including power and water facilities, schools and hospitals. In Ukraine, over 200 health facilities and 1,635 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC, requested protection for humanitarian action so that aid agencies can maintain access to civilians. ICRC has also called for parties to agree to terms so safe passage of civilians is possible., Protecting Red Cross Workers, The Red Cross emblem is strictly regulated under humanitarian law. In armed conflict, it may be used by medical staff and facilities, including army medics and vehicles. It may also be used by Red Cross and Red Crescent workers, vehicles, facilities and the humanitarian relief they bring. Resources for People Affected by the Conflict, The ICRC has published a list of resources for people needing urgent help in Ukraine, including medical care, evacuation support, mental health support, shelter and safety tips. The IFRC Psychosocial Center also has resources for talking to children about war. For people fleeing the war in Ukraine, the European Union (EU) lists a comprehensive guide including rights when crossing the border into an EU country, eligibility for temporary protection and applying for international protection, as well as the rights of travel inside the European Union., How to Find a Missing Loved One, If you are trying to locate or get in touch with a U.S. citizen, please contact the U.S. Department of State Overseas Citizens Services Office online or call 1-888-407-4747. However, if you are looking for a family member who is not a U.S. citizen but is located in either Ukraine or Russia, the Red Cross may be able to reconnect you through our Restoring Family Links program., In neighboring countries where Ukrainians have fled, the Red Cross is distributing SIM cards for cell phones, so people can get in touch with their loved ones. Some family members have maintained contact with each other, but the situation is rapidly changing. As of now, most have maintained their own family connections via cell phones, but it is important to note that the telecommunication systems in the region have been affected. The ICRC and Ukraine Red Cross will continue to work together to help reconnect families, despite considerable challenges on the ground., How can I learn more about the Red Cross response?, ICRC and IFRC have a comprehensive list of resources, including maps, press releases, videos, photos and stories, further expanding upon Red Cross efforts in the region. For more information about the American Red Cross support, visit redcross.org/Ukraine., About the American Red Cross:, The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to victims of disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families. The Red Cross is a nonprofit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to deliver its mission.

WHO delivers ambulances to Ukraine amid ongoing attacks against health care,News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Safety and Security",2 Sep 2022,"WHO has delivered 11 ambulances to Ukraine as part of its ongoing humanitarian efforts to save lives and reconstruct the health system in the country., More than 30 ambulances have now been donated to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine by WHO and its partners since 24 February 2022. More first aid ambulances are set to be delivered later this year., “These ambulances will save lives and go a step further in ensuring that timely access to emergency care during the war is strengthened and maintained,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, at a handover ceremony alongside the Minister of Health of Ukraine, Dr Viktor Liashko., “These ambulances ensure that first aid can reach patients who need medical transportation. As of today, WHO has verified over 500 attacks against health care in Ukraine and many of those attacks have affected the medical transport capacity of the country’s health system. Our ongoing support to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to empower health-care workers and rebuild the health-care system will continue amid the war.”, The first aid ambulances will be handed over to the Lviv Emergency Medical Service Department and will then be distributed throughout Ukraine., The Minister of Health emphasized that support from international partners is a powerful tool in sustaining the country’s entire medical system during wartime., “Emergency health-care workers are the first ones to arrive at the scene of an accident and do everything they can to save people’s lives. Thanks to modern ambulances, health-care workers not only provide timely transport for people who are injured or in critical condition from the accident scene to a medical facility, but also stabilize their condition during transport,” said Dr Liashko., “Emergency medicine centres and ambulances are also involved in the process of medical evacuation of patients overseas. This component is very important to the proper functioning of the medical system as a whole. We are grateful to WHO for its continued support for our health-care workers because every day each of us does everything in their power to save the lives of Ukrainians affected by the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.”, The donations were made possible with support from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund and allocated through WHO., WHO has delivered more than 1300 metric tonnes of life-saving medical supplies to Ukraine since the war began. Deliveries include power generators, ambulances and oxygen supplies for medical facilities; supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries; and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases., Media Contacts

Treating diabetes: WHO delivers insulin to hospitals in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,1 Sep 2022,"WHO has delivered more than 26 metric tonnes of insulin pens to hospitals throughout Ukraine in an effort to ensure that people with living diabetes can improve their quality of life., It is estimated that over 9% of the population in Ukraine is living with diabetes mellitus, a condition that can cause costly and debilitating complications including heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness and lower-limb amputations if untreated., “Access to insulin can save lives and prevent the development of disabling complications,” explained Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. “WHO is stepping up its efforts with the Ministry of Health to respond to mounting health needs throughout Ukraine. It is vital that access to insulin and other medicines is made available during these challenging times, as the coming months could test Ukraine’s health system as never before.”, More than 370 000 insulin pens are being disseminated to hospitals in the Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Rivne, Ternopil, Volyn, Zakarpattya and Zaporizhzhia regions. The donations were made possible with support from the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and the nongovernmental organization Direct Relief., Supplying medical facilities and pharmacies with insulin requires a well functioning logistics system to comply with the necessary storage and transportation conditions, in particular the cold chain. WHO is making every effort to provide vital insulin as soon as possible and in full to all patients, including children, who need this therapy., Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death globally.

500 Reported Attacks on Health Care in Ukraine a “Colossal Tragedy that Calls for Accountability”: PHR,News and Press Release,Physicians for Human Rights,"Health
Safety and Security",2 Sep 2022,"At least 500 attacks on health care have been perpetrated during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Surpassing this grim milestone in just over six months of conflict underscores how the Russian government has targeted Ukraine's health system as a strategy of war, as it has done in Syria, and that Russia must be held accountable for its violations of international law, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) said today., ""Ukrainian medics are under siege, targeted for doing their jobs of providing impartial health care. 503 reported attacks on health care in just over six months marks a colossal tragedy that calls out for justice and accountability,"" said Christian De Vos, JD, PhD, director of research and investigations at PHR., The WHO's System for Surveillance on Attacks on Health Care (SSA) includes incidents of violence and obstruction that impact health facilities, health professionals, patients, health transports, and medical supplies. As of September 2, the WHO reports:, ""A single attack on health care is unacceptable and demands accountability. An average of several attacks per day -- every single day since February 24 -- represents a scale and pattern of carnage unseen anywhere else in the world this year,"" said De Vos., ""After evading responsibility for its extensively--documented violence against health care in Syria, Russia has extended its brutal practices of bombing hospitals, detaining health workers, and terrorizing civilians by cutting off access to health care in Ukraine. All avenues -- both domestic and international -- must be pursued to prosecute those responsible for such attacks. We also call on the Russian government to immediately release all detained health workers, in line with its obligations under the Geneva Convention. We urge world leaders not to forget the barbarity being endured by health workers in Ukraine, as well as by their medical colleagues who are also under fire in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Syria, and beyond,"" said De Vos., ""Destruction of medical facilities and attacks on medical personnel has been a distinct strategy of Russian warfare to destabilize Ukraine's healthcare system,"" said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, co-founder at Ukrainian Healthcare Center (UHC) and Ukraine's former Deputy Minister of Health (2016-2019). ""Prosecution of these crimes against healthcare should be prioritized at the international and national levels. Apart from building standalone cases dedicated to attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel, investigating bodies should consider making a case on the systematic pattern of terror against the civilian population involving massive attacks on healthcare facilities."", Alongside its Ukraine-based partners, UHC and Truth Hounds, PHR submitted a statement to the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) for its 51st session in September, calling on member states to uphold their obligations to prevent and seek accountability for human rights violations in Ukraine, including attacks on health care, under UN Security Council Resolution 2286 (2016)., PHR is working to support health professionals in Ukraine to document and call attention to attacks on health care in the country. PHR is also making resources available to advance accountability for war crimes and other violations of the Geneva Conventions in Ukraine, including guidance on medical impartiality, forensic photography, how to obtain meaningful informed consent for a forensic evaluation for sexual assault, chemical warfare agent identification, and recognition and treatment of chlorine gas exposure., In Syria, PHR has systematically documented 601 attacks on 400 medical facilities, the killing of at least 942 health workers, as well as the blocking of access to medical care and supplies since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. Approximately 90% of these attacks were perpetrated by the Syrian government and/or its Russian allies.
""Impunity for Russian war crimes perpetuates ongoing atrocity crimes in Ukraine. However, the reaction of the international humanitarian organizations has been irresolute and weak. We call on the WHO and its Member States to ensure swift political and institutional action toward the Russian Federation as an aggressor and suspected perpetrator in the massive attacks on health facilities in Ukraine,"" said Kovtoniuk., ""From Tigray to Ukraine to Syria, violence against health care is a vastly underreported global crisis. The WHO, its Member States, and NGOs must continue to work together to strengthen data collection and ensure timely, credible, and detailed information about attacks on health care, including sharing data where security considerations permit and identifying perpetrators of attacks if they are known.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",2 Sep 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Security conditions in the east and south continued to worsen, prompting authorities to extend mandatory evacuations to parts of Kharkivska, Mykolaivska and Zaporizka oblasts., According to IOM, 330,000 people were newly displaced inside the country in the last month. Most newly displaced Ukrainians come from the east and south of the country., Closer to the front line, a humanitarian base of the Ukraine Red Cross Society sustained severe damages as a result of an attack on Sloviansk in eastern Donetska oblast., The area close to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant was again affected by hostilities. Meanwhile,
IAEA announced on 29 August that its expert mission was on its way., Despite the worsening security situation and persistent access constraints, the humanitarian community has reached 12.7 million people., ANALYSIS, General security and humanitarian situation, The war in Ukraine was marked during the reporting period by ongoing hostilities, worsening humanitarian conditions and increased displacement in the east and south of the country, deadly missile strikes elsewhere, the launch of the mission to Zaporizhzhia by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the start of the new school year both in person and online, the first field mission by the new Humanitarian Coordinator, and the successful deployment of two more humanitarian convoys to Donetska and Mykolaivska oblasts. Besides civilians continuing to be injured and killed daily and civilian infrastructure being damaged and destroyed, the need to help millions of Ukrainians prepare for the coming winter is becoming more and more acute.
The heaviest fighting continued to be reported in the eastern Donetska oblast, where at least 65 civilian casualties were recorded in both Government-controlled areas (GCA) and non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) over the weekend of 26-28 August. The Government-controlled cities of Bakhmut, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were reportedly significantly impacted.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) condemned the reported shelling of its former base in Sloviansk on 29 August – which damaged the premises and vehicles belonging to a Ukrainian Red Cross Society evacuation team – writing that “the ICRC stands with the Ukraine Red Cross Society to reaffirm the importance of protection of civilians, humanitarians, health workers and facilities.” In NGCA of the oblast, most civilian casualties and damage to civilian buildings and infrastructure were reported in the front-line cities of Donetsk, Horlivka and Makiivka. Also in the east, a dozen civilian casualties were reported on 30 August due to more-intense shelling in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The authorities reported shelling and casualties across Kharkivska oblast.
Elsewhere, Mykolaiv and the southern Mykolaivska oblast also continued to suffer daily attacks, and missile strikes reportedly killed two civilians and injured another 24 in the city on 29 August. There was no repeat this week of the kind of single deadly incident like the missile strike at and around a train station in Chaplyne in the central Dnipropetrovska oblast on 24 August that reportedly killed 25 people and injured 31 more. But there were more strikes there and in other oblasts.
There was an intensification of hostilities in the south-eastern Zaporizka oblast. There were reports of civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled settlement of Kamianka on 26 August and then reportedly in the Government-controlled town of Orikhiv on 28 August, as well as the reported regular shelling of front-line towns, including Huliaipole and Kamianske, and missile strikes on the administrative centre, Zaporizhzhia. At the same time, there continued to be reports of military activity and shelling at and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), located in the city of Enerhodar in NGCA of the oblast. The United Nations has been calling for the demilitarization of the area and access for IAEA inspectors, who had not been able to visit the plant since the war began. On 29 August, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi announced that “the day has come, IAEA’s Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia is now on its way,” and that he would be leading the mission to ZNPP later in the week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-2-sep-2022-enukru

Government approves SEK 500 million to Ukraine for reconstruction and humanitarian support,News and Press Release,Govt. Sweden,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",2 Sep 2022,"The Government has approved another SEK 500 million to support Ukraine in accordance with what the Prime Minister told Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs when he visited Stockholm on 29 August. The funds will be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine, humanitarian procurements and transport of Ukrainian wheat., “Sweden has supported Ukraine for many years – from the time of its independence to February this year, this support has amounted to approximately SEK 4 billion. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion on 24 February, that support has been more than doubled through a number of decisions concerning another SEK 5.2 billion thus far for military support, humanitarian support, financial guarantees, reform support, civilian operations and reconstruction support,” says Minister for Foreign Affairs Ann Linde., Following this decision, Sweden will provide increased support for the impending reconstruction process, including sustainable management of destroyed infrastructure. Sweden will also be responsible for coordinating waste management and recycling during the reconstruction of Ukraine – a request made by President Zelenskyy when Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson visited Kyiv in July., In addition, Sweden will help with procurement funding and the delivery of Ukrainian wheat to countries most at risk of widespread starvation. The initiative aims at supporting the country’s economy – and thus its independence – and the implementation of the agreement regarding the export of Ukrainian grain from ports in the Black Sea. Sweden will cover the costs for the purchase of at least 40 000 tonnes of wheat that will be transported by sea from Ukraine., “By purchasing 40 000 tonnes of wheat and then shipping it, Sweden is helping to mitigate the already great human suffering that Russia’s aggression has exacerbated for millions of people who suffer from hunger in other parts of the world. This will reduce the acute risk of starvation. It will also strengthen Ukraine’s economy and its independence,” says Minister for Development Cooperation Matilda Ernkrans., Ukraine was a crucial exporter of grain before Russia’s invasion. Millions of tonnes of grain are currently stuck in Ukraine following the invasion, which has had a serious impact on Ukraine’s economy and the already acute hunger crisis in the world. Fifty million people in 45 countries are already on the brink of starvation. In July, Ukraine and Russia agreed to resume grain exports from ports in the Black Sea., The purchase and transport of Ukrainian wheat will take place via the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and be delivered to countries that are most at risk of starvation, such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Yemen. Since the agreement was made, the WFP has made one delivery of Ukrainian grain on humanitarian grounds. Thanks to this decision, further transports will now be possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/government-approves-sek-500-million-ukraine-reconstruction-and-humanitarian-support

Temperatures are expected to start dropping in October and reach their lowest in January–February (Weather Atlas accessed 14/07/2022). The conflict resulting from the Russian invasion that began on 24 February 2022 has damaged homes, as well as gas, electricity, and heating infrastructure, putting additional people at risk of having insufficient heating or insulation to deal with harsh winter conditions. The situation is particularly concerning for IDPs living in collective centres and people living in damaged homes or homes needing renovation, especially in rural areas., Winter conditions will also affect humanitarian access. Snow and ice on the roads make travel challenging and unpredictable, especially away from the main highways. This issue is particularly a concern in areas with mine and unexploded ordnance contamination, as slipping off the road could mean landing in a contaminated field., On 30 July, President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the remaining population in government-controlled areas of Donetsk oblast to evacuate, in part because of damages to households and interrupted gas, electricity, and water supplies heightening the danger of facing a winter season without the ability to keep warm (BBC 31/07/2022). The intensity of the conflict and the extensive damages to water and gas infrastructure mean that it would be impossible to guarantee service during winter (OCHA 29/07/2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-ukraine-overview-winterisation-needs-and-response-29-august-2022

I am meeting communities affected by the international armed conflict to hear for myself how we can best help. Together with the ICRC team here, I am also taking stock of our humanitarian response over the last six months – which builds on our sustained work in Ukraine since 2014, in Donetsk and Luhansk., This week alone, the base of the Ukrainian Red Cross in Sloviansk was hit and severely damaged, which is totally unacceptable and reminds us of the high cost of urban warfare on civilians and infrastructure., I want to express my concern about the fighting in or near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. It is encouraging that a team from the IAEA is now on its way to Zaporizhzhia to inspect the damage, because the stakes are immense. When hazardous sites become battlegrounds, the consequences for millions of people and the environment can be catastrophic and last many years. In the event of a nuclear leak, it will be difficult if not impossible to provide humanitarian assistance. It is therefore time to stop playing with fire and instead take concrete measures to protect this facility, and others like it, from military operations. The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation that we will regret for decades., Next, I’d like to give you some details about our direct support to people in Ukraine:, Together with the Ukrainian Red Cross and other Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners, the ICRC has massively increased its humanitarian operations since 24 February. The scale of the Movement response in Ukraine and neighboring countries is unprecedented. I would like to highlight three areas in particular:, In a joint program with the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, we have provided some 300,000 people with cash totaling 1.5 billion Ukrainian hryvnia (roughly $40 million). This financial assistance goes to people who need it most, such as single household families, people with conflict-related injuries or people with disabilities., Working with local water authorities, we have provided over 9 million people with improved access to clean and drinkable water., And over 700’000 vulnerable people now have improved access to healthcare., We work hand-in-hand with the Ukrainian Red Cross, and I cannot praise them enough. In the most challenging conditions, their work is simply impressive. Working closely with local and national authorities, the staff of our respective organizations, as well as the many Ukrainian Red Cross volunteers, have helped communities throughout the country, from delivering first-aid training in bomb shelters to providing food to displaced people., But this support covers only a fraction of the needs our teams on the ground witness every day. Together with our partners, we will continue to respond as best as we can., I’d like to say a few words about the very important issue of prisoners of war:, To date we have only been able to visit hundreds of prisoners of war on both sides. And we know there are thousands more we still need access to. We will keep demanding access to all POWs, guided by our humanitarian commitment and our mandate under the Geneva Conventions., It has now been one month since the outrageous attack on the Olenivka penal facility. Despite intense negotiations behind-the-scenes, the ICRC has not yet been given the necessary guarantees to visit the POWs and check their conditions. We are working hard to change that., Yesterday, I met with families of prisoners of war, who in some cases have not heard news of their loved ones in months. I was deeply moved by their words, their emotions and the stories they shared. The importance of the ICRC’s role to reconnect separated families has never been clearer to me. Since February, we have provided more than 3,000 families with news of their loved ones. This work gives families hope and is an absolute humanitarian imperative., I share the frustrations of those families who wait in anguish with no news at all. Families have the right to know about the fate of their loved ones, whether they are alive, wounded or dead. Many have waited anxiously for six long months, and they need answers today. They are impatient, as we are., As the ICRC’s director-general, I reaffirm now to all families of POWs, our total and unwavering commitment: The ICRC will not stop pushing with persistence and determination for access to and information about your loved ones. This demand is urgent and non-negotiable., Access to POWs means we can monitor and request improvement to their conditions and treatment. It allows us to help them stay in touch with their loved ones. One example: We recently facilitated the transport of more than a thousand letters from servicemen in captivity from Russia to Ukraine, where they will be handed to their families by the National Information Bureau., Both Ukraine and Russia have legal obligations under the 3rd Geneva Convention to facilitate this essential work. But more than an obligation, it is the right thing -- the ethical thing -- to do. And it benefits both sides., I know people have questions about the ICRC’s role in Ukraine and I believe it’s important to be clear about what we can and cannot do as an organization., We cannot enforce the rules applicable in this or in any armed conflict. That is the responsibility of the parties, especially in an international armed conflict, including in occupied territory. Whether they like it or not, the onus is on the warring parties to stick to the rules they agreed to., The ICRC, as a humanitarian organization, has no way to force governments and militaries to act. We don’t have weapons. We are not politicians., In the case of the Azovstal plant, ICRC facilitated the safe passage of combatants out of the plant, in coordination with the parties to the armed conflict. Given that they were then POWs in the hands of the adversary, we registered their information on the understanding that the ICRC would later be allowed to visit them. But we cannot guarantee the safety of the POWs once in the adversary’s hands, because it is simply not within our power to do so., We do want it known that outside the public spotlight we raise issues with the parties, and we do so in a direct and uncompromising way. We also continuously offer our support as a neutral intermediary to facilitate agreements of humanitarian nature between the parties. In line with our mandate and working modalities, we do all this in a bilateral and confidential manner. The impact of that work is not always visible, and progress can take time. Our confidentiality is not unconditional. We do speak out publicly when the bilateral approach doesn’t work and when we believe this to be in the best interests of people affected by armed conflict. But first we focus our efforts on our dialogue with the parties. Experience shows us this approach bears fruit., Finally, before I open for questions, I want to reiterate just how deadly these last six months have been for civilians and devastating to essential civilian infrastructure. Hospitals, shopping malls, schools, bridges, apartments, train stations and homes have been damaged or destroyed on countless occasions. Fighting has damaged water, power and gas supply systems, medical facilities, and schools. It is particularly painful for the many children who today don't have a school to go back to., This underscores the inherent risks of urban fighting. The use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area against military targets in populated areas may violate international humanitarian law, which prohibits indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. I have seen for myself the dire and long-term consequences of such fighting in cities like Aleppo, Saada, and Mosul. Attacks on civilian infrastructure and essential services have a crippling effect on civilian life and objects. In Ukraine today, they must stop., This is why international humanitarian law exists. It lays down the rules applicable in international armed conflicts that protect us now and the generations that succeed us. More than simply rules, the Geneva Conventions are expressions of our common humanity and are the ultimate safety net for dignity in the midst of the devastation of armed conflict. We will continue to support their implementation and we will continue pushing with determination and resolve for these values to be upheld., Thank you / Djakouyou, There may be some minor discrepancies between written and delivered versions., For enquiries contact press@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icrc-director-general-ukraine-concern-over-nuclear-plant-situation-and-access-prisoners-war
"Displacement in Ukraine Again on the Rise, IOM Data Shows",News and Press Release,IOM,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",30 Aug 2022,"Kyiv – Six months into the war in Ukraine, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) has risen again to 6.9 million people as of 23 August. According to the latest survey by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), most of over 300,000 new displacements since July occurred in the south and east of the country., “The war shows no signs of abating. Protracted internal displacement generates growing needs and vulnerabilities,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine. “Increasing needs require further commitment and support from humanitarian organizations. Aid must be able to reach all those in need, including those in hard-to-reach areas.”, Nearly half (44 per cent) of displaced persons of working age are currently not earning any money. Only one third indicated a salary as their primary source of income following displacement, while 24 per cent rely on state support. As a result, most displaced households have resorted to measures such as cutting expenditures (70 per cent), including food, while one third of them have taken on new debt., With the fall and winter season approaching, the living conditions of IDPs are particularly alarming. Twenty-two per cent of displaced persons surveyed by IOM said their current housing is inadequate for the harsh Ukrainian winter, and over a third of those are unable to relocate to appropriate lodging – mainly due to the lack of funds. Among displaced persons living in villages (an estimated 2 million overall), 30 per cent have no access to medical services., The most pressing needs are the same across Ukraine: cash, medicine, and building and reconstruction materials. Approximately, 60 per cent of displaced persons, returnees and those who have not left their homes identified cash as needed, while medicine (7 per cent) and building and reconstruction materials (7 per cent), were predominantly requested by returnees and non-displaced communities., In addition to producing accurate, regular data on needs in support of evidence-based humanitarian action, IOM provides crucial humanitarian aid to displaced and war-affected communities in Ukraine. Almost 800,000 humanitarian services have been delivered by IOM since 24 February. IOM’s winterization programming is well under way and includes rehabilitation of critical infrastructure, including collective centres, repair and insulation of homes, and distribution of winter-related items such as heaters, solid fuels, winter clothing and other emergency items to help families cope with harsh and cold weather conditions. IOM’s cash interventions will empower affected populations to address their most urgent needs during the cold season in a flexible way., For more information, please contact:, In Ukraine:, Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, +38 067 447 97 92, Jorge Galindo, jgalindo@iom.int, +38 093 631 92 60, In Vienna:, Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int, +43 660 377 64 04, In Geneva:, Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int, +41 794 035 526",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/displacement-ukraine-again-rise-iom-data-shows
Start of an uncertain school year for four million schoolchildren in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",1 Sep 2022,"UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell meets schoolchildren, parents and teachers scarred by war, concluding a three-day visit across the country, KYIV/NEW YORK, 1 September 2022 – The ongoing war in Ukraine has marred the start of a new school year for Ukraine’s four million schoolchildren, stated UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell as she concluded a three-day visit across the country., “The new school year should be a time of excitement and promise, as children re-enter the classroom and share stories of their summer with friends and teachers,” said Russell. “Yet, for four million children in Ukraine, the mood is one of trepidation. Children are returning to schools - many of which have been damaged during the war – with stories of destruction, uncertain if their teachers and friends will be there to welcome them. Many parents are hesitating to send their children to school, not knowing if they will be safe.”, Thousands of schools across the country have been damaged or destroyed, with less than 60 per cent of schools deemed safe and eligible to reopen by the Government. On the first day of Ukraine’s academic year, Russell visited a rehabilitated primary school damaged during the early weeks of war. Only 300 students can attend at any one time due to the capacity of the school’s bomb shelter, a mere 14 per cent of the school’s pre-war capacity., UNICEF is working with the Government to help get Ukraine’s children back to learning, in classrooms when it is deemed safe, and through online or community-based alternatives if in-person is not possible. Some 760,000 children have received formal or non-formal education since the war began. More than 1.7 million children and caregivers have benefited from UNICEF-supported mental health and psychosocial support interventions., “Schools in Ukraine are desperate for resources to build bomb shelters instead of playgrounds, with children being taught about unexploded ordinances instead of road safety,” added Russell. “This is the stark reality for Ukrainian students, parents and teachers.”, Efforts to get children back to learning include rehabilitating schools, providing laptops, tablets and supplies to teachers and students, and guiding children and teachers on how to say safe during a time of war., “Education for the children of Ukraine has been dramatically compromised. After more than two years of the COVID-19 pandemic and six months since the escalation of the war, their physical and mental health is under enormous strain. More must be done to address what for many has been a sad reality,” said Russell., While schoolchildren in Ukraine face imminent ongoing threats to their lives and wellbeing, refugee children face other challenges. As of 31 July 2022, an estimated 650,000 Ukrainian children living as refugees in 12 host countries were still not enrolled in national education systems. UNICEF has supported nearly half of them with formal or non-formal education and is working with governments and partners to make sure that Ukrainian refugee children are either enrolled in schools or have access to online learning., Across Ukraine, UNICEF has reached an additional 616,000 people, including the most vulnerable families, with humanitarian cash transfers. Donors have been incredibly generous, but with winter coming, the worry is that needs could outpace resources., “Unless there is peace, the lives of children and their families in Ukraine are going to get even more challenging as winter approaches,” said Russell. “We know freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls are just months away, which is why UNICEF is working with the government and partners to preposition winter supplies, including warm clothing, shoes, generators, heaters and wood pellets.”, Executive Director Russell also met with the First Lady Olena Zelenska, complementing the efforts of the Ukrainian people – including teachers, parents, and healthcare workers - and expressed gratitude for the long-standing partnership between the Government of Ukraine and UNICEF. She also discussed means of further strengthening the joint response to the humanitarian crisis and the importance of having safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian access to all children in need of life-saving support in accordance with international humanitarian law., Media contacts Nina Sorokopud UNICEF Ukraine Tel: +380 50 388 2951 Email: nsorokopud@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/start-uncertain-school-year-four-million-schoolchildren-ukraine

The revised Flash Appeal identifies urgent humanitarian needs to be addressed by end of 2022., This First Standard Allocation of the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund of up to $70 million will kick-start prioritized activities under the revised Flash Appeal including time-critical winterization assistance. The allocation aims at providing targeted multisectoral support to internally displaced persons (IDPs) including evacuees, returnees and other conflict-affected people residing in the areas directly impacted by the military hostilities, including areas outside of Government control and newly accessible areas in Ukraine. In particular, the allocation will aim at supporting people with disabilities, elderly and vulnerable women in areas with high concentration of IDPs, including areas where people are expected to move during the winter months, areas with high concentration of returnees, hard to reach areas including non-government-controlled areas (NGCA)., The allocation will continue to pursue UHF’s commitment on localization through promoting participation and capacity strengthening of national and local partners, including small civil society organizations (CSOs), communitybased organizations (CBOs), volunteer groups, organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) and women-led and women’s rights organizations with access to hard-to-reach locations and ability to deliver contextually relevant assistance. In addition, the allocation will promote cross-cutting priorities including gender and age considerations, disability inclusion, protection mainstreaming, and accountability in all partner programming.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-2022-first-standard-allocation-strategy-1-september-2022-enuk

The analysis is based on recent highresolution satellite imagery (acquired on 22 May, 2022) and data obtained from the Karta Ruynuvan (""Map of Destructions"", open source damage monitoring project) (reflective of the situation as of 23 July, 2022)., In total, 137 non-residential facilities were found to be damaged in Kyivskyi District, 54 in Shevchenkivskyi District and 36 in Saltivskyi District. It should be noted that only 23 of the identified facilities, all of which were located in Saltivskyi District, were found through using satellite imagery. The other 13 detected damaged structures are derived from the Karta Ruynuvan. This highlights the main limitation of using satellite imagery to estimate damage extent; the ability to discern damaged infrastructure from satellite imagery strongly depends on the type of damage (i.e., it is only possible to detect damage that is visible from above, such as damage to roofs and exterior walls), as well as the temporal availability of such data., Most of the detected damaged infrastructure in Saltivskyi and Shevchenkivskyi Districts consists of grocery shops, pharmacies, and other small facilities rather than larger objects such as schools or hospitals. In Kyivskyi, on the other hand, analysis indicates that 22 educational facilities (of 86 in total in District) were damaged.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-infrastructure-and-facilities-damage-analysis-summary-northern-districts-kharkiv-february-may-july-2022-v1

Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",22 Aug 2022,"Six months have passed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These six months have brought hard times full of suffering for Ukrainians, but at the same time, we have seen great public generosity. As a result of this generosity, we have been able to help more than 330,000 Ukrainians. We can help Ukrainians prepare for winter and the return of the school year and provide them with psychosocial support. In addition to our humanitarian work, we also focus on human rights—we support ten independent media outlets and have helped around 400 activists move to safety., Despite heavy casualties, Ukrainians have not given up and continue to bravely resist Russian aggression. Symbolically, the six-month anniversary of the war falls on Ukraine's Independence Day. This date marks the country’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and it is the most important national holiday for Ukrainians., ""Since 2014, when the war in Ukraine began, Independence Day has become another symbol for Ukrainians of pro-European aspirations and defiance of the past. This year, with thousands of Ukrainians dying at the front and in their homes, and millions of people becoming refugees in their own country or in neighbouring countries, the 31st anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine is a symbol that Ukraine endures,"" says Nadia Ivanova, our director of Centre for Human Rights and Democracy., We organise retreats for human rights organisations and support Ukrainian media and NGOs. We have brought over 400 activists to safety., At the end of February and the beginning of March, we relocated some 400 foreign activists to safe countries. These activists had fled from oppression in their own countries and settled in the vicinity of Kyiv, which was under daily shelling. We dispatched ten buses from Kyiv, thus bringing to safety those who would have been at risk of ill-treatment by Russian secret services if captured. Furthermore, we have supported the creation of two new centres to provide safe accommodation for relocated activists., Activists and volunteers have had to respond with similar agility to the rapidly changing situation in Ukraine. Many of them have worked almost without rest since February., ""Some are on the verge of burnout, some even on the verge of collapse. So, the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy is now organising recovery retreats for these activists in safe conditions, where they work privately or as teams with psychologists and receive the help they need,"" says Ondřej Lukáš, media coordinator at our Centre for Human Rights and Democracy., Since the invasion, we have financially supported 10 Ukrainian media outlets whose advertising revenues dropped to virtually zero after the invasion. We recognised that there was a need to provide financial income for editors., ""Supporting independent media is important to us as an organisation founded mostly by journalists. Financial support for independent journalists in a warring country like Ukraine is important first of all so that we, as the international community, know the truth about what is happening and can contribute to the punishment of war crimes,"" adds Nadia Ivanova, deputy director of Centre for Human Rights and Democracy., We have co-financed an exit session for Ukrainian journalists in Latvia and financially covered an exit session for the NGO Triangle and individual psychological consultations for activists. We have also financially supported organisations that are retraining psychologists., We have financially supported four NGOs mapping Russian war crimes, We have supported the 5 AM Coalition, a consortium of thirty human rights organisations dedicated to protecting the victims of Russian aggression in Ukraine and documenting crimes committed by Russian forces. This activity aims to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity., We have also supported events in Vienna and The Hague organised by the Media Initiative for Human Rights, which advocates for war victims. We are also working with the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union (UHHRU), the Kharkiv Human Rights Group, and the Legal Development Network (LDN), which monitor war crimes, violations of humanitarian law, general human rights violations, as well as human rights violations with a particular focus on vulnerable groups (children, seniors, minorities, women, etc.). These organisations produce professionally documented material for national and international institutions, which can then be used to punish crimes where appropriate. They also provide legal and psychological support to victims., The great wave of aid brings significant challenges, Over the past six months, we have assisted 330,000 people affected by the war. We started by sending humanitarian trains and trucks to places where people were cut off from the basic necessities of life. In Ukraine, our team has expanded to 200 colleagues. Where markets function or have recovered, we began distributing cash as soon as possible. Inside the country, we operate a helpline where a team of ten psychologists receives dozens of calls a day. We are helping to repair damaged houses to prepare war victims for the Ukrainian winter., ""It is with great admiration and, of course, with joy and a sense of great responsibility that I observe the willingness of Czech society to help the invaded Ukraine. The wave of solidarity that has risen in the last six months is unprecedented in the history of our country. It is mainly thanks to all those generous people, companies and organisations that we can continue to work in Ukraine and respond flexibly to the challenges ahead,"" adds our director, Šimon Pánek., In the coming months, the most significant challenges will be housing, education, and heat, The lack of suitable accommodation appears to be the biggest problem in Ukraine ahead of the coming winter. Many school buildings have been converted into collective centres providing facilities for the internally displaced., With the start of the school year, the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science announced that it plans to open 41% of schools for full-time teaching. However, many buildings are not suitable for teaching in the current situation. Moreover, according to the new legislation, schools must have a shelter on their property---something most schools lack., ""Our teams in Ukraine are helping to repair school buildings and have launched a psychological support project for teachers who are under great psychological strain due to the war, and we are also focusing on children's mental health,"" says Barbora Kindlová, one of our programme coordinators., ""The overall interest in psychological assistance is currently enormous in Ukraine, and it is expected that with the coming of winter when many people will face further problems related to lack of accommodation, cold, poor access to water and food, the need for psychological assistance is likely to increase,"" she adds., According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, at least 1,888 schools have been damaged or destroyed since the Russian invasion began. This is more than double the number of such attacks recorded in eastern Ukraine between 2014 and 2021, when some 750 schools were damaged, destroyed, or forcibly closed. The war has disrupted the education of all 7.5 million children living in Ukraine at the beginning of this year., There is a goal to repair at least 9,000 homes by early winter. Yet our aid will only be enough for a small portion of this. In addition to home repairs, our teams will continue to provide water in areas where shelling has damaged water lines and to provide hot meals to collective centres in the west of the country., Author: Juliana Hámová, Mediální koordinátorka Člověka v tísni",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-invasion-weve-got-four-hundred-threatened-activists-safety-total-we-helped-more-330000-people
"Belgium is committed to the protection of human rights, respect for international humanitarian law and the fight against impunity in Ukraine",News and Press Release,Govt. Belgium,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",31 Aug 2022,"As the conflict in Ukraine has entered its seventh month, the human toll continues to rise and the civilian population is paying an extremely painful price for the brutal Russian aggression. The war has already claimed nearly 13,000 civilian lives according to the UN, and probably many more in reality. The situation in the territories temporarily under illegal Russian control is alarming, including the kidnapping or forced disappearance of Ukrainian elected officials, journalists, civil society activists and ordinary citizens. Belgium is particularly concerned about the number of child victims of the conflict and the impact of the widespread destruction of schools on education., The protection and promotion of human rights, rule of law and international humanitarian law (IHL) and the fight against impunity are among Belgium's foreign policy priorities. Belgium pays particular attention to the fight against the use of sexual violence and to the protection of children in armed conflicts., In the context of the war in Ukraine, Belgium is therefore committed to defending these priorities in a concrete way by supporting initiatives lead by several of Belgium's international partner organizations:, Human Rights Monitoring Mission of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (500,000 euros), Established in 2014 during the Russian offensive in Eastern Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea, this mission now monitors the impact of Russian aggression on human rights throughout the country and documents human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law. It supports the Human Rights Council's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to ensure that those responsible for human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law (IHL) in the context of Russia's aggression against Ukraine are held accountable and therefore to end impunity., OSCE Human Rights Monitoring Mission (300,000 euros), The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights conducts human rights monitoring activities in Ukraine and neighboring regions, including documentation of IHL and human rights violations, and support for Ukrainian human rights defenders., UNICEF's Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism on Grave Violations against Children in Situations of Armed Conflict (500,000 euros), Belgium provides regular financial support to this mechanism established by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that investigates and reports on six types of grave violations of children's rights in situations of armed conflict., Together with other countries, Belgium insisted on the need to include the war in Ukraine among the ""situations of concern"", which allows for a follow-up by the office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General. Indeed, information provided by various UN sources indicates a very rapid deterioration of the condition of children in the country., UN Conflict-Related Sexual Violence Trust Fund (500,000 euros), This fund finances the UN team of experts on the rule of law and issues related to sexual violence in conflict to assist national authorities in the prosecution of crimes involving sexual violence. The deployment of this expertise complements the Human Rights Monitoring Mission of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights., UN Women's Peace and Humanitarian Trust Fund for Ukraine and Moldova (500,000 euros), This Fund provides support to local NGOs and women's grassroots organizations relevant to conflict and crisis situations., In the context of the conflict in Ukraine, this support has several objectives: to address the humanitarian and protection needs of displaced women and girls (including socio-economic reconstruction), to prevent violence against women and girls, to ensure that survivors of violence have access to essential services, and to ensure the participation of women in decision-making processes., European Endowment for Democracy Emergency Assistance Program for Ukraine (300,000 euros), The European Endowment for Democracy Fund (EED) established by the EU and its Member States provides technical and financial assistance to promote democracy and human rights in the European neighborhood through grants to civil society organizations, pro-democracy movements, civic and political activists, and independent journalists and media working for a democratic and pluralistic political system., Since the outbreak of the war, a significant portion of the EED's emergency assistance has been allocated to independent media in Ukraine, which play a crucial role in documenting war crimes and collecting testimonies of victims., Minister of Foreign Affairs Hadja Lahbib: ""In view of the accounts of abuses and serious violations of international humanitarian law that we are receiving from Bucha, Mariupol, Kramatorsk and many other places in Ukraine, Belgium wishes to express a strong and very clear message concerning the abuses and crimes committed in the context of this war of aggression: these must be solidly documented in order to guarantee that their perpetrators do not go unpunished. This is why Belgium supports the various mechanisms deployed since the beginning of the conflict. This must also serve to influence the course of the conflict and limit the perpetration of these crimes as well as the impact of the war on the civilian population., I am also deeply shocked by the cases of sexual and gender-based violence, the majority of which were committed in areas controlled by the Russian armed forces. These include rape, gang rape, torture, forced nudity in public and threats of sexual violence. Sexual violence is used in this conflict as a weapon of war against civilians. This terrible violence, which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, violates the human rights on which our society is based.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/belgium-committed-protection-human-rights-respect-international-humanitarian-law-and-fight-against-impunity-ukraine
“Nous n’avions pas le choix” : “Filtrage” et le crime de transfert forcé de civils ukrainiens vers la Russie,Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,1 Sep 2022,"Transferts forcés de citoyens ukrainiens vers la Russie, Les forces russes soumettent les civils fuyant les zones de conflit à un processus de « filtrage » punitif et abusif, (Kiev, le 1er septembre 2022) – Les forces russes et celles qui leur sont affiliées transfèrent de force des civils ukrainiens, y compris ceux qui fuient les hostilités, vers la Fédération de Russie ou vers des régions d’Ukraine occupées par la Russie, a déclaré Human Rights Watch dans un rapport publié aujourd’hui., Ce rapport de 71 pages, intitulé « ‘We Had No Choice’: ‘Filtration’ and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to Russia » (« “Nous n’avions pas le choix” : “Filtrage” et le crime de transfert forcé de civils ukrainiens vers la Russie » - résumé et recommandations en français), documente les transferts de civils ukrainiens.Ces transferts sont une grave violation des lois de la guerre et sont constitutifs de crimes de guerre et de possibles crimes contre l’humanité. Les autorités russes ou affiliées à la Russie soumettent également des milliers de citoyens ukrainiens à un processus de contrôle d’identité obligatoire, punitif et abusif appelé «filtrage»., «Les civils ukrainiens ne devraient pas être placés dans une situation où ils n’ont pas d’autre choix que de se rendre en Russie», a déclaré Belkis Wille, chercheuse senior auprès de la division Crises et conflit de Human Rights Watch et co-auteure du rapport. «Et personne ne devrait être contraint de subir un processus de contrôle abusif pour pouvoir se mettre en sécurité.», Human Rights Watch a mené des entretiens avec 54 personnes qui sont allées en Russie, sont passées par le processus de filtrage, avaient des membres de leur famille ou des amis transférés en Russie, ou apportaient leur aide à des Ukrainiens qui tentaient de quitter la Russie. La plupart de ces personnes avaient fui la région de Marioupol ; plusieurs d’entre elles avaient été transférées de la région de Kharkiv. Human Rights Watch s’est également entretenu avec des dizaines de civils de la région de Marioupol qui avaient réussi à s’échapper de la zone de guerre pour rejoindre un territoire sous contrôle ukrainien, sans subir le filtrage., Human Rights Watch a écrit au gouvernement russe le 5 juillet 2022, joignant un résumé de ses conclusions et des questions, mais n’a reçu aucune réponse., Des responsables russes ou affiliés à la Russie ont organisé des moyens de transport pour les personnes qui fuyaient la ville portuaire assiégée de Marioupol, dans le sud-est de l’Ukraine. Ils ont affirmé à certains civils qu’ils n’avaient pas d’autre choix que de rester en zone occupée par la Russie ou d’aller en Russie, et devaient « oublier» l’option de rejoindre le territoire sous contrôle ukrainien. Une femme de Marioupol qui a été transférée en Russie a déclaré : «Bien sûr, nous aurions saisi l’occasion d’aller en Ukraine si nous avions pu, c’est certain. Mais nous n’avions pas le choix, il n’y avait aucune possibilité d’y aller.», D’autres civils ont déclaré que des soldats ou d’autres personnels stationnés à des postes de contrôle avaient donné instruction aux citoyens ukrainiens fuyant les hostilités d’aller en Russie ou en «République populaire de Donetsk »(Donetskaïa Narodnaïa Respoublika, DNR), une zone de la région de Donetsk contrôlée par des groupes armés affiliés à la Russie et actuellement occupée par la Russie. Des membres du personnel militaire russe qui ont rassemblé des civils dans les territoires occupés leur ont dit la même chose. Des personnes qui avaient les moyens financiers nécessaires ont pu organiser leur propre transport vers les territoires sous contrôle ukrainien., Des habitants de villages et d’une ville de la région de Kharkiv dans l’est de l’Ukraine, près de la frontière avec la Russie, ont également été transférés de force vers ce pays. Un homme âgé de 70 ans, du village de Ruska Lozova en Ukraine, a affirmé que les forces russes lui avaient dit : « Vous avez vécu sous notre contrôle, donc si l’armée ukrainienne vient, elle vous punira», ajoutant : «Vous serez exécuté.» Quoiqu’il n’ait pas cédé, des centaines de familles de son village sont effectivement parties pour la Russie., Certaines personnes ont déclaré qu’elles étaient allées volontairement en Russie, principalement comme voie de transit pour rejoindre l'Union européenne, y compris comme moyen d’éviter les restrictions de voyage., Bien que le nombre total de civils ukrainiens transférés en Russie ne puisse pas être déterminé avec certitude, beaucoup d’entre eux ont été déplacés et transportés en Russie d’une manière et dans un contexte qui en font des transferts forcés illégaux, a déclaré Human Rights Watch. À la mi-août, des médias russes ont indiqué que plus de 3,4 millions d’Ukrainiens, dont 555 000 enfants, étaient entrés dans la Fédération de Russie en provenance d’Ukraine., Certaines personnes, qui avaient accès à des téléphones cellulaires et aux réseaux sociaux, ont pu entrer en contact avec des activistes qui ont aidé à faciliter leur départ de la Russie en transitant par l’Estonie, la Lettonie ou la Géorgie. Cependant, une fois arrivés à la frontière, certains ont eu des difficultés à la franchir car ils n’avaient pas les pièces d’identité requises, les ayant laissées en Ukraine lors de leur fuite., Les lois de la guerre interdisent aux forces russes ou affiliées à la Russie de forcer des civils ukrainiens, individuellement ou en masse, à être évacués vers la Russie. Un transfert forcé constitue un crime de guerre et un possible crime contre l’humanité ; parmi ces cas figurent des transferts dans des circonstances telles qu’une personne ne consent à être déplacée que parce qu’elle craint des conséquences comme la violence, la coercition ou la détention si elle refuse, et la puissance occupante profite d’un environnement contraignant pour la transférer. Le transfert ou le déplacement de civils ne peut pas être considéré comme légal ou justifié en vertu de motifs humanitaires, si la crise humanitaire qui déclenche le déplacement est elle-même le résultat d’une activité illégale de la part de la puissance occupante., Lors du processus de «*filtrage *», que des milliers d’habitants de la région de Marioupol ont été obligés de subir alors qu’ils tentaient de fuir, les autorités russes ou affiliées à la Russie dans cette région occupée recueillaient systématiquement leurs données biométriques, notamment leurs empreintes digitales et des photos numérisées de leur visage, de face et de profil ; les fouillaient au corps et inspectaient leurs affaires personnelles et leurs téléphones ; et les interrogeaient sur leurs opinions politiques., Un homme originaire de Marioupol a affirmé qu’avec des dizaines d’autres habitants de la ville, il avait été interné pendant deux semaines dans une école du village, dans des conditions insalubres, avant d’être emmené pour subir la procédure de filtrage. Il a indiqué que beaucoup d’entre eux étaient tombés malades et appréhendaient l’avenir immédiat. «Nous avions l’impression d’être des otages», a-t-il dit., Même si la Russie peut être fondée à effectuer des contrôles de sécurité concernant des personnes cherchant à entrer volontairement sur son territoire, la procédure de filtrage – en raison de son ampleur et de la manière systématique avec laquelle les civils ukrainiens ont été contraints de la subir – est punitive et abusive, n’a aucun fondement juridique et constitue une violation du droit au respect de la vie privée, a déclaré Human Rights Watch., Les personnes qui «*échouaient *» lors du processus de filtrage, apparemment à cause de leurs liens présumés avec l’armée ukrainienne ou avec des organisations nationalistes, étaient détenues dans les régions contrôlées par la Russie, y compris au centre de détention d’Olenivka, où au moins 50 détenus ukrainiens auraient été tués dans une explosion le 29 juillet., Les forces russes et affiliées, dans toutes les régions d’Ukraine qu’elles occupent devraient s’assurer que les civils puissent partir en toute sûreté vers les territoires sous contrôle ukrainien s’ils le souhaitent, a déclaré Human Rights Watch. Ces forces devraient s’assurer que les personnes qui montent à bord de bus d’évacuation vers la Russie soient pleinement informées sur la destination de ces bus et qu’elles disposent d’autres options si elles ne veulent pas aller en Russie. Ces forces devraient aussi cesser d’exercer toute forme de pression sur les citoyens ukrainiens pour qu’ils aillent en Russie, et devraient faciliter le retour en Ukraine de tous les civils ukrainiens qui le souhaitent., Les autorités russes devraient également mettre fin à toutes les actuelles opérations de collecte et de rétention de données biométriques de personnes en Ukraine ou venant d’Ukraine. Elles ne devraient recueillir des données biométriques que lorsque de telles collectes sont nécessaires, légales et proportionnées, et devraient informer les personnes des motifs d’une telle collecte de leurs données, de la manière dont elles seront utilisées et de la durée de la rétention de ces données., «Il faut immédiatement mettre fin au transfert de personnes vers des régions ukrainiennes occupées par la Russie, puis vers la Russie elle-même, sans leur consentement», a affirmé Belkis Wille. «Les autorités russes et les organisations internationales devraient faire tout leur possible pour aider les personnes emmenées en Russie contre leur volonté, et qui veulent retourner chez elles, à le faire en toute sécurité.»",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nous-navions-pas-le-choix-filtrage-et-le-crime-de-transfert-force-de-civils-ukrainiens-vers-la-russie
“We Had No Choice”: “Filtration” and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to Russia [EN/JA/RU/UK],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,1 Sep 2022,"Forcible Transfer of Ukrainians to Russia, Punitive, Abusive Screening of Fleeing Civilians, (Kyiv, September 1, 2022) – Russian and Russian-affiliated forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians, including those fleeing hostilities, to the Russian Federation or areas of Ukraine occupied by Russia, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today., The 71-page report, “‘We Had No Choice’: ‘Filtration’ and the Crime of Forcibly Transferring Ukrainian Civilians to Russia,” documents the transfers of Ukrainian civilians. The transfers are a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity. Russian and Russian-affiliated authorities also subjected thousands of Ukrainian citizens to a form of compulsory, punitive, and abusive security screening called “filtration.”, “Ukrainian civilians should not be left with no choice but to go to Russia,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. “And no one should be forced to undergo an abusive screening process to reach safety.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed 54 people who went to Russia, went through filtration, had family members or friends who were transferred to Russia, or who supported Ukrainians trying to leave Russia. Most had fled the Mariupol area, and several were transferred from the Kharkiv region. Human Rights Watch also interviewed dozens of civilians from the Mariupol area who were able to escape the war zone to Ukrainian-controlled territory without undergoing filtration., Human Rights Watch wrote to the Russian government on July 5, 2022 with a summary of its findings and questions but received no response., Russian and Russian-affiliated officials organized transport for people fleeing the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol. They told some civilians that they had no choice but to stay in Russian-occupied areas or go to Russia and should “forget about” going to Ukrainian-controlled territory. “Of course, we would have used the opportunity to go to Ukraine if we could have, for sure,” said a woman transferred from Mariupol. “But we had no choice, no possibility to go there.”, Others said that military or other personnel at checkpoints instructed fleeing Ukrainians to go to Russia or the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DNR”), an area of the Donetsk region controlled by Russian-affiliated armed groups and occupied by Russia. Military personnel who rounded up civilians in occupied territories told them the same. People who had the financial means could organize their own transport to Ukrainian-held territory., Residents from some villages and a city in the eastern Kharkiv region, bordering Russia, were also forcibly transferred to Russia. A 70-year-old man from Ruska Lozova village said that Russian forces told him that “You lived under us and so if the Ukrainian army comes, they will punish you,” and said, “You will be executed.” While he did not give in, hundreds of families from the village did leave for Russia., Some people said they went to Russia voluntarily, mostly as a transit route to reach the European Union, including as a way of avoiding travel restrictions., Although the total number of Ukrainian civilians transferred to Russia remains unclear, many were displaced and transported in a manner and context that makes them illegal forcible transfers, Human Rights Watch said. In mid-August, Russian media reported that over 3.4 million Ukrainians had entered the Russian Federation from Ukraine, including 555,000 children., Some of those who had access to smartphones and social media networks were able to connect with activists who helped them leave Russia for Estonia, Latvia, or Georgia. At the border, though, some had difficulties because they had left their identification documents behind when they fled Ukraine., The laws of war prohibit Russian or Russian-affiliated forces from forcing Ukrainian civilians, individually or en masse, to evacuate to Russia. A forcible transfer is a war crime and a potential crime against humanity and includes a transfer in circumstances in which a person consents to move only because they fear consequences such as violence, duress, or detention if they remain, and the occupying power is taking advantage of a coercive environment to transfer them. Transferring or displacing civilians is not justified or lawful on humanitarian grounds if the humanitarian crisis triggering the displacement is the result of unlawful activity by the occupying power., During the “filtration” process, which thousands of residents from the Mariupol area were forced to undergo while trying to flee, Russian and Russian-affiliated officials in the Russian-occupied region typically collected civilians’ biometric data, including fingerprints and front and side facial images; conducted body searches, and searched personal belongings and phones; and questioned them about their political views., A man from Mariupol said that he and dozens of Mariupol residents stayed for two weeks in a village schoolhouse under filthy conditions before they were taken to undergo filtration. He said many got sick and feared what awaited them. “We felt like hostages,” he said., While Russia may have legitimate grounds to conduct security screening on people voluntarily seeking to enter Russian territory, the filtration process – in its scope and the systemic manner in which Ukrainian civilians were forced to undergo it – is punitive and abusive, has no legal underpinnings, and violates the right to privacy, Human Rights Watch said., People who “failed” the process, apparently due to their suspected ties to the Ukrainian military or to nationalist groups, were detained in Russian-controlled regions, including at the detention center in Olenivka, where at least 50 Ukrainian detainees were reportedly killed during a blast on July 29., Russian and Russian-affiliated forces in areas they occupy should ensure that civilians can safely leave to Ukrainian-controlled territory if they choose, Human Rights Watch said. They should ensure that people who board buses are fully informed about where the buses are going and have options if they do not want to travel to Russia. They should stop pressuring Ukrainian citizens to go to Russia and facilitate the return to Ukraine of those seeking to do so., Russian authorities should also halt all ongoing biometric data collection and retention processes of persons in or from Ukraine. They should collect biometric data only where lawful, proportionate, and necessary and inform people of why their data is being collected, how it will be used, and how long it will be held for., “Herding people further into Russian-occupied areas and onward to Russia without consent should immediately stop,” Wille said. “ Russian authorities and international organizations should do everything they can to help those taken to Russia against their will who want to return home to be able to do so safely.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/we-had-no-choice-filtration-and-crime-forcibly-transferring-ukrainian-civilians-russia-enjaruuk
"FRONTEX - Ukraine: Border traffic at high, but stable level",News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,31 Aug 2022,"Over recent weeks, the passenger traffic between Ukraine and the European Union has remained relatively stable. The ten-days average number of Ukrainians entering the EU (41 000) was roughly in line with the number of people leaving the EU (43 000)., In total, more than 9.5 million entries to EU, including more than 8.5 million Ukrainian nationals, have been recorded since the beginning of Russia’s invasion., Land border crossing points have also been experiencing heavy freight traffic from Ukraine in recent weeks. Recovering export of grains by sea may lead to a gradual decrease of such traffic at the land borders., Frontex analysts predict that any intensification of the conflict in the south of Ukraine might lead to a rise in the number of Ukrainians fleeing their country. In the longer term, socio-economic factors, such as an economic contraction, extensive damage to infrastructure and occupation of territory important for agriculture may also encourage more Ukrainians to enter the EU., Over 4.1 million persons fleeing Ukraine have registered for temporary protection in the 29 EU+ countries from the beginning of the war to 21 August 2022., Frontex continues to support the countries neighbouring Ukraine, including Moldova, with 253 staff and officers assisting with border control activities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/frontex-ukraine-border-traffic-high-stable-level

This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro regions (East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random digit dial (RDD) approach, and 2,001 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed.

"Experts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child Commend Ukraine on its Commitment to Child Rights, Ask about the Mental Health of Children in Light of the War and the Evacuation of Children with Disabilities",News and Press Release,UNCRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",31 Aug 2022,"The Committee on the Rights of the Child today concluded its consideration of the combined fifth to sixth periodic report of Ukraine under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Committee Experts said they were impressed that Ukraine had chosen not to delay the meeting with the Committee due to the Russian aggression, reflecting its commitment to child rights, and asked about the mental health of children and the evacuation of children with disabilities., Bragi Gudbrandsson, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, said the Committee was impressed that Ukraine had not asked to delay the meeting, as it was never more important than in times of war to address the rights of the child, and this was when the obligations of the State were the greatest. This reflected the State’s commitment to children’s rights and implementing the Convention even in adverse circumstances., He said that the war had traumatised the whole nation, including children, and this needed to be urgently addressed. Could more information be provided about the mental health project launched by the First Lady of Ukraine? What methods had been taken internally in Ukraine to protect children from violence in the context of war?, Mr. Gudbrandsson noted thatreports had been received that children had suffered neglect in institutions and some had been left behind in unsafe areas. How many children with high needs had been left behind in unsafe areas? Had there been any assessment on the mortality risks of these children? Was the Ukrainian Government willing to address this issue and act accordingly? One option would be to request emergency assistance from an affluent State in Europe which could assist with addressing the needs of children with disabilities in institutions., The delegation said that a Commission was developing a draft strategy aimed at protecting the mental health of the most vulnerable groups of the population affected by the war, including children. A programme was being developed which allowed children and adults to participate in activities in centres. Children aged 5 to 12 worked in groups with volunteers in sessions which focused on socialisation, adaptation and psychological support. There were 10 permanent and 20 mobile spaces allowing children to undertake these activities., The safest route for children with disabilities living in institutions would be evacuation, ideally abroad, the delegation said. However, there were challenges in this, including transportation, and ensuring that the countries had the resources available to support these children. It was also difficult for these children to change environments, particularly from a linguistic perspective, and this could have a negative impact on their wellbeing. Ukraine called on the international community to support children with disabilities in Ukraine, to ensure these children safely survived the winter., In opening remarks, Oksana Zholnovych, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, that in the last six months, the Russian Federation had launched a full-scale aggression on Ukraine, which afflicted terrible losses and destruction, affecting every family and every child. The United Nations Children’s Fund had supported a pilot project on psychological support, creating the Barnahaus centres, which hosted children who had experienced or witnessed violence from the military invasion. Specialised institutions had been created which helped women seek respite from abuse and protect their children. Ms. Zholnovych expressed gratitude to all States which had taken in children from Ukraine and provided a safe environment for them., In concluding remarks, Mr. Gudbrandsson said the Committee appreciated Ukraine’s decision not to request a delay for the meeting due to the Russian aggression, reflecting the State’s commitment to children’s rights and implementing the Convention even in adverse circumstances., Ms. Zholnovych expressed gratitude to the Committee for supporting Ukraine under such an adverse situation. Ukraine was grateful for the discussion and questions asked by the Committee members, even though some were not easy to answer. The children of Ukraine were the future, and it was important that they were healthy and safe., The delegation of Ukraine consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Policy; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Youth and Sport; the Ministry of Education and Science; the Ministry of Internal Affairs; the President’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights and Children’s Rehabilitation; the ICF “SOS Children’s Villages” of Ukraine; the Board of the Public Union “Ukrainian Child Rights Network”; the All-Ukrainian Forum “Parents for Early Intervention”; the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights for the Observance of the Rights of the Child and Family; and the Permanent Mission Opens in new windowof Ukraine Opens in new windowto the United Nations Office at Geneva., Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found hereOpens in new window.

To implement the principles of the Convention, Ukraine had adopted a law on nation-wide programmes and the action plans in support envisaged the allocation of 585 million dollars. A law was adopted which gave priority to family care for children, to replace institutional care. The benefits for children had been dramatically increased. A one-time benefit was also introduced in the case of adoption. Nearly 93 per cent of orphans and children deprived of parental care were now placed in a family environment., In 2022, during the war, some digital tools were implemented to expand opportunities for involving citizens in forms of childcare. This included the chatbot application “The child is not alone”, which contributed to the selection of over 1,000 candidates who were ready to take children into their families. Ukraine was developing the early intervention system which helped to support the families of children with disabilities and prevented these children from being enrolled in institutions. Since 2018, the comprehensive health reform had been underway in Ukraine which allowed the family, including parents and their children, to be managed by the same doctor throughout their lifetime. Once the doctor was selected, this covered all forms of health care, including pregnancy and neo-natal care. Ukraine had also started creating regional screening centres which could diagnose muscular dystrophy in the early stages., Ms. Zholnovych said that children with disabilities who needed accessible and quality education could benefit from inclusive education. To cover children with special educational needs, the State allocated funding to local budgets. The amount allocated had doubled since 2017. To facilitate the realisation of the citizens’ right to engage in physical culture, Ukraine had deployed more than 300 fitness centres. The State was also working on child-friendly justice. To protect minors who had committed an offense, or who were witnesses of crimes, the council on juvenile justice was established. A draft law on child friendly justice had been established., The United Nations Children’s Fund had supported a pilot project on psychological support, creating the Barnahaus centres, which hosted children who had experienced or witnessed violence from the military invasion. Specialised institutions had been created which helped women seek respite from abuse and protect their children. There were 43 shelters for women and children, 33 crisis rooms, and 66 counselling services throughout the country, with another 45 specialised services expecting to be launched., Ukraine still had work to be done, however, all announced achievements had to be revised due to the full-scale war which began in February 2022. All rights needed to be interpreted in a totally different context; the right to life was being violated on a daily basis due to shelling. A lot of children in the occupied territories were left without parents, and many had been taken to Russia and placed in institutions., Only 50 per cent of schools would be able to open their doors to school children this autumn. Over 2,000 educational facilities had been damaged by bombings and shelling. Reports had been received detailing horrific acts of violence against children by the Russian military. Millions of children had been forced to flee their homes and had become witnesses to violence. The war had set back development efforts of the country. The State was unable to ensure the protection of children during the war, particularly those who were in occupied territories. Ms. Zholnovych expressed gratitude to all States who had taken in children from Ukraine and provided a safe environment for them., Questions by Committee Experts, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, said the Committee was impressed that Ukraine had not asked to delay the meeting, as it was never more important than in times of war to address the rights of the child, and this was when the obligations of the State were the greatest. The hearts of the Committee went out to Ukraine for the great loss of life the country had experienced because of Putin’s war., HYND AYOUBI IDRISSI, Vice Chair and Taskforce Member, commended Ukraine for adopting the third Optional Protocol on individual communications, asking what had been done to allow for the effective implementation of this instrument? The legislative arsenal had seen many amendments in Ukraine; what was being done to ensure its effectiveness? What measures were being taken on the organisational and budgetary level and the follow-up and implementation of the national action plan? What was the impact of the plan on the situation of vulnerable children? What were the resources of the Ministry of Social Policy and the measures to ensure constitutional continuity within the Ministry? What was the mandate for the national council for coordination?, While Ukraine had made a great deal of effort in data collection, there was still not a single national database. What measures were being taken to address this situation? What had the State envisaged to bring a budget that was sensitive to the rights of the child, and put an end to the disparities between regions? What was being done to disseminate the Convention? What was being done to ensure the effective implementation of the law against discrimination? What impact had this law had on reducing hate crime, racism, and xenophobia?, The hundreds of children who had been killed and wounded during the war was a reality in Ukraine and the Committee was extremely concerned about this situation. What was the State doing along these lines? Could the delegation inform about measures taken for children to freely express their opinions? What could be done to allow for a true and meaningful participation of children?, JOSÉ ANGEL RODRÍGUEZ REYES, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, asked if there were weddings being held for children under the age of 18, particularly in the Roma population? Had relationships between adults and minors been detected? This was a problem before the war; did this remain a problem? What measures might be taken in the future to prevent these practices?, VELINA TODOROVA, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, commended the progress in the legislation to facilitate the birth registration of children born in non-government-controlled territories. It remained an issue that the birth certificate was issued without identifying the nationality of the child. Ms. Todorova commended the ratification by Ukraine of the two Conventions regarding stateless, however, children were born in Ukraine who may remained stateless if they could not acquire the nationality of their parents. Were there measures to address this issue?, Ms. Todorova noted that Ukraine was the second largest surrogacy hub globally, and the practice remained unregulated. Ukraine was making progress in drafting legal amendments to address the gaps in surrogacy; were these drafts adopted by the parliament? Did these laws provide safeguards such as ensuring that records were preserved and allowing children the right to know their origins? Were there safeguards to prevent illegal activity around surrogacy, such as trafficking? How was the right to privacy for children guaranteed?, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, said that children in Ukraine had shared narratives and it was a grim picture. The war had traumatised the whole nation, including children. The children of today would have to live with the baggage of this trauma for years to come. This trauma needed to be urgently addressed. Could more information be provided about the mental health project launched by the First Lady of Ukraine? What methods had been taken internally in Ukraine to protect children from violence in the context of war? Were children removed from parents who chose not to evacuate from war zones? If so, what support did they receive?, Mr. Gudbrandsson said that Ukraine had taken important steps in the past to protect children from violence, however, reports had been received which stated that parental practices lagged behind the legislation. Ukraine had ratified important conventions to protect children from violence, including the Istanbul Convention a few months ago. Mr. Gudbrandsson commended the State for taking such steps, especially during wartime. How was it ensured that children were also supported in centres for domestic violence? Was the Barnahaus model reflected in the draft law on justice for children? Was it possible to develop the Ukrainian Barnahaus model, in terms of the need to address the trauma due to the war? Was it possible to ensure that children were able to access Barnahaus or trauma-focused therapy following the war?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said that Ukraine had a system of coordination for matters relating to children’s rights. The inter-agency commissioner annually adopted the reports on the situation around children, and civil society organizations were invited to participate in this process. However, this had been suspended because of the war. There was a function to come up with proposals to improve the situation of the protection of children. A coordination council was established in August this year, to determine the main priorities of children’s rights in times of war., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, fully agreed that comprehensive data was required. The system was currently being changed from paper data collection, and digital statistics were being compiled which would ensure automatic exchange between all databases in Ukraine. A unified register of social protection was being developed, which would include each beneficiary of social protection systems. A register of people with disabilities was also being developed. Ukraine was planning to launch the national procurement agency for social services, to cover all people in need equally. The social protection system in Ukraine covered monetary benefits, which were paid from the State budget and were equal for all children. Children with disabilities were entitled to higher benefits., Access to healthcare for children was a priority. Since 2021, the State had guaranteed a right to all medical services. Ukraine ensured the equal funding and equal access for all children to healthcare. Under the medical guarantees programme, the State guaranteed all refugees and stateless persons living in Ukraine full payment to medical services. Children were evacuated to neighbouring countries in Europe and the United States during the conflict, and Ukraine was grateful to all partners for their assistance regarding the health of Ukrainian children., There were 25 training facilities for teachers located across all regions of Ukraine. Teachers were trained on social and civil competence and on the Convention. The Convention made up 10 per cent of all international documents studied under the training programmes. Full secondary education in Ukraine was mandatory. Children were enrolled in school even in the case of the absence of their documents. Over 2,000 educational facilities had suffered destruction and damages because of the Russian aggression, and this number was growing every day. Fifty per cent of schools would be able to open their doors to students in September, but the rest would need to open in a hybrid format. Children in the occupied territories had the opportunity to select their educational format. Children were facing huge challenges and steps were being made in terms of mental health protection. A strategy had been adopted to promote the rights of the Roma minority, which included the protection of their native language, and the ability for these children to study in their native language., Ukraine had taken steps to harmonise legislation with European law. Every legal act passed by Ukraine was analysed to ensure there was no discrimination enshrined in the proposed acts. The best protection against the Russian aggression was fighting back and protecting the borders. All efforts of the State focused on getting back to the pre-war borders. Children were being protected from the negative impact of hostilities. However, children unfortunately now knew how to respond to shelling, to handle ammunition and what to take with them to the bomb shelter. This was the reality despite how terrible this might be. Materials had been developed which covered actions in case a child was lost or alone because of the war. These materials were available on all information platforms. During emergencies, which included floods, radiological exposure, or armed conflicts, a partial or complete evacuation may take place. Around 50 per cent of educational facilities were equipped with shelters., Ukraine invested maximum efforts to protect children in civil proceedings as well as criminal proceedings. Children older than 14 years were able to participate in court procedures and exercise their procedural rights. In the case of divorce, the child could decide which parent they wished to live with, if they were over the age of 14. During the pre-trial investigation in crimes committed by minors, the health stature and level of minors’ development should be analysed and considered, as well as the attitude of the minor towards the offence, with the minor given the opportunity to share their opinion. Children were entitled to free legal aid. A minor could not be interviewed in the absence of parents or legal representatives., Questions by Committee Experts, JOSÉ ANGEL RODRÍGUEZ REYES, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said that one of the challenges before the war included the surgery of intersex children without their informed consent. Would this issue be tackled now?, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, asked if the delegation could elaborate on how mental health treatment would be provided to children in Ukraine?, A Committee Expert noted the extreme gravitas which defined the exchange. The childhood of the children of Ukraine was being deeply disrupted, which would have long-term consequences. The Expert commended the State for the initiatives which were being undertaken to mitigate this. Could more information be provided about the positive interventions being provided to preserve the innocence of childhood, including leisure, play and cultural activities?, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, said Ukraine had one of the highest numbers of children separated from their families in the whole of Eastern Europe, due to the conflict. The first phase of the deinstitutionalisation reform was completed, however, not much progress had been made to promote the best interest of the child and advance the process. At least 46,000 children had lived in institutions in Ukraine before the war in February; 72 per cent of these children were living there due to disabilities, and more than 90 per cent of children in care had living parents. The Government had managed to reunite between 30,000-40,000 children in institutions with their parents. How many of those left behind were in war zones? Were there plans for the de-institutionalisation of the children who had been left behind? Were there plans to strengthen the foster care system and introduce support services for children?, Many children had been evacuated from institutions; was there reliable information on these evacuations? Was there specific data on the number of children who had been evacuated from institutions and foster families? Why did the Ukrainian Government insist that those children evacuated from institutions remain institutionalised? Reports had been received that children had suffered neglect in institutions and some had been left behind in unsafe areas. How many children with high needs had been left behind in unsafe areas? Had there been any assessment on the mortality risks of these children? Was the Ukrainian Government willing to address this issue and act accordingly? One option would be to request emergency assistance from an affluent State in Europe which could assist with addressing the needs of children with disabilities in institutions., JOSÉ ANGEL RODRÍGUEZ REYES, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, asked if Ukraine was planning on opening health care options in all areas, and providing healthcare for all children regardless of where they lived? Were there plans to design programmes which urgently addressed mental healthcare for children and their caregivers? What measures were being taken to reduce drug use, alcohol use and tobacco use in adolescents? There had been hundreds of attacks against educational facilities; was it possible to protect educational facilities from attacks, including bombings? What measures were being taken to improve the accessibility and the quality of education, in regard to Roma children?, VELINA TODOROVA, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, noted that asylum seeking children did not have legal status under Ukrainian law, which could provide them with additional protection. Were there measures to address bullying in schools? The exploitation of children for drug trafficking was alarming and 80 types of new psycho-substances were not in the list of prohibitions, meaning drug traffickers could not be prosecuted. Were there measures to address this? What measures were in place to protect children from being involved in the production of pornography? Had there been studies about the root causes of the high number of children living in the street? The delegation considered that discrimination against Roma was a big issue in Ukraine. What was being done to address this? What had been done to prevent instances of violence against Roma and prosecute perpetrators? What were the prospects for the justice friendly child bill to be adopted? Why had no efforts been made to move children in prison in conflict zones to safe areas? The Committee was concerned about impunity and had heard that some judges released abusers of children., Responses by the Delegation, OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, said that Ukraine was in the midst of war as a result of an unprovoked aggression. As a victim, it was difficult to explain the acts committed by the abuser. All citizens in Ukraine had the right to life., The delegation said that according to the Family Code, the marriage age for men and women was 18 years. A child 16 years or older could apply for a marriage license and the court could issue this if it was determined that it was in the best interest of the child, such as if the bride was pregnant. Marrying someone under the age of 18 without permission was punishable by a prison sentence of up to five years. A draft law had been developed which envisaged the birth registration of children in uncontrolled territories, and involved an email being sent to the civil registry., Men and women who signed an agreement with a surrogate mother were required to give their consent for their nationality to be registered at the child’s birth. The surrogate mother should give consent to participate in the procedure, and the nationality was defined on the basis of the biological parents. Surrogacy procedures were in line with the order of the Ministry of Healthcare, which had a separate section on regulation, including a list of documents. Three draft laws were in place to regulate reproductive technologies, including surrogacy. Ukraine condemned the appeals of the Russian authorities to change the citizenship of children living in occupied territories and was determined to counteract these violations of children’s rights., Ukraine guaranteed the right to secrecy for those who wanted to adopt a child. The authorities who held this information were obliged not to disclose this information to the child, until the child was over the age of 10. Adoptive parents had the right to conceal information about adoption if it was thought that it would hurt the child’s interests. The right to peaceful assembly was guaranteed in Ukraine. Youth organizations had the right to receive grants to implement their projects. In 2018, the Government supported the development of youth organizations of Ukraine. A general provision within the Civil Code prohibited pictures or videos being taken of any citizen, including children, unless consent was given., The topic of intersex children was a very sensitive issue. According to legislation, every patient older than 14 years had the right to select a physician. In Ukraine there was a network of medical and genetic centres, and experts who provided counselling. The number of intersex children was growing annually. A strategy was being developed for children who had congenital disorders; however, the war posed a barrier. These children needed medical and social support and there would be a Commission under the Ministry of Healthcare relating to the sexual development of these children. Surgeries of these children would be regulated by the Commission and by documents issued by the Ministry of Healthcare in the near future., A mental health care programme had been implemented with the help of the First Lady. A Commission was developing a draft strategy aimed at protecting the mental health of the most vulnerable groups of the population affected by war, including children. The first Barnahaus centre was launched in 2021 in June and there were currently three centres operating throughout the country, with three more planned to open. These centres ensured that psychosocial and legal support would be provided to children who were traumatised as a result of violence, and counselling would be provided to restore their mental health. The President of Ukraine had signed a decree to protect all persons from domestic violence, including children., Due to the war, many children had lost their homes and had been forced to adapt to a new reality. Children needed to socialise with their peers, and it was important to integrate them into the hosting communities. Programmes were being developed to provide children with additional opportunities and with a focus on psychological adaption. A programme was being developed which allowed children and adults to participate in activities in centres. Children aged 5 to 12 worked in groups with volunteers in sessions which focused on socialisation, adaptation and psychological support. There were 10 permanent and 20 mobile spaces allowing children to undertake these activities. There was still a network of sports facilities, and sports and meaningful leisure contributed to psychological relief for children. Internally displaced children were able to attend these facilities free of charge., Measures were being taken to provide psychological support to children to mitigate future effects. It was important to reduce the stress impact, especially in children. During the first few months of the war, hundreds of thousands of children and adults had had to stay underground in shelters. Many professional educators had visited shelters and hubs at railway stations to help the children during this difficult period., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, said that Ukraine had adopted a strategy of deinstitutionalisation, where the first stage had been completed, with the second still underway. More measures needed to be taken to increase the number of families that were ready to adopt children. Digital tools were being implemented to make the process of adoption easier. The State was doing everything possible to minimise the number of children within institutional care., For the first few weeks of the war, Ukrainian borders did not register children who were crossing the border. Since 12 March, the Government was in full control of the situation, and knew where children were crossing, their destination, and which facilities were taking them in. More than 3,000 children were orphans, and more than 2,500 of these children were living abroad. Poland, Germany and Italy had hosted the majority of children who had crossed the border. Ukraine was committed to creating the best conditions to return children to the State once it was safe to do so. Children with disabilities who had evacuated with their families were not registered. The Government was doing everything it could to monitor Ukrainian children with disabilities who were seeking refuge abroad. The risk of child trafficking was a challenge, particularly given the current situation., The unprecedented project of medical evacuation of children with cancer had been implemented. The Polish Government had granted Ukrainian healthcare professionals, who had left their jobs due to war, an opportunity to work with Ukrainian children in Poland, thus removing the language barrier. Cooperation with neighbouring countries was being undertaken to ensure sustainable medical services until the war was over. The United Nations Children’s Fund and civil society organizations active in Ukraine worked together on support programmes for Ukrainian children in other countries, enabling children to receive social, legal and psychological support., Ukraine was working on alternative sources of heating for every region and facility, for people who required support. The safest route for children with disabilities living in institutions would be evacuation, ideally abroad. However, there were challenges in this, including transportation, and ensuring that the countries had the resources available to support these children. It was also difficult for these children to change environments, particularly from a linguistic perspective, and this could have a negative impact on their wellbeing. Ukraine was calling on the international community to support children with disabilities in Ukraine, to ensure these children safely survived the winter., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, appealed to the Committee to highlight this problem, as there were not enough resources to support children in a crisis situation., The primary healthcare in Ukraine was characterised by the large number of medical aid posts, functioning in rural facilities. However, the approach of the primary healthcare had been changed due to war. Internally displaced persons could receive healthcare wherever they were living. All the healthcare services in the occupied territories were still funded by the State, to allow access for Ukrainian citizens. Progress had been received in the reduction of sexually transmitted diseases. A network of youth-friendly clinics had been established with a focus on sexual and reproductive health. Reproductive health was studied under the biological curriculum in schools, where students learned about reproductive health, sexual relations, and sexually transmitted diseases, among other topics., Questions by Committee Experts, JOSÉ ANGEL RODRÍGUEZ REYES, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said that he understood that the marriage of minors of 16 years of age was allowed in exceptional circumstances. Would this be changed and would measures be implemented allowing everyone to know the dangers of child marriage? Did the State plan to revise the parameters for addressing intersex children? Were they considered as people who had an illness? Did Ukraine plan on addressing the deep consequences of the institutionalisation of children with disabilities, by providing family-based support?, A Committee Expert expressed gratitude to the delegation of Ukraine for travelling to Geneva while the country was at war. How were children able to be returned from occupied territories? And what about the children who remained?, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, asked if children who were currently in institutions in Ukraine had reasonable services? Were they safe and was there no need for evacuation? What could be done to carry out a rescue operation and engage neighbouring countries to assist? These children needed specialised services and family settings which were not currently available in Ukraine; could the delegation share their thoughts on this?, A Committee Expert said there were significant amounts of children who had fallen through the cracks when it came to data collection. What was being done to ensure these children were properly identified and to ensure their whereabouts? Were there guidelines drafted by Ukraine regarding the receiving of children in host countries?, A Committee Expert asked if children deprived of their liberty in the criminal justice system were safe? Were there plans to evacuate them?, VELINA TODOROVA, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said the Committee was aware of certain legal issues relating to the status of Ukrainian children abroad and their future repatriation to Ukraine. Had the State considered the treaty to which Ukraine was a party? Ms. Todorova said the situation could be discussed with Germany, which was appearing before the Committee next week., A Committee Expert asked if the views of children older than 14 were actually heard, or if their opinions were just considered?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said that the Family Code stipulated that children under the age of 18 could be granted permission to marry, if it was in line with the child’s interests, and if the court issued permission. Intersex children were not regarded as being ill. The Ministry of Healthcare was drafting the required framework to allow intersex children to make decisions., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, said there were more than 1,300 children with disabilities in the western region of Ukraine remaining in institutions. The scope of social services would be increased, primarily by auditing the institutions. Most of these children had living parents, so the goal was to reunite these children with their families, providing the families had the resources to care for these children. Ukraine was working on increasing the number of teachers who were able to teach children with disabilities. This was a cost-intensive initiative. However, first steps had already been made., A public portal had been created which involved all stakeholders responsible for recovering Ukrainian children from abroad, including the police. It was important for Ukraine to know the whereabouts of each child to allow for their repatriation; 53 children had already been repatriated. Due to security purposes, exact details of the repatriation process could not be provided, but action was being taken to bring these children back to their families., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation*, *said if hosting countries were willing to provide care to children with disabilities, then Ukraine was willing to evacuate these children. However, bilateral agreements were required, as these children were not allowed to leave the country alone, which required staff to accompany them. This meant the evacuation of staff and their families was also required. During the evacuation of children with disabilities, it was easier to take children accompanied by their relatives. It was difficult for children with mental disabilities to leave the country and change their environment. Ukraine was asking the international community to support the State in providing support to these children with disabilities, within the territory of Ukraine. Many Ukrainian children had left Ukraine with their relatives while their parents remained behind. Ukraine was undertaking efforts to evacuate those in prisons., Ukraine was guided by The Hague Conventions. It was incredibly important to start the dialogue with Germany; Ukraine would be grateful for the Committee’s guidance on this., Children could share their opinions in the case of a dispute about child custody, and over the age of 14 the child was able to decide who they wanted to stay with., A range of measures were being taken to prevent children from consuming drugs. Students at schools participated in Zoom trainings and webinars and parents received information about the use of drugs. Counteracting child pornography was one of the priorities of the national police. Following an investigation, 18 perpetrators were identified and apprehended and material was seized. People who were engaged in prostitution were engaged only in administrative liability, not criminal liability., Mental health was an integral part of the recovery of people in Ukraine. The First Lady had initiated the mental health and psychosocial support programme, which had brought the topic of mental health to a higher level. Every day the number of organizations and project providers in mental health was increasing. The top priority was coordination and joining efforts with all those working in the sphere to obtain positive results. The State was aiming to create a setting which ensured that all those who needed mental health support was able to receive it, without discrimination., Comment by a Committee Expert, VELINA TODOROVA, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said there had been no answers about the child justice system, and the responses regarding family codes were a bit disappointing., Closing Remarks, BRAGI GUDBRANDSSON, Committee Expert and Coordinator of the Taskforce on Ukraine, said the Committee appreciated Ukraine’s decision not to request a delay for the meeting, due to the Russian aggression, reflecting the State’s commitment to children’s rights and implementing the Convention even in adverse circumstances. Mr. Gudbrandsson thanked the delegation for the rich details they had shared, stating that the dialogue had been extremely helpful., OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and head of the delegation, expressed gratitude to the Committee for supporting Ukraine under such an adverse situation. Ukraine was grateful for the discussion and questions asked by the Committee members, even though some were not easy to answer. Ukraine would take measures at home to improve the situation of children and was committed to providing prompt responses to challenges caused by the war in Ukraine. The children of Ukraine were the future, and it was important that they were healthy and safe., MIKIKO OTANI, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for appearing before the Committee despite the extraordinary challenges faced. It was hoped that the dialogue would serve to protect the children of Ukraine under the Convention. Ms. Otani extended sincere and best wishes to the children in Ukraine who were suffering., _______, Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

Urgently needed life-saving supplies delivered to people in Mykolaiv,News and Press Release,UNCT Ukraine,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items",31 Aug 2022,"Humanitarian organizations carried out a joint mission and delivered urgently needed life-saving supplies to people in Mykolaiv as part of efforts to scale up support for over 550,000 people in need across Mykolaivska oblast., Yesterday, the last of the six truckloads of humanitarian assistance for 3,000 people sent over the past week arrived in Mykolaiv. These deliveries provided by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP) will help ensure that aid workers on the ground can reach people with food, necessary household items and other non-food items. The trucks also brought medical supplies that will be distributed by local authorities to enable hospitals in the city to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients., Also yesterday, during the visit led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, representatives of UN agencies and NGOs met with oblast and local authorities to ensure the continuous coordination and alignment of the relief operations carried out by different actors and to identify gaps. The mission also met with local NGOs implementing most activities to help people in dire need who have now lived through six months of the war., The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, highlighted the importance of yesterday’s and other missions to understand the needs of the people living in the most-affected oblasts. “We know first-hand what the remaining residents of Mykolaiv have to go through on a daily basis. On the visits to the city and surrounding areas, my colleagues have seen people, most of whom are older, with empty bottles desperately trying to find a water distribution point,” she said., The latest deliveries represent only a fraction of what humanitarian partners have been providing to support the most vulnerable people, who had no choice but to stay in Mykolaiv. “The city is completely cut off from the centralized water supply,” reminded Ms. Brown. Medical services are also becoming increasingly limited in Mykolaiv, and the city now hosts less than half of its pre-war population of nearly 500,000., Since the start of the war, humanitarian organizations have provided aid to over 540,000 people across Mykolaivska oblast. The work increased in scale in August. WFP has delivered food parcels to cover the needs of over 150,000 families for a month. UNICEF has distributed hygiene supplies for 59,000 people, including 11,000 children, as well as medical equipment and medicines to a hospital in Mykolaiv. Water management companies in Mykolaivska oblast have received purifying chemicals that will allow them to provide safe water to 26,000 people. Also, non-food items, including blankets and solar lamps, were delivered by UNHCR and are expected to benefit over 900 people. And UNHCR has provided refrigerators, cooking appliances, washing machines and fans to centres hosting internally displaced people. Other aid partners working in Mykolaivska oblast continue to provide other types of assistance, such as trucking in water to Mykolaiv city., “We are working non-stop to sustain and increase our support in Mykolaivska oblast but also to other areas heavily affected by Russia’s war on Ukraine. The humanitarian community is already prepositioning supplies to meet the current needs and help people prepare for the upcoming cold months. We will do all we can to ensure that the most vulnerable receive the assistance they require and deserve. They will not be left behind,” Ms. Brown added.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/urgently-needed-life-saving-supplies-delivered-people-mykolaiv

Logistics and Telecommunications",31 Aug 2022,"Background, Following the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the country’s security situation deteriorated rapidly, leaving an estimated 17.7 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The intense military escalation has resulted in loss of life and injuries, as well as massive destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure, interrupting critical services. People living in active conflict areas have endured months of hostilities without adequate access to water, health care, education, food security, protection, and other essential services. Since the start of the war, humanitarian organisations in Ukraine have prioritised the rapid expansion of existing life-saving operations in the east and the expansion of assistance to all regions of the country. However, the war shows no signs of abating and continues to drive humanitarian needs across the country. 1 It is anticipated that the limitations of the logistics capacities will continue to constrain humanitarian operations, with supply routes unlikely to simplify while needs are increasing with the ongoing conflict and large-scale initiatives such as winterisation., To support responding humanitarian organisations in their delivery of assistance to affected populations, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Cluster Approach was activated in Ukraine for Logistics on 3 March 2022., Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks, The volatile security situation remains the most significant challenge for the planning and implementation of humanitarian response activities, particularly in eastern and southern areas. Based on the findings of the Gaps and Needs Analysis (GNA), completed at the end of June, the Logistics Cluster and partners have identified the following logistics gaps and bottlenecks:, • The current security situation in Ukraine is creating difficulties for planning and executing aid delivery, including the forward movement and staging of humanitarian cargo. Further, as conflict continues, it is anticipated that mounting damage to road infrastructure will further constrain humanitarian operations., • While the commercial logistics sector is well developed, due to the conflict, many private sector companies relocated to the west, leading to limited logistics services currently available in the country’s east. There are also limitations on labour force that would otherwise be available, particularly to support the movement of cargo to hard-to-reach areas., • Fuel shortages are impacting the operational capacity of humanitarian organisations and pose constraints for humanitarians’ access to fuel for light vehicles, as well as for their transport contractors., • The ability to secure storage space in and around hard-to-reach areas has been constrained., • The conflict has resulted in the closure of all airports and seaports. Shipping lines have also suspended their services from the country and diverted their vessels to other Black Sea ports until further notice. There is significant pressure on the land borders that remain open to facilitate the majority of the country’s imports and exports, with long waiting times.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-concept-operations-september-2022

Since the start of the war, humanitarian organisations in Ukraine have prioritised the rapid expansion of existing life-saving operations in the east and the expansion of assistance to all regions of the country. However, the war shows no signs of abating and continues to drive humanitarian needs across the country. 1 It is anticipated that the limitations of the logistics capacities will continue to constrain humanitarian operations, with supply routes unlikely to simplify while needs are increasing with the ongoing conflict and large-scale initiatives such as winterisation., To support responding humanitarian organisations in their delivery of assistance to affected populations, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Cluster Approach was activated in Ukraine for Logistics on 3 March 2022., Logistics Gaps and Bottlenecks, The volatile security situation remains the most significant challenge for the planning and implementation of humanitarian response activities, particularly in eastern and southern areas. Based on the findings of the Gaps and Needs Analysis (GNA), completed at the end of June, the Logistics Cluster and partners have identified the following logistics gaps and bottlenecks:, • The current security situation in Ukraine is creating difficulties for planning and executing aid delivery, including the forward movement and staging of humanitarian cargo. Further, as conflict continues, it is anticipated that mounting damage to road infrastructure will further constrain humanitarian operations., • While the commercial logistics sector is well developed, due to the conflict, many private sector companies relocated to the west, leading to limited logistics services currently available in the country’s east. There are also limitations on labour force that would otherwise be available, particularly to support the movement of cargo to hard-to-reach areas., • Fuel shortages are impacting the operational capacity of humanitarian organisations and pose constraints for humanitarians’ access to fuel for light vehicles, as well as for their transport contractors., • The ability to secure storage space in and around hard-to-reach areas has been constrained., • The conflict has resulted in the closure of all airports and seaports. Shipping lines have also suspended their services from the country and diverted their vessels to other Black Sea ports until further notice. There is significant pressure on the land borders that remain open to facilitate the majority of the country’s imports and exports, with long waiting times.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-concept-operations-september-2022

These actions significantly raise the risk of a nuclear accident or incident and endanger the population of Ukraine, neighboring states, and the international community. The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its troops from within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and respect Ukraine’s territory and sovereignty. We reaffirm that the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and the electricity that it produces rightly belong to Ukraine and stress that attempts by Russia to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid would be unacceptable. We underline that Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant should not be used for military activities or the storage of military material., The G7 Non-Proliferation Directors Group welcomes the IAEA-led mission announced by Director General Grossi for August 29, 2022, to address nuclear safety, security and safeguards concerns around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. We also welcome UN Secretary General Guterres’ efforts to provide necessary support to this mission. We continue to emphasize this visit must be conducted in a manner that respects full Ukrainian sovereignty over its territory., We reiterate our full and continued support for the IAEA. IAEA staff must be able to access all nuclear facilities in Ukraine timely, safely and without impediment, and engage directly, and without interference, with the Ukrainian personnel responsible for operating these facilities, which must be allowed to carry out its duties without threats or pressure and must be able to acquire information relevant to all the necessary technical elements pertaining to nuclear safety and security at the installations. The safety of all individuals implementing these efforts must be addressed to strengthen nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine., We reaffirm the importance of the Seven Pillars of Nuclear Safety and Security as outlined by Director General Grossi as being of particular importance and urgency to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants and support the IAEA in helping facilitate the implementation of these pillars in Ukraine to uphold the safety and security of their nuclear facilities., We intend to continue to support the IAEA financially and technically, including through its technical assistance plan for Ukraine, in its efforts to ensure the nuclear safety and security of, and the application of safeguards to, Ukraine’s nuclear power plants., We express our grave concern about recent malicious cyber activity against Ukraine’s nuclear power company. We also intend to continue to support cyber security in Ukraine., As founders of the G7-led Global Partnership, we have worked together with Ukraine for more than 20 years to increase the safety and security of its nuclear facilities. We therefore have a particular responsibility to support international efforts aimed at sustaining these facilities and assisting Ukraine in countering the serious risks Russia’s war of aggression poses to the safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear installations., We intend to make use of the G7 Global Partnership initiative and the Global Partnership meeting in Berlin in October 2022 to invite IAEA representatives to outline possible areas of support to the IAEA’s efforts. We also intend to continue to raise the issue of nuclear safety and security in Ukraine within IAEA fora, including at the upcoming IAEA Board of Governors and IAEA General Conference meetings., We deeply regret that Russia blocked consensus at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference because it refused to accept responsibility for the grave situation around the safeguards, safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",30 Aug 2022,"Humanitarian organizations carried out a joint mission and delivered urgently needed life-saving supplies to people in Mykolaiv as part of efforts to scale up support for over 550,000 people in need across Mykolaivska oblast., (Kyiv, 30 August 2022) Yesterday, the last of the six truckloads of humanitarian assistance for 3,000 people sent over the past week arrived in Mykolaiv. These deliveries provided by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP) will help ensure that aid workers on the ground can reach people with food, necessary household items and other non-food items. The trucks also brought medical supplies that will be distributed by local authorities to enable hospitals in the city to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients., Also yesterday, during the visit led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, representatives of UN agencies and NGOs met with oblast and local authorities to ensure the continuous coordination and alignment of the relief operations carried out by different actors and to identify gaps. The mission also met with local NGOs implementing most activities to help people in dire need who have now lived through six months of the war., The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, highlighted the importance of yesterday’s and other missions to understand the needs of the people living in the most-affected oblasts. “We know first-hand what the remaining residents of Mykolaiv have to go through on a daily basis. On the visits to the city and surrounding areas, my colleagues have seen people, most of whom are older, with empty bottles desperately trying to find a water distribution point,” she said., The latest deliveries represent only a fraction of what humanitarian partners have been providing to support the most vulnerable people, who had no choice but to stay in Mykolaiv. “The city is completely cut off from the centralized water supply,” reminded Ms. Brown. Medical services are also becoming increasingly limited in Mykolaiv, and the city now hosts less than half of its pre-war population of nearly 500,000., Since the start of the war, humanitarian organizations have provided aid to over 540,000 people across Mykolaivska oblast. The work increased in scale in August. WFP has delivered food parcels to cover the needs of over 150,000 families for a month. UNICEF has distributed hygiene supplies for 59,000 people, including 11,000 children, as well as medical equipment and medicines to a hospital in Mykolaiv. Water management companies in Mykolaivska oblast have received purifying chemicals that will allow them to provide safe water to 26,000 people. Also, non-food items, including blankets and solar lamps, were delivered by UNHCR and are expected to benefit over 900 people. And UNHCR has provided refrigerators, cooking appliances, washing machines and fans to centres hosting internally displaced people. Other aid partners working in Mykolaivska oblast continue to provide other types of assistance, such as trucking in water to Mykolaiv city., “We are working non-stop to sustain and increase our support in Mykolaivska oblast but also to other areas heavily affected by Russia’s war on Ukraine. The humanitarian community is already prepositioning supplies to meet the current needs and help people prepare for the upcoming cold months. We will do all we can to ensure that the most vulnerable receive the assistance they require and deserve. They will not be left behind,” Ms. Brown added., For further information, please contact:, Lizaveta Zhuk, +380 50 344 16 94, lizaveta.zhuk@un.org, Viktoriya Hrubas, +380 50 382 4541, viktoriya.hrubas@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/urgently-needed-life-saving-supplies-delivered-people-mykolaiv-enukru

Protection and Human Rights",29 Aug 2022,"From 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 28 August 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 13,718 civilian casualties in the country: 5,663 killed and 8,055 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes.
OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., Civilian casualties from 1 to 28 August 2022*(individual cases verified by OHCHR)*, From 1 to 28 August 2022, OHCHR recorded 1,063 civilian casualties:, This included:, Per type of weapon/incident:, The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and**numbers may change as new information emerges over time. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., 1/ An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 21 August 2022) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred from 22 to 28 August only, as during these days OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported from 22 to 28 August have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-28-august-2022-enruuk

IAEA Support and Assistance Mission Sets Out to Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,29 Aug 2022,"Michael Amdi Madsen, IAEA Office of Public Information and Communication, We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said this morning as he and a team of IAEA experts and inspectors set off from the Agency’s headquarters in Vienna for the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) in Ukraine. The IAEA mission will help ensure nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant and undertake vital safeguards activities., Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant has been controlled by Russian forces since March but is operated by its Ukrainian staff. This month the site has come under repeated shelling, and last week temporarily lost connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line., In the most recent update from the power plant over the weekend, Ukraine informed the IAEA that the site had come under renewed shelling but that all safety systems remain operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels. The country said it did not yet have complete information on the nature of the damage from the shelling., The ISAMZ will bring clarity to the situation and help address any contradictory information about the status of the facility, its operation and the damage it has sustained. Speaking to the United Nations Security Council earlier this month about the deteriorating situation at Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, Mr Grossi said: “It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks.”, Once reaching Zaporizhzhya later this week, ISAMZ will assess the physical damage to the facilities, determine the functionality of the main and backup safety and security systems, and evaluate the working conditions of the control room staff. At the same time, the mission will undertake urgent safeguards activities to verify that nuclear material is used only for peaceful purposes., Photos from the outset of the mission are available on the IAEA’s Flickr.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-support-and-assistance-mission-sets-out-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine

Additionally, 80,867 women and children have been reached by UNICEF-supported gender-based violence prevention, risk mitigation and response services., • Since 24 February, 3,987,013 people in Ukraine have been able to access health care as a result of supplies distributed, directly by UNICEF or in partnership with implementing organizations. In addition, 3,486,360 people were provided with access to safe drinking water and 538,728 people received critical water, sanitation and hygiene supplies., • Since 24 February, 760,276 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education and 280,326 children have benefited from learning interventions with supplies provided by UNICEF., • At least 972 children in Ukraine have been killed or injured since the war erupted. Six months on, fighting remains heavy in eastern and southern parts of the country. Humanitarian access to affected children and families remains restricted. Additional concerns include the risk of outbreaks of acute waterborne diseases and the onset of harsh winter conditions., • The updated inter-agency Flash Appeal estimates 17.7 million people in Ukraine to be in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, an increase of 2 million people compared to April 2022. UNICEF continues to scale up programmes to sustain critical services, save lives and mitigate against protection risks, including with winter approaching., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Six months into the war, at least 17.7 million people have been affected in Ukraine, 1 nearly one-third of the country’s population. An estimated 6.6 million people are internally displaced,the majority being women and children trying to find safety across the country and facing risks of exploitation, gender-based violence (GBV) and family separation.
Although over 5.5 million internally displaced people have returned home and the overall number of people uprooted by the war has gradually decreased since May, vulnerabilities among displaced families are reported to remain high: 46 per cent are families with children aged 5 to 17 years., As of 15 August, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has verified over 13,000 civilian casualties (5,514 people killed, 7,698 injured) since the start of the war. At least 972 children in Ukraine have been killed or injured by violence since the war erupted nearly six months ago, an average of over five children killed or injured daily.
These are just figures the UN has been able to verify and the true number is likely much higher., The war shows no signs of abating, with fighting concentrated in eastern and southern Ukraine. Safety concerns are high over military activity around Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while risk of outbreaks of acute waterborne diseases, due to damaged water supply and sanitation systems and limitations in water treatment consumables, is becoming heightened in the east and south of the country., As the conflict persists, Ukraine’s harsh winter is fast approaching. For vulnerable children and their families, this can significantly increase costs of living at a time when basic needs have escalated due to the conflict. UNICEF is rolling out a winter response to save lives and prevent or mitigate protection risks, especially for women and children. Critical assistance will help address extreme weather-related causes of poor health and negative coping mechanisms.
On 30 July, the Government of Ukraine announced mandatory evacuations from Donetsk region to central and western oblasts, due, reportedly, to the destruction of gas pipelines in the region and, as a result, the authorities’ inability to provide heating and other basic services during the winter., Ukraine is gradually increasing grain exports, as part of a United Nations brokered deal to export produce trapped by the war. On 1 August, a first shipment since the escalation of the war in February marked a crucial step toward unblocking millions of tons of crops and easing global food prices. Grain exports are now continuing from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea – Odesa, Chernomorsk and Yuzhny., The European Union (EU) has also granted candidate status to Ukraine which, as an EU candidate country, will undergo reforms to align the legislative, policy and institutional framework on children’s rights with international and EU standards. This provides an opportunity in the medium to long term, to integrate Ukraine’s reform agenda with a child-centred and resilience-building recovery plan, to achieve sustainable results for children in the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-19-26-july-24-august-2022

Update 96 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (28 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,28 Aug 2022,"Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of renewed shelling in recent days at the site of the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), but it said all safety systems remained operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., As previously reported, the ZNPP has continued access to off-site electricity after the plant temporarily lost connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line on Thursday. In addition, both reactor units that were disconnected from the electricity grid during Thursday’s power cuts are operating again after being re-connected on Friday. The other four units at ZNPP were disconnected before Thursday’s events and remained in shutdown., There had been shelling in the area of the ZNPP on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, but Ukraine did not yet have complete information on the nature of the damage, Director General Grossi said. The shelling had hit the area of the plant’s two so-called special buildings, both located about 100 meters from the reactor buildings, as well as one overpass area. Those buildings house facilities including water treatment plants, equipment repair shops or waste management facilities. There was also damage on some water pipelines at the site but they had been repaired., All measurements of radioactivity at the ZNPP site were within normal range, and there was no indication of any hydrogen leakage, Director General Grossi said, citing information from Ukraine., The latest shelling once again underlined the risk of a potential nuclear accident at the ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant (NPP), which is controlled by Russian forces since early March but operated by its Ukrainian staff., Director General Grossi said he was continuing his consultations with all parties with the aim to send an IAEA expert mission to the plant in the next few days to help ensure nuclear safety and security there. The planned mission would assess the physical damage to the ZNPP’s facilities, determine whether the main and back-up safety and security systems were functional and evaluate the staff’s working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-96-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-28-august-2022
Ukraine: Russian sham trials of prisoners of war in Mariupol ‘illegal and unacceptable’,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,26 Aug 2022,"Any moves by Russian-backed armed groups to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in a so-called ‘international tribunal’ in Mariupol are illegal and abusive, and a further act of cruelty against a city that has already suffered extensively under Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Amnesty International said today., In recent days, concerns have mounted after several reports and pictures shared on social media appear to show cages being built inside the Mariupol Philharmonic Hall to allegedly restrain prisoners who will be put on trial. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab confirmed that pictures posted on Facebook by Mariupol City Council were consistent with the interior of the Mariupol Philharmonic Hall., International law prohibits a detaining power from prosecuting prisoners of war for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of armed conflict. Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war charged with crimes are entitled to due process and a fair trial, which can only take place in a regularly constituted court., “Any attempts by Russian authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in so-called ‘international tribunals’ set up by armed groups under Russia’s effective control in Mariupol are illegal and unacceptable,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia., “International humanitarian law prohibits courts being set up solely to try prisoners of war. Wilfully stripping fair trial rights from prisoners of war, which is precisely what Russia’s action will do, amounts to a war crime. The Geneva Conventions also state clearly that prisoners of war are protected from prosecution for taking part in hostilities., “By staging such sham ‘trials’, Russia – as the occupying power – is making a mockery of justice and a public theatre of courts, transforming them into vehicles for propaganda., “To choose Mariupol as host of these ‘tribunals’ is particularly cruel and shocking, given Russia’s recent relentless attacks and siege which turned the city into a wasteland before its capture in May. Amnesty International investigated a Russian air strike on the Donetsk Regional Academic Drama Theatre in Mariupol and concluded that Russian forces had deliberately targeted civilians, an attack amounting to a clear war crime.”, Rights of Ukrainian POWs, Russian forces and Russian-backed armed groups must give independent monitors full access to Ukrainian prisoners of war. Amnesty International shares concerns raised by the UN’s human rights agency (OHCHR) that Ukrainian prisoners of war have been held without access to independent monitors, “exposing them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession”., Amnesty International also shares OHCHR’s concern that public statements by Russian officials deeming Ukrainian prisoners of war to be ‘war criminals’ directly undermines the presumption of innocence, a fundamental fair trial guarantee., In recent years, Amnesty International has consistently documented the violation of the right to a fair trial in Russia, including endemic use of torture, fabrication of evidence, and politically-motivated prosecutions. These concerns are substantially increased when it comes to ‘trials’ by armed groups in Russian-occupied territories., Amnesty International has also previously documented numerous human rights abuses by such groups since they took control over parts of eastern Ukraine under Russian patronage, including abductions, killings, unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture and other ill-treatment, and suppression of dissent., Amnesty International is also calling for an immediate international investigation into other alleged war crimes, including the 29 July explosion in Olenivka village that killed more than 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war held by forces of the so-called ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ in eastern Ukraine. It is imperative that Russian authorities allow international investigators to visit the site to launch a comprehensive probe., Third Geneva Convention, Protections for prisoners of war facing criminal proceedings are contained in Articles 82 to 108 of the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII). As Article 84 provides, they may only be tried by courts that offer “the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognized”., In addition, Article 13 of GCIII states: “Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.”, Accountability for war crimes, Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here., Amnesty International has called repeatedly for Russian forces responsible for violations to be held to account and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-sham-trials-prisoners-war-mariupol-illegal-and-unacceptable

Note to correspondents: Statement by the United Nations Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative Amir Abdulla (27 August 2022),News and Press Release,UN SG,Food and Nutrition,27 Aug 2022,"Today, the exports of grains and other foodstuffs under the Black Sea Grain Initiative surpassed one million metric tons. This is a remarkable achievement made possible by the collective efforts and hard work of all representatives at the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul in its first month., Since the JCC started its operations on 1 August, it has enabled dozens of voyages through the Black Sea. Today, its joint teams have conducted the 100th inspection on board approved cargo vessels. Through this unique operation grains and other food from Ukraine are once again en route to three continents so far., As the world grapples with food insecurity and high prices, the importance of this Initiative is clear. As increased volumes of Ukraine’s agricultural production are now heading to market by sea, confidence has grown in the food and shipping industries, driving down prices and reducing risk., While this agreement covers commercial operations for the resumption of exports, the Initiative has also enabled the World Food Programme to restart purchasing wheat from Ukraine for its humanitarian operations in hunger-struck countries, like Ethiopia and Yemen., These are all important first steps but much more needs to be done. Across the world, high prices in fuel and fertilizer, climate change and conflict are placing immense pressure on farmers and consumers alike and driving millions more into poverty and hunger., The silos in Ukraine are still stocked with millions of tons of produce from previous harvests. The Black Sea Grain Initiative has started creating some space but much more grain needs to shift to make space for the new harvest., Equally important and urgent is the export of fertilizer, including ammonia, under this Initiative, so that farmers across the world can continue food production for next year at an affordable cost., These million tons are just a beginning: the world cannot afford to have food and fertilizer held up by anything. Every shipment cleared through this route helps to calm markets, boost food supplies and keep farmers producing., For more info, contact: Ismini Palla (Ms), Black Sea Grain Initiative, Joint Coordination Centre, palla@un.org , +962770996330 (Mobile/WhatsApp/Signal)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/note-correspondents-statement-united-nations-coordinator-black-sea-grain-initiative-amir-abdulla-27-august-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",26 Aug 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Six months of Russia’s war on Ukraine have caused death and suffering on a dramatic scale and led to a grave humanitarian crisis., Today, nearly 18 million people – 40 per cent of the country’s population – need humanitarian assistance and the situation is expected to deteriorate further in the winter months., A strike on 24 August left a group of civilians killed and injured close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine. Other attacks were reported on the same day., In total, over 840 civilians were killed or injured in the first three weeks of August alone, and more than 13,400 since the war began., Humanitarians assisted 12 million people. Yet, obstructions imposed on aid workers prevented or limited assistance in areas beyond the control of the Ukrainian Government., General security and humanitarian situation, The war in Ukraine reached the six-month mark with intense hostilities driving increasing humanitarian needs across the entire front line and in large parts of the east and south of the country. Nearly 18 million people – 40 per cent of the country’s entire population – need humanitarian assistance, with massive destruction of civilian infrastructure disrupting access to critical services, particularly water and health care. With the winter approaching, the situation will likely deteriorate further, and a new wave of displacement is expected, particularly from the east and heavily destroyed towns, where people have no access to gas or electricity, or are living in damaged houses. Some 628,000 private households and businesses in Ukraine remains without electricity due to the hostilities – more than half, 381,000, located in Donetska oblast, according to the Ukrainian authorities., Over the last week, continued fighting and shelling in eastern and southern Ukraine, and strikes elsewhere in other areas, caused additional destruction of civilian infrastructure and a large number of civilian deaths and injuries. On 24 February, a strike left a group of civilians killed and injured close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation later informed that the attack targeted a military train at the Chaplyne railway station in the Dnipropetrovska oblast, killing, according to them, servicemen of the reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and destroying military equipment that was being transported to the Donbas region. The strike, however, reportedly also harmed civilians and civilian objects in the surrounding areas. The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said she was truly shocked by the killing of civilians, including children, who died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or travelling with their families. She said the human toll of the attack in Chaplyne is just one more example of the level of suffering that this war is causing the people of Ukraine. Several other attacks across the country also killed civilians over the last week. Recent days have also seen intense shelling of frontline cities, including Nikopol and Zelenodolsk, in Dnipropetrovska oblast, where hostilities have left a path of destruction, with dozens of houses damaged, as well as schools, shops and pharmacies., In the eastern Donetska oblast, more than 120 civilian casualties were reported just last weekend, from 18 to 21 August, according to authorities on both sides of the front line. At least 12 civilians were reported by the oblast authorities to have been killed and another 25 injured in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with the cities of Avdiivka and Bakhmut coming under continuous shelling. Twelve civilians were also reported to have been killed and 52 more injured in non-Governmentcontrolled areas (NGCA) during the same period, and Donetsk city was reported to have come under intensive shelling 23 August. Approximately 100 houses were also reportedly damaged in both GCA and NGCA as well as other civilian buildings including educational facilities., Kharkiv was also hit, and other parts of Kharkivska oblast continue to suffer daily air attacks. Rights groups reported that missile strikes in Kharkiv overnight 17 to 18 August resulted in a relatively high number of civilian casualties – with 17 people reportedly killed and 32 injured. Meanwhile, other cities and oblasts also continued to be impacted by the hostilities.
The southern oblast of Mykolaivska also reportedly continued to come under daily shelling during the week, including 20 August – when a missile reportedly struck a residential building in the city of Voznesensk injuring 14 people, including three children., Tensions continued to rise over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), located in the city of Enerhodar in NGCA of Zaporizka oblast, with more fighting reported. UN Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking 18 August during his second visit to Ukraine since the start of the war, said he remained “gravely concerned” about the unfolding situation and that “common sense must prevail to avoid any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant.” He said the UN Secretariat supports sending an International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) inspection mission, provided both Ukraine and Russia agree, and that meanwhile the area needs to be demilitarized. It was subsequently reported that on 22 August a civilian car was caught in shelling and a heating distribution point was damaged in Enerhodar – and that the driver was reportedly killed and a second person critically injured. A mission from the IAEA to assess the situation of the plant is expected to take place in the coming days.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-24-aug-2022-enukru
President Macron reiterates support for IAEA mission to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,26 Aug 2022,"Joanne Liou, IAEA Office of Public Information and Communication, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi met with President Emmanuel Macron yesterday in Paris, in an important step to the IAEA’s imminent mission to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. President Macron, who reiterated his support of the IAEA’s activities, has played key role in facilitating the mission. That mission would assess the physical damage to the facilities, determine whether the main and backup safety and security systems are functional and evaluate the staff’s working conditions, in addition to performing urgent safeguards activities on the site. The plant, Europe’s largest, has been occupied by Russian forces since early March but is operated by Ukrainian staff. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to an IAEA mission in talks with President Macron, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed the parameters with the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan., In his address to the UN Security Council earlier this month, Mr Grossi called for cooperation from both sides of the conflict to allow for a mission to the Zaporizhzhya plant. The IAEA has not been able to visit Zaporizhzhya in south-eastern Ukraine since before the conflict began more than six months ago. Ukraine informed the Agency this week that renewed shelling caused additional damage in the area of Zaporizhzhya. Mr Grossi expressed the urgent need to send an IAEA mission to help stabilize the nuclear safety and security situation., “The serious nuclear safety and security risks facing the facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, underlines the need for an IAEA expert mission to go there,” Mr Grossi said. “I am gravely concerned about the extremely stressful and challenging working conditions under which Ukrainian management and staff are operating the plant.”, France is among 12 countries of the IAEA’s Response and Assistance Network (RANET) that has provided specialized equipment to Ukraine in response to a request for needed equipment for the safe and secure operation of its nuclear facilities. In July, Ukraine received a large batch of radiation protection and monitoring equipment provided by France and Australia and delivered by the IAEA., Nuclear non-proliferation, Mr Grossi also met with French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Thursday to discuss continuing efforts to ensure that nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful purposes. “Our efforts are critical to address the challenges facing nuclear non-proliferation,” Mr Grossi said., At the most recent IAEA Board of Governors meeting in June, Mr Grossi stated that the IAEA cannot confirm the correctness and completeness of Iran’s declaration under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. France has been supportive of the IAEA’s work in monitoring and verifying Iran’s nuclear programme and of its efforts to maintain a continuity of knowledge with respect to the Tehran’s nuclear activities., Earlier this month, at the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Mr Grossi called on leaders to “come together and recommit to the noble principles enshrined in the NPT: nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and to promote cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy.”, Nuclear energy and peaceful applications, France has been a member of the IAEA since 1957 and operates 56 nuclear power reactors, which make up over 70 per cent of the country’s electricity generation. “France is already a world leader in low carbon energy generation, and nuclear energy has a major role to play in that,” Mr Grossi said., The country is an active participant and contributor to the IAEA’s technical cooperation programme. “France is an important partner, and the country’s support to the programmes and initiatives goes a long way in helping our Member States get access to nuclear technology and expertise in many areas, including food and agriculture and cancer care,” Mr Grossi said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/president-macron-reiterates-support-iaea-mission-ukraines-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant
Update 95 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (26 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,26 Aug 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) continued to have access to off-site electrical power for cooling and other safety functions and that one of its reactor units had been reconnected to the national grid, a day after the plant temporarily lost connection to a vital power line, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The ZNPP’s connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) line was restored yesterday afternoon after two power cuts and the disconnection from the grid of the plant’s two operating reactors, one of which was reconnected today, Ukraine said., Director General Grossi said he welcomed the restoration of the external power line. But he added that the power cuts had highlighted the potential vulnerability of a major nuclear power plant (NPP) located in the middle of an active conflict zone and the critical importance of sending an IAEA expert mission to the six-reactor facility as soon as possible to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there., “I remain engaged in active and intense consultations with all parties to organize and lead an IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhya NPP very soon, hopefully in the next few days. As yesterday’s sudden loss of the external power line showed, the IAEA’s presence at the site is urgently needed,” he said., Ukraine told the IAEA that the ZNPP was now connected both to the 750 kV power line forming part of the national electricity grid and to a 330 kV line linking it to a nearby thermal power facility that can also provide off-site power if required., During yesterday’s power cuts, emergency diesel generators were started in accordance with plant safety requirements in the event of such a power cut, but the 330 kV back-up line had remained connected and operational throughout that time, Ukraine said. The ZNPP normally has four external 750 kV power lines, but three of them were lost earlier during the conflict., Power lines are primarily used to transport electricity from an operating nuclear facility through the grid in order to supply households, factories and others. NPPs also require a constant supply of electricity for their routine operations and to power the safety systems needed during an emergency or accident. If the external power line is lost, as was the case at the ZNPP yesterday, it is essential to have a back-up power source for the safety systems, in order to prevent any accident with radiological consequences for the public and the environment. The back-up power can be provided by the emergency diesel generators, or by additional reserve power lines., A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-95-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-26-august-2022

It said the ZNPP remained connected to a 330 kV line from the nearby thermal power facility that can provide back-up electricity if needed., Ukraine also informed the IAEA that as a result of the cuts in the 750 kV power line, the ZNPP’s two operating reactor units were disconnected from the electricity grid and their emergency protection systems were triggered, while all safety systems remained operational, the Director General said. All six units remained disconnected from the grid also after the power line was restored, Ukraine said., There was no information immediately available on the direct cause of the power cuts. The six-reactor ZNPP normally has four external power lines, but three of them were lost earlier during the conflict. The IAEA remains in close contact with Ukraine and will provide updated information as soon as it becomes available., A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict.

Six months on in Ukraine: Local and national women’s organizations are leading the response to the conflict but are side-lined by humanitarian actors,News and Press Release,CARE,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",24 Aug 2022,"24 August 2022. Six-months after the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, women and girls continue to face life-threatening protection risks. Meanwhile, women’s rights and women-led organizations are side-lined in the humanitarian response. Today, we highlight the perspectives of some of CARE’s women-led partners in Ukraine, Poland and Romania on their participation in humanitarian coordination and decision-making.
Women and children make up 90 percent of Ukrainian refugees, and women and girls represent 65 percent of the internally displaced people in Ukraine . Women and girls are facing risks inside and outside their country, including gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse and human trafficking.
Women are also among the frontline responders in the humanitarian crisis, leading efforts to deliver essential and lifesaving support to the millions of crisis-affected people in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. Local and national women’s rights organizations (WROs) and women-led organizations (WLOs) know and understand the needs of affected people in their communities, are the first to reach them, and often have access to marginalized populations that international actors do not. They are also advocating for the rights of women and girls and are essential to increase the participation of those groups in processes and decisions that affect them now and will continue to impact them after the war.
Yet, local and national women’s organizations’ expertise, leadership and unique contributions to humanitarian action in Ukraine and neighbouring countries continue to be largely disregarded by humanitarian actors coordinating and managing the response., On the 6-month mark of the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, CARE stands by women’s rights and womenled organizations, that have played, and continue to play, a critical role in delivering aid and support to their communities and beyond, showing the world the power of locally driven, women-led humanitarian action.
CARE is partnering with 32 WLOs and WROs in Ukraine and neighbouring countries and is committed to amplifying their voices. Today, we highlight the perspectives of some of CARE’s women-led partners in Ukraine, Poland and Romania on their participation in humanitarian coordination and decision-making.
CARE calls on all actors coordinating and planning the response (and the recovery phase) to do more to ensure that women’s organizations are centre-stage in decision-making and are provided with the support they need, and the recognition they deserve., This is what our partners told us:, “We don't see women's CSOs involved in decision-making on any consistent basis. Local initiatives emerge to meet the dire needs and rely heavily on their own networks of friends and relatives to fund or provide for these needs, and they don't know about the state-organized efforts or supplies or funds provided by international organizations or donors. Informational donors' events on how humanitarian aid is organised and coordinated were heavy with lingo and slim on entry points for local initiatives and smaller and newer CSOs. We see little to no outreach work towards local initiatives and CSOs.” (WRO, Ukraine), “Civil society organizations are poorly represented in decision-making, especially at the local level, namely in small towns and villages. This is because many CSOs do not know about the decisionmaking mechanism, and the local authorities do not inform them about the possibility of participating in decision-making. CSOs are predominantly approached to deliver humanitarian aid – to bring food, clothes or buy something for IDPs.” (WRO, Ukraine), “Sexual and reproductive health rights need to be highly prioritized in the humanitarian response.
As a leading expert SRHR organization in Poland who took over the burden of providing assistance to Ukrainian women and girls, we should be co-leading in the organization of the SRHR response. (SRHR NGO, Poland), “On the one hand, we do feel involved in the coordination process because we are invited to the coordination meetings and we are consulted on humanitarian aid documents. On the other hand, the process seems to be quite bureaucratic, and we are not always sure what the decisions and outcomes of our participation are, and above all, if we reach out enough with our pathway of SRHR support to those who need it.” (SRHR NGO, Poland), Women’s organizations reported gaps and challenges in coordination, communication, and information. The limited adequate and targeted support to WROs and WLOsfrom those mandated to coordinate the response is a significant challenge. They provided practical recommendations to improve the quality of information sharing, without increasing the quantity of over-burdensome meetings, and thereby enhance their role in decision-making fora., “International donors and organizations should step up their outreach game and bring together local authorities, hosting communities, vulnerable groups, IDPs, and local CSOs -- with a separate attention to women's CSOs and women's peacebuilding activists even through joined retreats.” (WRO, Ukraine), “[We need] better communication between authorities and civil society and a real dialogue and consultation, not just information about the decisions taken.” (WLO, Romania), “The humanitarian response needs to be communicated to local partners in more direct and accessible ways. The language used in communication with local NGOs could be simpler. Local actors should not be pressured to learn UN expert jargon to be able to meaningfully participate in the decision-making process on the humanitarian response.” (SRHR NGO, Poland)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-ukraine-local-and-national-womens-organizations-are-leading-response-conflict-are-side-lined-humanitarian-actors

Growing Civilian Toll from Russian Cluster Munition Attacks [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Mine Action,25 Aug 2022,"Global Report Tracks New Use, Production of Widely Rejected Weapon, (Geneva, August 25, 2022) -- Russian forces' repeated use of cluster munitions has caused predictable and lasting harm to hundreds of Ukrainian civilians, Human Rights Watch said today in releasing the 100-page global Cluster Munition Monitor 2022 report. Both Russia and Ukraine should reject the use of cluster munitions and join the 2008 international treaty banning them., Ukraine is the only country in the world where cluster munitions are being used today, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of Russian cluster munition attacks have been documented, reported, or alleged in at least 10 of Ukraine's 24 regions, or oblasts. Preliminary data shows at least 689 civilian casualties from cluster munition attacks in Ukraine between February and July 2022. Ukrainian forces also appear to have used cluster munitions rockets on at least two occasions., ""The immediate and long-term suffering that cluster munitions cause civilians make their use today in Ukraine unconscionable as well as invariably unlawful,"" said Mary Wareham, arms advocacy director at Human Rights Watch and editor of the Cluster Munition Monitor 2022. ""All countries should condemn the use of these weapons under any circumstances."", Cluster munitions can be fired from the ground by artillery, rockets, and mortars, or dropped by aircraft. They typically open in the air, dispersing multiple bomblets or submunitions over a wide area. Many submunitions fail to explode on initial impact, leaving dangerous duds that can indiscriminately maim and kill like landmines for years, until they are cleared and destroyed., A Human Rights Watch investigation in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, found that in May and June, Russian forces launched cluster munition rockets whose submunitions struck homes, city streets, and parks, as well as an outpatient clinic at a maternity hospital and a cultural center. A May 12 attack on the nearby town of Derhachi instantly killed a woman cooking in her garden and severed the legs of her husband, who died hours later., The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, which 110 countries have ratified and 13 more have signed, comprehensively prohibits these weapons. There have been no confirmed reports or allegations of new use, production, or transfers of cluster munitions by any state party since the convention was adopted on May 30, 2008. However, no country has ratified the convention since 2020, and neither Russia nor Ukraine are parties., Cluster Munition Monitor 2022 tracks efforts to eradicate cluster munitions by all countries, regardless of whether they have joined the treaty. In 2021, for the first time in a decade, no new casualties from cluster munition attacks were recorded, although there were 147 new cluster munition casualties in eight countries from cluster munition remnants. Children accounted for two-thirds of all casualties for which the age of victims was recorded. This notable decline in new cluster munition casualties has been eclipsed by the new use in Ukraine since February 2022., Human Rights Watch found that the strict standard set by the Convention on Cluster Munitions has affected government development and acquisition plans as cluster munitions are being phased out of service in many of the 47 countries with stocks that have not joined the convention., In 2022, Russia has used both stocks of old cluster munitions and newly developed ones in Ukraine. There's no evidence to suggest cluster munitions, as defined by the convention, have been transferred among the artillery, rocket systems, and other weapons that the Ukrainian government has received from third parties in 2022., Other military powers have bucked the positive trend away from cluster munitions. China and Iran are actively researching and developing new types of cluster munitions., The United States last manufactured cluster munitions in 2016 but has not joined the international ban or committed to never produce them in the future., Under the convention, 37 countries that once possessed cluster munitions have destroyed their stocks, collectively destroying nearly 1.5 million cluster munitions containing 178 million submunitions. The total is 99 percent of all cluster munitions that parties to the convention have reported stockpiling., In 2021 and the first half of 2022, Bulgaria, Peru, and Slovakia destroyed at least 1,658 cluster munitions and 46,733 submunitions from their stockpiles. Under the convention, countries contaminated by cluster munition remnants cleared more than 58 square kilometers of affected land in 2021, destroying at least 78,424 submunitions and cluster munition remnants., The Cluster* Munition Monitor *is the annual monitoring report by the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), the global coalition of nongovernmental organizations co-founded and chaired by Human Rights Watch. The report will be presented to countries attending the 10th annual meeting of the Convention on Cluster Munitions at the United Nations in Geneva on August 30-September 2., ""Russia's widespread use of cluster munitions in Ukraine is a sobering reminder of what the convention needs to overcome if it is to succeed in ending the human suffering these indiscriminate weapons cause,"" Wareham said. ""Governments that have yet to join the convention should review their position and join with others helping to rid the world of cluster munitions.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/growing-civilian-toll-russian-cluster-munition-attacks-enruuk
Media advisory: Humanitarian coordinator Denise Brown to meet people uprooted by the war in Eastern and Central Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,OCHA,Food and Nutrition,25 Aug 2022,"WHO:, WHAT:, WHEN:, WHERE:, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General Denise Brown is starting today a three-day mission to eastern and central Ukraine to see first-hand the humanitarian impact of the war and efforts undertaken by humanitarian organizations in the country to support the people affected. This will be Denise Brown’s first visit to eastern Ukraine since she assumed her role as Humanitarian Coordinator for the country, in late July., In Kryvyi Rih, Mrs. Brown is expected to meet people uprooted by the war and local authorities. The city is now home to more than 70,000 people who had to flee the horrors of the war in the east and in the south. In Kharkiv, where attacks and shelling have, once again, intensified over the last week, Mrs. Brown will visit a collective centre hosting people who lost their houses in the city or had to flee from other parts of Kharkivska oblast. She will meet humanitarian partners and authorities to discuss the response efforts and address possible gaps., On the last day of her visit, Assistant Secretary-General Denise Brown will be in Dnipro, which hosts the Humanitarian Hub coordinating life-saving operations in eastern Ukraine. She will have the opportunity to discuss with humanitarians the planned efforts to support people during the upcoming winter and the challenges faced by aid workers to provide assistance in areas close to the front line and areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine., Six months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, nearly 18 million people – around 40 per cent of the country’s entire population – need humanitarian aid. With the winter approaching, the situation will get even worse. Many are living in damaged houses and the lack of access to gas or electricity in large parts of the east becomes extremely concerning and could be a matter of life or death if people cannot heat their homes. The United Nations and humanitarian organizations, most of them Ukrainian national NGOs, reached more than 12 million people with critical aid since 24 February., For further information, please contact:

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Aug 2022,"As the war in Ukraine enters its sixth month, over 6.65 million people have been displaced within Ukraine and over 6 million Ukrainian refugees are residing in Europe., The war’s half-year point coincides with Ukrainian Independence Day, which in normal circumstances would see citizens celebrating 31 years of independence from Russia., Fierce fighting continues with indiscriminate and relentless bombardment of the eastern (Donetsk oblast) and southern (Mykolaiv oblast) regions of the country. Critical infrastructure, including gas, electricity, and water, have been destroyed increasing the vulnerability of thousands of refugees still living there., On August 1, The Government of Ukraine called for the compulsory mass evacuation of all civilians remaining in the Government-controlled areas of Donetsk oblast citing the upcoming winter and the inability of the local governments to provide safe and warm places for people to live., In a diplomatic breakthrough, on August 1, the first commercial ship sailed from Odesa to Lebanon, carrying over 26,000 tons of corn to the global market., Trócaire, through the Caritas Ukraine network, continues to provide humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the conflict, the Caritas Ukraine network has provided more than 2,089,911 services for more than 1,450,000 people. The focus of assistance continues to be on basic needs such as food kits (55%), hygiene kits (20%), services for IDPs in shelters (8%), water supply (7%)., During the first months of the war, all activities were aimed at emergency measures to respond to the humanitarian crisis, but currently there is further transfer into stabilising humanitarian aid: monthly food and hygiene assistance, case management and advocacy and permanent housing solutions., Caritas Ukraine has also started pilot activities to prepare for winter considering the damaged infrastructure for heating and electricity supply. Local offices located near the zone of active hostilities, are actively starting to distribute fuel for heating private homes in winter., Providing safe space for children, Not far from the West-Ukrainian city of Lviv, Caritas has built several homes for children who have lost their parents., These so-called ‘family-run orphanages’ provide a safe space for children where they can live, learn and grow with the support and warmth of a real family., Caritas Spes has built five of these houses for five families, each consisting of ten people. Some families have been living here for years now, while others have arrived recently after the violence in other parts of the country forced them to leave their homes., This is the case for Natalia Molar who came from a village near Kyiv with two of her children and now takes care of eight other displaced children as well., “We wanted to stay in our home as long as possible, but when the missiles started flying over our heads and a neighbouring village was occupied by the Russian military, we knew we had to leave,” Natalia said., “My husband and eldest son couldn’t come with us. They had to join the army. Now, they’re working on a military base and they call me every day to let me know they’re doing all right., It’s very hard to be divided as a family, but at least here we are safe and people are helping us. We calm them by saying that we are in a good place.”, “When we got here we had to sleep in a kindergarten. After a few days, Caritas assigned us this home. First, we had no idea what would happen. We expected to be sleeping in a railway station. In this place, we can live in the same condition as we did at home. We are very grateful for that.”, “From the moment we stepped out of the train, we felt amazing support from the people in western Ukraine. People are doing everything they can. The children now go to school. They received books and the teachers are great. They are doing really well and their grades are good.”, “My main concern is when this war will end. My son was supposed to go to university. What will he do now? I worry a lot about my family. The future is uncertain, so we try to only focus on tomorrow.”, “We have lots of hobbies and we try to entertain ourselves as much as we can. We play football and tennis. We often go fishing and we love to cook together. I can’t wait to have my son and husband with us again. I miss them so much.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-russia-invaded-ukraine-how-trocaire-responding
Six Months and 79 Years of Resilience in Kharkiv,News and Press Release,IOM,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",24 Aug 2022,"Kharkiv, 24 August 2022 – The destruction and loss of life following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War, and forever linked two different generations of Ukrainians, including those in Kharkiv., Six months into the war, the city whose pre-war population was roughly 1.4 million remains the epicentre of the heaviest fighting, shelled almost daily, a nightmare reminder of earlier war for the oldest residents of the city., Seventy-nine years ago, this region also fought for its freedom. On 23 August 1943, it was liberated from Nazi troops, a date now celebrated as Kharkiv Day, on the eve of Ukrainian Independence Day., Over 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes, seeking safety elsewhere in the country or protection abroad. Entire cities and villages have been razed and over 5,500 civilians have lost their lives, according to the United Nations., For many Kharkivians, lives are defined as Before and After., At 4 a.m. on 24 February, Ukraine’s second largest city took a fierce hit. Within 24 hours, Russian troops had reached the northern suburbs of the region’s capital just 30 kilometres from the Ukraine-Russia border. Despite outnumbering the Ukrainian forces, the invading army was unable to enter Kharkiv., “I am from Kharkiv, from the largest residential area in Ukraine – Saltivka, where about 400,000 people lived before the war,” says 21-year-old Tania, who has found a temporary home in Ivano-Frankivsk Region and participated in the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) Summer School for young leaders among displaced persons and members of hosted communities., “For two weeks, my family and I did not leave the metro (underground station) even for a minute. The metro became the main bomb shelter for the locals. I did not want to leave the city, because my grandparents remained behind. Only when they came to us in Kharkiv, I decided to flee from the war.”, According to a recent IOM survey, the biggest number – 28 per cent of the estimated 6.8 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine – fled from Kharkiv Region. The humanitarian needs of those who chose to stay or were unable to flee are immense., In May, Kharkiv received the first humanitarian convoy from IOM with much-needed items for people staying in the city’s shelters and hospitals, as well as hard-to-reach communities in areas under Ukrainian control., “Locals need solar lamps as there is no light, mattresses and blankets as it is damp and cold in shelters, tools for minor repairs for their damaged houses, hygiene kits,” explains Serhii, the head of Source of Revival, one of the biggest non-governmental organizations in the region and IOM’s implementing partner in Kharkiv Region., “Only war-affected people can understand the value of this help.”, In the first months of the war, the Source of Revival team’s working day began at 6 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m., when a curfew was set and any movement around the city was forbidden. The location of the warehouses had to be changed several times due to heavy shelling, missiles and air strikes., Not all drivers agreed to go to this dangerous area. The situation has since escalated; the number of casualties is growing but no one on the team has left Kharkiv. They put on bulletproof vests and protective helmets to deliver IOM’s assistance to those in dire need., Nadia, who is currently living on the outskirts of Kharkiv, fled her home in the city of Derhachi due to heavy shelling shortly after discovering she was pregnant in March., “Now, there is nothing left alive in Derhachi,” she recalls. “There is also shelling here, but not as fierce as in my hometown; then, when a missile hit a nearby school, we moved once again.”, Source of Revival brought tailored humanitarian aid from IOM directly to her temporary home as it was especially challenging for a pregnant woman to move around the unsafe city., The hardest part of the team’s work is delivering aid to communities that survived the Russian occupation. Although it takes time to de-mine the areas after Ukrainian forces have recovered them, NGOs endeavour to reach people in critical need as quickly as possible., “Some settlements were razed to the ground. There are many local Irpins and Buchas in our region,” a Source of Revival staff says, referring to two cities in Kyiv oblast occupied by Russia at the start of the war where evidence points to significant human rights abuses being committed against the civilians. “Exploitation, kidnapping for ransom, robbery, bullying, torture, rape, and sexual abuse of women, children, the elderly, and men. Some people are still missing.”, Humanitarian workers are helping local residents and identifying victims of conflict-related violence. All of them can go to the IOM centre for physical and psychosocial rehabilitation., Lately, Kharkiv has been receiving increasing numbers of displaced persons fleeing neighbouring Donetsk and Luhansk regions. And, despite the security situation, even Kharkiv residents are returning to their homes with high hopes., “They want to rebuild this place,” says Serhii, whose house was damaged by shelling as well. “But everything has changed: the infrastructure is damaged, houses are destroyed, there is no work, and part of the region is still occupied. Russian troops are trying to move closer to the city, so the threat remains, and chaotic shelling continues.”, According to authorities, over 1,000 civilians in Kharkiv Region were killed in the last 181 days, including 50 children, and this figure may not be final. Calm is deceptive here, and the situation can change in the blink of an eye. In one single night, on 18 August, 21 civilians died, and 44 were injured in Kharkiv Region as a result of a missile attack on a residential area. Nevertheless, as was the case 79 years ago, locals believe in their land and justice, revealing the same strength and character as their ancestors., “I draw power from my team. I understand that most of them could leave Kharkiv, but they stayed. They are the first to put on vests, helmets and go to help others,” says Serhii., Since May, Source of Revival has distributed more than 16,000 solar lamps, 7,000 blankets, 3,000 hygiene kits, 5,000 mattresses, 18,000 towels, 10,000 jerry cans, and other non-food assistance from IOM in Kharkiv Region. Deliveries are ongoing with funding from EU Civil Protection & Humanitarian Aid, European Union in Ukraine, US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), as well as the governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Denmark, Kuwait, South Korea, Sweden, and Slovakia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-and-79-years-resilience-kharkiv
"Ukraine’s Immediate Fate Important to World, Delegate Tells Security Council, Calling for Cessation of War",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,24 Aug 2022,"SC/15004　
9115TH MEETING (AM)　, Peacebuilding Chief Notes Human, Material Tolls Brought on by Russian Federation, Despite positive progress in exporting grain and other food products from Ukraine’s ports, the people of that country and beyond urgently need peace, the Secretary-General of the United Nations told the Security Council today, as Council members took stock of the now six-month-old conflict on the thirty-first anniversary of Ukraine’s independence., António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, briefed the Council on his recent visit to Ukraine where — due to the Black Sea Grain Initiative — dozens of ships have sailed in and out of Ukrainian ports loaded with over 720,000 metric tons of grains and other food products. He recalled seeing wheat pouring into the holds of cargo ships and the United Nations flag flying over vessels bound for the Horn of Africa, emphasizing that the Initiative is a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved “when we put people first”., Also spotlighting the other part of the deal — which allows Russian food and fertilizer unimpeded access to global markets — he called on all Governments and the private sector to cooperate to bring these goods to market. There will not be enough food in 2023 if the fertilizer market is not stabilized in 2022, he stressed, also calling for a massive scaling-up of support to developing countries reeling from the global food crisis as the shipment of grain and other foodstuffs “won’t mean much if countries cannot afford them”., He went on to express grave concern over the situation in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, underscoring that “the warning lights are flashing”. The security of the plant must be ensured, and he urged that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) be allowed to conduct a mission to the site as soon as possible. Noting the thirty-first anniversary of Ukraine’s independence, he underscored that “the people of Ukraine and beyond need peace, and they need peace now”., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, next briefed the Council that there is no end in sight to the conflict triggered by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. During the past 181 days, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 13,560 civilian casualties — 5,614 killed and 7,946 injured — and the actual numbers are considerably higher. She further voiced concern over the situation facing prisoners of war on both sides, stressing that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) must have unimpeded, confidential access to all places of detention., She also highlighted rising humanitarian needs, pointing out that at least 17.7 million people — 40 per cent of Ukraine’s population — require humanitarian assistance and protection. She additionally noted the worldwide repercussions of the war in Ukraine, citing a July estimate by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that up to 71 million people may have already been pushed into poverty in the three months following the start of the invasion. Stressing that the human and material toll of the war is tragic, colossal and evident — first and foremost for Ukraine and its people — she underscored: “It must end”., In the ensuing debate, many Council members expressed concern over the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the site and urging that IAEA be allowed to evaluate conditions there. While members also welcomed the positive development of resumed Ukrainian grain exports, some highlighted the continuing consequences for the world resulting from ongoing military hostilities in Ukraine., Kenya’s representative, spotlighting multilateralism as the last hope against a new world war, stressed that Ukraine’s immediate fate is important to the world. Unless the war is stopped through dialogue, it could be the first in a series of conflicts that historians term the “third world war”, he said, calling for intuitive, bold leadership from any and every country with influence to push the parties into dialogue., The representative of Brazil, also urging the parties to keep channels for dialogue open, pointed out that both reality and history demonstrate that closing that door is not the right approach to resolving conflict. It is in everyone’s best interests that the two countries are able to live side-by-side in the future, he added., The representative of the United Arab Emirates similarly called on leaders from both sides to commit to charting a path forward, with the support of the international community. The Charter of the United Nations provides many tools with which to end conflict, provided that the political will to use them exists. In this vein, she welcomed agreements to facilitate the export of grain, food supplies and fertilizers to global markets, but stressed that this “rare example of tangible progress” cannot be the last., On that point, the representative of the Russian Federation said that, while the Secretary-General’s “so-called ‘Black Sea Initiative’” is considered a sort of “success story”, only one of the 34 dry cargo ships went to Africa over four weeks of export operations. The true cause of global food security issues is Western sanctions, he stressed, calling on all involved to take the “package” nature of the initiative seriously and resolve the financial and logistical problems that impede the export of Russian food and fertilizers to the global market., Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, while noting that different parts of the world have different approaches and values, underscored that life, peace and economic prosperity have value everywhere in the world. Calling for the Russian Federation to be held accountable for its crimes of aggression against Ukraine, he underscored that, if Moscow is not stopped now, then “all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries”. “It is on the territory of Ukraine that the world’s future will be decided,” he said, adding that “our independence is your security”., At the outset of the meeting, the representative of the Russian Federation requested a procedural vote concerning the President of Ukraine’s participation in today’s meeting by video teleconference. Following statements by representatives of the Russian Federation and Albania, the Council extended an invitation to the President of Ukraine to participate in the meeting via video teleconference by a vote of 13 in favour to one against (Russian Federation), with one abstention (China)., Also speaking were representatives of the United States, Albania, France, Ireland, Norway, United Kingdom, Gabon, Ghana, India, Mexico and China, along with the European Union in its capacity as observer., The meeting began at 10:06 a.m. and ended at 12:34 p.m., Procedural Vote, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), objecting to the virtual participation of the President of Ukraine in today’s meeting, said that his country does not oppose the President’s participation; rather, he said that such participation must be in-person. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Council decided to work virtually, but such meetings were informal and, after the pandemic’s peak, the Council returned to the provisional rules of procedure. Stressing that the Council cannot make an exception for one country or one person, he pointed out that the meeting was announced a week in advance, that the President of Ukraine has travelled around the country to meet foreign delegations, that Ukraine’s Minister for Foreign Affairs has travelled abroad and that the Secretary-General has recently travelled to Ukraine. Reiterating that his country’s objection pertains specifically to the President’s participation by video teleconference, he called for a procedural vote on this matter., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that, while post-pandemic Rule 37 participation by video teleconference should be the exception, the democratically elected leader of a sovereign country cannot leave that country for reasons beyond his control. “We all know what those reasons are,” he said, emphasizing that the justification for this exception remains unchanged from when the Council previously agreed that the President of Ukraine could address the 15-member organ by video teleconference in April and June. Ukraine is at war, and the situation in that country requires the President to be there. Due to this unique situation, he supported the President’s participation via video teleconference and urged other members to do the same., The Council then adopted a proposal to extend an invitation to the President of Ukraine to participate in today’s meeting via video teleconference, pursuant to Rule 37, by a vote of 13 in favour to one against (Russian Federation), with one abstention (China)., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) voiced regret that Council members had spoken out against complying with the rules of the organ. “We can understand the logic of Kyiv’s Western backers…,” he said, expressing disappointment that other members today contributed to the erosion of the Council’s very foundation and practices. Despite his delegation’s position, it will hear Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy because “we have something to say to him as well”. He hoped that Mr. Zelenskyy would remain until the conclusion of today’s meeting. “We shall see whether Mr. Zelenskyy will be able to come to the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly as the head of the Ukrainian delegation or not, as the representative of Albania has claimed,” he said., Briefings, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, briefing the Council on his recent visit to Ukraine, said that the Black Sea Grain Initiative is progressing well. Dozens of ships have sailed in and out of Ukrainian ports — loaded with over 720,000 metric tons of grains and other food products — and he recalled seeing wheat pouring into the holds of cargo ships and the United Nations flag flying on vessels bound for the Horn of Africa where millions of people are at risk of famine. He said that the Initiative is a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved “when we put people first”, also spotlighting the other part of the deal that allows Russian food and fertilizer unimpeded access to global markets. All Governments and the private sector must cooperate to bring these goods to market, as there will not be enough food in 2023 if the fertilizer market is not stabilized in 2022. He also stressed that, while getting more food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and the Russian Federation at reasonable costs is vital to calm commodity markets, the shipment of grain and other foodstuffs “won’t mean much if countries cannot afford them”. He therefore called for a massive scaling-up of support to developing countries “getting hammered by the global food crisis”., He went on to express grave concern over the situation in and around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, underscoring that “the warning lights are flashing”. Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the plant are unacceptable, and any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. He called for the security of the plant to be ensured, for the facility to be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure and for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct a mission to the site as soon as possible. Also expressing concern over alleged violations of international humanitarian law, he stressed that such law protects prisoners of war and that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) must have access to such prisoners wherever they are held. Further, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine must be able to freely conduct its work to find the facts through safe, secure and unfettered access to all relevant places, persons and evidence. Noting the thirty-first anniversary of Ukraine’s independence, he underscored that “the people of Ukraine and beyond need peace, and they need peace now”., ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, recalled that on 23 February, the Council heard impassioned pleas to avert a war in Ukraine to no avail. Today, exactly six months later, there is no end in sight to the conflict triggered by the Russian Federation’s invasion, she said. The heaviest fighting is concentrated in the eastern Donbas region, in the south near Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and in the north-east near Kharkiv. However, virtually all corners of Ukraine are affected, and no one is out of reach of missile strikes. During the past 181 days, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had recorded 13,560 civilian casualties: 5,614 killed and 7,946 injured, she said, adding that actual numbers are considerably higher. Noting other figures documented by OHCHR, she underscored that the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of populated areas, killing civilians and wrecking hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure, are actions that may amount to war crimes., Voicing concern about the situation of prisoners of war on both sides, she said there is a need for unimpeded and confidential access by ICRC to all places of detention. Noting reports that the Russian Federation and affiliated armed groups in Donetsk are planning to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in a so-called “international tribunal” in Mariupol, she stressed that any tribunal must respect the protections afforded to all prisoners of war by international law, and that the failure to uphold those standards could amount to a war crime. Humanitarian needs continue to rise rapidly, she pointed out, noting that at least 17.7 million people, or 40 per cent of the Ukrainian population, need humanitarian assistance and protection, including 3.3 million children. “As winter approaches, the destruction caused by war, combined with the lack of access to fuel or electricity due to damaged infrastructure, could become a matter of life or death, if people are unable to heat their homes,” she warned. The United Nations ongoing winterization efforts aim to complement and support the work led by the Government of Ukraine., She went on to say that the United Nations revised flash appeal requires $4.3 billion to support 17.7 million people in need of assistance through December 2022. Donors have generously provided $2.4 billion, as of 19 August. The humanitarian response has scaled-up to 500 humanitarian organization partners reaching over 11.8 million people with at least one form of assistance. The war has severely impacted agriculture in Ukraine, leaving thousands of farmers without income, destroying grain storage facilities and exacerbating food insecurity among vulnerable groups. Noting the worldwide repercussions of the war in Ukraine, she said that in July, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that up to 71 million people may have already been pushed into poverty in the three months after the start of the war. The global financial situation remains volatile, she added, noting that energy markets remain under stress and inflation continued to accelerate in July, more drastically affecting developing and least developed countries., Noting that today’s grim six-month anniversary coincides with Ukraine’s National Day — an occasion to celebrate the country’s sovereignty and independence and proud heritage, she said the human and material toll of the war is tragic, colossal and evident, first and foremost, for Ukraine and its people. In closing, she said: “In deepening global divisions and exacerbating mistrust in our institutions, the war is weakening the foundations of our international system. The consequences of a breakdown in how the world manages questions of peace and security are frightening to contemplate. This war is not only senseless, but exceedingly dangerous, and it touches all of us. It must end.”, Statements, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine, said that the Russian Federation has placed the world on the brink of nuclear catastrophe by turning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a war zone. The plant has six reactors — only one exploded at Chernobyl — and IAEA must take permanent control of the situation as soon as possible. Further, he called on the Russian Federation to cease its “nuclear blackmail” and completely withdraw from the plant. While he welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation was forced to accept the international community’s terms to allow grain exports from three Ukrainian ports, he emphasized that this development only relieves tensions in global food markets — it does not remove the threat of food insecurity. Expressing regret that the international community still must fight in the twenty-first century to save tens of millions of people from artificial hunger “provoked by a single country with its insane aggression”, he called on the international community to do everything possible in the coming weeks to expand the existing grain initiative. He also pointed out that the Russian Federation is deliberately trying to impose “energy poverty” on tens of millions of people by deliberately raising energy prices., While noting that different parts of the world have different approaches and values, he underscored that life, peace and economic prosperity have value everywhere in the world. All countries — if they respect themselves — punish murder. However, there is one country that behaves differently — rewarding murderers and encouraging executioners — and is proud of doing so. Moscow does not comply with fundamental conventions concerning prisoners of war, and there is no war crime that the Russian occupiers have not yet committed on Ukraine’s territory. If Moscow is not stopped now, he stressed, then “all these Russian murderers will inevitably end up in other countries”. The Russian Federation must be held accountable for its crimes of aggression against Ukraine, and the international community must force Moscow to recognize that the inviolability of borders and peace are unconditional values for all nations. “It is on the territory of Ukraine that the world’s future will be decided,” he said, adding that “our independence is your security”., LINDA THOMAS GREENFIELD (United States) said the Russian Federation’s goal is as clear as ever: to dismantle Ukraine as a geopolitical entity and erase it from the world map. Its disinformation campaigns are increasingly being weaponized to prepare for further attempts to annex Ukrainian territory. However, the international community will never recognize the Russian Federation’s attempt to change Ukraine’s borders by force, she underscored. Noting that Ukraine had an impeccable record of nuclear energy safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, she said the Russian Federation recklessly attacked and seized control of that site by force, risking nuclear disaster. She voiced concern about Moscow’s “so-called filtration operation”, which involves the systematic and forced deportation of Ukrainian civilians to remote areas of the Russian Federation. Millions of Ukrainians are still under siege and tens of millions around the world are being driven to hunger by the Russian Federation’s actions, she said, stressing that Moscow is the sole hindrance to a swift resolution to the crisis. The international community must continue to call for and ensure accountability for all atrocities committed by the Russian Federation., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) recalled that 31 years ago today, Ukraine declared its independence from “the decaying Soviet Union”. Today also marks six months since the start of the invasion, when the Charter of the United Nations “was thrown in the Kremlin shredder” and “respect for international law” lost any meaning for Moscow. It marks 27 weeks since the General Assembly’s resolution asking the Russian Federation to stop the war and 25 weeks since an International Court of Justice order for Moscow to stop its military activities. Yet, the Russian Federation shows a clear intention to dismantle Ukraine, amid unquestionable evidence that its actions are destabilizing global security, energy and food security conditions. Five children have been killed for each day of the war, while many more millions are left with invisible wounds. He went on to describe a recent explosion that killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in Ukraine under Russian control, strongly requesting the United Nations to ensure the investigation is conducted impartially. Citing reports that the Russian Federation is now recruiting prisoners into the fight, he reiterated that any territorial annexation or development incompatible with Ukraine’s Constitution imposed by Russian Federation — such as sham elections or referenda — will not be accepted or recognized. Nor will the “Crimea template”. He reaffirmed Albania’s unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine, calling on the Russian Federation to stop the war, withdraw its troops and change course., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France), stressing that Ukrainians are fighting for their sovereignty, said her country will continue to support Ukraine as long as is necessary in face of the Russian Federation’s aggression. France will never recognize the annexation of territories occupied by the Russian Federation, the legitimacy of independent referenda organized by Moscow in these territories to camouflage its violations of international law, or the annexation of Crimea. Welcoming that the Joint Coordination Centre is now operational and that 33 vessels have left Ukrainian ports since the signing of the Istanbul accord. However, supply chains are still disrupted, transport costs are high and energy markets are crippled. The presence of Russian troops at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant heightens the risk of a nuclear accident, and she appealed for the withdrawal of those forces, stressing that any adverse events there would be the responsibility of Moscow. She described information on extrajudicial killings and torture of Ukrainian prisoners as “shocking”, emphasizing that the Russian Federation must respect international humanitarian law, which applies to all conflicts, whether or not Moscow chooses to acknowledge it is at war. She voiced support for the International Criminal Court investigations into mass atrocity crimes in Ukraine, noting that France will follow closely the upcoming publication of the Human Rights Council Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. She called on the Russian Federation to choose diplomacy and to recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, within internationally recognized borders., CÁIT MORAN (Ireland) said that for 183 days, her country has called for an end to the unjustified and unjustifiable war being waged against Ukraine. The Russian Federation must comply with its obligations under international law. Moreover, parties to the conflict must comply with international humanitarian law. This includes the obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants and not to attack civilian objects, the prohibitions against indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, and the obligation to take all feasible precautions in attack. She called on the Russian Federation to end its brutal war and withdraw its troops from the entire internationally recognized territory of Ukraine, and to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours. Voicing concern about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and the serious risk of a radiological accident or incident arising from military activity at the facility, she called on the Russian Federation to end its illegal occupation of the site, withdraw its troops and munitions, and ensure that Ukrainian authorities can uphold their responsibilities for the safety and security there., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) condemned the Russian Federation’s military aggression, underscoring that thousands of civilians have been killed, millions have fled their homes and others are trapped in war zones. Expressing solidarity with the people of Ukraine, she stressed that civilians must be protected, and international humanitarian law and international human rights law fully respected and implemented. Humanitarian actors must be ensured access. The Russian Federation must stop the war and fully, immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces and military equipment from Ukraine. War crimes cannot be forgotten, she said, stressing that perpetrators — at all levels — must be held accountable. On the resumption of Ukrainian grain exports, she said: “We are certainly encouraged that a critical transportation line from a global breadbasket might be restored. It is much needed, for Ukrainians as well as the world’s most vulnerable people and countries.”, JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom), recalling that after six months of war in Ukraine, thousands of civilians have been killed and more than 17 million need humanitarian assistance, amid a pattern of Russian violations of international humanitarian law, including reports of torture, inhumane treatment, arbitrary detention and forced deportation of Ukrainian citizens to the Russian Federation. Beyond Ukraine’s borders, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin’s decisions have had a devastating impact, with millions across the world facing rising food and fuel prices. He pointed to reports that Moscow is organizing fake referenda to illegally annex more territory from Ukraine. “Any such attempt would fool no one,” he said, stressing that the Russian Federation has lied throughout its illegal invasion, using disinformation to create false pretexts, undermine Ukrainian sovereignty, obscure the truth and hide war crimes. Thirty-one years ago today, Ukraine declared its independence, with over 90 per cent of Ukrainians voting in favour. “That pride in Ukrainian identity and sovereignty remains as strong as ever,” he said, describing Ukraine’s fight as one for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. “All of us in this Chamber have a responsibility to recognize that.”, RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) pointed out that — six months after the opening of hostilities — there is no solution in sight for the conflict in Ukraine, and that the situation is now compounded by the risk of nuclear disaster. Parties must refrain from attacks that could threaten the safety of nuclear facilities, and he called on both sides to facilitate an IAEA mission to evaluate the condition of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Noting that both reality and history demonstrate that closing the door to dialogue is not the right approach to resolving any conflict, he urged the parties to keep channels for dialogue open as this offers the best prospects for peace. He added that both sides bear the obligation under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population and prevent human-rights abuses, and that it is in everyone’s best interests that the two countries live peacefully, side-by-side, in the future., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said military activity around nuclear facilities must cease and warring parties must refrain from any action that could put the world at risk of a nuclear catastrophe. He called on parties to comply with nuclear safety rules and to cooperate with IAEA in securing potentially dangerous sites to prevent the risk of disaster. Voicing his country’s opposition to the war and its outrage at the attacks on civilians, he underscored that parties to the conflict must respect their international commitments under international humanitarian law. “For seven months, this Council has been plagued by unprecedented fragmentation and has been living with the invective of one camp against the other, while towns and villages are being ravaged, women, men and children are being scarred by a bloody war. Our mandate is to stop wars, if not to prevent them,” he said, urging the Council to come together around its mandate and purpose., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) expressed regret that what should be a day of celebration is impaired by a war that has breached Ukraine’s territorial integrity and contravened the Charter of the United Nations. Kenya will forever be thankful to those who fought for its freedom. The country joined the United Nations within days of its independence, signing up to its principles. “As a young nation, we needed assurance that our sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence would be respected,” he explained. Kenya valued its mission to outlaw aggression and that it gave voice to even the smallest countries without regard to military might or wealth. How intolerable that such a precious heritage should be as endangered as it is today. He described multilateralism as the last hope against a new world war, emphasizing that “we have no desire to be drawn into a worldwide conflict.” Kenya sees a grim warning it too may be engulfed by the confrontations fuelling the war, which is why Ukraine’s immediate fate is so important to the world. Its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence must be respected. Unless the war is stopped through dialogue, it could be the first in a series of conflicts that historians term the “third world war”. Indeed, the danger of conflict between nuclear Powers means that most of their confrontations would be undertaken by proxy, throwing countries like Kenya into “a mirror of the cold war that shattered our democracies… We cannot leave our fate to the most powerful.” He called for intuitive, bold leadership from any and every country with influence to push the parties into dialogue. He called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the opening of safe humanitarian corridors, unhindered humanitarian access and the security of all nuclear facilities., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said that, six months in, it is difficult to overstate the toll of the conflict in Ukraine. While she welcomed agreements to facilitate the export of grain, food supplies and fertilizers to global markets, she stressed that this “rare example of tangible progress” cannot be the last. The Charter of the United Nations provides a repertoire of tools with which to end conflict, but none are applicable in the absence of the political will to use them. The war will only end through a negotiated settlement, and Council meetings on Ukraine have value when they are complemented with action to alleviate the suffering of civilians or to facilitate such negotiation. Initiatives such as an IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant can serve as confidence-building measures that could unlock broader political discussion, she said, calling on leaders from both sides to commit to charting a path forward with the support of the international community., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said that the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the agreement concerning access to world markets for Russian food products and fertilizers have proven that, with persistent diplomacy, an acceptable political solution could be found to the ongoing military hostilities in Ukraine. She urged Council members to overcome their divisions and work to bring the weight of the organ’s authority to support such peace initiatives. Expressing concern over the mounting death toll and destruction of economic infrastructure in Ukraine, she called on the parties to end the war and demilitarize the zones around the country’s nuclear facilities. Further, international inspectors must be allowed access to these facilities in line with established norms. Noting that any miscalculation could potentially result in a wider conflict in Europe, she urged all key actors to demonstrate maximum restraint and called on the Russian Federation to withdraw its invading troops and pursue diplomacy and dialogue to resolve its legitimate security concerns., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) said her country just dispatched its twelfth humanitarian aid consignment to Ukraine, including haemostatic bandages to stem bleeding from deep wounds, a specific request from Kyiv. Over the last six months, India has dispatched 11 consignments — 97.5 tons — of aid to Ukraine, as well as to Romania, the Republic of Moldova, Slovakia and Poland. She called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and encouraged talks between the two sides. Further, the ground situation calls for a sustained priority on humanitarian relief, she said, stressing that India places the highest priority on such requests and that these measures should never be politicized. India will partner with countries to mitigate economic hardships, as the impact of the conflict is not limited to Europe, but rather exacerbating food, fertilizer and fuel security concerns. Underscoring the importance of equity, affordability and accessibility in relation to food grains, she said that in the last three months, India has exported 1.8 million tons of wheat to Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sudan and Yemen, and is working to increase fertilizer production. She advocated efforts to ensure that global fuel supplies are commensurate with demand. “Open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination,” she affirmed, stressing that India will step forward whenever the global South is constrained on aspects of food, health and energy security in a manner that does not take undue advantage of countries in distress., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), noting that technical difficulties during President Zelenskyy’s statement made it difficult to make out what was said at certain points, said he hoped that his delegation’s position regarding the usefulness of Council guests’ in-person participation has become clearer as a result. He recalled that the Council had gathered on 23 August in connection with a concrete threat to international peace and security — Kyiv’s ongoing bombing of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is putting Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. Noting claims about the catastrophic consequences of six months of hostilities for Ukraine’s civilian population, he said responsibility lies with the Kyiv regime, which came to power in 2014 as a result of an anti-constitutional coup d'état carried out with the help of a number of Western States. From the very beginning, the new Maidan authorities has been steadily leading the country to disaster, choosing Russophobia and the glorification of Nazi criminals., He went on to say that Ukraine, in a senseless “crusade” against itself, lost Crimea and provoked armed resistance from the Donetsk and Luhansk residents. That war, which claimed civilian lives for eight years, could have ended if Kyiv had fulfilled the Minsk agreements. “In order to establish peace in Donbass and prevent obvious threats to the Russian Federation emanating from Ukraine, we had no choice but to launch a special operation to de-Nazify and demilitarize Ukraine — the goals of which are being successfully and steadily fulfilled,” he said. Criminal shelling of the “republics of Donbass” continues, he pointed out, stressing that Ukraine’s armed forces are purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, schools and medical facilities, power lines and gas pipelines., He noted that the “so-called ‘Black Sea Initiative’” of the Secretary-General is considered a sort of “success story”, especially in terms of the unhindered export of food from Ukraine. Only one out of 34 dry cargo ships went to Africa over four weeks of export operations, he pointed out, noting it as inconsistent with the stated goal of fighting hunger in the countries in dire need of grain. The true cause of global food security issues is Western countries’ own economic miscalculations and the consequences of anti-Russian sanctions. Sanctions ruptured logistical and financial chains, and in turn provoked a sharp decline in market supply. He called on all those involved to take the “package” nature of the Black Sea Initiative seriously and not to postpone resolving the financial and logistical problems that impede the export of Russian food and fertilizers to the global market., JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico), while welcoming the continued, regular operation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, emphasized that the multilateral system — particularly the Security Council — has not been able to end the war in Ukraine. The invasion of sovereign Ukraine by the Russian Federation is a flagrant violation of Article 2.4 of the Charter of the United Nations, and any territorial acquisition resulting from the illegal use of force is null and void. The war must end, he stressed, after six months of bombings on hospitals, schools, residential areas and basic civilian infrastructure; of the destruction of cultural heritage; of violations of the methods and means of warfare; of violations of human rights, including sexual and gender-based violence; and of the use of indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions and mines. He also expressed concern over the illicit flows of weapons in the region, underscoring the need to ensure that these weapons do not fall into the hands of those that should never have them, particularly once hostilities have concluded., ZHANG JUN (China), Council President for August, speaking in his national capacity, said international humanitarian law should guide the conduct of parties to the conflict, stressing that civilians and civilian facilities cannot be the target of military strikes. Noting recent frequent attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, he called on all relevant parties to exercise restraint and refrain from any action that might compromise the safety and security of the nuclear facility. IAEA must conduct a site visit to the power plant as soon as possible to make a professional and technical assessment of the situation and take measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. He commended the Secretary-General’s and other parties’ efforts in facilitating the grain export agreement. At the same time, removing barriers to export food and fertilizer from the Russian Federation is also highly important, he pointed out. He hoped that the United Nations, in accordance with its memorandum of understanding with the Russian Federation, can help address the “chilling effect” caused by relevant countries’ abuse of sanctions and ensure the stable and smooth running of the global industrial and supply chains., SILVIO GONZATO, European Union delegation, speaking in its observer capacity, said the war in Ukraine, now in its sixth month, provides a stark reminder that independence can never be taken for granted. He vowed to support Ukraine “any way we can”, denouncing the Russian Federation’s continued violation of the Charter of the United Nations and disregard for the General Assembly resolution adopted in March by an overwhelming majority. He also deplored its failure to abide by the International Court of Justice order to immediately cease its use of force, urging Moscow to comply with its obligations under international law. The perpetrators of war crimes, and responsible Government officials, will be held accountable. He said the Union supports all measures to ensure accountability for rights violations committed during the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Moreover, “it is deplorable that we even need to say that a nuclear power plant should never be used as a military base,” he stressed. He urged the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its military forces and unauthorized personnel from the Zaporizhzhia plant, so the operator and Ukrainian authorities can resume their sovereign responsibilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and so that the legitimate operating staff can conduct their duties without interference. An IAEA team also must be allowed to access all nuclear facilities in Ukraine in a manner that respects that country’s full sovereignty and control over its infrastructure. He welcomed the positive role played by the African Union in coming to an arrangement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative and highlighted the European Union “Solidarity Lanes” initiative aimed at boosting exports from Ukraine over land.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraines-immediate-fate-important-world-delegate-tells-security-council-calling-cessation-war
"Humanitarian Needs in Ukraine, Global Food Crisis Still Skyrocketing Six Months after Russian Federation’s Invasion, Secretary-General Warns Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",24 Aug 2022,"SG/SM/21423, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council on Ukraine, in New York today:, Today marks a sad and tragic milestone — six months since the Russian Federation’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine., During this devastating period, thousands of civilians have been killed and injured, including hundreds of children. Countless others have lost their family members, friends and loved ones. The world has seen grave violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law committed with little to no accountability. Millions of Ukrainians have lost their homes and their worldly possessions, becoming internally displaced or refugees., With the onset of winter, humanitarian needs continue to rise rapidly with millions of people in need of assistance and protection. As these needs skyrocket, it is imperative that humanitarian actors in Ukraine have safe and unhindered access to all people requiring assistance, no matter where they live., The consequences of this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine. We are seeing new vulnerabilities emerge in a global environment already worn out by conflicts, inequality, pandemic-induced economic and health crises, and climate change — with a disproportionate impact on developing countries., The acceleration of already high food, fertilizer and fuel prices has triggered a global crisis that could drive millions more into extreme poverty, magnifying hunger and malnutrition, while threatening to raise the global humanitarian caseload to new highs and erase hard-won development gains., Vulnerable communities are grappling with the largest cost-of-living crisis in a generation and high commodity and transportation costs are having major repercussions for existing humanitarian operations., Under-Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo will brief the Council on the impact of the armed conflict in Ukraine both inside and outside the country over the past six months., As I mentioned on Monday, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide a brief update on my recent travel to Ukraine. I would like to have been able to do the same yesterday based on my experience in discussions about Zaporizhzhia, but unfortunately I was out of New York with a [inaudible] planned that was impossible to change at such a short notice., My visit was an important opportunity to follow up on the landmark deal that has brought a measure of hope, especially to developing countries and millions of vulnerable people bearing the brunt of the global food crisis, some of them on the edge of famine., I can report to the Council that the Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed in Istanbul in July, is progressing well — with dozens of ships sailing in and out of Ukrainian ports, loaded so far with over 720,000 metric tons of grains and other food products. This deal would not have been possible without the constructive approach of both Ukraine and the Russian Federation and the efforts of the Government of Türkiye., During my visit to Lviv, I met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Turkish President Erdoğan. I thanked them for their continued engagement to support the implementation of the Initiative to ensure the safe passage of Ukrainian food products and fertilizers to those in need and to the world at large., I was filled with emotion visiting the port of Odesa and the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul. On my visit to Odesa, I went aboard a bulk carrier called the MV Kubrosli Y as it was being loaded with about 10,000 metric tons of wheat. It was deeply moving to peer into the hold of this cargo ship and see wheat pouring in. Even if in a limited way, the storied port of Odesa — which had been paralyzed for months — is slowly coming to life thanks to the Initiative., In Istanbul, I saw the World Food Programme-chartered ship, the MV Brave Commander. It was proudly flying the United Nations flag with its cargo destined for the Horn of Africa where millions of people are at risk of famine., I then had the opportunity to walk up the long and narrow gangway of the SSI Invincible II heading to pick up Ukrainian grain in the port of Chornomorsk. The vessel will carry one of the largest hauls of grain leaving Ukraine to date — more than 50,000 metric tons., Just a few weeks ago, much of this would have been hard to imagine. We are seeing a powerful demonstration of what can be achieved, in even the most devastating of contexts, when we put people first. As I stressed in Odesa and Istanbul, what I saw was the more visible part of the solution., The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to global markets of the Russian Federation food and fertilizers, which are not subject to sanctions. It is critical that all Governments and the private sector cooperate to effectively bring them to market. Together with the task team led by Rebeca Grynspan, I will continue my intense contacts for that purpose., In 2022, there is enough food in the world — the problem is its uneven distribution. But if we don’t stabilize the fertilizer market in 2022, there simply will not be enough food in 2023. Many farmers around the world are already planning to reduce areas for cultivation for next season., Getting much more food and fertilizers out of Ukraine and the Russian Federation at reasonable costs is vital to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers. I once again commend the parties for their engagement in this process and urge them to continue to build on this progress., I also renew the call I made in Odesa for a massive scaling up of support to the developing countries getting hammered by the global food crisis. The shipment of grain and other foodstuffs is crucial, but it won’t mean much if countries cannot afford them. Developed countries and international financial institutions must do more to ensure that developing countries can fully capitalize on the opportunities of the Black Sea Grain Initiative., Despite progress on the humanitarian front, fighting in Ukraine shows no signs of ending, with new potential areas of dangerous escalation appearing. Two places were ever-present in my mind — and in my discussions in Ukraine — Zaporizhzhia and Olenivka., I remain gravely concerned about the situation in and around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia. The warning lights are flashing. Any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant are simply unacceptable. Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. The security of the plant must be ensured, and the plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure., In close contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations Secretariat has assessed that we have in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from Kyiv, provided both the Russian Federation and Ukraine agree. I welcome expressions of support for such a mission and urge that to happen as soon as possible., I am deeply disturbed by the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights related to the armed conflict. International humanitarian law protects prisoners of war. The International Committee of the Red Cross must have access to them wherever they are held., The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine — and the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine — continue to monitor, document and report with a view to supporting the investigation of alleged violations., Work is also ongoing to deploy the recently established Fact-Finding Mission to Olenivka to look into the incident on 29 July. This mission must be able to freely conduct its work — to gather and analyse necessary information — and to find the facts. It is imperative that the mission has safe, secure and unfettered access to all relevant places and persons and to all relevant evidence without any limitation, impediment or interference., On this thirty-first anniversary of Ukraine’s independence, I wish to congratulate the Ukrainian people. The people of Ukraine and beyond need peace and they need peace now. Peace in line with the United Nations Charter. Peace in line with international law., For information media.

WHO’s Response to the Ukraine Crisis - Interim Report (February to June 2022),Situation Report,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",29 Jul 2022,"Overview, The military offensive by the Russian Federation in Ukraine which began February 2022 has triggered one of the world’s fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crisis, with geopolitical and economic ripples felt across the globe.

But the crisis also saw an extraordinary mobilization and crisis response to a health emergency by WHO and its more than 100 partners., The just published interim report demonstrates what has been achieved in just over three months; how WHO, the health authorities in Ukraine and international and national partners have reached and assisted millions of people and prevented Ukraine’s health system from disintegrating and ceasing to function., By delivering specialized medical supplies, coordinating the deployment of emergency medical teams, verifying and reporting attacks on healthcare and​ working with health authorities, WHO and health partners have minimized disruptions to the delivery of critical healthcare services within Ukraine and in countries​ hosting refugees., This life saving work would not be possible without your valuable and continued support.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/whos-response-ukraine-crisis-interim-report-february-june-2022
David Miliband responds to six-month mark of war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IRC,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",23 Aug 2022,"August 23, 2022 — David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said,, “Six months of war has taken a terrible toll – not just on Ukrainian civilians but civilians worldwide. IRC’s clients are dealing with the devastating global repercussions - from East Africa to the Sahel to the Middle East to Central America., ""In East Africa, a perfect storm of continued drought, the impact of the blockade on Ukraine's ports, and the economic fallout from the war is causing mass starvation. Up to 20 million people will face extreme hunger by September, with 3 million already at risk of losing their lives without urgent international funding., In the Sahel, which is experiencing the highest levels of severe food insecurity since 2014, up to 18 million people are experiencing severe hunger., ""In the Middle East, the war in Ukraine has sent prices of wheat and fuel spiralling, punishing Syrian refugees the hardest as expenditures far outstrip limited incomes. In Central America, prices for staple foods like white maize are well above the five-year average. Together with climate change and ongoing insecurity, nearly 13 million people across the region face growing hunger., ""Six months on, international attention must be devoted urgently not only to the mounting toll on Ukrainian civilians caught in the greatest European displacement crisis since WW2, but on the great and growing global fallout of this war on the world’s most vulnerable.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/david-miliband-responds-six-month-mark-war-ukraine
"After six months of war, physical and mental scars ravage generations across Ukraine",News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",24 Aug 2022,"KYIV, Ukraine – “He winces at sharp sounds, maybe as a consequence of the first days after his birth. Why should he have to go through this?”, At just 26 years old, Mariia had expected to be overwhelmed with the excitement of new motherhood. Instead, she is consumed with anxiety for her family’s future. Her son, Arthur, is now six months old, but has yet to live a day in peacetime: He was born in Kyiv on 25 February, the day after Russia launched its military offensive on Ukraine., Instead of taking their newborn home wrapped up safely in a bundle of soft blankets, the family spent the next four days in a bunker underneath the hospital. “I stayed in the basement even when there were no air raid sirens, because it was too hard to run up and down the stairs to the maternity ward,” Mariia told UNFPA., It was a difficult birth, and she needed postnatal care after leaving the hospital. “I was worried about the suture from the Caesarean section. I couldn’t contact my doctor because we left Kyiv, and there were no other specialists nearby.”, From forced displacement, severe shortages of reproductive health care and the high risk of sexual violence, the war in Ukraine is having a disproportionate impact on women and girls. For thousands of pregnant women without access to essential services, childbirth is now fraught with added danger: Many hospitals are citing higher numbers of premature babies, health facilities are destroyed and damaged, and staff and supplies are running increasingly low., Mothers and newborns fight for survival, Nataliia was four months pregnant when the war started. Despite the shelling, she decided to stay in the Kyiv region: It was where she had given birth to her three other children and was her haven. She told UNFPA, “We felt safe in our house, although our days were filled with sirens and nothing was like it used to be.”, Yet the family were too afraid to venture outside and the mounting pressures of daily life began to weigh on her. With her anxiety and stress levels soaring, Nataliia’s waters broke two months before her due date: Her son, Artem, was born later that day weighing just 1.6 kilograms., “He was very ill, and so tiny. I couldn’t hold him because he was too fragile,” she said. Spending the first two weeks of his life in an incubator, he received critical care from staff at the Kyiv perinatal hospital, one of more than 30 facilities UNFPA has supported since the war began., Although Nataliia is now home in Kyiv, Artem’s traumatic birth is all too fresh in her mind: “As a mother, there is nothing worse than going through long months of pregnancy, followed by painful labour, only to see your baby fighting for his life.”, Delivering under fire, The World Health Organization has reported more than 473 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine. Some 12 million people are currently estimated to need health assistance, while more than 15 million require protection support. UNFPA has so far reached more than 6 million people with sexual and reproductive health supplies and services since the war broke out, providing over 80 tonnes of equipment and medicine to fill critical gaps in 37 hospitals, helping ensure safe birth and emergency obstetric services., With women and girls also at increased risk of sexual exploitation and violence during conflict and displacement, UNFPA is working with 27 facilities for survivors, including shelters, crisis rooms and daycare centres. Over 100 mobile health teams have been deployed across the country, offering psychosocial support even in the most hard-to-reach and conflict-ravaged areas., A toll too heavy to bear, Like so many others trying to survive in desperately uncertain times, for Mariia there has been an inevitable toll on her mental and physical health. “Since the beginning of the war, my life has changed radically. Our family grew, but we had to leave home. We lost our income. I try to hold on, but anxiety follows me everywhere.”, Six months after Russia invaded Ukraine, death, destruction and devastation haunt the country’s streets. Some 6.6 million people are internally displaced and nearly 7 million are refugees in neighbouring countries – the vast majority of them women and children. More than 1,500 women and girls are reported to have been killed since the start of the war and over 1,200 injured – although the true number is expected to far exceed this., As the country reaches a sobering milestone, UNFPA remains dedicated to protecting women and girls' health and well-being – and in some cases their very survival. Conflict should never strip women of their fundamental rights, including their right to give birth safely and with dignity, and to live free from violence and abuse.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/after-six-months-war-physical-and-mental-scars-ravage-generations-across-ukraine

""Though shaken, the health system has not collapsed. WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health of Ukraine to restore disrupted services, displaced health workers and destroyed infrastructure, which is essential not only for the health of Ukraine's people, but for the country's resilience and recovery. But no system can deliver optimum health to its people under the stress of war, which is why we continue to call on the Russian Federation to end this war."", WHO has helped deliver more than 1300 metric tonnes of critical medical supplies in coordination with the Ministry of Health and partners, with more on the way. These include power generators, ambulances and oxygen supplies for medical facilities; supplies for trauma and emergency surgeries; and medicines to help treat noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)., However, attacks on health continue unabated, with 473 WHO-verified attacks recorded this past half-year, resulting in at least 98 deaths and 134 injuries., ""I've said this before and I'll say it again and again: attacks on health care are unconscionable,"" stressed Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. ""Not only are these a violation of international humanitarian law, but they also kill and maim civilians and health-care providers, and severely hinder or prevent the delivery of, and access to, health care to those who need it the most. Amid the horror of war, we continue to witness the heroic efforts of health providers -- including the many I've been privileged to meet in person myself -- who are such a credit to their profession despite their own personal suffering."", So far this year, WHO has helped train more than 9000 health-care workers on a range of issues including trauma surgery, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology and laboratory diagnostics. Mental health is another key focus. Stress management training is being provided to health-care workers and the general population on how to safeguard mental health given the sharp rise in war-related psychological distress., ""WHO is stepping up its efforts with the Ministry of Health to ensure that the health workforce is prepared with the necessary skills to respond to mounting needs as winter approaches,"" said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. ""We're already seeing severe challenges and shortages in many areas, with rising inequalities in access to health and other essentials, impacting, as always, the most vulnerable -- women, children and the elderly.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Aug 2022,"Summary: Five shipping containers of relief kits, canned meat, comforters and more have been distributed to 16,000 vulnerable people in Ukraine. The supplies bring hope to the people of Ukraine, practical evidence that they are not forgotten., Aug. 24, 2022, By Jason Dueck, Before the fighting escalated in Ukraine this year, Nadiya O.* and her husband lived near the city of Uman, Ukraine. Together they grew a vegetable garden and kept bees, selling their honey to make some extra cash. But shortly after the conflict worsened, her husband died from a heart attack., Then Russian military bombing destroyed their home, burning most of the beehives they had tended together to ash. The ones that remain still stand, empty and quiet. An unexploded rocket lies buried in what used to be their garden, among the rosebushes. In Ukrainian, the name Nadiya means hope, but her situation left little to be hopeful for., But a measure of hope found its way to Nadiya O. when a container full of MCC canned meat, comforters and other relief items was distributed through MCC partner Uman Help Centre., The container that arrived in Uman was one of five shipped to Ukraine by MCC, each loaded with essential relief items including relief kits, hygiene kits, infant care kits, comforters and canned meat. Shipping routes into Ukraine have been majorly disrupted by the conflict. Before fighting escalated, MCC relief supplies could be sent by container ship to the Port of Odesa in southern Ukraine directly, but these containers had to make a much longer journey overland., Using contents from the five containers, MCC partners in Uman, Kharkiv, Nikopol and a few other places distributed emergency supplies to more than 16,000 people. Nadiya T.*, program coordinator for MCC in Ukraine, says that a lot of attention is paid to who receives the supplies to make sure they reach the people most in need., “The recipients of material resources are the most vulnerable groups, the people who are in the most critical need,” says Nadiya T. “People whose homes were destroyed. People who lost their jobs, the elderly people with small pension benefits and people living with disabilities.”, Donating material resources isn’t the only way MCC donors are responding to the needs in Ukraine. Donations to MCC’s Ukraine response totalled US$9.7 million at the end of July. These generous gifts have provided survival essentials, fuel, comforters, child protection and counselling support to more than 22,000 people. Thousands more received food and emergency kits from the supply shipments., But Nadiya T. says there’s something more intangible the support has provided — the same measure of hope that Nadiya O. felt. “Ukraine is facing a humanitarian catastrophe,” says Nadiya T. “So many people in Ukraine are still suffering and they feel helpless in the face of circumstances they cannot control. The fighting has been going on for months, people get tired and discouraged., Ukrainians need to know that they’re not alone in this and that they’re supported, that there are people around the world who are not indifferent to the suffering. Please keep praying for us. And please keep supporting Ukrainians in the ways you can. Every prayer and every bit of assistance is very meaningful and much appreciated.”, To hear more from Nadiya T. about the experiences of displaced people in Ukraine, listen to her episode of MCC’s Relief, Development and Podcast. (CA: mcccanada.ca/relief-development-podcast US: mcc.org/relief-development-podcast)., MCC is seeing an increased demand for supplies to send to Ukraine and other countries around the world and our inventory of material resources is getting low.

Direct Relief Works with Ukrainian Ministry of Health and Global Drug Makers to Deliver 890 Tons of Medical Aid to Ukraine,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,Health,23 Aug 2022,"Since Russia's war on Ukraine began six months ago this week, Direct Relief has secured and delivered more than 890 tons of medicine and medical supplies (2,487 pallets) to help the people of Ukraine. Direct Relief has brought this aid to Ukraine through partnerships with Ukraine's Ministry of Health and many of the world's leading healthcare companies to address the short-term lack of medical product access given supply interruptions caused by the conflict., Under a collaboration agreement, Ukraine's Ministry of Health is working with Direct Relief to secure medicine donations from pharmaceutical manufacturers, enabling the use of Direct Relief's existing contractual and working relationships, smoothing the processes of securing the drugs and then ensuring their timely delivery. Direct Relief has secured and delivered critical medical aid (with over 10% of the pallets requiring cold-chain handling and logistics) specifically requested or approved by the Ministry of Health since the war began. Direct Relief began its collaboration with Ukraine's Ministry of Health in the year before the invasion working together to provide monoclonal antibody therapies to help address the large Covid-19 outbreaks in the country., Novo Nordisk Manufactures Insulin Specifically for Ukraine Donation, Among the large prescription medicine donors is Novo Nordisk A/S, which has provided many different types of human and analog insulin for Direct Relief's humanitarian response in Ukraine, including a large donation of insulin that was manufactured to donate specifically for Direct Relief's humanitarian efforts. In total, the Denmark-based company has helped meet the needs of tens of thousands of patients with diabetes., ""While we are still deeply concerned with the ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we are grateful that we have been able to team up with Direct Relief, other humanitarian actors and the Ministry of Health to safeguard the supply of our lifesaving medicines to the people who depend on them in Ukraine. I would like to extend my gratitude to the staff of Direct Relief, who work tirelessly in times of crises to serve unmet needs for health care around the world,"" said Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, President and CEO of Novo Nordisk., Pfizer Donates Critical Anti-infective and Other Medicines to Direct Relief for Ukraine, Pfizer has been among the largest donors to Direct Relief's response in Ukraine, providing lifesaving therapies to address severe bacterial and fungal infections, as well as medicines to treat patients with Covid-19 infections, which was very important given the recent Covid-19 waves that impacted Ukraine over the past six months. In addition, Pfizer provided various chronic disease medicines and therapies to address uncontrolled bleeding (critical for trauma and wound victims) and chemical warfare antidotes. Pfizer made these donations to Direct Relief's Ukraine response from the United States and its European affiliates., Caroline Roan, Pfizer Senior Vice President of Global Health and Social Impact, said: ""Ensuring critical medicines continue to reach patients impacted by this tragic and challenging war is paramount to Pfizer. We are committed to contributing to ongoing humanitarian efforts that support the safety, health and wellbeing of people affected by these terrible events. We are very proud to be one of Direct Relief's largest donors in this program -- as part of our broader humanitarian commitments in support of the people of Ukraine, and complementing our efforts to improve access to healthcare worldwide."", Baxter Donates 10 Truckloads of IV Fluids, Dialysis-Related Products, and More for Ukraine, Baxter International Inc. made one of the largest donations by volume, delivering to Direct Relief more than ten truckloads of critical medical products needed for Ukrainian patients with trauma and wounds, as well as vulnerable patients with renal conditions that required dialysis., Given the critical need within Ukraine, Baxter provided the products from its facility in nearby Poland, allowing more time to get these essential medicines where they are needed., ""We are deeply grateful to the Direct Relief team for their incredible actions in Ukraine and surrounding countries and are proud to have supported their efforts with donations of more than 100 different types of Baxter products.

Six months of war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Caritas,Protection and Human Rights,23 Aug 2022,"Caritas Internationalis: “Stop the conflict immediately. Ukrainian people must have the opportunity to start rebuilding their lives”., On the day marking six months since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, Caritas Internationalis launches a new appeal for peace, drawing attention to the high cost of this war in terms of human lives and the heavy consequences both at the local and global level. “This conflict has continued for so long,” says Caritas Internationalis Secretary General Aloysius John, “but unfortunately, the political will to unconditionally end the violence continues to be lacking. We need immediate peace which will finally give Ukrainians the chance to start rebuilding their lives and their country – a process which will unfortunately take several years.” John also emphasises the devastating impact of the conflict at the international level. “This war is contributing to an unprecedented global economic and humanitarian crisis, with food insecurity dramatically escalating and prices of essential goods skyrocketing. As always, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are paying the highest price’., Since the beginning of the conflict, the two Caritas organisations operating in the country – Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes-Ukraine – have been supporting the population by providing humanitarian assistance to more than 3.5 million people. More than 2.8 million meals and food packages, and over 900,000 hygiene kits were distributed. Some 300,000 people were assisted to find housing. About 100,000 people received medicine and medical assistance. At the same time, psycho-social support services and legal assistance were ensured. In many of the Caritas centres, children’s areas were also set up, and educational programmes were provided., Caritas organisations in neighbouring countries – such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia, and Hungary – have also been active in welcoming and providing assistance to the millions of refugees fleeing the war.
The Caritas response to the conflict has been immediate and has continued to grow and adapt to the increasing needs of the population. “Our operations have not slowed down. On the contrary, they have become more extensive and more organised,” says Tetiana Stawnychy, President of Caritas Ukraine. “In the first days, we were helped by the generosity of local people, then we gradually expanded the number of our centres from 19 to 37, also involving 448 parish centres. Each of these centres has staff or volunteers who work tirelessly.”
Caritas Spes-Ukraine has also significantly increased its outreach in the six months of conflict and now has 24 local offices and operates in 23 regions of the country, including conflict areas. Father Vyacheslav Grynevych, Secretary General of Caritas Spes, emphasises the valuable support offered by the entire Caritas Confederation and its benefactors. “During these six months of war, we have seen many destroyed faces and heard many dramatic stories; but thanks to solidarity, we have been able to continue our work.”, Anyone wishing to support the work of Caritas In Ukraine can donate here",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-war-ukraine
Ukraine: Six months of war and humanitarian response amid a global food crisis,News and Press Release,WFP,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",24 Aug 2022,"How the World Food Programme uses every opportunity to assist people within the country and beyond, 24 August 2022, Edmond Khoury, Six months of war in Ukraine have claimed thousands of civilian lives and uprooted millions of people. Many families who remain in areas close to frontlines are struggling to access food after commercial supply lines were disrupted. Those who've fled their homes have often lost their livelihoods and are struggling to rebuild their lives, having run out of money or found their homes reduced to rubble., Below are a few ways the World Food Programme (WFP) stands alongside people in Ukraine and the wider world as hunger reaches record highs. (A total of 50 million people in 45 countries are teetering on the edge of famine.), Cash assistance, WFP is the leading provider of humanitarian cash-based transfers worldwide, with extensive experience in conflict settings., Our multi-purpose cash programme helps displaced people in Ukraine cover essential needs such as food, healthcare and accommodation., Since the beginning of the war, WFP has disbursed more than US$200 million to internally displaced Ukrainians. In Moldova, 11,000 families hosting Ukrainian refugees also receive cash transfers from WFP to cover additional expenses such as food and utilities., Food assistance, WFP began serving ready-to-eat nourishing meals and distributing bread within days of the war in Ukraine. As our response adapts, we are providing food kits wherever food is unavailable or hard to access., The provision of food kits helps counter the impact of inflation and decreased purchasing power for families, freeing up resources to cover other needs., Food kits cover most of a family's monthly nutrition needs; they contain canned protein (meat or beans), sunflower oil, pasta or rice. To date, WFP has distributed more than 64,000 metric tons of food to people in Ukraine., Supporting grain exports, Before the war in Ukraine, the country produced enough food to feed 400 million people per year. Food export disruptions had immediate implications for countries that rely heavily on grain imports from both Russia and Ukraine -- key players in global wheat and maize markets., WFP has been working with the Government of Ukraine and other partners to advocate for and facilitate the export of grain through Black Sea ports as well as alternative land and river export routes., Last week (16 August), the first shipment of Ukraine grain for WFP operations since the war left the Black Sea port of Pivdennyi in Odesa -- a chartered vessel took 23,000 metric tons of WFP to the drought-hit Horn of Africa region, where catastrophic hunger threatens more than 20 million people., Allowing the export of Ukrainian grain is critical to stabilize global markets and alleviate hunger, but it also has direct benefits for Ukrainians., The agricultural sector is an essential component of Ukraine's economy, representing around 11 percent of its GDP, and a direct source of livelihoods for many of the 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas. Resuming grain exports will help free up silos and give both the resources and confidence Ukrainian farmers need to prepare a new harvest., Prepositioning food in high-risk areas, As the war in remains highly volatile, with shifting frontlines, WFP is taking part in and coordinating convoys to hard-to-reach areas, supporting the delivery of food kits and other essentials, conducting food security assessments. In July, WFP reached more than 900,000 people in hard-to-reach or frontline areas directly affected by fighting., We continue to engage with the parties to the conflict to negotiate humanitarian access via convoys to the hardest-hit locations -- particularly in the east and south -- guided by humanitarian principles and aiming to reach people on both sides of the contact line., WFP's started distributing value vouchers in Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts. Families receive a US$13 paper voucher per person to spend in a number of WFP-contracted grocery shops., WFP is currently working to facilitate the transition of approximately 64,000 beneficiaries from food assistance to value vouchers. The voucher system helps retailers return to hard-hit communities, and local economies to recover. This temporary measure will be replaced with cash transfers as the situation permits., Supporting Ukraine's economy and food systems, Food systems -- the networks that are needed to produce and process food, and ensure it reaches consumers -- are not meeting the needs of many around the world. Their flaws are further exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine and the climate crisis., WFP continues to prioritize the local procurement of food from Ukraine. We currently buy 80 percent of the food we distribute inside Ukraine, directly supporting Ukrainian farmers and Ukraine’s economy. We also work with local bakeries to deliver bread., WFP’s overall priority in Ukraine is to work with local authorities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to restore access to food, stabilize institutional services and sustain economic activity to reduce vulnerability in the long term.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-six-months-war-and-humanitarian-response-amid-global-food-crisis
Ukrainian children at risk of long-term mental health problems,News and Press Release,NRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",24 Aug 2022,"Bunny Nooryani, The war in Ukraine has exposed hundreds of thousands of children in the country to traumatic events that put them at risk of long-term mental health problems, making it imperative to take action, warns Stener Vogt, a child protection specialist at NORCAP, which is part of the Norwegian Refugee Council., “Most adults don’t know how to deal with the impact of war on children’s mental health,” says Vogt, who is on assignment in Kyiv, Ukraine. “We will see long-term mental health problems for the children of Ukraine if we don’t address this properly now.”, More than 13 million people in Ukraine have fled their homes because of fighting in the six months since the escalation of the war on February 24. Many are children who have been exposed to deeply traumatic events and urgently need safety, stability, child protection services and psychosocial support. While parents and other caretakers are crucial to a child’s welfare, they often lack a sufficient understanding of how to meet the needs of a child affected by war, says Vogt., “Child protection is often perceived as the protection of small adults, but children’s needs differ from those of adults,” says Vogt, who coordinates child protection efforts by international aid agencies and local organisations in Ukraine, supporting the work of national authorities. “We are working to give parents and other caregivers a better understanding of these needs and how to deal with them.”, Keeping families together, A key focus for Vogt is to ensure children are not separated from their families., “Many families are in a difficult situation with one parent in the army and the other needing to work and may see no other option than to place their children in an institution or in the care of someone else,” he says. “But we see that children who remain with their parents are more resilient, so we need to do even more to enable parents to keep their children with them.”, Children fleeing conflict are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation and trafficking. The lack of an adequate system for registering children moving out of Ukraine increases these risks, says Vogt., Establishing safe spaces, About 7 million people are estimated to be internally displaced in Ukraine, while 6.7 million people are refugees in other countries, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)., In Ukraine, the authorities and humanitarian organisations have set up collection sites that provide displaced people with critical information and other support. In neighbouring countries, UNICEF and UNHCR have worked with authorities and other organisations to set up Blue Dots. These are safe spaces along border crossings that provide refugees with information and support, including advice, childcare and referrals for healthcare, education and psychosocial support. They also register unaccompanied children to facilitate monitoring of their protection and family reunification., “We are working with the authorities to increase the number of collection sites within Ukraine and Blue Dots in neighbouring countries, but even more needs to be done to address the needs of children,” says Vogt., Providing support, With expertise in the humanitarian, development and peacebuilding sectors, NORCAP works with local, national and international partners to meet the needs of people affected by crises. In response to the crisis in Ukraine, NORCAP has experts working with UN agencies, national authorities and local organisations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries on issues including child protection, anti-trafficking, the provision of shelter, education and cash assistance., “No society is built for a crisis of this scale,” says Vogt. “So even though the Ukrainian authorities are doing their utmost, and sometimes more than can be expected, they urgently need assistance from the humanitarian community to help protect the most vulnerable., “The authorities are really concerned about child protection: They know what they want, but don’t always have the resources or specialist experience. We do our best to support the government in filling these gaps.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-children-risk-long-term-mental-health-problems

When a School Gym Becomes Home for Ukraine’s Displaced,News and Press Release,IOM,"Health

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Aug 2022,"Ivano-Frankivsk, 24 August 2022 – Every morning for the last four months, Ruslan and his wife, Yulia, have woken in simple metal cots in an Ivano-Frankivsk school gym that serves as one big bedroom for dozens of men and women, including people with disabilities, and their pets. Their few small bags of personal possessions are all that remain of their pre-war lives in this collective centre, one of thousands established in educational facilities across Ukraine., They fled Mariupol, one of the hardest hit cities in Ukraine, in April, walking for days along minefields, having left their elderly parents who refused to be evacuated from their home city. Once a vibrant port city of over 400,000 people, Mariupol endured a vicious siege resulting in heavy destruction and is currently occupied by Russian forces., Ruslan was an employee at the Azovstal steel plant – the last stronghold of Ukrainian troops in Mariupol and a shelter for many civilians who barricaded themselves in its basement, seeking refuge from air and artillery strikes. Neither Ruslan nor his wife know if their home is still standing and whether their family members are alive., This scene is playing out across the country every day. An estimated 6,645,000 people remained internally displaced in Ukraine as of 23 July, according to the latest data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The difficulties they face while being displaced are often compounded by the grief of having to leave loved ones behind., The couple, and more than 100 other internally displaced persons (IDPs), found shelter in this western Ukraine high school. In the early days of the Russian invasion, many communal facilities, such as schools, kindergartens, dormitories and religious buildings, were rapidly turned into centres for those fleeing the war. Not designed to serve as accommodations, they were meant to provide only temporary shelter to displaced Ukrainians. Six months later, however, people are still living there, often sharing one open space with little privacy., “We were told that this is only temporary, and we would be relocated to another facility with separate rooms for each household,” Ruslan says. “However, repairs are still ongoing in that building and nobody can tell us when it would be possible to move. Most people staying here have nowhere to return to as their homes have been destroyed. We do not even know what happened to our house as we cannot reach our family members staying in Mariupol.”, While most residents here are accommodated in the gym, some families, including those with children, were placed in the classrooms. All are provided with three free meals per day; however, living conditions are far from normal. With only one shower facility and three washing machines, people must schedule a slot to use these services., IOM is addressing the urgent needs of IDPs by providing the facility with basic household items, including things like extension cords so people can charge their phones – a necessity for many of the displaced, like Ruslan, who are desperate for news from their families. Every resident received a hygiene kit containing soap, shampoo, toothpaste, towels and other sanitary items. Partitions will also be installed to create individual sleeping areas and improve privacy., “The needs of people staying in a school have changed over time,” explains school head Dmytro Skydanchuk. “In the beginning, many lived here only for a few days or weeks before continuing their journey, often going abroad. Those who stayed have no place to go, and they need what each of us does – to take a shower, charge their phone, wash and dry clothes.”, Uncertainty looms as school year approaches, With the start of the school year looming, schools hosting displaced persons face another dilemma. Institutions with established bomb shelters and considered safe enough to reopen doors to children, must either relocate displaced persons to other centres or consider distance learning modalities that were in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school in Ivano-Frankivsk, where over 1,300 students are enrolled, will have to follow the latter. Even though it is equipped with a bomb shelter and underwent security checks, there is little chance that new accommodation for the residents will be ready before the new school year begins., “Our students and parents do not complain, they understand that there is war, and these people lost everything. Nobody will force them to leave, they are welcome to stay as long as needed,” Dmytro adds., According to the Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster in Ukraine, as of the end of June, over 950,000 displaced Ukrainians were staying in 5,670 collective sites across 14 regions of Ukraine. Schools, kindergartens and dormitories account for 73 per cent of these facilities. People residing in communal settings are often the most vulnerable, as they lack funds to rent accommodation where it is available., Authorities at the educational facilities themselves do not have a clear vision of how a learning process will be organized. Some institutions opted for a combined modality with offline learning for primary school students and online for teenagers. Others, mainly in rural areas, had been previously restructured and will likely continue functioning as shelters for displaced persons., While the final decision is pending, local communities and humanitarian actors work hand-in-hand to make living conditions for displaced persons more comfortable. In the village of Vartykivtsi, in Chernivtsi Region, just six kilometres away from the border with Moldova, IOM provided a collective centre with mattresses, household appliances, water heating systems, and helped to repair two shower facilities, improving the living conditions for over 80 temporary residents. Meanwhile, residents of the village provided food, medicine and clothes, and helped cook meals for those forced to flee the war., Viktoria was displaced to Vartykivtsi from Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia Region with her husband and three children, and her mother and brother – both of whom have disabilities. At the temporary shelter where they currently reside, the family demonstrates resilience and solidarity, helping to turn the school into a comfortable living space. Viktoria’s husband renovated the walls in the shower facilities while she volunteers as a cleaner and a cook., “This is our common home, and we try to make it comfortable for us, our children and people who share our fate,” Viktoria says., By Iryna Tymchyshyn and Maksym Petrov, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/when-school-gym-becomes-home-ukraines-displaced

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Aug 2022,"SITUATION OVERVIEW, 24 August marks six months since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine, which began in February 2022 and triggered the largest displacement within Europe since the Second World War. This date also marks 31 years since Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union., Six months into the full-scale war, it is now estimated that 6.6 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and an additional 6.6 million are internally displaced within the country. This represents a displacement of nearly one-third of the country’s population, making it one of the largest human displacement crises in the world today. As of 15 August, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has verified over 13,000 civilian casualties (5,514 people killed and 7,698 injured) since the start of the war, with the actual number believed to be significantly higher. The majority of casualties have occurred in eastern Ukraine, specifically Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have faced some of the most intense shelling and fighting of the war., Including those who have been displaced, suffered injury, or otherwise been affected as a result of the full-scale invasion, it is estimated that there are now more than 17.7 million people, representing nearly one-quarter of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance. These estimates include the Ukrainians who have remained in their home communities but whose lives have nevertheless been severely disrupted. They are staying in damaged homes, basements, and bomb shelters; they have lost livelihoods and their access to essential services as infrastructure and supply chains have been decimated across the country., Persons with specific vulnerabilities, including older persons, unaccompanied and separated children, and persons with disabilities have faced particular hardship, as have the estimated almost half a million third-country nationals (TCNs) who were living in Ukraine when the fighting escalated. Around 300,000 TCNs have left Ukraine since the crisis began, with many forced to overcome a frequently shifting security situation, complicated transit routes, and conflicting or unclear information., The heaviest fighting continues to be centred in Eastern and Southern Ukraine, though at the beginning of the war, the front line also spread across the north, causing heavy damage in areas like Chernihiv and Sumy, and almost reaching the capital city, Kyiv. Through many parts of the country, deadly artillery and missile attacks continue in civilian occupied areas, putting lives in danger and damaging critical infrastructure. Millions are without access to many necessities for life such as water, food, healthcare, sanitation, gas, and electricity. Destruction of property, infrastructure, and livelihoods continues to lead to displacement, increased vulnerabilities and loss of life. Shelling and other fighting near critical infrastructure, including Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, risk further catastrophe.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-2022-6-months-response
UK Ambassador to Ukraine sees landmine clearance funded by the British Government,News and Press Release,Govt. UK,Mine Action,23 Aug 2022,"Brovary, Ukraine – The UK’s Ambassador from Her Majesty’s Government in Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, visited the British mine clearance charity The HALO Trust at work on a minefield in northern Ukraine yesterday, to mark the 6-month anniversary of the invasion of Kyiv and showcase UK aid for HALO’s work., The minefield visited by Ms Simmons was in a forest near the village of Zalissa, north-east of Brovary. The village came under repeated shelling and was occupied by Russian forces for 24 days in March, but returned to Ukrainian control in April. However many houses remain destroyed and there a substantial amount of cluster munitions, anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines still hidden in the area. At least one local resident has been killed by hitting a tripwire which detonated an OZM-72 anti-personnel bounding fragmentation mine while walking in the forest., The HALO Trust is the world’s largest humanitarian mine clearance organisation and has been operating in Ukraine since 2015. Prior to March 2022, its 400 Ukrainian workforce was based in Kramatorsk, where it was clearing anti-personnel and anti-tank mines and booby traps. HALO relocated from the Donbas to Brovary in northern Ukraine immediately after Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv area, taking many of its original workforce with it and actively recruiting new deminers from the Kyiv region. Today, HALO is clearing mines and remnants of war in various locations in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions., During the Ambassador’s visit, Her Excellency met Tetiana Fediuk, one of the HALO Trust’s first female deminers. Tetiana comes from a small village in Luhansk region and received the ‘best deminer of 2018’ accolade after one year of service. Although her home village was occupied by Russian forces in, she managed to leave the Donbas to join HALO operations in Kyiv. Tetiana met Her Majesty’s Ambassador at a breakfast event organised by the British Embassy in October 2021, where she shared her experiences as female deminer with Ms Simmons. Yesterday, after six months of war in Ukraine, they met again in Tetiana’s professional domain., Her Majesty's Ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons said: “After six months of this barbaric war, Russia has contaminated much of Ukraine with deadly landmines., Today I visited the HALO Trust site in Brovary, Kyiv, to understand the horrific wreckage to families, livelihoods and farmland caused by these deliberately planted landmines. The continued Russian targeting of innocent people is abhorrent., I saw the commitment of the de-miners, many of them Ukrainian men and women, working away from their children or with family members fighting on the frontline. Their courage is inspirational., The UK Government is supporting HALO Trust with £2 million in funding for demining and risk education to protect the most vulnerable communities and help the Ukrainian people take back their land and lives from this deadly threat.”, Mairi Cunningham, Programme Manager of HALO Ukraine said:
Today [Wednesday 24 March] marks six months since the invasion of Russian forces in Ukraine. Many of my demining colleagues endured weeks of suffering in Mariupol and elsewhere in the Donbas but are determined to work with HALO to remove the explosive remnants of war in their country. We are deeply grateful to Ambassador Simmons for showing her support during yesterday’s visit and would like to thank her and the FCDO for the emergency £2m funding to assist with HALO’s work here. Thanks to UK Aid, British taxpayers can be assured they are directly contributing to saving lives and livelihoods in Ukraine.
Clearing landmines and explosive ordnance is not only necessary for saving lives, but also to help Ukrainian farmers get Ukrainian crops back on the roads and out to export.

Update 93 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (23 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,23 Aug 2022,"Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that renewed shelling in recent days caused additional damage in the area of the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), once again highlighting the serious nuclear safety and security risks facing the facility and underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to go there, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Ukraine informed the IAEA that the shelling on Saturday (20 August) and Sunday (21 August) damaged ZNPP infrastructure including laboratory and chemical facilities, the Director General said. In addition, Ukraine said shelling on Monday (22 August) damaged the transformers of the nearby thermal power plant, causing a disconnection of the power line linking this plant to the ZNPP lasting several hours before it was restored later the same day., “These incidents show why the IAEA must be able to send a mission to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant very soon. I’m continuing to consult very actively and intensively with all parties so that this vital IAEA mission can take place without further delay. The IAEA’s presence will help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation at the site and reduce the risk of a severe nuclear accident in Europe. The mission is expected to take place within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed,” Director General Grossi said., In addition to the now restored back-up line to the thermal power plant, the ZNPP has one operational power line connecting it to the grid out of a total of four such lines. A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including the two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), three at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP., In relation to safeguards, Director General Grossi said the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the sites of the four operational NPPs in Ukraine, as well as from the Chornobyl NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-93-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-23-august-2022

Protection and Human Rights",23 Aug 2022,"The NGO Educo urges that education for children affected by the conflict must be prioritised, Half a year into the war in Ukraine, which broke out on 24 February, the NGO Educo urges that education for children and adolescents affected by the conflict be a priority. ""Unfortunately this war is dragging on. In humanitarian crises, education is sometimes neglected and perceived as less pressing, but six months into the conflict it is urgent to focus on education for the children affected by this war,"" says Pilar Orenes, Executive Director of the NGO., As a member of ChildFund Alliance, Educo supports educational programs in Ukraine as well as refugee families in Moldova. Throughout the summer, it has run summer camps in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, located in the far west of the country and a major centre for the arrival of displaced people, and has also run summer camps and other programs to support families who have taken refuge in Moldova. ""We will continue to support children in Ukraine, and when the summer is over we will provide online education and recreational activities for children affected by the war,"" says Orenes: ""We must put education at the forefront, because the future of hundreds of thousands of children and the future of the country depend on it”., The NGO condemns the fact that during these six months of conflict, many educational institutions have become targets of attack, in violation of international laws of war. ""An attack on a school is an attack on children, on the civilian population and on a place that provides training and protection for children,"" laments Orenes., Since the beginning of the war, 261 education centres have been destroyed and more than 2000 have been damaged, according to data from the Ukraine government’s Education Ministry. The Executive Director of Educo points out that ""children affected by conflict need spaces to learn in, but also moments of leisure and free time, places where they can be protected from the many threats that often lurk in this type of context, such as all kinds of abuse or trafficking""., Education at the centre, Educo points out that in order for the education of children affected by war to be at the centre, it is necessary to maintain and reinforce commitments from institutions and governments to this cause. Spain has so far contributed more than 14 million euros to the UN appeal, which places it in 17th place on the list of donors, having made a contribution of 0.6% of the total. Within this amount of 14.3 million, more than 8.6 million has been allocated to children and 1.4 million to education., About Educo:, Educo is a global development NGO focused on education child protection and child participation, which works in 14 countries carrying out projects in which more than 1.6 million children and young people participate.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/24th-august-half-year-start-war-ukraine

No sentence or punishment may be passed on them unless it is delivered by an impartial and regularly constituted court., We recall that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of courts solely to judge prisoners of war and that wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial amounts to a war crime., We are furthermore concerned that prisoners of war have generally been held without access to independent monitors, exposing them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession. There have also been worrying public statements by Russian officials and members of affiliated armed groups labelling Ukrainian prisoners of war as ‘war criminals’, ‘Nazis’, and ‘terrorists’, thereby undermining the presumption of innocence., We reiterate our calls to the Russian Federation to grant independent monitors full access to all individuals detained in relation to the armed conflict in Ukraine, by the Russian Federation, including those held by Russian-affiliated armed groups., For more information and media requests, please contact:, Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org or

Con todo el sistema humanitario al límite, el conflicto podría tener impactos permanentes en la capacidad de las organizaciones y sus donantes para responder en la crisis de Ucrania y en emergencias en otros lugares., La Federación Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja (FICR), la Cruz Roja de Ucrania y otras 46 Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja continúan ampliando una de sus mayores respuestas en la historia para satisfacer las necesidades humanitarias., “La gente está en un punto crítico de quiebra. El coste humano sigue aumentando y el sufrimiento ha sido inimaginable para millones de personas. Los devastadores efectos colaterales solo aumentan a medida que el conflicto se prolonga con el aumento de los precios de los alimentos y el combustible y el empeoramiento de las crisis alimentarias. La Federación Internacional continúa creciendo con la necesidad humanitaria, pero no podemos hacerlo solos”, ha señalado el presidente de la FICR, Francesco Rocca, En Ucrania y los países vecinos, la inflación y la escasez de productos esenciales, como combustible y alimentos, afectan la capacidad de las personas para pagar los suministros básicos. La llegada inminente de un clima más frío en las próximas semanas traerá necesidades humanitarias adicionales. Si bien hemos visto una increíble demostración de generosidad, estas tensiones económicas pueden afectar a los países anfitriones que pueden ayudar a las personas que han huido del conflicto. Además de esto, las personas que han huido están atrapadas entre empezar de nuevo o volver a la incertidumbre y al peligro potencial., El conflicto sigue teniendo consecuencias de largo alcance. El coste de los alimentos ha subido en todo el mundo. Ucrania es uno de los mayores exportadores de cereales del mundo. Las exportaciones de granos del país han bajado un 46 por ciento en lo que va del año. Esta caída masiva está teniendo un gran impacto en el Cuerno de África, donde más de 80 millones sufren hambre extrema, la peor crisis alimentaria de los últimos 70 años., Dado que millones de personas han sido desplazadas, más de 100.000 voluntarios, voluntarias y personal de la Cruz Roja local se han movilizado rápidamente en Ucrania, en los países limítrofes (Polonia, Eslovaquia, Hungría, Rumania, Moldavia, Rusia y Bielorrusia) y en otros 17 países de la región., El director de la Cruz Roja de Ucrania, general Maksym Dotsenko, ha señalado que “la gente ha tenido que dejar todo atrás y escapar con vida, muchos están viviendo y planificando el día a día. Con el invierno a la vuelta de la esquina, sabemos que esto será cada vez más difícil para las personas que necesitan lo básico para sobrevivir: un lugar cálido para vivir, alimentos, bienes y servicios”. “Nuestro personal y voluntariado continúa trabajando las 24 horas para apoyar a las personas, incluso cuando muchos se preocupan por sus propias familias y su seguridad.

"Ukraine: Six months in, IFRC warns of ripple effects and mounting humanitarian needs",News and Press Release,IFRC,"Food and Nutrition
Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Aug 2022,"Geneva/Budapest/Kyiv, 23 August 2022– Six months into the escalation of conflict in Ukraine, humanitarian needs in and outside the country continue to grow. With the entire humanitarian system stretched, the conflict could have lasting impacts on the capacity of organizations and their donors to respond in Ukraine and to emergencies elsewhere., The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the Ukrainian Red Cross and 46 other Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies continue to scale up one of their largest responses in history to meet the humanitarian needs., IFRC President Francesco Rocca says:, “People are at a critical breaking point. The human cost continues to mount, and the suffering has been unimaginable for millions. The devastating knock-on effects are only growing as the conflict drags on with rising food and fuel prices and worsening food crises. IFRC is continuing to scale up with the humanitarian need, but we cannot do it alone.”, In Ukraine and neighbouring countries, inflation, and shortages of essential products, such as fuel and food, impact the ability of people to afford basic supplies. The imminent arrival of colder weather in the weeks to come will bring additional humanitarian needs. While we have seen an incredible outpouring of generosity, these economic strains can affect how much host communities are able to assist people who have fled from conflict. On top of this, people who have fled are stuck between starting over or going back to uncertainty and potentially danger., The conflict continues to have far-reaching consequences. The cost of food has gone up around the world. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain exporters. The country’s grain exports are down 46 per cent so far this year. This massive drop is having a major impact on the Greater Horn of Africa where more than 80 million are experiencing extreme hunger, the worst food crisis in the last 70 years., As millions of people have been displaced, more than 100,000 local Red Cross volunteers and staff have rapidly mobilized in Ukraine, in bordering countries – Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Russia and Belarus – and in 17 additional countries in the region., Ukrainian Red Cross Director, General Maksym Dotsenko, says:, “People have had to leave everything behind and escape with their lives, many are living and planning day-by-day. With winter around the corner, we know that this will only become increasingly difficult for people who need the basics to survive – a warm place to live, food, goods, and services.”, “Our staff and volunteers continue to work around the clock to support people, even when many worry about their own families and their safety. Yet they continue to put on the Red Cross vest to deliver critical aid to those who need it. We are focused on being adaptable, flexible, and responsive to whatever happens next.”, Much about the future of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine remains unknown. Even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families. This outlook requires humanitarian organizations, governments, and donors to commit for the long term. New sources of funding and resources will have to be found outside of humanitarian budgets., Guided by impartiality, the IFRC, along with other members of National Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, will continue scaling up, providing essential humanitarian aid; cash and voucher assistance; healthcare, including mental health support, first aid and medical supplies and care; and water and sanitation., Note to editors:, We have experts available to provide the latest information from different countries and audio-visuals for use by the media., For more information and to arrange an interview please contact:, In Budapest: Guy Lepage, +1 (365) 885-3155 (WhatsApp) | +36 204597933 | RRCommsOf.Budapest@ifrc.org, In Geneva: Jenelle Eli, +1 202-603-6803 | jenelle.eli@ifrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-six-months-ifrc-warns-ripple-effects-and-mounting-humanitarian-needs

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, the two communities of Komarniv and Velikolyubin have sheltered more than 1,200 internally displaced persons from war-torn regions., More than 200 activists joined the clean-up in both communities, which was supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said such activities help IDPs integrate more quickly and easily into the new environment and help strengthen social cohesion within communities, whilst also contributing to the development of socially useful initiatives., ""Due to the war, many Ukrainians were forced to leave their homes, fleeing from danger, and we can only imagine how difficult it was to make such a decision,"" Coene said. ""We are very happy to support initiatives like this one, as they not only bring communities together, but also make them cleaner and allow us to take care of the environment during these very difficult times."", Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, noted the exceptional engagement of Ukrainians who, despite the war, are eagerly working hand-in-hand with the local authorities, civils society and displaced people to protect the environment they live in., ""The war in Ukraine continues destroying the lives of millions of people and displacing them, but no weapon will ever be able to destroy the desire of Ukrainians to come together for a positive change in the host communities,""she said.""These clean-up campaigns are very inspiring.

Access to humanitarian aid across the country and long-term support to displaced people, including those who choose to return, needs to be prioritised from now on.

Getting Ready: Bolstering Civil Protection Capabilities in Ukraine,News and Press Release,ACTED,Protection and Human Rights,22 Aug 2022,"With financial support from UKAid, ACTED, together with Ukrainian NGO, Right to Protection (R2P), and IMPACT Initiatives, have begun collaborating with oblast authorities, Ukrainian State Emergency Services (SESU) and Civil Protection departments, to address critical gaps to ensure the safety of civilians., Taking a highly participatory and consultative approach, 3P partners are led by the needs and priorities of Ukrainian civil protection authorities to strengthen the protection capacity and readiness of beneficiaries to respond to conflict-related emergencies., As the war grinds on in the East and South, Ukrainian cities and villages recently liberated or spared so far from large-scale destruction are working rapidly to reinforce preparedness systems and prevent further harm to on civilian populations from materialising. As the lead agency of the 3P Consortium ('Prevent, Prepare, Protect'), ACTED, together with Ukrainian NGO, Right to Protection (R2P) and IMPACT Initiatives, are collaborating with authorities and social institutions in seven oblasts, including Kyvska, to deliver targeted capacity building interventions, provide information management and technical support, and donate critical equipment to key civil protection duty-bearers., At community level, local civil society organisations, groups, and individuals continue to play a crucial role in responding to emergencies since the conflict began, while official first responders (ambulance and, firefighters) are stretched to their limits. Recognizing this, ACTED and partners also focus on provision of additional training -articularly First Aid and Psychological First Aid - and channeling resources into managing and upscaling support to these groups. At the same time, ACTED works with authorities to increase the general public's awareness of, and readiness for emergencies through either the procurement and installation of public alert systems equipment or the development of mobile apps that will alert users to evacuation orders, nearest bomb shelters, guidance on what to pack in a go-bag, and information on conflict-related risks such as fires, hazmat incidents, and unexploded ordinance. These activities will be complemented by the implementation of a large-scale awareness campaign to support oblast efforts to increase residents' understanding of preparedness measures. Social institutions, such as mental health and state care facilities, will benefit from R2P's protection experience and receive customized guidance on improving inclusion and accessibility for vulnerable groups including the elderly, people with special needs, women, and children., Since the 24th of February 2022, an estimated 6.65 million people have been displaced from their homes within Ukraine, and a further 6.4 million have fled across international borders, making it the most significant displacement crisis in Europe since World War II. In this context, the safe and efficient management of mass population movements has become one of the highest priorities of authorities. As one of the project's primary objectives, ACTED and IMPACT are working with oblast authorities, and the departments in charge of civil protection (SESU, CP departments) to review and update existing mass evacuation and emergency response plans, and provide critical equipment and resources that will enable authorities to put plans into practice. In addition, the Consortium undertake light renovations of several protective structures in case of conflict escalation, where citizens may seek refuge from shelling and missile attacks. Key staff involved in charge of setting up temporary collective centers for IDPs will also receive training in protection mainstreaming, humanitarian standards, legal counselling, and vulnerability sensitization. Coupled with national and regional level advocacy and experience sharing opportunities, these activities contribute to improving the coordination of emergency response across multiple regions., The 3P Consortium, The 3P Consortium, established in Ukraine in 2019, comprises a group of international and national NGOs operating in the country - ACTED, IMPACT Initiatives, and the Right to Protection. Under ACTED's leadership, the 3P Consortium works to reduce disaster risk vulnerability and enhance community resilience. Initially focused on Eastern Ukraine, the Consortium has expanded its geographic focus since the start of the 24 February conflict to support recently liberated oblasts and those that have so far been spared from the effects of large-scale military operations. 3P partners are united by their desire to prevent, prepare and protect - the '3P' - civilian populations and critical service systems against conflictrelated risks, as well as the risks of natural, ecological and industrial disasters in Ukraine., 3P Consortium Partners, ACTED -- www.acted.org: ACTED is a French humanitarian organisation present in 40 countries and supporting over 18.2 million beneficiaries worldwide.

But the fact is that many more families are waiting for news, particularly families of prisoners of war, who feel frustrated, hopeless, and angry as the days and months go by without any information., ""Over the last six months, the international armed conflict raging in Ukraine has caused a huge number of civilian deaths and injuries, massive population displacement, immense physical and mental suffering, and horrific damage to civilian infrastructure. It's also taken an extreme emotional toll on victims of conflict and families of soldiers,"" said Robert Mardini, the ICRC's director-general. ""Families are anxious and desperate for news. We hear it in their voices and read it in their words. Conflict makes it clearer than ever that families belong together. We're determined and will continue to work as hard as we can to reconnect separated relatives."", The consequences of a missing family member can be devastating, and families have a right to know what happened to their loved ones., Under the Third Geneva Convention, the states mandate the ICRC to visit prisoners of war in international armed conflicts, no matter where they are held. The ICRC continues to call on all relevant authorities to facilitate visits by the ICRC to prisoners of war, a stipulation all parties have agreed to under the Geneva Conventions., The last six months have taken a huge toll. If frontlines continue to shift, more civilians will be subjected to the horrors of conflict, with lives needlessly lost and families torn apart. The Red Cross Red Crescent Movement is working to alleviate the suffering of victims of conflict, including by providing unconditional cash grants to 625,000 people., Some of the other work that the ICRC, the Ukrainian Red Cross and other Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement partners, including the IFRC, have carried out since February includes:, For additional information about the assistance provided by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to communities affected by the international armed conflict, please see here., For further information, please contact:, Fatima Sator (English, French), ICRC Geneva, fsator@icrc.org, Tel.: +41 79 848 49 08

Our joint efforts will contribute to the green recovery pathways in Ukraine, while ensuring the role of agriculture in the Nationally Determined Contribution of Ukraine to the Paris Agreement. Most importantly, our partnership will help Ukraine retain its position as one of the key agriculture suppliers worldwide.”, Deputy Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine for digital development, digital transformations and digitalization Denis Bashlyk said the expanded partnership with UNDP would help the agriculture sector recover from the impacts of war., “Before the war we were one of the biggest exporters of wheat, corn and oil,” said Bashlyk. “After Russia launched full-scale war, the world understood that without Ukraine, the world’s food security is threatened. Many countries ended up in difficult conditions, in some countries we can see high inflation rates, and what is worse, millions of people have ended up on the brink of starvation.”, The deputy minister emphasized that currently the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine prioritizes the implementation of state support programmes, the use of modern irrigation systems by agricultural producers, and the prompt resolution of logistical issues in agriculture., According to the MoU, both parties will pursue and implement climate-smart approaches, tools and technologies to support low-carbon models of agricultural development. The cooperation will aim to elaborate and introduce state programmes for pilot projects to enhance the access of agricultural producers to green financing, elaborate logistics solutions facilitating transportation of produce to other countries. The agreement also focuses on supporting organic agriculture development, and compliance with sustainability criteria in accordance with Renewable Directive (EU) 2018/2001 and Action Plan on the implementation of Association Agreement., The cooperation should contribute to more inclusive strategies for ecological recovery with innovative sources of financing, which bolster women’s economic empowerment., Media Enquiries, Yuliia Samus, UNDP Communications Team Leader, yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ministry-agrarian-policy-and-food-ukraine-strengthen-agriculture-sector-undp-support-enuk

There are no armed operations of this kind that do not result in children being harmed., “Meanwhile, beyond the horror of children being killed or physically hurt in attacks, almost every child in Ukraine has been exposed to deeply distressing events, and those fleeing violence are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking., “The start of the school year in just over a week’s time is a stark reminder of how much children in Ukraine have lost., “Ukraine’s education system has been devastated by the escalation of hostilities across the country.

Since the escalation of war in Ukraine on 24 February, more than 10 million women and children have been negatively impacted, and with an estimated one third of Ukrainian refugees expected to develop depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorders1, there is an urgent need to provide support to those suffering from ongoing war trauma now and in the months and years to come, warns CARE., “The fear and grief that wars create leave deep internal scars – scars that hurt every bit as much, if not more, than physical scars. Left unaddressed, this fear and grief can have a profound long-term, negative impact and lead to a range of serious mental health issues or even suicide,” said Isadora Quay, CARE International’s Global Gender in Emergencies Coordinator., Sarah Easter, a member of CARE’s global emergency team, travelled to Ukraine recently and heard countless stories of fear, distress, terror, heartbreak and hope. She shared, ""We cannot sit idly by and watch women and children suffer from ongoing psychological distress and its complications. Women told me about missiles going through apartments and dead bodies on the street, and also that as a consequence of the war, when searching for safe places, they found closed public facilities or not fully functional health facilities, preventing them from receiving adequate help. We urgently need to step up our assistance so that women and children can receive the mental health and psychosocial support they need to survive, heal and face the future.”, Maya, 62, from Kyiv shared her story with Ms Easter, “It sounded like rain, but there were no clouds. When I stepped out onto the balcony, a missile flew by. That’s when I decided to flee west. The evacuation train went through the active war zone. It was announced that we should turn off our phones. Then the lights went off and we continued very slowly. The train was dead quiet.”, CARE and our partners are providing support to families, women and children who have seen and experienced the horrors of war in Ukraine. “We are employing psychosocial workers through organisations in Poland, Ukraine and Romania to provide much-needed support to those impacted by the war, as well as providing relief activities for families and children and information on where to seek further help, including anonymously through hotlines. CARE’s partners have also produced a book that helps people process their feelings and learn useful coping strategies. Not everyone is comfortable speaking directly with a mental health professional, so we have designed a range of activities and approaches to suit different needs,” said Ms Quay., Tamara, a psychologist with a Ukrainian organisation supported by the Center for Women's Perspective, a CARE partner, said, “Most of my patients either live in the past or in the future. I help them to live in the present. I normally start by letting them explain their fear, maybe let them draw it. Most of my patients are stressed and in shock. I try and decrease their level of fear. I believe there will be a lot of cases of post-traumatic stress disorder.”, Tetyana, 33, who fled Luhansk with her 12-year-old daughter, said, “I came to Rivne totally broken. I needed help and someone to talk to. With a psychologist, we talked about my primary fear. We did some practical exercises to control my negative thoughts, to stop and turn it to the positive. The first time there were air sirens in Rivne, it was like something switched inside of me. I was so overwhelmed and there were too many emotions. Now I can deal with it better. I can talk about it. The sirens do not scare me as much.”, Sofia Sprechmann Sineiro, CARE International’s Secretary General said, “As mental health needs increase, psychosocial and mental health support must be made available and accessible to affected women, men and children, and treated with the same urgency as meeting physical needs. Lives and futures depend on it.”, Founded in 1945, CARE is one of the largest and oldest humanitarian aid organisations fighting global poverty.

Empowering Persons with Disabilities in Eastern Ukraine,Analysis,SeeD,Protection and Human Rights,22 Aug 2022,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, Ukraine has been a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since 2008, yet monitors and civil society consistently point to the absence of a rights-based approach to disability, ultimately preventing persons with disabilities from fully exercising their rights. The barriers obstructing persons with disabilities have been compounded in the context of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, including on some the most vulnerable groups—women and older persons with disabilities. The present study aims to provide quantitative evidence of the current realities of persons with disabilities in the oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, and presents actionable recommendations by which the state, international donors and civil society can foster an enabling environment for their continued empowerment. The results and recommendations were validated in two focus group discussions with persons with disabilities and representatives from organisations working with them. In line with previous research, SCORE results showed that persons with disabilities in Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts experience higher levels of marginalisation based on their health status, income and education level when compared to the comparable sample of those without disability status. Persons with disabilities report lower mental wellbeing, which is exacerbated in women with disabilities., The social, civic and economic empowerment of persons with disabilities are all linked to their mental and physical wellbeing. While limitations to the economic empowerment of persons with disabilities arise due to fewer employment opportunities, the deficit in civic activity, especially pronounced in youth with disabilities, is influenced by their access to education and their social inclusion. Nevertheless, youth with disabilities are passionate and optimistic about making a change in Ukraine, indicating that if the means are made available, far-reaching benefits could be reaped from their inclusion and empowerment., Actors seeking to solidify the empowerment of persons with disabilities should focus on combating intersectional discrimination, mainstreaming access to psychosocial support that is sensitive to gender and sociodemographic characteristics, and strengthening equal and inclusive education and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/empowering-persons-disabilities-eastern-ukraine

There were not enough places, we were forced to deliver beds in the corridor, because it was impossible to refuse,” recalls Dmytro Bondaryuk, director of the Center., Now the institution houses mostly local elderly residents and several families from Kyiv and Kharkiv, but volunteers have already begun to prepare for winter to accept everyone who will need help.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/chernivtsi-region-there-center-medical-and-social-support-and-rehabilitation-ukrainian-red-cross-enuk

All this allowed families to distract at least for a moment from the events experienced and feel joy and happiness., “This is the first time in six months that I’ve been smiling all day long!” said one of the participants at the end of the camp.

At least 16% of children killed in six months of war in Ukraine aged under 5,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,22 Aug 2022,"At least 942 children have been killed or injured, 356 children killed of which 59, 16%, were under the age of 5, 586 injured with 75, or 13%, aged under 5, KYIV, 22 AUGUST, 2022 – At least 16% of children confirmed killed in Ukraine since the war escalated six months ago were under the age of five, Save the Children said today., Between February 24 and August 10, at least 942 children were killed or injured in Ukraine – an average of five children every day — with 356 children losing their lives and 586 wounded, according to data from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)., The UN has said that the total number of casualties is likely to be much higher than those currently verified and the exact ages of all child casualties are not all known. Most of the verified child casualties were due to the use of explosive weapons in populated, urban areas., In the once bustling city of Kharkiv, relentless shelling and bombing reportedly damaged more than 600 buildings in the first month of the war, according to city officials, including nurseries, schools and health care facilities., Dana*, 29, and her daughter, Antonina*, 2, fled Kharkiv in March at the peak of the city’s bombardment. Before they managed to escape the city, they took refuge in a cellar as the sound of air aids could be heard overhead., “She heard all the explosions and was afraid; she couldn't sleep. When the same thing happens here, she is scared and asks: ‘Something went boom, mom. What just went boom?’” said Dana. “With a child that’s only two-and-a-half years old, I can't just explain to her that there’s a war going on and children are dying. She's too small.”, Instead, she tells her daughter that the loud booms are thunder. But this tactic doesn’t work for her older nieces and nephews who are more aware of what is happening., “They ask a lot of questions. One of my nephews is nine and he asks: “Will I die as well?” His parents try hard at picking the right words to give him an answer,” said Dana. “My five-year-old niece asks ‘When I grow up, will I still be running to the hallway when there's a siren?’ So, they understand [that this isn’t normal].”, Children in parts of the country are growing up on the frontlines of brutal warfare as urban areas are used as battlefields, leading to deaths and life-changing injuries, and destroying infrastructure needed to guarantee access to life-saving food and water., Millions of children from Ukraine have fled their homes, with an estimated 3.1 million children living as refugees in neighbouring countries. About 3 million children are believed to be internally displaced inside Ukraine., Save the Children’s Country Director in Ukraine, Sonia Khush, said:, “Although children in Ukraine have nothing to do with the causes of the war, they are the ones most affected by it. They are growing up to the sound of bombs and shelling, and to the sight of their homes being destroyed, their schools damaged and their friends and family members being killed or injured.”, Even though cities throughout the country are on the frontlines of a devastating war, Save the Children teams are seeing acts of kindness and resilience unfold throughout the country. In Bucha, for example, – which was severely damaged by shelling and bombing earlier this year – the community has come together to rebuild a destroyed playground for children., Khush continued: “Children need more than humanitarian aid, they need hope: hope that this war will end; hope that they can return home; and hope for a bright future. Without meaningful support and an immediate cessation of hostilities, Ukraine will not only become a graveyard for even more children but also for children’s hopes and dreams.”, Dana and Antonina now live in Dnipro where Save the Children is supporting them with essential household items and food through a local partner, Pomagaem. Dana hopes to return to Kharkiv next month if it is safe to do so. Her friends and family are scattered throughout the country, living wherever they could take refuge when the war escalated six months ago., “We're living one day at a time, and that's it. For us it's not like we've come here [to Dnipro] and are going to stay here permanently,” said Dana. “In any case, we are going to go home.”, Save the Children is calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities as the only way to protect children from violence and other violations of their rights. The aid agency condemns attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, and the use of ballistic missiles and other inaccurate explosive weapons, which are causing civilian casualties, and violate international humanitarian law., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to get access to the services they need. With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, baby and hygiene kits to displaced families. It is on the ground, distributing essential household kits to families affected by the conflict., Between February 24 to August 10, 942 children have been confirmed killed and injured in Ukraine, with 356 children killed and 586 injured. According to numbers Save the Children obtained from OHCHR:, Age unknown: 55 killed and 151 injured, Civilian casualties among children under 5 (of those 736 whose ages are known):, Killed – 59 children under 5, 16.5% of 356 total number of children killed under 5, Injured – 75 children, About 13% of the 586 children injured under 5, 134 children (or 14% of 942 total child casualties) were under 5, As of 16 August, 6.37 million people have fled Ukraine, half (3.18) are estimated to be children., For further enquiries please contact:, · Samantha Halyk Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org (based in Ukraine from 19 August until 4 September), · Daphnee Cook Daphnee.cook@savethechildren.org (based in Kenya), · Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/least-16-children-killed-six-months-war-ukraine-aged-under-5

"17 killed and 32 injured in Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv, 17-18 August 2022",News and Press Release,AOAV,Protection and Human Rights,19 Aug 2022,"By Chiara Torelli on 19 Aug 2022, From the evening of 17 Aug to pre-dawn on 18 Aug, a series of Russian missile strikes on residential neighbourhoods in Kharkiv killed 17 civilians and injured 32, destroying homes and commercial premises., Late on 17 Aug, 13 civilians were killed and 20 injured, including one child, when a Russian ground-launched Iskander missile hit a three-storey house in Kharkiv’s Saltivskyi district. The house was completely destroyed, and the strike caused a fire to spread., Overnight, four civilians were killed, including an 11-year-old boy, and 22 injured, including two children, in a missile strike on a dormitory in Kharkiv’s Slobidskyi district. The dormitory was partially destroyed and a neighbouring shop damaged., Since 24 February 2022, AOAV has recorded 338 incidents of Russian explosive weapon use targeting urban residential areas in Ukraine, or 43% of the total 789 incidents of Russian-perpetrated explosive violence recorded in that time., Urban residential areas are the locations in which AOAV has recorded the majority of incidents of Russian explosive weapon use in Ukraine, followed by 30% in locations where multiple urban areas are affected, 10% in villages, 3% in locations where no information is recorded, and 2% in schools., Russian armed forces’ use of explosive weapons in urban residential areas is responsible for 28% of the total 5,839 reported civilian casualties of Russian explosive violence in Ukraine since 24 Feb 2022., When Russian armed forces used explosive weapons in urban residential areas in Ukraine, 100% of the casualties are civilians., Globally, since 2010, AOAV has recorded 439 incidents of Russian explosive weapon use in urban residential areas, resulting in 2,367 reported civilian casualties. When Russia has used explosive weapons in urban residential areas, 99% of reported casualties are civilians., In total, since 2010, AOAV has recorded 5,201 incidents of explosive weapon use in urban residential areas, which have caused 42,008 reported civilian casualties. Urban residential areas are the most targeted known location of explosive weapon use. When explosive weapons are used in urban residential areas, 92% of the total 45,492 reported casualties are civilians., State actors are the reported perpetrators in the case of 44% of incidents of explosive weapon use in urban residential areas, and non-state actors in the case of 34%., The reported perpetrator of the most incidents of explosive weapon use in urban residential areas is Russia, while the reported perpetrator of the most civilian casualties of explosive weapon use in urban residential areas is Syria., AOAV’s casualty figures represent the lowest of estimations in terms of the number of people killed and injured by explosive weapon use. In an effort to quantify the explicit harm caused by specific explosive weapons, AOAV solely records incident-specific casualty figures, as reported in English-language media., AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. All actors should stop using explosive weapons with wide-area effects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/17-killed-and-32-injured-russian-missile-strikes-kharkiv-17-18-august-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Aug 2022,"Ukraine, 19 August 2022 – Humanitarians in Ukraine are not new to crises. In 2014, the armed conflict in the east of the country caused a wave of displacement, uprooting almost 1.5 million people. However, the invasion on 24 February has been ravaging the country for six months and caused an internal and external displacement of over 13 million people, spurring a larger system into overdrive. Thousands of volunteers, first responders and humanitarians mobilized and joined efforts, despite facing personal challenges, including displacement, loss of home and separation from their loved ones., “I see myself in the eyes of displaced persons”, Back in February, Yevheniia Kovalenko was the Head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Field Office in Sievierodonetsk in the Luhansk Region. The city, which has a population of about 100,000 people, became her second home in 2016 after she fled the non-government-controlled part of the region. The entire IOM team in Sievierodonetsk shared the same fate of displacement. They managed to start anew, finding accommodation, sending children to school and assisting conflict-affected people through IOM’s numerous projects., “Despite the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, residents of Sievierodonetsk tried to find stability in their daily lives, accepting this as the new normal. Our work as IOM was aimed at supporting the most urgent economic recovery, and empowering affected people. On 24 February, the fragile peace collapsed again, taking with it years of humanitarian and development progress,” Yevheniia recalls. Sievierodonetsk is now occupied by the Russian Federation after heavy fighting destroyed almost 80 per cent of civilian housing, including those of humanitarian workers., In February, Yevheniia’s team relocated to western Ukraine and established IOM’s operational presence in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk from scratch. In the first chaotic days of the war, when the city was overcrowded with people fleeing from fighting, some of the staff members lived in the collective centres for displaced persons, as it was impossible to immediately find any other place to stay., Yevheniia’s main priorities were to find accommodation for colleagues, as many had left with families and children, and to kick start IOM’s local response as the unprecedented crisis unfolded., “Being displaced twice, we understand more than anyone the situation of millions of Ukrainians. When meeting displaced people, I see the 2014 version of myself in their eyes. Back then, I was a mother with a little child, with no strength to face the war. Now, I feel more empowered because I know how to act and how to help others. We are dealing with the needs on a bigger scale but also our understanding of the problems has grown,” says Yevheniia, who is now leading IOM’s regional hub with 13 national and international staff members, responding to the needs of displaced Ukrainians hosted in the region., One of the primary concerns of IOM is improving the living conditions for displaced persons staying in collective centres where up to 100 people sometimes share one room. In Ivano-Frankivsk Region, about 4,500 people are staying in such centres. IOM’s assistance to these facilities includes household appliances, blankets, and individual hygiene kits, as well as basic repairs., “The conditions in which people live are far from being normal. I see how our work makes a difference. While focusing on emergency response, we are starting to think of recovery efforts as many displaced persons have nowhere to return to and will need to build their lives again. As we did twice already.”, “When everyone was in panic, we became a real pillar of support for people”, The speed, continuity, and scale of IOM’s humanitarian response in Ukraine was made possible not only by the efforts of its humanitarian workers, but also a network of 50 local partner civil society organizations with operations on the ground. To address the growing needs, most of them have shifted the focus of their operations in the blink of an eye and are now focusing on providing humanitarian assistance., A few weeks after the invasion of Ukraine, the first batch of IOM’s aid – hygiene and baby kits, mattresses, solar lamps, sleeping bags, and kitchen sets – reached Zaporizhzhia in south-eastern Ukraine. In recent days, Zaporizhzhia has drawn attention as the site of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the target of military activities which, according to the United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, could lead to catastrophic consequences not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond., “Before 24 February, we had not dealt with a humanitarian response. We had never handed over hygiene kits or food. It was a new challenge for us. We have grown from delivering 120 kits daily to 20-30 tons of aid,” explains Anna Chernova, a programme manager at the IOM partner charity foundation Posmishka UA, which used to focus on expanding the country’s social welfare system and counter-trafficking activities., Currently, the foundation is working in the logistics hub in Zaporizhzhia – the new heart of the city, which receives all newly arrived displaced persons, mostly from temporary occupied territories of this region, as well as from Kherson and Donetsk. Public authorities, social services and civil society organizations work closely here, so that people can get all available assistance: from information on the resumption of education for children to accommodation in collective centres and receiving family hygiene kits. In front of the hub, Posmishka UA has set up a field kitchen, offering hot meals to people., People who come here have gone through more than 20 checkpoints on foot to cross the front line, fleeing from shelling and bloodshed. Humanitarian workers here help displaced persons and vulnerable locals, as well as people who decide to return home to the temporarily occupied territories, giving them the basic necessities for the difficult route., “People who come to Zaporizhzhia do not expect to receive any help. They do not believe that someone is waiting for them here, so they are very touched by our support,” recalls Anna., The team says that the needs of people in Ukraine over the past months have remained almost the same, but have grown in scale. Rising unemployment makes it difficult covering basic things such as food, hygiene products, solar lamps, mattresses, and medicine., “Our hub could receive up to 3,000 people daily when the green corridors were working,” says the team who also helps civilian evacuees. In May, the city became the endpoint on the evacuation route organized by the United Nations for civilians hiding in the bunkers of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol. In Zaporizhzhia, these people who went through hell on earth were warmly met by volunteers and international organizations, who provided people with water, food, and psychosocial support., “People have lost faith – this is what we aim to restore”, Despite challenges, the team of Posmishka UA in Zaporizhzhia has only grown, remaining true to the principle of staying and delivering. There are 65 volunteers – locals and internally displaced persons – working at the foundation on a permanent basis. They help to unload, sort, and distribute humanitarian aid. Volunteers are a boon for public organizations in Ukraine, which usually do not have enough funds to develop operational capacities. For Posmishka UA, working close to the front, these courageous people are a vital human resource., Anna is one of the volunteers at the Posmishka UA mobile field kitchen. Her war began back in 2014. She had to save her children for the second time already – first, running away from Donetsk six years ago when the hostilities broke out in eastern Ukraine, and then from Enerhodar in southern Ukraine in spring 2022., Anna says that her first experience of displacement was very difficult. Civil society organizations were the only ones that provided her family with assistance. Fleeing the war for the second time, Anna unleashed her inner power to support others, so that no one would be left alone with their problems., People who come here for a hot meal receive something even more valuable – attention and a pinch of positivity from Anna and other volunteers, who have already become one supportive family., “Why am I here? Because I understand what the people are going through. I've been through this before, so I can support them emotionally, help restore their faith in what the next day will bring and in people,” says Anna., Written by Iryna Tymchyshyn and Alisa Kyrpychova, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unbent-and-unbroken-humanitarian-workers-ukraine-turn-despair-hope-enuk

Logistics and Telecommunications",20 Aug 2022,"Istanbul, Turkey - 20 August 2022, It is good to be back in Istanbul and I thank Minister of Defense Hulusi Akar and the Government of Türkiye for your warm welcome., I thank you even more for your pivotal role in the Black Sea Grain Initiative., At the heart of this initiative is the Joint Coordination Centre which enables the safe movement of dozens of commercial vessels., Every member of the delegations represented at the JCC – Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and United Nations – have been working with dedication and professionalism bringing their unique skills and passion to support this essential work., They embody what we can achieve with political will, top operational expertise, and collective effort., I would like to especially recognize our acting coordinator of the UN team Frederick Kenney for his dedication and hard work on this Initiative. And I welcome, Amir Abdulla, whom I have appointed as Coordinator to lead the UN team. He brings decades of expertise in complex humanitarian operations., Ladies and Gentlemen of the media,, More than 650,000 metric tons of grain and other food are already on their way to markets around the world., I just came back from the Marmara Sea where Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and United Nations teams are conducting joint inspections on the vessels passing through the Black Sea on their way in or out of the Ukrainian ports., What a remarkable and inspiring operation., I just saw a World Food Progamme-chartered vessel – Brave Commander - which is waiting to sail to the horn of Africa to bring urgently needed relief to those suffering from acute hunger., Just yesterday, I was in Odesa port and saw first-hand the loading on a cargo of wheat onto a ship., I was so moved watching the wheat fill up the hold of the ship., It was the loading of hope for so many around the world., But let’s not forget that what we see here in Istanbul and in Odesa is only the more visible part of the solution., The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertilizer, which are not subject to sanctions., It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market., Without fertilizer in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023., Getting more food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia is critical to further calm commodity markets and lower prices for consumers, We are at the beginning of a much longer process, but you have already shown the potential of this critical agreement for the world., And so, I am here with a message of congratulations for all those in the Joint Coordination Centre and a plea for that vital life-saving work to continue., You can count on the full commitment of the United Nations to support you., Thank you., Question: What are your observations of today and will this be [inaudible] ceasefire agreement?, Secretary-General: First of all, as you can imagine, I was deeply moved, deeply moved, when I saw the World Food Programme’s ship that is heading to the Horn of Africa. I was deeply moved when I saw another ship, the largest until now involved in this operation, being prepared to cross the Bosphorus and I felt that this is work of enormous importance for humanity. Now, we always believe that hope is the last thing one can lose and obviously, I have hope that the most important value for humanity, that is peace, will also come to this part of the world. Peace, that for us, in the UN, is always linked to the UN Charter and International Law. And so, my hope, is that this extraordinary spirit of commitment that we have seen in the JCC will [result] in a complex, I am sure, lengthy, process in which we all would like to see peace, triumphing., Question: Russia’s Foreign Ministry keeps on repeating that Moscow hopes that the UN will make all necessary efforts to remove the remaining sanctions on Russian food and fertilizer. Can you please, Mr. Guterres, kindly explain what these restrictions are and what the UN is doing to remove them?, Secretary-General: As I have been saying time and time again, it has been made clear by the countries that have applied sanctions that they do not apply to food and fertilizers. But of course, there is a chilling effect in the private sector and there are a certain number of obstacles and difficulties that need to be overcome in relation to shipping, in relation to insurance and in relation to finance. And I can tell you that we are working hard in cooperation with the U.S. and the E.U. in order to be able to remove those obstacles and to allow for what we consider is extremely important for the people, especially in the developing countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-generals-remarks-press-joint-coordination-centre-black-sea-grain-initiative-including-q

Update 92 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (19 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,19 Aug 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, today renewed his urgent appeal for maximum military restraint in the area of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) following new signs of rising tension over Europe’s largest such facility., Just over a week after he briefed the United Nations Security Council on the worsening nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP, Director General Grossi warned that any further escalation related to the six-reactor plant could lead to a severe nuclear accident with potentially grave consequences for human health and the environment in Ukraine and elsewhere., In view of the serious situation, the Director General reiterated the need to send an IAEA mission to carry out essential safety, security and safeguards activities at the site in southern Ukraine. He said the IAEA is in active consultations with all parties regarding its efforts to send such a mission as soon as possible. As during two previous IAEA missions to Ukraine during the conflict, Director General Grossi would himself lead this mission., The Director General also welcomed recent statements indicating that both Ukraine and Russia supported the IAEA’s aim to send a mission to ZNPP., The Director General made his latest statement today in response to media reports and other information received by the IAEA in recent days indicating possible new nuclear safety and security risks related to the ZNPP, less than two weeks after shelling caused some damage at the plant, including impacting response activities in case of an emergency, that sparked widespread alarm about the situation there., “In this highly volatile and fragile situation, it is of vital importance that no new action is taken that could further endanger the safety and security of one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants,” Director General Grossi said., “There is an urgent need to lower the tension and take the necessary steps to help ensure nuclear safety and security and prevent any radiological consequences for the population and the environment. The IAEA can play an indispensable role in this regard,” he said., The IAEA has not been able to visit the ZNPP since before the conflict began half a year ago. Since early March, it has been controlled by Russian forces, but the Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., Separately today, Ukraine informed the IAEA that it had decided to make “a change in” the regulatory license for the ZNPP, instructing the Ukrainian operator to maintain reactor units 1 and 2 in cold shutdown. Currently, only reactor units 5 and 6 are operating at the plant. The IAEA continues to monitor the operational status of the reactors, as well as the nuclear safety and security situation more generally., Ukraine also informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including the two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), three at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP., In relation to safeguards, Director General Grossi said the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the sites of the four operational NPPs in Ukraine, as well as from the Chornobyl NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-92-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-19-august-2022

But it is also emotional because of the sadness I feel looking into this wonderful harbor and looking into these terminals practically empty with the possibility that this harbor has to develop that Ukraine and the whole region being cut off because of the war., As I said it is moving to be here in Odessa and it is especially meaningful to be here on World Humanitarian Day., For months, the port was paralyzed., Ships like those here were within minutes of sailing fully loaded with grains and other cargo., A critical transportation line from a global breadbasket was cut., The Black Sea Grain Initiative is changing that., In less than a month, 25 ships have departed from Odesa and other Ukrainian ports loaded with grain and other food supplies. With more on their way, as the minister has explained., They have carried well over 600,000 tonnes of food products and counting., Wheat. Corn. Sunflower oil. Soya beans., But each ship is also a vessel of hope., Hope for Ukrainian farmers finally rewarded for their harvest – with storage being freed up for more., Hope for seafarers and the larger shipping community, knowing that it is once again possible to sail through the Black Sea safely and efficiently., And, most of all, hope for the world’s most vulnerable people and countries., Here from Odesa on World Humanitarian Day, I want to make a special appeal to the wealthier world for those bearing the brunt of the global food crisis., As these ports open, I appeal for wealthier countries to also open their wallets and their hearts., After all, the movement of grains doesn’t mean much to countries that cannot afford it., Lower prices on the global food markets don’t mean much if those prices aren’t reflected in local food markets., A country cannot feed itself if it is starved for resources., It is time for massive and generous support so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports – and people can buy it., Developing countries need access to financing -- now., They need debt relief -- now., They need resources to invest in their people – now., And all of us must do more to ensure full global access to Ukraine’s food products and Russian food and fertilizers., That is not easy – but nothing about this initiative is easy., No one ever expected smooth sailing., This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter war., It is unprecedented in scope and scale., But there is still a long way to go on many fronts., Getting more food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices., But let’s not forget that what we see here in Odesa is only the more visible part of the solution., The other part that is also important, that we have been defending, relate to the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertilizer, which are not subject to sanctions., It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market., Without fertilizer in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023., I am deeply committed to those objectives, but it will only happen if all parties cooperate., I am here in Odesa to salute the work being done – and to urge that those efforts continue., Continue to help bring much-needed relief to global food security., Continue to improve global food supply and stabilize markets., And continue to improve the welfare of the most vulnerable, especially those trapped in the most fragile humanitarian contexts., Let us spare no effort to keep this life-saving effort going and to work for peace., Peace in line with the United Nations Charter and international law., Let us take inspiration from Odesa., Today, Odesa is more than just a shipping centre., This port is a symbol of what the world can do when we commit to working together for the common good., The Ukrainian people has been suffering so much.

In limbo in Dnipro: Displaced family faces uncertainty as Ukraine war marks six months,News and Press Release,WFP,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",19 Aug 2022,"Maxime and Anastasiia welcome food assistance from the World Food Programme but worry about their children’s prospects as the country reels from ongoing conflict, Weariness is etched on Maxime’s face as he describes his and his wife Anastasiia’s escape from their home in Ukraine’s war-torn Donetsk region – and the hard times they face today with their two children., Maxime recalls the steady shelling battering his neighbourhood in the eastern town of Bakhmut in March. “We felt our home shake in its entirety,” he says. “We packed our most precious belongings in some suitcases and left the next day.”, They are far from family and friends and are very much living on the edge. While relatively safe, hundreds of kilometres away, their newly adopted city, Dnipro, has also been targeted by missile strikes., Six months after the war began, Ukraine is a country on the move. Families are abandoning homes they’ve lived in all their lives, fleeing for safety on foot, or by car or bus. Sometimes, they find themselves packing up once again when unrest catches up., Today, more than 6 million Ukrainians are internally displaced, the UN estimates. Just as many are refugees, mostly in Europe., Meanwhile, hunger is also on the rise. One in three Ukraine families is food insecure – rising to one in two in parts of the country’s east where 40 percent of people surveyed said they were reducing meal sizes, with adults reducing their intake to feed children, or borrowing food. It remains a challenge for WFP and partners to analyze the needs of a vast, moving population, amid a volatile security situation., Reaching them with key food and nutritional assistance is challenging, especially in areas where conflict is intense. Nonetheless, the World Food Programme supported 2.9 million people with bread deliveries, food rations, and cash in July alone - WFP uses a flexible mix of food and cash to support vulnerable populations wherever they are, including in areas close to the front line., When possible, WFP buys food from Ukraine – one of the world’s breadbaskets, which paradoxically supplied two-thirds of the organization's grain procurements for hungry countries last year. Now Ukraine itself counts among those countries., “We are continuously working to get access to communities near the front line and in newly occupied areas,” says Marianne Ward, WFP’s Deputy Emergency Coordinator for Ukraine. “Last month, WFP reached 921,000 people in near-frontline and conflict-affected areas of the east and south. We are fully committed to supporting people in Ukraine on both sides of the contact line, always guided by the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, humanity and independence,” she says., Maxime’s family receives WFP boxes packed with staples such as canned meat, rice, pasta and oil., “With WFP assistance, at least we don’t worry about the food,” he says., They have plenty of other worries, though., Anastasiia regularly catches up with her parents who decided to stay back in Bakhmut despite the intensifying conflict. “They are finding it difficult to buy fuel, and food prices are rising by the week.”, After months of searching, Maxime has finally landed short-term jobs to tide the family over. But he misses the steady salary he once earned in Bakhmut as a factory worker. Still, the WFP rations free up his earnings for other key needs, like rent and healthcare., “We are doing our best to settle in,” Maxime says. “But I am no longer planning for the future.”, WFP is delivering food parcels to families affected by the war thanks to generous contributions from Australia, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Germany, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, UN CERF, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, as well as private donors.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/limbo-dnipro-displaced-family-faces-uncertainty-ukraine-war-marks-six-months

The Ukrainian Parliament extended martial law for another three months until 21 November., In the past week, fighting was concentrated in Donetska and Kharkivska oblasts. Tensions continue growing over the security situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant., Meanwhile, the first humanitarian vessel chartered by the World Food Programme left the port of Pivdennyi near Odesa on 16 August for Ethiopia with 23,000 tons of wheat on board., In eastern Zaporizka oblast, humanitarians delivered critical supplies for nearly 6,000 people remaining in the hard-hit town of Orikhiv on 17 August., Across Ukraine, the UN and its humanitarian partners reached nearly 12 million people with some form of humanitarian assistance., General security and humanitarian situation, The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres arrived in Hiroshima from New York on the evening of Friday, 5 August., On Saturday, he spoke at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony, which aims to console the souls of those lost to the atomic bombing, as well as pray for the realization of lasting world peace. In his remarks, the Secretary-General underscored that nuclear weapons are nonsense and called on countries to work urgently to eliminate the stockpiles that threaten our future., The Secretary-General said his message to leaders is simple: Stop flirting with disaster. Take the nuclear option off the table --- for good. [See Press Release SG/SM/21401], After the ceremony, he met with Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, with whom he discussed issues in the region including the situation in the Korean Peninsula and Japan's efforts to tackle climate change, among others. After their meeting, the Prime Minister gave the Secretary-General a special tour of the Peace Museum, and they then signed the museum's guestbook., Following the tour, the Secretary-General met with a group of survivors of the atomic bomb, known as the *hibakusha, *who shared their experiences with him., This encounter was followed by a meeting with the Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who bestowed upon him a special honorary citizenship. Accepting this honour, the Secretary-General said that it is impossible for people to come to Hiroshima and not to feel the absurdity of the existence of nuclear weapons, and that he accepted this honour on behalf of all those working for a nuclear weapons-free world and in the memory of those tens of thousands of people who were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki 77 years ago. [See Press Release SG/SM/21402], He then held a press encounter in Hiroshima and told reporters that the world is in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in this city 77 years ago. He added that it is unacceptable for states in possession of nuclear weapons to admit the possibility of nuclear war. He stressed that we must use every avenue of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation to ease tensions and eliminate the nuclear threat., The Secretary-General also met with the Hiroshima Governor, Hidehiko Yuzaki, and then took part in a dialogue with young activists who are leading initiatives on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He emphasized the importance of young people speaking up for nuclear disarmament and keeping the memory of the impacts of the bombings alive. This was followed by an interview with the national broadcaster NHK at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) offices. He then met and took pictures with the UNITAR staff members., That evening, the Secretary-General went back to his hotel where he met with Natsuo Yamaguchi, the Chairperson of Japan's Komeito Party., The Secretary-General then left Hiroshima for Tokyo, arriving that night. On Sunday, the Secretary-General had a private programme and did not hold any official meetings., On Monday, the Secretary-General met with Japan's Foreign Minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi. After their meeting, the Secretary-General held a press conference at Japan's National Press Club, where he stressed that at a time when geopolitical tensions are rising and the nuclear threat is back in focus, he had two asks for countries: First, he asked nuclear armed countries to commit to the ""no first use"" of nuclear weapons and second, to never use or threaten non-nuclear armed countries with the use of nuclear weapons, with full transparency in relation to their arsenals. He said he hoped these asks will be taken seriously because ""we are witnessing a radicalization in the geopolitical situation that makes the risk of a nuclear war again, something we cannot completely forget."" In addition, he urged Japan to take climate action by cutting emissions, stop funding coal plants abroad and partner with countries to help them transition to renewable energy., After the press conference he had a private audience with Japan's Emperor Naruhito. This was followed by a meeting with Yukio Takasu, his Adviser on Human Security., In the afternoon, he flew from Tokyo to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.Fighting remained focused in eastern Ukraine over the last week as civilians continued to endure deteriorating conditions resulting in death and injury. Millions of Ukrainians across the country suffer the direct and indirect impacts of the war. Amid the ongoing hostilities, the Ukrainian Parliament extended martial law on 15 August for another three months until 21 November. Meanwhile, thousands more people are evacuating Donetska oblast, and scores of damaged buildings require repair with winter approaching. Safety concerns are also growing over the military activity around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, while neighbouring town of Nikopol continues to come under fire., In the eastern Donetska oblast, intense fighting reportedly resulted in at least 120 civilian casualties just over the weekend and further damaged critical civilian infrastructure. In Government-controlled areas of the oblast, the authorities reported that the cities of Bakhmut, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were particularly impacted, while Donetsk city and Horlivka in non-Government-controlled areas also reportedly suffered shelling. The deadliest attacks were reported on 12 August, when 14 civilian casualties (1 person killed and 13 injured) were recorded in Bakhmut and 14 more (2 killed and 12 injured) in Kramatorsk. The National Police also reported that more than 190 civilian facilities were damaged over the same period, 12-14 August. In areas beyond Government control, there was a reported fire and ammonia release on 10 August at a brewery in Donetsk city, with one person reportedly killed and two injured. Local sources also reported the alleged shelling of a fertilizer plant in Horlivka on 12 August. Separately, Ukraine's Energy Ministry updated that, as of 11 August, some 623,000 users -- private households and businesses -- were without power supplies due to the hostilities, compared with 597,000 users the week before. It said that over half of all users lacking electricity live in Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast (381,000), followed by the eastern Luhanska (over 128,000), southern Mykolaivska (31,000) and eastern Kharkivska (30,000) oblasts. Further, some 234,000 users were reported to be lacking gas supply., Shelling and casualties were reported daily in Kharkivska oblast. Five civilians were reportedly injured in Kharkiv city on 15 August, with nine more civilian casualties reported in the oblast over the weekend. The Governor reported intense shelling in Kharkiv and several towns on 16-17 August. Shelling in the Saltivskyi district reportedly resulted in damage to residential buildings and transportation infrastructure; while garages and farm machinery were damaged and destroyed in the Chuhuyivskyi district. The Governor added that a 22-year-old man was reportedly hospitalized in Zolochiv after having been injured in an explosion. He said fighting was ongoing south-east of Kharkiv, around Lebyazhi. Separately, on 16 August, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published the report Ukraine: Unlawful Russian Attacks in Kharkiv, in which it describes ""repeated unlawful attacks that killed and wounded civilians and damaged health-care facilities and homes ... carried out in populated areas by indiscriminately using explosive weapons with wide area effects and widely banned cluster munitions in apparent violation of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war."" The HRW report also cites the oblast Deputy Prosecutor saying over 1,000 civilians, including 50 children, have been killed in Kharkivska oblast during the war, and almost 2,000 injured., Tensions continued to mount over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) -- located in the city of Enerhodar in areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine in the south-east Zaporizka oblast -- with the Ukrainian Government and humanitarian partners reporting more fighting in the vicinity and explosions near an administrative office on 11 August. The following day, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi addressed the UN Security Council, describing the situation as ""very alarming"" -- amid calls to allow the Agency's technical experts to visit the plant. While IAEA experts' preliminary assessment indicated that there is no immediate threat to nuclear safety as a result of the shelling or other military actions, Mr. Grossi warned that ""this could change at any moment.""Separately, Zaporizka oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh said that an accident at Zaporizhzhia NPP would make it necessary to evacuate some 400,000 people living in the area, including from neighbouring Dnipropetrovska oblast -- adding that it is very difficult to fully implement civil protection measures with part of Zaporizka oblast beyond Government control. Meanwhile, the situation remains perilous and unpredictable. Even on 12 August, the same day the IAEA Director General addressed the Security Council, a worker at the Zaporizhzhia plant was reportedly killed and two others injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-17-aug-2022-enukru

""An end to the war is still not in sight and the infrastructure in eastern territories of Ukraine is severely damaged. That is why we will be distributing important winter-specific relief supplies, such as blankets and solar batteries, to people in particular need in the coming weeks."" Around 900,000 people are currently living in emergency shelters and thousands in barely accessible villages or damaged houses. ""We expect even more people to arrive in western Ukraine during winter. In the east of the country, it sometimes happens that temperatures drop to minus 20 degrees at this time of year. Without electricity and heating, people would freeze to death,"" warns Titko. In addition, a collective shelter west of Lviv is being renovated to make it winter-proof and to create living space for up to 120 people., Germany: Interim balance of aid, Since the beginning of the war, the Order of Malta in Germany delivered more than 5,500 tons of relief goods to Ukraine and its neighboring countries. Medical supplies, medicines, massive tents, camp beds, blankets, food and field kitchens were sent to Ukraine in 183 transports. Malteser Ukraine in Ivano-Frankivsk and Lviv received 11 emergency ambulances and 2 mobile medical units. From there, they were partly transferred to the interior of the country., In Lviv (Ukraine), Katowice (Poland) and Fürstenfeldbruck (Germany), Malteser International has large logistics and material centers at its disposal. Private or communal initiatives as well as corporate donations, which have been previously agreed with the relief organization, are also directed there. In addition, around 1,000 Malteser volunteers from Germany were on duty every day during the first three months. To date, the aid organization is setting up short-term shelters, supporting refugees in arrival centers and shelters, providing corona tests and first-aid medical assistance, picking up donations in kind and more. In total, full-time and voluntary staff look after refugees in more than 60 regular accommodations run by the federal states and local authorities. Rescue transports by land and air help bring seriously ill or injured people to German clinics or care facilities via Poland., Appeal: ""Europeans must continue to help alleviate the suffering in Ukraine""., Humanitarian aid is a major concern for the President of Malteser International Europe, Douglas Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch. He appeals: ""All Europeans must continue to help alleviate the suffering in Ukraine."" The great support for the Ukrainian people threatens to lose momentum in the face of their own concerns about gas and electricity. ""But the war is getting worse, and more people are going to be injured both mentally and physically. Anyone who can give money or commitment to women, children and men, please do so, because many people in need still relay on humanitarian aid. Even if the war ended tomorrow, people will be dependent on our help for months and perhaps years to come."", Saurma-Jeltsch thanks the volunteers and full-time workers for their work: ""The large and unique worldwide network, the cohesion and tireless commitment to people in need is the basis on which Malteser International has been able to build its assistance and can continue to do so. The cooperation with the Order of Malta, its national associations and all activities to support in the crisis were activated immediately. We will continue to stand by the side of the people in need in Ukraine."", Attention editors:, Pavlo Titko, Head of Malteser Ukraine (German-speaking) and
Douglas Graf von Saurma-Jeltsch, President of Malteser International Europe and Board Member of Malteser Germany, are available for interviews and sound bites.

UNECE continues to mobilise international architects to help Ukrainian cities build back better,News and Press Release,UNECE,Recovery and Reconstruction,19 Aug 2022,"UNECE has mobilised international architects to help the city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine’s ninth largest city, develop a forward-looking, people-centred master plan for building back better. This work will be led by One Work, a global design and architecture company, in collaboration with Ukrainian architects, following discussions between the City Council and international architects that were facilitated by UNECE., The Chairman of the City Council, Mr. Dmytro Falko, expressed his appreciation of this partnership, noting that it will help the city ensure full and complete adherence with international standards and best practices throughout the planning and reconstruction effort. One Work Project Manager, Ms. Ana Paez, said that the company will be supporting the city pro bono and work closely with Ukrainian architects and experts to realize the aspirations of the city leaders and citizens., Ukraine’s Vice-Minister of Communities and Territories Development, Mr. Ihor Korhovyi, underlined the importance of pilot testing such partnerships to serve as a blueprint for nationally-owned collaborative approaches for other cities’ reconstruction efforts to follow. He invited the international community to intensify its support to Ukrainian cities, noting that such support must focus on addressing both the emergency humanitarian needs resulting from the war and the cities’ long term strategic goals. He drew attention that emergency relief should involve building the administrative and management capacity of cities, so as to enable them to address the humanitarian needs of inhabitants across all communities and age groups and ensure successful reconstruction after the war., UNECE will be supporting the city of Mykolaiv in line with the Framework for Programmes for the Integrated Rehabilitation of Settlements and Territories of Ukraine, which was developed by the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine to guide local governments in their reconstruction efforts. UNECE has helped the Ministry further develop the Framework and is currently pilot testing it in the City of Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, within the context of the #UN4Kharkiv Initiative. The initiative brings together 12 UN agencies and is coordinated by UNECE. At present, activities are focused on the development of a master plan for Kharkiv, which is being led by the Norman Foster Foundation on a pro-bono basis working closely with Ukrainian architects., UNECE will draw on the experience gained from the #UN4Kharkiv Initiative to help the city of Mykolaiv build back better.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unece-continues-mobilise-international-architects-help-ukrainian-cities-build-back-better

Protection and Human Rights",18 Aug 2022,"Good afternoon., President Zelenskyy, allow me to begin by thanking you and the people of Ukraine for welcoming me once again during such a difficult period., I am also very pleased to be joined by President Erdoğan., Just a few weeks ago, the two of us were together in Istanbul for the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative – a landmark agreement to help vulnerable people in every corner of the world., Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I have been clear: There is no solution to the global food crisis without ensuring full global access to Ukraine’s food products and Russian food and fertilizers., I want to express my gratitude to all parties for their support., In less than one month, 21 ships have departed from Ukrainian ports and 15 vessels have left Istanbul for Ukraine to load up with grain and other food supplies., As we speak, more than 560,000 metric tons of grain and other food produced by Ukrainian farmers is making its way to markets around the world., I am especially pleased that the first UN-chartered vessel carrying Ukrainian wheat is on its way to respond to the needs of people suffering from the worst drought in the Horn of Africa in decades., And as we speak, more than 560,000 metric tonnes of grain and other food produced by Ukrainian farmers is making its way into markets around the world to people in them., Meanwhile – and critically – we have seen signs that global food markets are beginning to stabilize., Wheat prices dropped by as much as 8% following the signing of the agreements., The FAO Food Price Index fell by 9% in July - the biggest decline since 2008., Most food commodities are now trading at prices below pre-war levels, but still very high., But let’s have no illusions – there is a long way to go before this will be translated into the daily life of people at their local bakery and in their markets., Supply chains are still disrupted., Energy and transportation costs remain unacceptably high., Ladies and Gentlemen,, The positive momentum on the food front reflects a victory for diplomacy – for multilateralism – for people caught in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis – and for the hard-working farmers of Ukraine., But it is only the beginning. I urge all parties to ensure continued success., This is an unprecedented agreement and, in my experience, by their very nature, initiatives in conflict situations are inherently fragile., They must be constantly nurtured., From day one, the parties of the JCC [Joint Coordination Center] have worked professionally and in good faith to keep the food flowing., I appeal for this to continue and for them to overcome all obstacles in a spirit of compromise and permanently settle all difficulties., Getting food and fertilizer out of Ukraine and Russia in larger quantities is crucial to further calm commodity markets and lower prices., It is essential to provide relief to the most vulnerable people and countries., And it is vital to help reverse the turmoil in the global fertilizer market that is now threatening next season’s crops – including rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world., In the meantime, the United Nations will go on working in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people to mobilize all of our capacities and resources – along side our national partners – to continue to provide humanitarian support to people in need wherever it is required., We will do our best to scale up our operations to face the difficult the coming winter., Ladies and Gentlemen,, But, of course, the heart of the problem that brings us here remains the war., As I have stated time and time again, this invasion is a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and of the United Nations Charter., The war brought innumerous death, massive destruction and displacement, and dramatic violations of human rights., People need peace., Peace in line with the United Nations Charter., Peace in line with international law., I remain gravely concerned about the unfolding situation in and around Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia., Common sense must prevail to avoid any actions that might endanger the physical integrity, safety or security of the nuclear plant., The facility must not be used as part of any military operation., Instead, agreement is urgently needed to reestablish Zaporizhhia as purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area., In close contact with the IAEA, the UN Secretariat has assessed that we have in Ukraine the logistics and security capacity to support any IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant from Kyiv, provided both Russia and Ukraine agree., Military equipment and personnel should be withdrawn from the plant., Further deployment of forces or equipment to the site must be avoided., The area needs to be demilitarized., We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide., Today, I also discussed the investigation of the tragic incident in a detention facility in Olenivka on 29 July., What happened there is unacceptable. All prisoners of war are protected under International Humanitarian Law., The International Committee of the Red Cross must have access to them wherever they are kept., I decided to establish a Fact-Finding mission., The Terms of Reference of the mission were shared with Ukraine and the Russian Federation, as well as the make-up of the team. It is my intention to appoint General Carlos dos Santos Cruz of Brazil to lead this mission., General Santos Cruz is a respected officer with over 40 years of national and international public security and military experience, including as a commander of UN peacekeeping operations., We will now continue to work to obtain the necessary assurances to guarantee secure access to Olenivka and any other relevant locations., To put it simply, a fact-finding mission must be free to find the facts., The team must be able to gather and analyze necessary information., Above all, that means safe, secure and unfettered access to people, places and evidence without any interference from anybody., We will continue to do all we can to advance this and other efforts correspond to needs of the Ukrainian people., Once again, my thanks to President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people for your welcome., You can continue to count on the support of the United Nations to promote human rights, international law and the cause of peace., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-generals-remarks-press-lviv-ukraine-press-conference-delivered
Ukraine Crisis: 6-12 August 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,18 Aug 2022,"Almost half of all violent events last week were recorded in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces continued attempts to advance in the directions of Pisky, Marinka, and Bakhmut (ISW, 10 August 2022; KyivPost, 12 August 2022; Ukrainska Pravda, 12 August 2022). Ukrainian forces continued to strike Russian bases and ammunition depots, as well as bridges along Russian resupply routes, particularly in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions (ISW, 8 August 2022). Additionally, Ukrainian partisan activity against alleged Russian collaborators and Russia-appointed government representatives was recorded in occupied areas of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson regions., Meanwhile, on 9 August, two explosions occurred at the Saky aircraft base in Novofedorivka on the occupied Crimean peninsula. While the Ukrainian military did not openly take credit for the explosions, some sources suggest the involvement of Ukrainian special forces or local partisan groups (ISW, 10 August 2022). Russia claims that the explosions were caused by negligence associated with the storage of munitions at the base and that no aircrafts were damaged in the process (Interfax, 9 August 2022). Despite these claims, satellite images show the destruction of at least 11 Russian jets, with Russia also later reporting that one civilian was killed and 14 were wounded (The Guardian, 11 August 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-6-12-august-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",18 Aug 2022,"OVERVIEW, Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, conflict has affected an estimated 5.7 million school-aged children in Ukraine (ages 3–18) (MESU 02/07/2022). Five million school-aged children are estimated to be in need of educational support (OCHA 12/08/2022). Part of the impact on the Ukrainian education system has been a two-week total closure of educational activities in February, followed by education resuming online in most of the country. Displacement, the damage and destruction of educational facilities, and a lack of access to technology and internet connection have seriously affected students’ ability to learn and caused significant challenges to the reopening of schools (WB 28/05/2022)., The next academic year is set to start on 1 September and will last until 30 June 2023 (GOU 28/06/2022). The current conflict makes the full reopening of in-person schools unlikely, meaning the continued heavy reliance on online learning (OCHA 12/08/2022)., Specific factors that make the resumption of in-person learning in schools challenging for the September 2022 semester are a lack of human resources, financial constraints, damage to school infrastructure, and the use of educational facilities for other purposes. There is also a need to ensure the safety of school facilities against the risks associated with hostilities, such as through demining and the provision of adequate bomb shelters., As at early August, only 30% of schools met the security requirements and were ready to start in-person lessons. Children in areas affected by active ground conflict, 1.2 million children living in rural areas, and those in areas controlled by the Russian military are likely to face additional barriers in accessing education in September (Teach for Ukraine accessed 08/08/2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-impact-conflict-education-17-august-2022
Answering the call: SURGE Advisors bring long-term perspective to emergency response,News and Press Release,UNDP,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",18 Aug 2022,"Each year on 19 August, we pay tribute to the real-life heroes who commit their lives to helping others in times of crisis. This year’s theme highlights the global solidarity at the heart of humanitarian relief efforts., With the world facing overlapping crises – from the pandemic to armed conflict, climate change and growing inequality – there has never been more people in need of emergency assistance. Just as raising a child is a community effort, an entire humanitarian network is needed to deliver lifesaving help to people in crisis and put communities on a path to recovery and resilience., One of UNDP’s contributions to this community is our SURGE Academy, which sends trained advisors to emergency situations around the globe. It’s a critical component of UNDP’s ability to deploy the right people at the right time during or after a crisis., Haïti: Building on lessons learned, On 14 August 2021, a magnitude 7.2 struck southwest Haiti, destroying areas of Les Cayes, the country's third largest city. More than 2,200 people lost their lives, and an estimated 600,000 people were in need of assistance., Building on lessons learned from the 2010 earthquake and 2016 hurricane responses, the United Nations family and partners teamed up to accelerate relief and recovery efforts. As a member of UNDP’s pool of SURGE Advisors, Nermine Mohamed Wally arrived to support the UNDP Haiti team in coordinating its response., “When I spoke with people who lost their homes, I was struck by their will to stand up and regain their lives — many were already working to repair or rebuild.”, Afghanistan: Stay and deliver, Following the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan, UNDP committed to stay and deliver critically needed services to the people of Afghanistan as part of the overall UN system's response. Dozens of SURGE Advisors were mobilized, serving as reinforcements on the ground., That’s how Usman Qazi found himself in Kabul initiating the Area Based Development Emergency Initiative (ABADEI), which aims to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and complete breakdown of the country’s economy., Tilini Subodha Kuruppu Arachchige also joined the mission, traveling from Kabul to Kandahar to meet the new authorities and connect with other stakeholders, including women leaders, and set up new programmes., Bahamas: Preparing for the new norm, In September 2019, Category 5 Hurricane Dorian, the strongest ever to make landfall in The Bahamas, and one of the most powerful in human history, battered the archipelago for 48 hours, leaving ‘apocalyptic’ scenes in its wake., Leading a SURGE team days after the storm, UNDP Resident Representative Denise E. Antonio reiterated the Government’s call for resilient recovery based on “building back better”., UNDP partnered with local organizations and the Government to get critical “build better” knowledge into the hands of the people. It implemented a cash-for-work programme to clean up debris and provided small grants to help small and medium-sized businesses get back on their feet., Equatorial Guinea: Impactful assessment, Craig Castro’s 20 years of international development experience were put to the test when he deployed as a SURGE Advisor to Equatorial Guinea in March 2021 after a series of explosions in the country's main city, Bata. In collaboration with the local government and sister UN agencies, he set up an impact assessment that proved critical in immediate work programmes and informing longer-term recovery plans., “A month into my mission… I got another call from New York. I was being sent to Mozambique.”, In Mozambique, his mission was to support the growing number of people displaced by militancy and to promote stability. The team identified the remote Macomia District as a priority area. But getting there was complicated by deteriorating security conditions. Moldova: A personal mission, When the call came for SURGE Advisors to support Ukraine and neighbouring countries following the outbreak of the war, Ioana Creitaru knew she had to go. Once in Moldova, she met women refugees and heard stories with echoes of her own great-grandmother's, who decades earlier had fled as a refugee from Moldova to Romania., In Ukraine and elsewhere, UNDP’s humanitarian response relies on partnerships with local organizations and citizens, who know their communities best. Mykola Nadulichnyi is founder of an NGO promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities in Ukrainian society. The war forced him to flee his home in eastern Ukraine, making the trek to the western city of Lviv, close to the Polish border., Working in tandem, In times of crisis, volunteers are among the first to take critical action on the ground. Under the UNV-UNDP Tandem Teams, UN Volunteers work together with international experts, local staff and SURGE Advisors responding to the pandemic, environmental disasters and human-induced crises., Tandem Teams bring together local knowledge and insights of national and international volunteers. In 2021, 38 UN Volunteers were deployed across the globe in UNV-UNDP tandem initiatives., One of them, Bryan Wakesa, joined UNDP Africa to support the COVID-19 recovery framework of the African Union. In his role as research assistant and information manager, Bryan gained insight into the need to address the impact of crises on vulnerable populations. But this knowledge was not all he took away from the experience., Reducing future need, When a crisis hits, saving lives and attending to immediate needs are top priority. But preserving development gains and helping people get solidly on the path of recovery is also indispensable. Critical members of the global humanitarian village, UNDP SURGE Advisors strengthen crisis response by integrating a long-term perspective, ultimately reducing the chances of future humanitarian catastrophes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/answering-call-surge-advisors-bring-long-term-perspective-emergency-response

A las amenazas naturales -como los terremotos, los huracanes, o las sequías- se suman la violencia, o los conflictos como causas que provocan el sufrimiento de millones de personas en todo el mundo, en especial, en las zonas donde existe más vulnerabilidad. El personal de asistencia humanitaria trabaja para revertir los efectos de estas situaciones y contribuir a la recuperación a largo plazo de todas las zonas afectadas por los conflictos o desastres naturales., Es el caso de Ucrania, y la situación que viven desde hace seis meses con la escalada del conflicto, que ha afectado principalmente a las provincias de Donetska, Kharkivska y Luhanska, pero también al sur (Odesa) y Járkov, la segunda ciudad de Ucrania más próxima al Dombás,; la situación ha provocado que casi un tercio de la población se haya visto obligada a huir de sus hogares, mientras millones de personas permanecen en zonas de intensos combates con necesidad urgente de asistencia humanitaria y protección. Aunque el número de personas que se trasladan a países vecinos actualmente es mucho menor que al comienzo del conflicto y 2,5 millones de personas habrían regresado al país, se estima que el número de desplazados internos en Ucrania es ya de 7,13 millones de personas, más de la mitad de los cuales residían originalmente en las regiones orientales del país. Esta situación está provocando unas necesidades cambiantes en las distintas regiones del país, en función de la evolución del conflicto y los flujos de desplazados que éste genera., El Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja y el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja trabaja sin descanso desde hace más de 8 años en las regiones afectadas, que han intensificado su respuesta en todo el mundo debido a los movimientos migratorios provocados por el conflicto, y es que más de 18 millones de personas se han visto afectadas, y cerca de 10 millones han cruzado las fronteras, siendo Polonia el país que ha recibido a casi la mitad de ellas en primera instancia. En Ucrania, la Cruz Roja ha atendido a 5,4 millones de personas, respuesta que se extiende por todo el continente europeo donde la Cruz Roja está atendiendo en 15 países a las personas que se han visto obligadas a huir del país. En España, han sido más de 112.000 las personas atendidas por Cruz Roja en el sistema de acogida. Cruz Roja Española ha desplegado en los seis meses que dura la escalada del conflicto a 32 delegados y delegadas internacionales en distintas rotaciones para colaborar con la Federación Internacional de la Cruz Roja en la gestión del voluntariado, logística, coordinación sobre el terreno, distribuciones, asuntos de protección de género e inclusión, salud, agua y saneamiento, despliegue y atención de albergues, medios de vida y soporte en remoto del software desarrollado en España para la gestión de voluntariado en las Sociedades Nacionales., En el Día Mundial de la Asistencia Humanitaria, que se celebra el 19 de agosto, Cruz Roja recuerda a personas afectadas por crisis humanitarias y rinde homenaje a las personas que prestan servicio humanitario, y en especial, a todas aquellas personas que han perdido la vida durante esta labor., A lo largo de estos años, Cruz Roja Española ha apoyado proyectos de emergencias en situaciones como el terremoto de Haití de 2010 y el del pasado agosto de 2021, la explosión del puerto de Beirut de agosto de 2020, los huracanes de Centroamérica en octubre de 2020, las recurrentes escaladas de violencia en Gaza y Cisjordania o los tifones en Filipinas., La respuesta internacional de Cruz Roja Española, En lo que va de año, Cruz Roja Española lleva realizadas 105 misiones, 50 en África, 11 en América y 44 en Europa, Asia y Oriente Medio. A día de hoy, en ejecución se encuentran 171 proyectos: 78 África, 48 América, 30 en Europa, Asia y Oriente Medio y 15 globales, en los que participan 4.681.684 personas.
En 2021 la cifra llegó a las 7.364.956 personas beneficiarias en los 159 proyectos totales en los que participaron hasta 96 delegados y delegadas españoles.
La mayor parte de los proyectos están encaminados a atender a personas afectadas por desastres, personas sin medios de vida, o personas migrantes y refugiadas; sin embargo, también se contemplan medidas para mujeres en dificultad, personas afectadas por violencias o conflicto, con problemas de salud, entre otras.
Entre otras operaciones humanitarias, además de Ucrania, en 2022 Cruz Roja se ha centrado especialmente en los movimientos de población en América, tanto en América del Sur procedentes de Venezuela, como en el triángulo norte de Centroamérica – El Salvador, Guatemala y Honduras y la tensión social e inseguridad en Haití. En los próximos meses Cruz Roja va a prestar especial atención a la crisis alimentaria en África, la más grave en décadas con 323 millones de personas en situación de inseguridad alimentaria severa. Cruz Roja Española ya está desarrollando 16 proyectos de asistencia humanitaria en Burkina Faso, Malí, Níger, República Democrática del Congo y Senegal que benefician a 1.203.065 personas con acciones como distribución de alimentos y de entregas en efectivo para cobertura de necesidades básicas, prevención y tratamiento de la malnutrición o el apoyo a la reactivación y diversificación agrícola y ganadera. Se prevé que esta situación empeore a lo largo de 2023, como consecuencia del impacto del conflicto en Ucrania en el comercio y en el precio de alimentos básicos, la pobreza endémica, la crisis del clima y la violencia en varios países de la región. Por ello, Cruz Roja espera aumentar la respuesta humanitaria contribuyendo a los esfuerzos de la Federación Internacional para atender las necesidades humanitarias en 17 países de la región. Por otro lado, el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja ha estado presente en Afganistán desde 1987 trabajando para proteger y ayudar a los necesitados en áreas controladas por los talibanes durante años, por lo que se tienen canales abiertos con líderes locales y de alto nivel, y se continúa trabajando mano a mano con la Sociedad de la Media Luna Roja Afgana para ayudar a aquellos cuyas vidas han sido marcadas por la guerra., Actuar para salvar vidas: el compromiso del Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja Desde Alepo, Mosul, Saná, hasta Marahui, Donetsk o Irpín… Ciudades y pueblos se encuentran hoy entre los principales campos de batalla de conflictos armados.
Por eso, el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja trabaja sin descanso para prevenir y responder a las consecuencias humanitarias; a medida que hay más gente que nunca en los pueblos y ciudades de todo el mundo, el horror y el sufrimiento de la guerra urbana aumenta. Los barrios se convierten en el frente de batalla, lo que obliga a los civiles a correr para salvar sus vidas o refugiarse en cualquier lugar, en medio de una destrucción generalizada; a menudo, sin encontrar un sitio seguro donde esconderse.
Esta realidad es inaceptable.
Al trabajar juntas, las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja se esfuerzan por fortalecer su capacidad colectiva para proteger y ayudar a las personas, e influir en aquellos momentos y lugares que pueden marcar la diferencia en el campo de batalla.
Las actuaciones de la acción humanitaria que salvan vidas son el corazón de su mandato, con responsabilidad hacia los millones de personas y familias cuyas vidas han sido, o serán, destrozadas por la guerra. Para ello, moviliza su formidable fuerza y ​​garantiza que la devastación se minimice o incluso se prevenga en el futuro., Sobre Cruz Roja, Cruz Roja representa el mayor movimiento humanitario, ciudadano e independiente del mundo.

Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Holds Meeting with States Parties on the Situation of Persons with Disabilities in Ukraine and in Countries where they Fled Following the Russian Aggression 17 August 2022,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,17 Aug 2022,"The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities this afternoon held a meeting with States parties on the situation of persons with disabilities in Ukraine and in countries where they fled following the Russian aggression., Jonas Ruskus, Committee Vice Chair, said the Committee this afternoon would interact with States parties of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities about the situation of persons with disabilities in Ukraine and in countries where they had fled after 24 February 2022., Since that day, the Committee had received worrying information indicating situations affecting the human rights of persons with disabilities in Ukraine in relation to the Russian aggression against that country. The Committee, alarmed by the seriousness of these allegations, decided to make a call for written submissions to concerned States parties and invited them to participate in this public meeting., Ukraine said that almost six months had passed since the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. The plight of persons with disabilities was particularly tragic and required special attention. The Government was providing shelter, emergency intervention, and in-patient care for persons with disabilities. The Government had established a programme supporting the evacuation of persons with disabilities living in institutions, but only 10 per cent of such persons had been successfully evacuated abroad., In closing remarks, Ukraine thanked civil society organizations for the work that they performed daily to help those in need, and neighbouring Governments for their support. Ukraine would continue to make reforms to support persons with disabilities despite the conflict situation., The Committee heard statements from European Union, Lithuania, European Commission, Latvia, Republic of Moldova, and Türkiye., Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found here. The programme of work of the Committee’s twenty-seventh session and other documents related to the session can be found here., The Committee will next meet in public at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 18 August, to continue its review of the combined second and third periodic report of China (CRPD/C/CHN/2-3)., Statements, JONAS RUSKUS, Committee Vice Chair, said the Committee this afternoon would interact with States parties of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities about the situation of persons with disabilities in Ukraine and in countries where they had fled after 24 February 2022.
Beginning that day, the Committee had received worrying information indicating situations affecting the human rights of persons with disabilities in Ukraine in relation to the Russian aggression against that country. The Committee, alarmed by the seriousness of these allegations, decided to make a call for written submissions to concerned States parties and invited them to participate in the public meeting., States parties were obliged to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters. Mr. Ruskus thanked all those parties to the Convention that had made written contributions or were present to give statements about ongoing developments in Ukraine and neighbouring countries where people had fled. These parties were Bulgaria, Italy, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Türkiye, Republic of Moldova and Belarus., Ukraine said that almost six months had passed since the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Tens of thousands of persons had lost their lives. Dozens of cities had been razed to the ground. The list of Russia’s crimes was endless. The plight of persons with disabilities was particularly tragic and required special attention. Ukraine expressed gratitude to international partners for their support for Ukrainian persons with disabilities. Several institutions provided social services to persons with disabilities in Ukraine. The infrastructure of these institutions had been damaged by Russian attacks, and the number of social workers operating in the State was decreasing. The Government was providing shelter, emergency intervention, and in-patient care for persons with disabilities, and had shortened the decision-making process related to these services to two days. Non-governmental organizations and international organizations were also providing assistance. Payments of pensions and cash assistance was also provided by the Government in a timely fashion., Persons with disabilities faced difficulties regarding evacuation, and many had been taken forcibly to the Russian Federation. The Government had established a programme supporting the evacuation of persons with disabilities living in institutions, but only 10 per cent of such persons had successfully evacuated abroad. Over 50 institutions were in occupied territories, which the Government could not reach to support. About 3,300 residents had so far been evacuated. As of June 2022, more than 3,000 persons with disabilities had been classified as internally displaced persons., Ukraine had compiled its combined second and third periodic report under the Convention. It hoped that the meeting would highlight that the Russian Federation had abandoned its responsibilities under the Convention and international human rights law. The only way to protect the rights of persons with disabilities in Ukraine was for Russia to cease military activity in the State., European Union said that the European Union remained extremely concerned regarding the intense fighting in the east of Ukraine. Millions of civilians were stranded, in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. Persons with disabilities encountered additional barriers and making humanitarian aid available to these persons was a priority for the European Union. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was the only human rights treaty ratified by the European Union. All actions financed by the **European **Union considered the needs of persons with disabilities. Actions focused on mental health and psychosocial support, among other support., The European Union was committed to leaving no one behind. Around 348 million euros of humanitarian assistance from the European Union had so far reached 11.7 million people. Over 1,000 critically ill and wounded Ukrainians had been provided with assistance. Humanitarian needs were increasingly becoming difficult to address. Hygiene kits were being provided for elderly persons and persons with disabilities, and rehabilitation and care services were also provided. Temporary accommodation was provided to internally displaced persons. The medical evacuations of persons with disabilities had been organised by partner organizations. Assistance devices such as walking sticks were provided to elderly persons. The European Union was also working with the United Nations Refugee Agency to establish “blue dot” spaces, which provided shelter for refugees. The European Union would continue to work to provide humanitarian assistance to all those in need in the State., Lithuania said that persons with disabilities were at risk in Ukraine, particularly children. Persons living in institutions often did not have access to family support. Lithuania provided temporary residence permits for Ukrainian refugees. Ukrainians with disabilities were eligible to access all social and health services provided by the Lithuanian State. They were also supported in accessing the labour market and were provided with disability benefits. Twenty-six persons had thus far been provided with special needs services. Nine Ukrainian citizens of retirement age had also been provided with assistance. Persons with disabilities were also able to access housing support, and mobility assistance was provided to persons who needed it. Personal assistants were available to all persons with disabilities. Sign language interpretation services were provided, as were target compensations such as disability pensions. By 1 August, social care services had been provided to 65 children from Ukraine, and a social care centre had accommodated 35 children from Ukraine., European Commission said that the European Commission had established a new mechanism for receiving and integrating Ukrainian refugees in other countries. Asylum was a fundamental right, and European Union countries had a responsibility to receive asylum seekers and process them according to defined standards. An action plan on the inclusion and integration of migrants had been established in 2021. A taskforce had been developed to support Ukrainian women seeking asylum in European countries. The European Commission had also developed a temporary protection directive that protected Ukrainian citizens who had arrived in the European Union. The directive provided regulations for the provision of access to labour markets and health services., The European Union had committed to facilitating the migration and integration of persons with disabilities. The European Asylum and Integration Fund provided funds for the protection of persons with special needs, including refugees with disabilities. Guidelines for supporting persons with disabilities at borders had also been developed. The European Commission had identified specific challenges, such as in providing support for children from institutions, especially children with disabilities, and had developed strategies for providing that support. The European Commission would continue to do its upmost to protect all Ukrainian citizens who had fled to Europe., Latvia expressed deep regret that the situation in Ukraine continued to deteriorate. Persons with disabilities were at higher risk, as they faced difficulty in reaching shelter. Latvia had pledged to support all persons fleeing Ukraine, particularly persons with disabilities. Ukrainian refugees received housing, food and health support in Latvia, and could access the same services as Latvian nationals. Ukrainian persons with disabilities were eligible to apply for special care allowances and social security in Latvia. Disability had been determined for over 100 Ukrainian refugees so far, and more than 100 additional refugees had applied for disability support. Latvia condemned in the strongest possible terms the Russian invasion of Ukraine and supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity., Türkiye said that since the beginning of the war in February, over 300,000 Ukrainians had entered Türkiye. Türkiye hosted the highest number of refugees in the world, currently over 4 million people, providing all fundamental rights and services for the refugees it was hosting. A 90-day visa exemption was applied to Ukrainians and foreigners in Ukraine who came to Türkiye due to the war. Temporary accommodation centres had been established for Ukrainians in need. In these accommodation centres, access to many rights and services such as education, health, interpretation and consultancy was provided. For Ukrainians outside the temporary accommodation centres, access to basic rights and services was also provided., The majority of Ukrainian citizens who came to Türkiye were women and children. They benefited from health, education and social assistance services. Nearly 1,200 foster children and orphans had been brought to Türkiye since the beginning of the war and 118 of these children had disabilities. Almost 500 caregivers or accompanying persons had also joined them. The Ministry of Family and Social Services provided all necessary services to these people, including healthcare and psychosocial support. Turkish social services staff, including psychologists, conducted daily rehabilitation services and participated in social inclusion programmes. All the children continued their regular education in Ukraine distantly. Turkish classes, art classes and physical education were also provided for these children by the State.
If the war continued, Türkiye envisaged welcoming a further 3,000 children from Ukraine. It would continue to help all those affected by the war and work towards achieving peace without delay., Republic of Moldova said that a regulation establishing an intersectoral cooperation mechanism for the identification, assistance, and monitoring of children at risk coming from the territory of Ukraine had been approved in April 2022. There were 100 centres for children and persons with disabilities in the Republic of Moldova. Around 518 persons with disabilities had access to social security in the Republic of Moldova and 23 children were currently in Moldovan centres for rehabilitation. The Minister of Labour and Social Protection had authorised more than 100 placement centres throughout the country. These centres were created and managed by local public authorities. Many refugees also lived with local families. The Ministry ensured the availability of accommodation places in temporary placement centres for persons with disabilities. It also supported the transport of refugees who wished to travel to other countries., Free telephone assistance was provided to refugees 24 hours a day. From February to July, 115 refugees had called the phone line to ask about members of their family and had received support. Specific support provisions such as massage mats, glasses, medicine and transport services were provided for persons with disabilities, and sign language interpretation was also provided., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert thanked all participants for informing the Committee about the services provided for Ukrainian persons.

It also thanked neighbouring Governments for their support. Ukraine would continue to make reforms to support persons with disabilities in spite of the conflict situation. Sirens were the daily reality for persons in Ukraine. Ukraine would ensure that it implemented its international obligations for those most in need., Lithuania said that the Government supported all persons from Ukraine, especially persons with disabilities.

All important information was provided in Ukrainian language., European Union said that humanitarian partners provided psychosocial assistance all over Ukraine, especially in the east of the country. United Nations agencies were providing support for victims of gender-based violence. The European Union had experts in the country conducting regular monitoring missions.

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (6-12 August 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,12 Aug 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, with violence reportedly spilling across the borders with Russia and Belarus. Rallies condemning Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip and nuclear weapons on the occasion of A-Bomb Day on 6 August were recorded across the region. Fighting de-escalated along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. In France, environmental groups carried out acts of vandalism to denounce profit-driven water management, while climate protests continued to be staged elsewhere. Meanwhile, farmer demonstrations declined in the Netherlands amid ongoing negotiations between the government and farmers over nitrogen emission cuts., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Almost half of all violence last week was recorded in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces continued attempts to advance in the directions of Pisky, Marinka, and Bakhmut (ISW, 10 August 2022; KyivPost, 12 August 2022; Ukrainska Pravda, 12 August 2022). Ukrainian forces continued to strike Russian bases and ammunition depots, as well as bridges along Russian resupply routes, particularly in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions (ISW, 8 August 2022). Additionally, Ukrainian partisan activity against alleged Russian collaborators and Russia-appointed government representatives was recorded in the occupied parts of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson regions last week., Amid the fighting, Russian forces continued active shelling of frontline regions, killing dozens of civilians last week. At least 15 civilians were killed in Russian attacks on settlements in the Nikopol district of the Dnipropetrovsk region on 10 August (Nikopolnews, 10 August 2022; Nikopol Regional Military Administration, 11 August 2022).1, Meanwhile, two explosions occurred at the Saky aircraft base in Novofedorivka on the occupied Crimean peninsula on 9 August. The Ukrainian military did not openly take credit for the explosions; however, some Ukrainian sources have suggested the involvement of Ukrainian special forces or local partisan groups (ISW, 10 August 2022). The Russian Ministry of Defence claims that the explosions were the result of negligence associated with the storage of munitions at the base and that no aircraft were damaged in the process (Interfax, 9 August 2022). Despite Russian claims, the satellite images following the explosions show the destruction of at least 11 Russian jets, with Russia also later reporting that one civilian was killed and 14 were wounded in the explosions (The Guardian, 11 August 2022)., Similarly, explosions took place at a military airfield near Ziabrauka of the Gomel region in Belarus last week. Belarusian defense officials attribute the explosions to a fire accident, while Ukrainian forces also deny involvement (ISW, 12 August 2022). The source of the explosions remains unclear, with local media reporting that several heavy explosions destroyed military equipment at the airfield late at night (Zerkalo.io, 11 August 2022). The airfield reportedly hosts Russian missile systems that have been used during strikes on Ukrainian territory (RFE/RL, 11 August 2022)., In Russia, the governor of the Kursk region reported several incidents of cross-border artillery fire by Ukrainian and Russian forces last week. These trends contribute to the 186% increase in violent events in the Kursk region last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker. The Subnational Tracker also warned of increased violence in the Kursk region during the preceding four weeks. Moreover, four new sabotage incidents aimed at disrupting Russia's railway and power lines system took place in the Kursk and Novosibirsk regions (Activatica, 10 August 2022). While violence in Kursk has not been common, it has become increasingly volatile, resulting in a shift from a place of 'low risk' to being considered an area of 'growing risk' by ACLED's Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., Rallies in support of Ukraine and against the war were held in Germany, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom last week. In Germany, such gatherings were organized to coincide with A-Bomb Day (6 August), commemorating the 77th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In over a dozen demonstration events recorded across the country, protesters also denounced the prospect of a nuclear Third World War. A-Bomb Day protests were also recorded in Denmark, France, and Greece., Meanwhile, following the flare-up of violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in and around the Gaza Strip, demonstrations condemning Israeli attacks were recorded in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued last week, but at lower levels than the week prior. This violence contributed to the 85% increase in weekly violent events in Azerbaijan and Artsakh in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the region during the preceding four weeks. The recent escalation in fighting prompted protests in Armenia against the current Armenian government. Demonstrators also gathered outside the French and American embassies in Yerevan, demanding their involvement in the Artsakh conflict., Meanwhile, climate actions to denounce anthropogenic global warming were recorded across the region last week amid an ongoing heatwave and historically significant period of drought (The Guardian, 13 August 2022). In France, environmental activists in Toulouse damaged the lawn of a golf course and plugged its holes with cement to condemn its exemption from water rationing. Likewise, activists cut tarps covering two alternative water supply reservoirs used to irrigate crops in summer using winter groundwater in Pouillé and Nalliers in Vendée. The environmental group that claims the action online said it wanted to denounce the ""industrial system"" operating the reservoirs for a profit (France3 Regions, 10 August 2022). Additionally, protests urging more climate action were recorded in Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Sweden., In the Netherlands, farmers' protests against the government's plan to cut nitrogen emissions in the agricultural sector significantly decreased last week amid ongoing negotiations between the cabinet of the Netherlands and farming organizations. Elsewhere, protests related to farmers' working conditions and denouncing water shortages were reported in Armenia, France, Italy, and Serbia last week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-6-12-august-2022

Limitations included:, • varying levels of geographic access, due to identified organizational program locations, the sheer size of the country and the security context given the ongoing war;, • limited time, as efforts were made to collect preliminary data within a two-week period, to inform program start-up; and, • the need to take into consideration the number and diversity of community members engaged, many of whom were prioritizing basic needs, and the timing and appropriateness of arranging focus-group discussions., Furthermore, given that Ukraine is still an active war zone, with well-documented deliberate targeting of health and mental health facilities, some information cannot be shared publicly at this time. Therefore, we are sharing as much as is possible while prioritizing the safety and security of such facilities. Finally, as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with increasing evidence of more widescale destruction, atrocities and war crimes, it is important to note that the findings presented are accurate to our knowledge at the time of this assessment.
The situation and related needs will likely evolve, so future assessments will be crucial.

"The United States supporting the UN World Food Program to purchase up to 150,000 metric tons of Ukrainian wheat",News and Press Release,USAID,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",16 Aug 2022,"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing over $68 million in additional funding to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to purchase, move, and store up to 150,000 metric tons of Ukrainian wheat to help respond to the world’s worst food crises., The world is facing its most severe food crisis in decades. In order to save lives, humanitarians need access to all available grain stores to deliver to the populations that need it most. Before Russia’s invasion, Ukraine was one of WFP’s top suppliers of grain and the fourth largest commercial exporter of wheat. Opening the Ukrainian market is a vital step forward in our emergency response., USAID, in partnership with the Howard G. Buffett Foundation and Minderoo Foundation, supported the first humanitarian grain shipment to leave the Black Sea via Ukraine’s Yuzhny Port today. This shipment will support the humanitarian response in the Horn of Africa where a historic drought is pushing millions of people to the brink of starvation. This procurement comes just weeks after the UN announced it helped reach an agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey to resume Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea, which had ground to a halt following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Russia’s war against Ukraine has caused food and fuel prices to spike globally and contributed to staggering levels of food insecurity in countries facing life-threatening hunger. This additional 150,000 metric tons of wheat supported by USAID, builds on these efforts and will support ongoing emergency food assistance in countries facing severe food crises., While the resumption of food exports out of Ukraine, after being blocked by Putin for almost six months, is an important first step, these shipments must continue so that the millions of tons of grain trapped in the country can reach markets and help feed the most vulnerable. This freeing of critical food supplies trapped in the Ukrainian ports is crucial, but the sheer scale of the hunger crisis – fueled by wars, the economic devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and extreme weather worsened by climate change – is so immense that this single advance will not solve this crisis., The United States has provided nearly $7.6 billion in assistance to respond to the global food security crisis since the beginning of Russia’s war against Ukraine. We will continue to work to meet the needs of the people made even more vulnerable due to Russia’s war against Ukraine. USAID humanitarian assistance, including our support to WFP, includes direct food assistance, as well as other support including safe drinking water, health care, and protection to meet needs made even worse by food crises.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-supporting-un-world-food-program-purchase-150000-metric-tons-ukrainian-wheat
Ukraine Receives Seven-Week Supply of Long-Acting Insulin from Direct Relief,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,Health,16 Aug 2022,"The insulin was manufactured and provided to Direct Relief by the drug maker Eli Lilly and Company, esponding to a call for help from Ukraine's Ministry of Health, Direct Relief has secured and delivered to Ukraine enough long-acting insulin to meet the country's estimated need for seven-plus weeks., The insulin, manufactured and provided to Direct Relief by the drug maker Eli Lilly and Company, was delivered to Ukraine over the past two weeks and will be allocated by Ukraine's Ministry of Health to hospitals, clinics, and programs treating people with diabetes around the country., There are 2.3 million adults living with diabetes in Ukraine in 2022 -- one in every 14 adults -- 40% of whom are undiagnosed, according to the International Diabetes Federation's Diabetes Atlas. All people with Type 1 diabetes and roughly 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes require daily insulin injections, while many depend on other medications to control the condition., Direct Relief and its partners estimate that Ukraine needs 115,000 10 ml vials of long-acting insulin per month. In this single supply of medicine, Lilly provided 673,000 quick-injection pens, each containing 3 ml of long-acting insulin glargine, equivalent to 202,191 10 ml vials, or enough to cover Ukraine's needs for more than seven weeks., When a person has diabetes, their body doesn't make enough insulin to control their blood sugar level, making them susceptible to health problems including heart disease, blindness, lower-limb amputations and more. Diabetes is among the world's most widespread and most harmful noncommunicable diseases. In 2021 alone, diabetes caused an estimated 6.7 million deaths and at least $966 billion in health expenditures worldwide, according to the IDF, which has worked closely with Direct Relief in planning and facilitating large-scale insulin donations to countries in crisis around the world., ""IDF expresses its immense gratitude to our partner Direct Relief for the organization's quick and efficient mobilization of resources to deliver medical supplies and aid to support Ukrainian citizens living with diabetes,"" said Prof. Andrew Boulton, president of IDF. ""In times of crises, when resources are scarce, caring for diabetes can be extremely difficult. People living with diabetes require uninterrupted access to the medicines and care they need to manage their condition and prevent life-threatening complications. IDF's long-term partner Lilly has been incredibly generous in supporting people with diabetes affected by the war in Ukraine. We applaud this latest donation of insulin, which will help bolster the country's supply of this essential medicine."", People with diabetes take long-acting insulins like the insulin glargine donated by Lilly once a day to provide a baseline insulin level in their blood. Most people who depend on injected insulin also need short-acting insulin to level their blood sugar after meals., ""Lilly recognizes the challenges people continue to face in Ukraine in accessing essential medicines like insulin. This collaboration with Direct Relief is critical to ensuring our medicines reach the healthcare providers and patients who need them,"" said Michael B. Mason, president of Lilly Diabetes., The huge charitable supply of insulin is the latest action in Direct Relief's extensive aid for Ukrainians with diabetes since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Since then, Direct Relief has secured and delivered 1.4 million insulin quick-injection pens, 733,800 insulin pen needles, 188,833 10 ml insulin vials, nearly 25,000 glucose meters with 400,000 test strips, and over 3.2 million oral diabetes tablets equivalent to almost 1.5 million daily defined doses. Direct Relief has also provided a $150,000 grant to the Ukrainian Diabetes Federation (UDF) for managing and distributing insulin and diabetes-related medical supplies and testing equipment., Under a bi-lateral partnership agreement, Ukraine's Ministry of Health is working with Direct Relief to secure medicine donations from pharmaceutical manufacturers, leveraging Direct Relief's existing relationships, smoothing the processes of securing the drugs, and ensuring their timely delivery. Lilly supplied the insulin to Direct Relief, which arranged cold-chain transportation to Kyiv to benefit Ukrainian patients. Since the war erupted, Ukraine's government has been covering access to insulin for its population with diabetes., ""Direct Relief is deeply grateful to Lilly for its leadership and commitment reflected in this donation for the people of Ukraine,"" said Thomas Tighe, Direct Relief president and CEO. ""Lilly's support is an incredible example of what's needed to address this crisis from a humanitarian standpoint."", Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Direct Relief has provided more than 900 tons of requested medical aid to Ukraine and neighboring countries hosting Ukrainian refugees.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-receives-seven-week-supply-long-acting-insulin-direct-relief
"UNICEF reaches 350,000 children with cash assistance through “Spilno” programme [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,17 Aug 2022,"KYIV, Ukraine, 17 August 2022 – UNICEF’s humanitarian cash assistance programme has now reached more than 350,000 children in Ukraine., The ‘Spilno’ programme, launched on 31 March 2022 together with the Ministry of Social Policy, was created to address the needs of families with children, who are among the most vulnerable groups in Ukraine. Since then, UNICEF has distributed US$125 million and reached 350,000 children, including 35,000 with disabilities, living in 120,000 households., Families can register for assistance and receive a fast response through an online platform, with successful applicants receiving an unconditional grant., “This programme is about helping families in a crisis do what they believe is best for their children,” said Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “No one is in a better position to decide how to get the most out of this support than a parent or guardian.”, The Spilno programme prioritizes families with three or more children and those raising at least one child with a disability across Ukraine. The target beneficiary group was based on a 2020 child poverty report, which found that 47 per cent of families in Ukraine were living in poverty. Among these, 81 per cent of households with three or more children lived below the national poverty line., Accountability to affected populations is a key principle of the Spilno programme. A dedicated hotline (0 800 600 017), created to assist those who experience difficulties in applying online, has been instrumental in supporting the application process and consulting vulnerable families about cash grants., The programme is designed to support the government’s national social protection system. UNICEF works closely with the Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Digital Transformation and other humanitarian actors to enable linkages between humanitarian cash transfers and government social protection schemes. For instance, government social workers have been mobilised in several regions of Ukraine to support self-registration for the Spilno programme., “The UNICEF cash program has become an effective tool for supporting families with children in this extremely challenging time and for supporting the entire country,” said Oksana Zholnovych, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine. “The consolidation of the efforts of the international aid program and the Ministry of Social Policy proves that only together can we effectively overcome challenges and ensure the well-being of children and families. In this cooperation, the state helped to digitize, administer the process, verify the data, so that assistance can benefit those who need it most. We are sincerely grateful to UNICEF for this financial support for Ukrainian families with children and willingness to work in synergy. We count on the further expansion of cooperation in order to address the challenges of war faced by children and families.”, Vira, her husband and their three children fled their home in eastern Ukraine and sought refuge in a modular container town for displaced families in the western city of Lviv. “We were so desperate we sold our rings just to buy some food,” says Vira. “With the money we received through the Spilno cash assistance programme, we have enough to eat and buy medication.”, The Spilno cash programme would not be possible without funding provided by the Government of Italy, Spain, the Swedish International Development Agency, the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and the European Union, as well as support from businesses and caring individuals from all around the world., Media contacts Nina Sorokopud UNICEF Ukraine Tel: +380 50 388 2951 Email: nsorokopud@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-reaches-350000-children-cash-assistance-through-spilno-programme-enuk

Sectoral cash can top up the MPC value to cover specific needs that are not accounted for in the MEB, e.g. cash for rent or cash for protection., TOOLBOX, In supporting the emergency MPC rollout, the CWG set up four initial thematic Task Teams focused on targeting (TT1, facilitated by IOM), transfer mechanisms (TT2, facilitated by NRC), registration and deduplication (TT3, facilitated by UNHCR and WFP), and monitoring (TT4, facilitated by ACTED and REACH). As a result, the CWG created a toolbox to harmonize and operationalize common approaches. The toolbox is a one-stop shop with a suite of tools ready to be used by any humanitarian partner rolling out MPC in Ukraine.

He also stressed the importance of timely addressing the challenges to maintain critical food production and address breakdowns in agri-food supply chains., ""We continue to support Ukraine and work closely with the Government of Ukraine, in particular, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, and local administrations to ensure the stability and development of agriculture in this difficult time for the country,"" said Raimund Jehle. “FAO’s portfolio in Ukraine focus on emergency assistance to the agricultural rural households, addressing storage deficit, supporting value chains development, adaptation to climate change and combating land degradation.”, Following the start of the war, FAO developed and updated its Rapid Response Plan, requiring USD 115.4 million to assist nearly 1 million rural people by providing agricultural assistance and ensuring food security to those most affected by the conflict. Under this programme, FAO has already supported 80 000 people in 13 oblasts of Ukraine and continues providing multi-purpose cash assistance to cover the basic needs of over 5 000 families in the hardest hit locations in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine., Apart from it, FAO will provide animal feed and pilot a voucher program for the purchase of essential agricultural inputs. Support will be provided to displaced persons and host families in rural areas, as well as to the most vulnerable categories of the population., In addition to these activities, FAO is working with the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine on the implementation of Grain Storage Support Strategy to address the current storage deficit in Ukraine, aiming to deploy temporary storage capacity to farmers through 2022-2023. This will strengthen food security and protect livelihoods at the household and national levels in Ukraine, and ensure other grain import-dependent countries retain access to adequate supplies of grain, at a manageable cost., ""Together with the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, FAO is implementing the Grain Storage Strategy, according to which FAO plans to ensure the storage of 4.07 million tons of grain, which is 25% of the national need. We already completed a tender and are identifying potential suppliers of grain sleeves with supporting equipment, modular storage units,” added Pierre Vauthier, Head of the office in Ukraine. “One of the important requirements for receiving temporary storage equipment will be the registration in the State Agrarian Registry."", Thanks to close collaboration with the Government of Ukraine and our partners, and generous contributions from donors, FAO will continue delivering life and livelihood saving assistance across the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-stands-ready-support-ukrainian-farmers-and-rural-population

Protection and Human Rights",16 Aug 2022,"Russian Forces Use Widely Banned Cluster Munitions, Damage Hospitals, (Kyiv, August 16, 2022) – Russian forces have assaulted Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with repeated unlawful attacks that killed and wounded civilians and damaged healthcare facilities and homes, Human Rights Watch said today. All of the attacks that Human Rights Watch documented were carried out in populated areas by indiscriminately using explosive weapons with wide area effects and widely banned cluster munitions in apparent violation of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war., During recent visits to Kharkiv and the neighboring town of Derhachi, Human Rights Watch documented eight unlawful incidents of attacks that killed 12 civilians, wounded 26 others, and damaged at least 5 hospital buildings – just a fraction of attacks reported in the Kharkiv region since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022. As well as Human Rights Watch could determine, Russian forces did not take the precautions required by the laws of war to minimize civilian harm in any of the documented attacks, three of them with cluster munitions., “Russian forces have pummeled Kharkiv and surrounding areas, attacking densely populated residential neighborhoods with indiscriminate weapons,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “In the cases we documented, Russian forces appeared to show little regard for civilian lives and the laws of war.”, According to the Kharkiv region’s deputy prosecutor, Andrii Kravchenko, at least 1,019 civilians, including 52 children, have been killed and 1,947 others wounded, including 152 children, during hundreds of attacks by Russian forces in the Kharkiv region since late February., Between May 24 and June 28, Human Rights Watch researchers inspected the sites of eight of these cases, including three in Kharkiv and five in Derhachi, and interviewed 28 people, including 22 witnesses to the eight incidents, hospital workers, State Emergency Service representatives, and local prosecutors. Some people asked to withhold their surnames or their full names for security reasons., Two volunteers were wounded on May 12 when a cluster munition rocket pierced the roof of a cultural center in Derhachi, where workers were preparing food and other aid for local residents. At around the same time, submunitions – possibly from the same rocket – landed in the garden of a couple who lived about a kilometer away, killing both. On May 23, a cluster munition attack struck a maternity clinic building in Kharkiv city, wounding a man at a bus stop outside the clinic building and damaging the building’s façade, windows, and pharmacy., On May 26 a 63-year-old man taking a walk was killed when a munition landed in Kharkiv’s August 23 Square park. About a kilometer away, a woman who had just started a new job at a salon said her husband, who had come to take her home, and their 4-month-old baby boy were killed when a munition struck near the salon. The woman and a colleague were injured, and a client was also killed., Ukraine deploys military forces inside the city of Kharkiv, but in seven of the incidents of attacks, Human Rights Watch found no evident military objective – such as armed forces, weapons, or bases or other positions – in the vicinity of the attack. In one attack that damaged a hospital, there may have been a small Ukrainian military presence nearby, but the special protections provided to medical facilities under the laws of war meant this attack was still unlawful., All of the incidents of attacks documented were in apparent violation of the laws of war. Russian forces appear to have used munitions indiscriminately, including in three attacks with cluster munitions and three others with explosive weapons in populated areas. Three attacks damaged hospitals, including two with cluster munitions. The attacks were unlawfully indiscriminate because they were not directed at a specific military target or could not distinguish between civilians or civilian objects and military objectives., Since February 2022, Russian forces have repeatedly used cluster munitions, which are inherently indiscriminate, in attacks across the country that have killed hundreds of civilians and damaged homes, hospitals, and schools. Ukrainian forces have used cluster munitions on at least two known occasions since the full-scale invasion began. These weapons are banned under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions because of their widespread indiscriminate effect and long-lasting danger to civilians. Cluster munitions typically open in the air and send dozens, even hundreds, of small bomblets over an area the size of a football field. Many of these submunitions fail to explode on initial impact, leaving duds that act like landmines., A State Emergency Service representative in Kharkiv said that between February 24 and May 7, the service had collected 2,700 unexploded submunitions in the city and surrounding areas., The Russian attacks in Kharkiv demonstrate the devastating impact on civilians and civilian structures when armed forces use explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, including cluster munitions, and the increased likelihood of unlawful indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Explosive weapons can have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. Long-term effects of their use in populated areas include damage to critical infrastructure, interference with services such as health care and education, and displacement of the local population., In a late June report, the humanitarian aid organization Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders, MSF), which is treating war-wounded across Ukraine, concluded that the fighting is “being conducted with an outrageous lack of care to distinguish and protect civilians.” The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights indicated that of the 5,514 civilian deaths and 7,698 civilians injured that it recorded in Ukraine between February 24 and August 14 – most likely a significant undercount – the majority were caused by explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-barrel rocket launchers, missiles, and airstrikes., Russia and Ukraine should join the international convention banning cluster munitions and avoid using explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, Human Rights Watch said. All countries should agree to the proposed declaration on curbing explosive weapons and work to implement it effectively to prevent civilian harm., Serious violations of the laws of war, including indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks by individuals with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for attempting to commit a war crime, as well as assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime. Commanders and civilian leaders may be prosecuted for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility when they knew or should have known about the commission of war crimes and took insufficient measures to prevent them or punish those responsible., “Kharkiv residents have been living in fear of the next strike for months, as their city has endured some of the worst devastation and death amid widespread Russian attacks,” Wille said. “National and international prosecutors investigating war crimes in Ukraine should work to ensure that those responsible for the unlawful attacks in Kharkiv are held to account.”, For more information on the Russian forces’ assault on Kharkiv and details about the eight incidents of attacks documented by Human Rights Watch, please see below., Russian Forces’ Assault on Kharkiv Since February, On February 24, Russian forces entered the Kharkiv region, which borders Russia, from the north and northeast. By early March, they were approaching the capital of the region, Kharkiv city, from the west. Though they lost some ground in the northeast, Russian forces were occupying almost all of the northwestern part of the region by early April, including dozens of towns and villages, and had taken control of several key cities, including Balakliia, Izyum, and Kupiansk. Russian forces continued to attack Kharkiv city and surrounding towns and villages not under their control from the northwest., Human Rights Watch previously documented 43 attacks by Russian forces in Kharkiv between February 24 and March 5, during their initial assault on the city, which damaged apartment blocks, schools, places of worship, and shops, impeding access to food and medicine. They also damaged infrastructure, causing losses of vital services such as electricity, heat, and water. Local authorities reported that 133 civilians were killed and 319 were wounded in Kharkiv during these first 11 days of the war., In a June report, Amnesty International documented 41 attacks by Russian forces in Kharkiv city between February 28 and April 30 that killed at least 62 people and injured at least 196, including 7 attacks with cluster munitions., Unlawful Incidents of Attacks Since May Documented by Human Rights Watch, Derhachi Cultural Center, May 12 and 13, Derhachi is 10 kilometers northwest of Kharkiv city with a population of roughly 21,000. Russian forces have bombarded the town since February 24, with the front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces only a few kilometers away. Soon after hostilities began, about 200 Derhachi residents formed a volunteer network in cooperation with local authorities to help maintain law and order and distribute aid to civilians who chose not to flee, said Volodymyr Stepanenko, a deputy of the local council. They used the cultural center in downtown Derhachi as a distribution point, said five volunteers there and a security guard. When interviewed, the volunteers were wearing olive green clothing, similar to military attire, though all were civilians., On May 12 at about 8:30 a.m., part of a 220mm Uragan cluster munition rocket, which had already dispersed its submunitions, punched through the roof of the three-story cultural center, breaking through the ground floor ceiling. Several submunitions landed just outside and another landed in the garden of a couple’s home about a kilometer away. That night, at about 2 a.m. on May 13, another single munition hit the cultural center. In addition to the two people killed, nine were wounded in the two attacks, said Kravchenko, the deputy prosecutor., Those interviewed said that volunteers usually arrived at the center each morning at around 7 a.m. and started distributing aid at around 8 or 9 a.m., by which time a line of civilians had usually formed outside the center. They said that members of the Ukrainian army and the volunteer Territorial Defense Forces would also sometimes come by in vehicles to collect food, water, and medicine, but as far as they knew, no armed forces or their vehicles had been outside the center at the time of the attack., The five volunteers said that at the time of the attack, they and other volunteers, about 20 in all, were in a hall in the southeast corner of the building, on the ground floor, preparing to distribute aid. Oleksiy Stepanenko, the local council deputy’s son and also a deputy of the local council, shared photographs he took on his phone when the rocket remnant broke through the ceiling., Volodymyr Gorbunov, 48, a volunteer, said, “I was right under the spot where the rocket came through the ceiling. There was a huge bang and then lots of dust and glass was in my eyes. My volunteer partner fell to the floor next to me. I pulled him up, and as I did, I saw a drop of blood hit the ground and realized it was coming from my head.” Another volunteer, Serhii Kulik, about 35, was injured by a brick that fell from the ceiling, hitting his leg and slicing off one of his fingers., At the same time as the attack, volunteers and the State Emergency Service said, several submunitions landed behind the cultural center, and one landed in the garden of Svitlana and Serhii Lukianenko, a kilometer away. Researchers were unable to determine whether the submunition was from the same rocket, or a second one., Svitlana’s brother, who reached their home about three hours later, said the couple had been in the garden cooking over an open flame. The brother said he spoke to a neighbor, who heard screams and rushed over. The neighbor told him that Svitlana was killed instantly from a large wound to her head, while Serhii’s legs were severed, and he died during surgery at the hospital later that day., The brother shared photographs he took in the garden soon after he arrived, including of the remnants of at least one fragmentation submunition that detonated. Among the submunition remnants were rectangular, black metal stabilization fins from submunitions delivered by Uragan and Smerch cluster munition rockets, based on Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the photographs. The brother said there was no military presence in the area as far as he knew., When the cultural center was hit a second time by a single munition at about 2 a.m. on May 13, some civilians were sleeping in the basement. According to the volunteers and the head of the local hospital, on most nights since late February about 25 to 30 civilians were sleeping there. This included civilians from nearby villages whose homes had been destroyed, people from Derhachi whose homes had no basements to shelter in, and doctors and nurses from the nearby local hospital who could not make it home safely after finishing their shifts., Volodymyr, one of the center’s security guards, said that 21 civilians were in the building when it was hit in the early hours of May 13, including 6 doctors who were spending the night there and 3 security guards., Volodymyr said that he and one of the center’s other security guards were sleeping under the stage in the main hall of the building when he awoke to rumbling overhead:, I felt like I was waking up in a dream state, and then everything collapsed on top of me. Something hit my head, and bits of concrete got into my eyes. A wooden plank fell on top of me. I think it took me 20 minutes to dig myself out from under the rubble and check on my colleague, Serhii, who had two wooden doors with metal frames that had fallen on top of him, cutting his lip and leaving him with head and leg trauma., Human Rights Watch observed that the northeast part of the building, where Volodymyr had been, was completely destroyed, but the northwest corner, with the basement where people were sheltering, was largely undamaged. One man in the basement, Mykola, 64, was wounded, with blood coming from his eye. He was there because his home in the nearby village of Tsupivka was destroyed in an attack, volunteers said., Volodymyr said that everyone stayed inside the building initially because they were worried about further attacks, but at 3 a.m. they decided to evacuate the building, and he took Mykola to the hospital., Both strikes that hit the cultural center appear indiscriminate, in violation of the laws-of-war prohibition on attacks not directed at a specific military objective. This is particularly so with the use of cluster munitions in the first strike, as they are inherently indiscriminate weapons., A representative from the State Emergency Service said that their teams had collected 18 unexploded submunitions, 9 delivered by Uragan rockets and 9 delivered by Smerch rockets, in Derhachi between February 24 and June 6. He said the teams had also found four Uragan rockets containing a full payload of 30 intact submunitions that failed to deploy and one non-cluster munition Uragan rocket. Stepanenko, the local council deputy, shared a photograph of an empty cargo section of an Uragan cluster munition rocket that landed just meters from the cultural center during an earlier attack, on March 11., Repeated Attacks Damaging Derhachi Hospital, Russian forces repeatedly launched attacks that hit Derhachi’s main hospital, including in mid-March, on April 7, and on May 12. Human Rights Watch researchers observed the damage from each of these attacks and interviewed the head of the hospital, Svitlana Berezhna, and the head of the hospital’s primary healthcare unit, Nina Ivanenko. The mid-March attack damaged the X-ray department and cafeteria in the hospital’s main building, both of which were no longer functioning., The attack just after midnight on the night of April 7 to 8 damaged a wall near the entrance of the hospital’s main building, as well as the primary healthcare unit in a separate building. Ivanenko said that the building was empty at the time of the attack, which damaged the walls and windows and four computers. The May 12 attack damaged the roof, walls, and windows of another cluster of nearby hospital buildings housing other hospital units., Berezhna said that fortunately no one was killed or injured in the attacks. Human Rights Watch did not find any remnants of the munitions used in the attacks, but the blast damage and extensive fragmentation evident in the complex is consistent with the use of large-caliber artillery fire., Hospitals have special protections under the laws of war, and deliberate attacks against hospitals and other medical facilities that are not being used to carry out attacks are prohibited and constitute war crimes. The use of large-caliber artillery fire in the absence of a military target makes the attack indiscriminate, a serious violation of the laws of war and a potential war crime., Women’s Outpatient Services of Kharkiv’s City Maternity Clinic No 1, May 23, Just before 8 a.m. on May 23, Russian forces launched a cluster munition attack that hit the women’s outpatient services of Kharkiv’s City Maternity Clinic No. 1 in the Pavlove Pole neighborhood. Human Rights Watch saw damage to the clinic building’s façade, windows, and pharmacy, as well as a four-story apartment building across the street. The clinic’s medical director, Serhii Kopytko, said that staff members normally arrive at 8 a.m., and that fortunately no one from the clinic building was wounded. A 36-year-old man standing at a bus stop outside of the clinic building was wounded when one of the submunitions detonated nearby., Susannah, who works at a café 130 meters from the clinic building, said that she was getting ready to open the café when at 7:55 a.m. she saw something strike across the street, followed by explosions. She ran to the bathroom for cover, but said she heard at least five or six small explosions one after another. She showed Human Rights Watch small pieces of a steel rod that was fragmented when a submunition detonated that she had found lodged in the window of the café after the attack. She also showed Human Rights Watch where she later found the empty cargo section from the Uragan cluster munition rocket that was used in the attack., Another woman, who worked at a bakery next to the clinic building entrance, said she was inside, about to open the bakery door, when an explosion right outside threw her to the floor and shattered glass fell on her. “I heard many bangs; it sounded like fireworks going off,” she said. “Some were closer, some were further away.”, Two residents said that Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces gathered in several basements in the area, and that a kitchen 125 meters from the clinic building was being used to prepare food for the armed forces. Kitchen staff standing outside at the time of the visit confirmed this., In addition, the perimeter of the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University, a state university administered by the Defense Ministry that has come under numerous attacks since February 24, is 590 meters from the clinic building and a legitimate military target. On June 5, Human Rights Watch saw three people inside the university – one man in military fatigues and two men in the yard, guarding a doorway. Researchers were unable to ascertain the extent to which the campus is being used for military purposes, but it appeared to be largely abandoned., The Kharkiv prosecutor’s office is 115 meters from the clinic building and has also come under numerous attacks. This office is not a legitimate military target as long as it is not being used for military purposes., Human Rights Watch identified six impact splatters characteristic of the detonation of a fragmentation submunition in the asphalt directly around the clinic building and most likely two more in the soil. Researchers identified another three probable impact sites of the May 23 attack in the yard between the clinic building and the kitchen and another five between the clinic building and the prosecutor’s office. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine representative in Kharkiv said that, after the attack, his team found three unexploded submunitions in the vicinity of the clinic building, and an empty cargo section of an Uragan cluster munition rocket., Attacks across Ukraine had damaged or destroyed at least 10 perinatal centers and maternity hospitals as of May 15, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This combined with shortages of medical personnel and supplies prevent access to critical maternal and sexual and reproductive health care, including emergency obstetric care and essential care for survivors of sexual violence., Attacks in Kharkiv’s Pavlove Pole Neighborhood, May 26, On the afternoon of May 26, Russian forces fired several munitions in the Pavlove Pole neighborhood, including into the August 23 Square park and the area surrounding the park and the National Air Force University, which is about 690 meters away. Human Rights Watch researchers visited the park several times between May 27 and June 8. They interviewed 12 witnesses to the attacks and identified five specific craters, between the park and the university., An emergency responder said that they had identified at least one additional crater in the roof of residential buildings in the area. Kharkiv’s deputy prosecutor said that 10 civilians were killed, and 16 others wounded during the attacks. Human Rights Watch confirmed the specific circumstances around the deaths of seven of the civilians killed and four of those wounded., Seven witnesses said they were in or just outside of the park at around 2:30 p.m. when they heard at least three explosions a few minutes apart. These initial blasts killed at least three civilians., The owner of a restaurant on the edge of the park said that a munition landed in the park at around 2:30 p.m., setting a coffee stand in the middle of the park on fire. He said that he saw the bodies of two people being taken away by an ambulance. One of the victims was Serhii, 63, a pensioner who loved cycling who was in the park for his daily walk, two men from the neighborhood said. Video footage posted in the local media shows his body on the grass, and Human Rights Watch saw bloodied paper towels there the day after the attack. It’s unclear what happened to the second victim the restaurant owner saw., Another victim, who the residents said was an electrician, was killed on a street that runs alongside the edge of the park. A witness to the attack saw the victim’s body and said he had a metal fragment in his neck. Human Rights Watch saw blood on the pavement where his body had been and reviewed footage of the attack’s aftermath., The State Emergency Service representative said another munition hit the roof of a building next to the park, causing metal fragments to land in the parking lot between the park and a subway station entrance, killing at least one person., Soon after the strikes that hit the park, another munition landed near a salon on Otakara Yarosha Street, about 270 meters from the air force university and 1.2 kilometers from the park, killing three civilians and wounding two. Oleksandra Korostelova,26, had just started working at the salon five days earlier. Because the city had come under attack that day, she said her husband, Mykhailo, 33, drove with their 4-month-old baby boy, Mykola, to pick her up from the salon. Korostelova said at about 2:40 p.m. she suddenly heard an explosion in the building their salon was located in and ran outside to meet Mykhailo. She grabbed her son and they started running down the street looking for shelter, with a colleague from the salon, Alina, and a salon client. Korostelova said:, We stopped next to a building, under a balcony. I handed Mykola to my husband, to give the client a hug to calm her down – she was shaking and so scared. At that moment something landed on the roof right above us. The next thing I knew, Mykhailo was dead, lying on the ground, his body severed in half. The woman I had been hugging was also dead.… We couldn’t find my son for about three hours – he had been thrown up into the air onto a balcony overhang 15 to 20 meters above the road. He was also dead., Korostelova was wounded in the attack, with a metal fragment that cut into her left leg, while Alina’s toes were injured., At around the same time, a munition landed 795 meters from the park and 200 meters from the perimeter of the university. The blast killed a 59-year-old woman and wounded Polina, a 9-year-old girl, and a man, said three people living in the apartments next to where the munition landed. Polina’s great-grandmother said that Polina had been watching television with her father in their living room at the time of the blast. A piece of glass cut Polina in the neck, and she was still in the hospital almost two weeks after the attack., At about 3 p.m., another munition landed in the yard of an apartment block next to the air force university, said a woman who lives there. No one was wounded., The fragments recovered from the scene and the scope of the damage Human Rights Watch observed suggest that the attacks were carried out with mortar fire., All of the witnesses interviewed said there were no military targets in the immediate vicinity at the time of the attacks. While the Russian forces may have been targeting the university, the multiple strikes over a broad area indicate that the attacks were indiscriminate. The laws of war prohibit as indiscriminate attacks that are not directed at a specific military objective., Kharkiv’s Regional Clinical Trauma Hospital, June 26, On the morning of June 26, just after midnight, an expended rocket motor and tail section of an Uragan cluster munition rocket hit the roof of Kharkiv’s Regional Clinical Trauma Hospital, a seven-story building in a medical complex in the Saltivka neighborhood of Kharkiv city. The rocket remnant pierced the roof, penetrated through the seventh floor, and stopped on the sixth floor. Human Rights Watch researchers visited the hospital on June 27 and observed the damage. The impact ripped a hole of roughly 1x1.5 meters, damaged several rooms on the sixth and seventh floors, including a pre-operation room and some key medical equipment, and shattered some windows., A hospital administration representative said that the hospital was fully functioning at the time, treating both civilians and soldiers, with about 150 of the hospital’s 255 beds occupied. He also shared photos and videos taken shortly after the attack, which showed the remnant of the rocket and a remnant of a submunition, specifically the sleeve containing the main explosive charge for the submunition that was delivered by the rocket., The hospital official said this was at least the fourth attack to hit the medical complex. The first attack, on March 12,shattered 83 windows., When researchers visited on June 27, they saw about 10 military medics outside the hospital near an ambulance. Satellite imagery from June 11 shows two earthen berms and three roadblocks along several sections of Saltivske Highway, a primary road north of the medical complex. Those features are also visible on imagery just before and after the June 26 attack, less than 50 meters from the medical complex fence. Soil perturbation is also visible in the medical complex yard on left bottom corner. Human Rights Watch was not able to determine its cause., Hospitals are civilian objects, and they may not be deliberately attacked. While the satellite images suggest that there may have been military targets in the area at the time of the attack, hospitals have special protections under the laws of war. While the protection of hospitals ceases if they are being used outside their humanitarian function to commit “acts harmful to the enemy,” adequate warning must first be provided before the hospital can be attacked if the warning goes unheeded. In addition, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas renders the attacks indiscriminate in violation of the laws of war., Reported Attacks in Late June and July, Subsequent to the Human Rights Watch visits to Kharkiv in May and June, Russia launched further attacks on the city, killing more civilians. These include alleged artillery and aerial attacks on the city’s northern Saltivka and Nemyshlyansky neighborhoods in the evening of June 27, which, according to the deputy prosecutor, Kravchenko, and Telegram posts from that day, killed at least 4 people and wounded 23 more. According to Twitter and Telegram posts and Kravchenko, two attacks on July 9 and 10, one of which was likely by a ballistic missile, hit residential buildings in Osnovyanskyi and Slobidskyi neighborhoods, wounding seven civilians and damaging the Kharkiv Regional Multidisciplinary Children’s Sanatorium., The media reported a July 11 attack on the city that killed at least 4 civilians and wounded another 25. Kravchenko alleged that cluster munitions were used in the attack. Another alleged Uragan rocket attack on the city that day killed a 17-year-old and his father. Three attacks on July 12, including one likely carried out by a Smerch rocket and two artillery attacks, according to Kravchenko, wounded six civilians. Kravchenko shared the names and ages of all those killed and injured, except two whose bodies were unidentifiable., Researchers were not present to examine the attack sites, but the alleged use of cluster munitions and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas indicates that these attacks should also be investigated as potentially unlawful attacks and war crimes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-unlawful-russian-attacks-kharkiv-enaruk
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 14 August 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",15 Aug 2022,"Ukraine: civilian casualty update 15 August 2022 *, Date: 15 August 2022, From 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 14 August 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 13,212 civilian casualties in the country: 5,514 killed and 7,698 injured. This included:, Civilian casualties in Ukraine from 24 February to 14 August 2022 (individual cases verified by OHCHR), per month, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.
Civilian casualties from 1 to 14 August 2022 (individual cases verified by OHCHR), From 1 to 14 August 2022, OHCHR recorded 585 civilian casualties:, This included:, Per type of weapon/incident:, The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., * An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 7 August 2022) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred from 8 to 14 August only, as during these days OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.

Hunger is painful, physically painful, And in Ukraine, you are suffering from the scourge of war; a war that none of us understand., Take away our labels and our titles, we are all people at the end of the day, and we just don’t understand., Today we are connected through our shared humanity – and we nod our heads in admiration and respect for the people of Ukraine, and their fortitude and courage, But that is not enough, The Black Sea Agreement serves to support the farmers of Ukraine – yes it will take time, but the ships are moving now – Over the last two weeks, 14 commercial vessels were sent to the world’s market. Not enough, but the system is in place., It also supports hungry people across the world., This first shipment of humanitarian assistance, organized by the World Food Programme, enable the UN and our humanitarian partners to literally save lives and alleviate the suffering of millions of people who are now struggling to put food on their table in Ethiopia.

The closure of the ports had left thousands of people without livelihood at a moment when the war was also devastating Ukraine’s economy., Now, today, we already have nearly 18 million people in the country who need humanitarian aid to survive. And the situation is getting worse by the day., Local, National and International partners are working to provide that assistance. We managed to reach nearly 12 million in the last six months, but we need to do more., And we will do more to work with the local organizations – those who were there from day 1., We need to reach people in need no matter where they are., Since the war began, the UN and our humanitarian partners have been prevented from sending supplies to areas temporarily beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine. It is imperative that we can provide assistance to everyone who needs it, no matter where they live., The winter months will soon be upon us – we are working together with the government and regional authorities on winterization – together we need to ensure the population of Ukraine has a safe, dignified and warm place., The partnership between the UN and Government of Ukraine is key to doing more.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/remarks-un-humanitarian-coordinator-ukraine-denise-brown-wfp-vessel-departure-odesa

The invasion has produced Europe’s largest movement of people, internally from east to west in the country, and externally to neighboring countries. There are an estimated 15.7 million people affected by the war in Ukraine, of which 12.1 million are considered in need of humanitarian health care., Active conflict has affected the functionality of the health system and produce acute shortages of supplies and medicines. Additionally, war activities limit free mobilization of populations. All of this, resulting in an overall limitation to access of health services and medicines. Conversely, there is also an increase of internal and external displacement of people due to war-related activities. The abrupt displacement of people may increase the risk of disease, due to closer and more intense social mixing, poor quality shelter and WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) conditions., In May 2022, taking into consideration the Health Cluster requests, Corus International prepared and conducted a LQAS health needs assessment, to measure indicators related to its Program interventions in Ukraine. This LQAS household survey was implemented from 27th to 31st May 2022 and was taken as the baseline for Corus International Health Program in the following 5 locations where Corus supports existing sanatoriums managed by the Federation of Trade Professional Unions (FPU):, However, due to the critical need of more specific data backing up the focus on the East, South Central and North of the country, Corus International decided to carry out a second round LQAS health needs assessment in Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Rivnenska regions. Then the following 5 additional Sanatorium locations were selected from those three regions:, The LQAS survey used a modified WHO’s data collection tool, which allowed to measure Corus Health Program indicators. The data was collected with smart phones and tablets equipped with Kobo Collect software, which was pretested in the field, and adjusted to ensure accuracy, before training the data collection teams on its use. A server was set up to securely host all electronic data collected from the survey, and data were monitored daily for errors and quality. The total random sample size for the second LQAS assessment was 475 respondents. Data was collected by each interviewer through in-depth structured interviews. Data collection teams combined smart phone/tablet and paper-based questionnaire methods for interviewing. Data collection took place from the 8th to 13th July 2022. Corus analyzed all data sets using STATA V.12 and Excel. This document presents the findings of the second round LQAS health needs assessment., In the geographical locations included in the survey, almost 30% of households were internally displaced persons (IDPs); most of them (39.8%) living in collective premises with private sleeping quarters and sharing dining facilities (see table 2). Rest of participants lived in their own apartment or house.

Ukraine initially also reported that a scheduled shift change had to be stopped, but it later told the IAEA that personnel rotation was back to normal. There were no casualties at the plant and its safety systems were not damaged, Ukraine added., Based on the information provided by Ukraine, IAEA experts noted that systems important for nuclear safety and security had not been affected. Nevertheless, renewed shelling at or near the ZNPP was deeply troubling for nuclear safety and security at the six-reactor facility, Director General Grossi said, reiterating his demand that all such military activity cease., Thursday’s shelling occurred on the same day as the IAEA Director General briefed the United Nations Security Council about the worsening nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP over the past week, emphasizing the urgent need for the IAEA to be able to send an expert mission to carry out essential nuclear safety, security and safeguards work there., The IAEA has not been able to visit the ZNPP since before the conflict began almost half a year ago. Since early March, it is controlled by Russian forces, but the Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the sites of the four operational nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Ukraine, and its experts have now also restored full safeguards data transfer from the Chornobyl NPP after experiencing a period of partial loss of such transmission, Director General Grossi said., Ukraine also informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, three at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-91-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-august-2022

Hostilities have destroyed more critical infrastructure during the month of July, leaving millions without access to basic lifelines such as health services, water, electricity, and gas supplies. Following an earlier slight decrease in the total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine, IOM estimates the number has once again grown to 6,645,000 IDPs in the country, largely fuelled by new displacements in the East, South, and North of Ukraine., Winter is just a few months away and with temperatures predicted to plummet as low as – 20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country, the impact will be felt by millions living in substandard conditions or without sufficient personal insulation or access to heating., JULY HIGHLIGHT, Around 1.6 million people have been reached with protection services, assistance through cash or essential items, and shelter support. UNHCR continues to work to support and complement the authorities’ response and contribute to sustainability., In close collaboration with the local authorities, UNHCR quickly provided emergency shelter support and relief items to communities affected by the recent missile attacks in Vinnytsia and Dnipro., The High Commissioner for Refugees visited Ukraine from 5 to 8 July for the second time to meet with Government, partners and people impacted by the war, living in Bucha, Iprin, Lviv and Makariv. Discussions were held on preparation for the upcoming winter and supporting future sustainable refugee returns., The winterization response is UNHCR’s top priority for the next six months. UNHCR is prioritizing the scale-up of programmes that will enable IDPs, conflict-affected persons and returnees to access safe, warm and dignified accommodation during the winter months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-unhcr-operational-monthly-update-july-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",12 Aug 2022,"Over the past month, we have managed to deliver food and drinking water to tens of thousands of people across Ukraine. In northern and central Ukraine, this has meant helping 30,000 people. We are working in almost all regions, including Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk, where we are preparing for a hard winter. Across Ukraine, we are preparing to repair 9,000 houses, nurseries, and other damaged buildings before the winter., Since the invasion, we have assisted more than 330,000 people with aid worth a total of €29,451,632 , and we have more than 200 colleagues on the ground., In the Czech Republic, we have supported some 17,000 Ukrainians displaced by the war so far. These are mainly women, children, and the elderly. We focus our efforts on the most vulnerable with health problems or other special needs. We are working in ten regions, helping at Prague's Main Railway Station, and dealing with dozens of requests for help daily at our Ukrainian helpline. We tutor children who have fled the war and we organise after-school activities for them—such as trips or camps., Read the latest summary of our assistance in Ukraine and the Czech Republic., AID IN UKRAINE, We are already preparing for winter and are still supplying drinking water to people living near the front line, €19,088,108 WORTH OF AID, As the Russian war in Ukraine nears its six-month anniversary, our aid is constantly changing and adapting to the needs on the ground. Two hundred of our colleagues are working in Ukraine, where we have a presence in nearly every region. Currently, our primary focus is on distributing direct financial assistance to internal refugees and other people at risk. We continue to provide food aid, especially in the south, where people fleeing fighting in other areas of Ukraine have sought safety. We have started to provide ready meals in collective centres, and we continue to supply drinking water to people living near the front line. We are also preparing for the winter—we know from our experiences in other war-torn countries that it is vital to prepare for the winter months well in advance., In the last month alone, we have delivered non-perishable food for 7,600 people and jerry cans of drinking water for 7,100 people to the Kharkiv region. Similarly, in the Dnipropetrovsk region, 6,000 people received help from us, and another 3,200 people were provided with hygiene supplies. We delivered 124 beds with mattresses and bedding to collective centres. However, we are not only focusing on eastern Ukraine; in Kyiv and the surrounding villages, we have delivered food for 11,000 people and to almost 30,000 people in the north., ""Over the last few weeks, we have stopped importing food into Ukraine and are buying it locally because the private sector has recovered from the initial shock,"" says Petr Drbohlav, our Regional Director for the Eastern Partnership and the Balkans. Since the beginning of the invasion, we have sent 50 trucks and 17 trains of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, bringing vital supplies to the victims of the war., In Ukraine, two million houses have been damaged or destroyed because of the Russian invasion. The coming winter poses a huge problem because people cannot survive in houses without windows or doors and with damaged roofs. Moreover, many Ukrainians live in cottages that are not built for winter living., We aim to repair 9,000 houses before winter so they can be heated. Together with other NGOs and with the support of UN agencies, up to 100,000 homes could be repaired. We also repair abandoned public buildings for refugees from collective centres in the Transcarpathian region. Where central heating is damaged, we will provide fuel. In places with no gas or electricity, we will look for alternatives, for example, in the form of stoves. In areas where the Russian army has withdrawn, we are primarily restoring critical infrastructure so that people can return home., We are also continuing to help collective centres for internal refugees. They have nowhere to return to, their homes are not safe, and they may have lost everything. Hundreds of thousands of people are still dependent on the help of collective centres and volunteers., We supply many collective centres with equipment or durable food supplies. In some places, the authorities are trying to free up schools and kindergartens that have become shelters for the neediest so that these can be reopened for children in September. As a result, centres are being merged, and local volunteers are running out of personnel and resources, so we will continue to supply food and hygiene items to these centres. In total, we have already supported 309 centres in eleven regions., We are providing psychosocial assistance via phone or in person ASSISTANCE WORTH EUR €8,215, At the same time, we provide psychosocial assistance, which is needed all the time and everywhere. However, we are faced with the fact that there are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists in Ukraine who can work with the traumas caused by the war. We run a telephone helpline in Ukrainian where people can call and confide their problems to a psychologist. Psychologists at the helpline receive up to fifty calls a day. The number of calls has increased by more than 73%., ""Psychologists at the helpline receive up to fifty calls a day. The number of calls has increased by more than 73%."" In addition to the phone helpline, we offer help in the form of mobile teams. One such team is led by Olena Kravtsova, our coordinator of psychosocial activities in Ukraine. Her team of fourteen psychologists provides psychological support in four regions of the country, and ten psychologists assist on a national helpline. ""Psychologists at the helpline receive up to fifty calls a day. The number of calls has increased by more than 73%,"" she says, describing the situation after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Olena adds that people will still need psychological support for at least five years after the war., The helpline works across Ukraine, whereas the mobile teams work in Lviv, Ternopil, Kirovograd and Dnipro. In addition, we provide support through our partners in three other areas., We are helping financially. Everyone buys what they need €6,736,496 WORTH OF AID, Where trade and markets work, we provide direct financial assistance. This means people can plan their shopping and buy precisely what they need; they are not dependent on the contents of standardised food parcels. In a situation where war has deprived people of almost everything, the opportunity to buy what a person needs is also an opportunity to make decisions about something in life. ""The most vulnerable families receive the equivalent of CZK 1,700 in hryvnia every month for a quarter of a year so that they can buy according to their own needs and thus, among other things, help kick-start the local economy,"" adds Petr Štefan, our global head of communications., DONATE TO UKRAINIAN EMERGENCY APPEAL:, HELP IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, €3,080,714 WORTH OF AID, In the Czech Republic, we have helped tens of thousands of refugees through the SOS Ukraine collection in cooperation with partner organisations, and more are arriving daily. Our services alone have supported around 17,000 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly. We focus on those most at risk, who have, for example, health problems or other special needs., Our field teams provide social work and counselling in 10 regions of the Czech Republic. We organise and coordinate help centres for refugees, monitor the situations in hostels, and address acute needs. We work to protect refugees from abuse in the housing and labour markets., We have supported integration activities and assistance for Ukrainian families with young children, To date, we have partnered and collaborated with 110 aid organisations, mainly in regions where we do not operate. In cooperation with other organisations, we have used more than €2,259,190 to help refugees., ""We have newly established additional partnerships in Prague, Brno and some smaller cities. For example, we have supported integration activities and assistance to Ukrainian families with young children in several family centres in Olomouc and the provision of psychological assistance to refugees in Libčice in Central Bohemia. When needed, we provide the necessary material support,"" says Zuzana Ramajzlová, Head of the SOS Ukraine programme in the Czech Republic., We have also started collaborating with the online Medical Advisory Service for Refugees ulekare.cz, which has already helped to resolve almost 10,000 requests in four months., We took over the provision of services at Prague's Main Railway Station and the monitoring of the situation at labour offices We have also taken over the provision of the Hlavák Initiative's services at Prague's Main Railway Station with sixty volunteers organising assistance to arriving refugees., In cooperation with other organisations, we are trying to help reduce the workload on labour offices where refugees must apply for humanitarian benefits. For example, in Prague's Holešovice, where the situation is the worst and Ukrainians have spent several days in endless queues, volunteers help with organisation. They also help with filling out applications. We are also preparing an information campaign on the rights and obligations of job seekers and on public health insurance., ""It is now very difficult to find suitable accommodation, as some locations are running out of capacity."" We are providing detailed information on humanitarian benefits on the helpline; we are looking for accommodation in a complicated situation., Our Ukrainian helpline team is working to address the requests of dozens of callers every day ""We try to explain everything in detail, as the Czech and Ukrainian systems are very different. The most frequent questions are about the payment of humanitarian benefits, registration at the labour offices and information on public health insurance. It is now very difficult to find suitable accommodation as some localities are running out of accommodation capacity,"" says Alena Čorna, helpline advisor., We are involved in working groups, and working towards systemic change We continue to cooperate with the Consortium of NGOs working with migrants, and we regularly meet with the management of the National Assistance Centre for Ukrainians. We are involved in most working groups. We are also involved in crisis management, coordination of regional assistance centres, and now in addressing the issue of health insurance for refugees., ""Within the framework of the international NIEM (National Integration Evaluation Mechanism) project, we have participated in the creation of two reports ""Integration of international protection holders in the Czech Republic"" and ""First-hand experience of integration: reception, adaptation and integration in the Czech Republic from the perspective of refugees"", which evaluated the main challenges related to the integration of Ukrainian refugees into the Czech society,"" says Tomáš Habart, head of Varianty's educational services., We are supporting education and organising leisure activities, We help with Czech language learning. We organise leisure activities, trips and suburban camps for Ukrainian and Czech children. We continue with adaptation groups. We are starting group tutoring in Olomouc and have new colleagues to support the education of Ukrainian children in Hranice na Moravě, Olomouc and Prague. From our computer collection, we have already issued more than 120 laptops, almost eighty desktop computers and over forty monitors, which will enable children to connect to Ukrainian distance learning or facilitate their preparation for Czech schools., We continue to support Ukrainian and Czech teachers. We offer SOS Ukraine scholarships for young refugees 15+ in a difficult socio-economic situation who are at risk of dropping out of their education. The programme is open to Ukrainian students enrolled in Czech secondary schools or engaged in distance learning with Ukrainian secondary schools., Another episode has been added to the Mall TV series Life in Czech, introducing our country to those who were not born here—this time on the topic of how children of foreigners manage to integrate into Czech schools. It conveys the experience that thousands of children from Ukraine are now going through. We are also preparing a final episode on how Czechs are helping, which will mainly touch on the wave of solidarity with Ukrainian refugees., AID IN MOLDOVA, €468,268 WORTH OF AID, In Moldova, we continue to support families who have provided shelter for those fleeing war. At the same time, we are also helping to run a helpline here, providing psychosocial assistance in Ukrainian and Russian to those most in need, as well as information about their rights and access to social and health services in Moldova.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/repairing-9000-houses-and-water-pipes-we-are-already-helping-prepare-winter-ukraine

Sustained fighting and hostilities continue to cause the destruction of critical infrastructure and seriously impact civilians in Ukraine, adding to an already unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Over the last week, insecurity and attacks have also hampered civilian evacuations in the east and the south, raising serious concerns about the security of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), located in areas under the control of the Russian Federation forces and affiliated groups., The fiercest fighting and harshest impacts on civilians continued to take place in the east. More than 120 civilians have reportedly been killed or injured in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts over the weekend, according to local authorities and Non-Government-controlled areas entities. Most casualties were reported in Donetska oblast, along and on both sides of the front line. Hostilities also caused additional damages to civilian infrastructure, including houses, health-care and educational facilities, as well as utility infrastructure, according to information gathered by humanitarians. In Donestka oblast, the situation with the water supply remains critical. At the same time, the Government-controlled city of Mykolaiv in the southern Mykolaivska oblast also reportedly continued to suffer daily shelling and rocket attacks. Intense shelling reportedly injured more than 20 people, including a child, and damaged 20 houses and five multi-storey buildings in the city, on 5 August alone, according to local authorities., Attacks reported on 5 and 6 August in the vicinity of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), located in non-Government-controlled areas of the south-east Zaporizka oblast, prompted Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi to issue a statement expressing concern and stressing the crucial importance that the Agency can send a mission of nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts to the site as soon as possible. The plant’s Ukrainian operator, Energoatom, reported that one attack had forced the shutdown of one of three operating reactors, that there had been physical damage to some plant infrastructure, and that the overall situation remained dangerous. Mr. Grossi said the events had breached several nuclear safety and security pillars. He also received the strong backing of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who – speaking on 8 August in Japan to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing in Hiroshima – described any attack on a nuclear plant as “suicidal.”, Attacks have also affected civilian evacuations and impacted the city of Nikopol, in central Dnipropetrovska oblast and just across the Dnipro river from Zaporizhzhia NPP, according to humanitarian security reports. On 10 August, authorities reported that a total of 13 people had been killed and 11 injured as the result of overnight rocket attacks impacting 2 settlements in the Nikopolskyi district – especially the city of Marhanets, where 12 of the people were reported to have died and 9 been injured. The shelling also reportedly caused significant damage to civilian infrastructure – including two schools and a dormitory – and cut off the gas supply to at least 1,000 residents. Elsewhere, reported missile attacks impacted the central-western Vinnytska oblast on 7 August and central Cherkaska oblast on 8 August, both of which have been less directly affected by the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-10-aug-2022-enruuk

UN Security Council must prioritize accountability for Russian war crimes in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,11 Aug 2022,"A UN Security Council session due to take place today must urgently prioritize civilian protection and accountability for the litany of war crimes committed by Russian forces and call for an end to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Amnesty International said., Russia requested the Security Council session, to focus on growing concerns over the militarization of a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine. The UN Secretary-General has warned that any damage to that or other nuclear plants could result in “catastrophic” consequences in the immediate vicinity and far beyond., “The allegations we are receiving directly from Enerhodar, the town adjacent to the nuclear plant, speak volumes about the terrible impact Russia’s militarization of the plant and surrounding areas is having on civilians. Amnesty International is currently investigating these worrying reports and urges the Security Council to do the same,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., The UN Security Council’s unequivocal priority – with regard not just to Zaporizhzhia but across the entire conflict – must be to ensure civilians are protected., Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “The Council must also include accountability for the wide range of egregious Russian violations in the conflict to date., “The imminent danger posed by the militarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is and should be the key issue for the Security Council. It would appear that this militarization is part of a broader strategy by Russian forces to threaten civilians and put millions of people at great risk. We should also keep our attention on Russia’s abominable conduct, and the fact that during its six months of aggression against Ukraine its forces have endangered and killed many civilians. We should not allow the Russian authorities to avoid accountability.”, Since the invasion, Amnesty International has documented and reported on numerous violations by Russian forces, including indiscriminate attacks, use of banned cluster munitions, and extrajudicial executions. Many amount to war crimes, which the Security Council must condemn and pave the way for those responsible to be brought to justice., “The UN Security Council’s unequivocal priority – with regard not just to Zaporizhzhia but across the entire conflict – must be to ensure civilians are protected,” said Agnès Callamard., Months of documenting violations, Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, Amnesty International has spent months on the ground documenting Russian violations and war crimes. The organization has published more than a dozen press releases, briefings and reports condemning these acts and calling for accountability. The organization has also urged Ukrainian forces to take additional steps to protect civilians.

"Situation at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant ‘Very Alarming’, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,Disaster Management,11 Aug 2022,"9109TH MEETING (PM)
SC/14996, Amid Growing Safety Concerns, Delegates Stress Urgency of Allowing Technical Experts to Conduct Security, Safeguard Mission, Thesituation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has deteriorated rapidly to the point of becoming “very alarming”, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi warned the Security Council today, in a meeting requested by the Russian Federation and marked by resounding calls to allow the Agency’s technical experts to visit the area to address mounting safety concerns., “These military actions near such a large nuclear facility could lead to very serious consequences,” Mr. Grossi said, stressing that the Agency has been in frequent contact with both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to ensure it has the clearest picture possible of the evolving circumstances., Providing an overview of events, he said that, on 5 August, the Zaporizhzhia plant — Europe’s largest — was subjected to shelling, resulting in several explosions near the electrical switchboard, and causing a power shutdown. One reactor unit was disconnected from the electrical grid, triggering its emergency protection system and setting generators into operation to ensure power supply. There was also shelling in a nitrogen-oxygen station. While firefighters extinguished the blaze, he said repairs must be assessed and evaluated., While IAEA experts’ preliminary assessment indicated that there is no immediate threat to nuclear safety as a result of the shelling or other military actions, “this could change at any moment”, he said., He recalled the seven indispensable pillars that are critical for nuclear safety and security, including aspects dealing with the physical integrity of the plant, off-site power supply, cooling systems and emergency preparedness systems and measures. “All these pillars have been compromised if not entirely violated at one point or another during this crisis,” he observed., Preventing nuclear catastrophe must be a collective, overarching goal. He asked both sides to cooperate with IAEA. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour and the IAEA must be allowed to conduct its mission in Zaporizhzhia as soon as possible.”, In the ensuing debate, delegates around the Chamber table reinforced the urgent need for IAEA to conduct a safety, security and safeguard mission to the site, a charge that Gabon’s delegate described as “more urgent than ever”. She called on the sides to seize the momentum from the recent grain export agreement to engage in ceasefire negotiations. Some delegates, including from Albania, Ireland and the United Kingdom, said the security around Zaporizhzhia would not be a concern were it not for the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine., Outlining his case, the Russian Federation’s delegate said Ukrainian forces used heavy artillery against Zaporizhzhia on 5 August, shelling the plant during a shift change to intimidate staff — their own citizens. On 6 August, these forces attacked with cluster munitions, and on 7 August, a power surge occurred. He blamed Kyiv for refusing to sign a trilateral document issued by IAEA, stressing that the Russian Federation is strictly complying with the IAEA Director General’s seven principles., In turn, Ukraine’s representative said the withdrawal of Russian troops and return of the station to the legitimate control of Ukraine is the only way to remove the nuclear threat at Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine has insisted on the need to send a mission to the site and has negotiated modalities with the Agency. “Despite their public declarations, the occupiers have resorted to manipulations and unjustified conditions for the site visit,” he said. Given the militarization of the site by Russian armed forces, such a mission must include qualified experts in military aspects., “It is especially galling that the Russian Federation’s actions are taking place during the ongoing [tenth] Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,” said the United States delegate, one of several calling on the Russian Federation to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, to cease all military operations at or near its facilities and to return full control of Zaporizhzhia to Ukraine., China’s delegate meanwhile noted that the IAEA Director General has been planning to visit Zaporizhzhia, and Secretary-General António Guterres has issued an appeal for that purpose. He cited a message from Ukraine to Mr. Grossi and the Secretary-General on 9 August underscoring the necessity of that visit, and expressed hope that any obstacles can be cleared to facilitate that mission., Also speaking today were representatives of Ghana, United Arab Emirates, Norway, Brazil, India, Kenya, France and Mexico., The representatives of the Russian Federation, United States and United Kingdom took the floor a second time, as did the IAEA Director General., The meeting began at 3:01 p.m. and ended at 4:55 p.m., Briefing, RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the IAEA has been actively assessing the situation of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities since the conflict began in February. Recalling his report on the situation to the Council in March, he added that, since 24 February, the Agency has activated its incident and emergency centre, established regular contact with Ukrainian authorities and closely monitored the situation at those facilities, as well as activities involving radioactive sources and nuclear material in Ukraine. The IAEA has also been coordinating offers of help from Member States and has facilitated the provision of equipment, such as personal protection equipment or radiation monitors. To date, 12 Member States have offered assistance. IAEA has been in frequent contact with both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to ensure that it has a clear picture of evolving circumstances at the site. Moreover, the Agency has conducted nine safeguards missions in Ukraine, including at the south Ukraine nuclear power plant and the Chernobyl site., Recalling his recent address at the ongoing tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, he pointed to seven pillars that are critical to ensuring nuclear safety and security, including crucial aspects dealing with physical plant safety and emergency preparedness measures. “All those seven pillars have been compromised if not entirely violated at one point or another during this crisis,” he underscored, noting that the situation at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, has been deteriorating rapidly to the point of alarm. On 5 August, the Zaporizhzhia plant was subject to shelling, resulting in several explosions. Recounting other details, he said there was shelling in the nitrogen-oxygen section of the plant. Although firefighters extinguished the blaze, repairs must be assessed and evaluated. Moreover, it is reported that staff have restricted access to the onsite emergency crisis centre., Voicing concern about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant, he stressed that any military action jeopardizing nuclear safety and security must stop immediately. “Those military actions near such a large nuclear facility could lead to very serious consequences,” he said, expressing grave concern about the situation faced by the Ukrainian operating staff. The Agency continues to monitor the situation and based on the most recent information, IAEA experts’ preliminary assessment indicates there is no immediate threat to nuclear safety as a result of the shelling or other military actions. Noting that the situation could change at any moment, he said “any nuclear catastrophe would be unacceptable and thus preventing it should be our overarching goal”. He asked both sides to cooperate with IAEA and allow for a mission to proceed as soon as possible. As such, IAEA must work with the authorities of both countries to obtain access for its experts, he said., He went on to say that IAEA has received information from both the Russian Federation and Ukraine indicating the state of the facility, its operations, and damage assessments. However, the contents of such statements are frequently contradictory. Without a physical presence, IAEA cannot corroborate some very important facts and provide an independent assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks. Among critical activities, IAEA will be able to assess the physical damage to the facility, determine whether main and backup safety and security systems are functional, and evaluate working conditions of control room staff. Moreover, IAEA needs to perform maintenance on all IAEA safeguards equipment to ensure remote data-collection and the continuity of knowledge, which is indispensable after IAEA’s departure from the facility. Despite the Agency’s readiness to perform such a mission since June, it was not able to due to political factors and other considerations, he said, stressing that: “This is a serious hour, a grave hour and the IAEA must be allowed to conduct its mission in Zaporizhzhia as soon as possible.”, Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said his delegation has repeatedly warned Western colleagues about the Kyiv regime and its criminal attacks on infrastructure, which are pushing the world to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Ukrainian forces have used heavy artillery to shell Zaporizhzhia, including on 5 August, damaging pipelines, when a hydrogen combustion incident took place. Ukraine shelled the plant during a shift change, to intimidate staff — their own citizens. On 6 August, those forces attacked with cluster munitions, including on a radiation monitoring post, and on 7 August, a power surge occurred in equipment feeding the plant. The electricity supply was knocked out, and Ukrainian staff were forced to suspend some operations. Mass strikes severed power lines, and it was particularly “sacrilegious” that attacks were carried out at night when people were sleeping. Ukrainian armed forces have aimed weapons at concrete storage facilities — and if strikes continue, it is only a matter of time before a catastrophe occurs. He noted the Russian Federation sends IAEA bulletins on these incidents., He cited other “criminal actions by the Kyiv regime”, including the use of Polish-made drones, and a 9 March incident when Ukrainian saboteurs blew up a power line to the Chernobyl nuclear facility. He cited propaganda attacks by Western media that the Russian Federation is shelling the plant, which contradict logic — as it is Russian forces that are in charge of it. Noting that the representatives of the United States and France have called for protection of the facility, he wondered when they will call on Ukraine to stop the shelling. The facility has only been protected thanks to selfless work of those personnel. He blamed the Kyiv regime for refusing to sign a trilateral document issued by IAEA, stressing that the Russian Federation is strictly complying with the IAEA Director General’s seven principles. His delegation is convinced that the IAEA mission has not occurred because this would play into the hands of Kyiv and its Western backers, who do not want to see that Zaporizhzhia is functioning normally. It is unacceptable for an IAEA mission to be undertaken while Ukraine is shelling. He called on States supporting the Kyiv regime to “bring their proxies into check” and stop the attacks — the only way to prevent a major radiation catastrophe on the European continent, a threat that has never been more serious., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said the information provided “confirms our worst fears of a growing risk of a potential nuclear incident, with catastrophic consequences for human lives and the environment.” Condemning the militarization of areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as deliberate attacks on the facility’s powerlines and sensitive units, she said these attacks appear to be taking place without regard for the potentially deadly consequences, including accidental emissions of radioactive material. She called for the unconditional withdrawal and removal of all military personnel and equipment, and return of the facility to its accredited personnel. “Under no circumstances should nuclear facilities intended for peaceful purposes be subjected to such attacks,” she stressed, calling for immediate and full respect for the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its 2005 Amendment by all the armed parties. IAEA warnings must galvanize the Council to assist the Agency to mitigate and suppress any such risks. The cessation of military hostilities, anchored on a complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, is the only acceptable pathway to restore peace and security, she said, urging parties to exercise restraint and halt the use of force in all areas of critical infrastructure, including nuclear power plants., BONNIE JENKINS, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security of the United States, voicing concern over the risk of a nuclear incident that would endanger Ukrainians, neighbouring States and the international community, said: “It is especially galling that the Russian Federation’s actions are taking place during the ongoing Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Russian Federation’s behaviour could not more directly undercut the shared interests of States parties in strengthening non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.” She called on the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine’s territory, to cease all military operations at or near Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and to return full control of the Zaporizhzhia facility to Ukraine. Access for IAEA personnel must be facilitated, she insisted, so they can address nuclear safety, security and safeguard concerns at the Zaporizhzhia facility, as well as other facilities around the country in a manner that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty. Moreover, Ukrainian staff at the power plant must be allowed to fulfil their important duties free from pressure of the Russian Federation., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) recalled that the parties are obliged to end any activity that would expose the world to the risk of a nuclear disaster, stressing that the scale of risks involved should be “a wake-up call” for them. She urged the parties to comply with the nuclear security rules to halt all shelling of the sites and to avoid exposing the world to risk of catastrophe. She called on them to cooperate with IAEA to secure the sites, underscoring the urgency of protecting the 174 containers of spent nuclear fuel from any military activity. Parties must also agree on the modalities of an IAEA mission, which she described as “more than urgent”. She urged parties to harness the momentum from the signing of a grain export agreement to engage in negotiations for a ceasefire. She outlined Gabon’s opposition to the war and encouraged all political and diplomatic efforts to achieve an agreement for lasting peace., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) expressed deep alarm over recent events at and near the Zaporizhzhia plant, including reported damage to critical infrastructure, the external power supply system and radiation sensors. “When it comes to nuclear matters, our collective security is truly intertwined,” he remarked. It is crucial that IAEA have full, unimpeded access to the site to assess the damage and ascertain the safety of the facility. He recalled the special protections for nuclear power facilities under international law, including Article 56 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, which makes clear that “works or installations containing dangerous forces” including “nuclear generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack”. The high stakes of nuclear safety and security — and the international community’s manifest concern — should make this a focus of “constructive and necessary” engagement between the parties. He reiterated the need for ongoing dialogue to bring the conflict to a peaceful, sustainable resolution, in line with international law., ODD INGE KVALHEIM (Norway) noted with great distress that Russian forces have violated several of the seven pillars for nuclear safety and security during their military aggression against Ukraine. He strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, recalling that the IAEA Board of Governors in March adopted a resolution deploring its “forcefully” seizing control of nuclear facilities. He called on the Russian Federation to return full control of all Ukrainian nuclear facilities to their Ukrainian operators, stressing that the war has disrupted direct communication lines between them and the Ukrainian regulator. “This is extremely dangerous,” he insisted. Staff operating the facilities are under psychological and physical stress — and at the mercy of an invading force. He voiced concern that the Russian Federation’s occupation of nuclear power plants in Ukraine also means seizing control of central electricity sources for Ukrainian civilians, calling on it to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, and to cease all threats and military actions., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) said all parties concerned have a responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable instruments on nuclear safety and security, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety, Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its amendment. During the ongoing Review Conference of the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty, States parties have been insisting on the need to promote nuclear safety and security, as well as risk reduction, he said, underscoring the urgency of translating those words into action. “The absence of immediate threat does not mean the absence of threat. It only means that the parties still have a chance to avoid a disaster,” he said, calling on all parties to refrain from any measure that could jeopardize the safety and security of the nuclear power plant, as well as its safe operation. He also joined calls for the deployment of an IAEA expert mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant without delay., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the issue of concern in the Council today would not need to be discussed were it not for the Russian Federation’s unjustified, senseless war against Ukraine. He described it as ironic that while the tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is underway, the Council needs to discuss a serious nuclear risk threatening Ukraine, Europe and beyond. He recalled that, until the Russian Federation’s invasion, no nuclear plant had ever been attacked, overrun and reportedly militarized by an invading army. There is countless evidence that Russian forces are conducting their war with untold brutality, and there is wide concern that Russian forces may cause — directly or indirectly — a severe nuclear accident or take other actions that would expose people to ionizing radiation, all while accusing the victims themselves of taking such actions. He pointed to events in Kharkiv and the overrun of Europe’s largest nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, as well as cyberwarfare targeting Ukraine reportedly linked with Russian actors and interests. Stressing that the IAEA must carry out its mission, he said Russian actions constitute a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules, and blatant disregard for international law and norms. The longer the war continues, the greater the likelihood that other nuclear challenges and risks will arise. He reiterated full support for IAEA and its ability to access all facilities in Ukraine. He called on the Russian Federation to stop the war and withdraw all its forces from Ukraine’s entire territory., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) said that, since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, her country has consistently called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. She called on both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue, affirming India's support for all diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. While Member States are discussing the nuclear dimension of the conflict, they need also to be acutely cognizant of its impact on developing countries, particularly, on the supply of food grains, fertilizer and fuel. It is important for all to appreciate the importance of equity, affordability and accessibility when it comes to food grains, she stressed, adding that open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination. In that regard, she welcomed the efforts of the initiative backed by the Secretary-General to open the exports of grains from Ukraine via the Black Sea and the facilitation of the exports of Russian food and fertilizers, noting that those efforts demonstrate that differences can be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya), noting that today’s meeting coincides with the tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, stressed that “we are all alive to the fact that the use of these weapons, whether intentional or accidental can have an apocalyptic effect on humanity.” He voiced deep concern over reports of shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, urging the parties to refrain from any military action that could jeopardize nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. It is essential that IAEA be allowed to send a nuclear safety, security and safeguards mission to the site as soon as possible. He voiced grave concern over the unabated strikes and shelling in various parts of Ukraine, stressing that with no meaningful ceasefire in sight, the war threatens to “usher in a new era of major global wars”. He reiterated the need to shift focus to an immediate cessation and deployment of diplomatic tools, reaffirming respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France) stressed that the presence and actions of Russian Federation armed forces near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant significantly increase the risk of an accident with potentially devastating consequences. That State bears the responsibility for this situation and must return to Ukraine full control of the plant, as well as all nuclear facilities in that country. Moreover, he Ukrainian personnel who operate the plant must be able to perform their duties without threat or pressure. The Russian Federation’s control of Ukrainian nuclear facilities is a danger for the Ukrainian people, and beyond that for the region and the entire international community. She stressed that the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security defined by the Director General of the IAEA must be respected, and the Agency’s ability to monitor Ukraine’s peaceful nuclear activities to ensure compliance with safeguards must also be restored. She emphasized the importance of facilitating a mission of IAEA experts to the Zaporizhzhia facility, with full respect for the sovereignty of Ukraine over its territory and infrastructure. Beyond that, IAEA personnel must be able to access all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities safely and without hindrance, communicating directly, without interference, with the Ukrainian personnel responsible for their operation. The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine and stop its dangerous headlong rush, she stressed., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said that, in line with the 2009 IAEA General Conference: any attack or threat against nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Agency's Statute. The situation prevailing in Zaporizhzhia in recent days is part of a deplorable pattern of attacks on civilian infrastructure, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to respect the obligation not to attack civilian objects and this includes not carrying out indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks. International law, international humanitarian law and nuclear security conventions must be respected without exception. He echoed the Secretary-General's call for IAEA to be allowed to inspect the Zaporizhzhia plant and urged that no obstacles or conditions be imposed. Such a mission will be able to provide us with objective, accurate and independent information on the conditions prevailing at the plant which are urgent to understand, he said., CÁIT MORAN (Ireland) voiced deep concern over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the strong risk of a radiological accident or incident arising from military activity at the site, which would have serious consequences for the people of Ukraine and the wider region. The issues at Zaporizhzhia arise from the Russian Federation’s unjust and unprovoked war against Ukraine, whose reckless actions have demonstrated utter disregard for nuclear safety and security — and raise real fears of a significant radiological, chemical or biological accident in Ukraine. She called on the Russian Federation — and all States — to commit to the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security. Noting that the tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is under way, she urged Moscow not to violate such essential multilateral instruments upon which collective security depends. Explaining that the Russian Federation seeks to avoid responsibility and distract from what is happening as a result of its war, she urged Moscow to stop using the Council to advance its disinformation campaign. If it is truly concerned about Zaporizhzhia, the Russian Federation should end its illegal occupation of the site and withdraw its troops so that Ukraine, with IAEA, can uphold the obligations for safety and security at the site., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) said his delegation is deeply concerned about the impact of the Russian Federation’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, recalling that the Council discussed its reckless actions at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, including at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, at the start of the invasion. He pointed to the 3 March resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors calling on the Russian Federation to cease all actions against and at all nuclear facilities in Ukraine, stressing that Ukraine’s competent authorities and IAEA inspectors are still being prevented from carrying out their essential duties at Zaporizhzhia, which is under the Russian Federation’s control. Stressing that the Russian Federation’s actions have violated almost all seven pillars of nuclear safety and security and that, despite its lies and obfuscation to the Council, he said it is the Russian Federation’s military presence that is placing the plant at risk. He reiterated the call for IAEA inspectors to be allowed access to all nuclear facilities in Ukraine to address nuclear safety, security and safeguard concerns, in a manner that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty over its territory and infrastructure., ZHANG JUN (China), Security Council President for August, speaking in his national capacity, expressed concern over the attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant, but noted IAEA reported it did not pose an immediate threat to nuclear safety. The radiation level remains normal, but the physical integrity and power supply of the plant were damaged, sounding a nuclear alarm to the international community. The safety of such facilities must not be subjected to trial and error, he stressed. A large-scale incident at the Zaporizhzhia plant — the largest in Europe — would have consequences more devastating than the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster, which leaked radioactive materials and radiated water, with severe consequences for the marine environment. He called on all parties to exercise restraint and act with caution, noting that Mr. Grossi has been planning to visit Zaporizhzhia, and Secretary-General António Guterres has issued an appeal for that purpose. He cited a message from Ukraine to Mr. Grossi and the Secretary-General on 9 August underscoring the necessity of that visit. Expressing hope that any obstacles can be cleared to facilitate that mission without impediment, he noted the Ukraine crisis has been dragging on for over 5 months — and that misjudgement and accidents can only be avoided by defusing the situation and restoring peace. He urged the parties to resume negotiations as soon as possible, addressing their mutual security concerns, and called on the international community to act responsibly, stepping up political and diplomatic efforts., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor for a second time, said his Western colleagues once again “refuse to call a spade a spade” — a surreal display of faulty logic, but no surprise. He cited a “war of lies” against his country, executed in a coordinated fashion to blame the Russian Federation for everything, while any blame of Ukraine is refuted — as with incidents in Bucha and Kramatorsk. He asked why references to the Kramatorsk incident have disappeared from the international radar — asserting this was because it involved a Ukrainian Grad rocket with a Ukrainian serial number, which cannot be refuted. Ukraine is using the civilian population as human shields, and deploying heavy artillery in hospitals, schools and kindergartens. He advised Amnesty International to “either say something good, or nothing at all”. Kyiv has carte blanche to commit any crimes, while Member States demonstrate an inability to take responsibility if it does not jibe with their narrow mercantile interests. It is absurd to hear such irresponsibility from grown-up people in the Council, he stated — urging the irrational European political elite to return to common sense and calling on Council colleagues to force the Kyiv regime to stop its strikes on Zaporizhzhia, which is holding Europe hostage. “The responsibility lies with you, ladies and gentlemen,” he stressed., Noting the Secretary-General has called for the Zaporizhzhia facility to be demilitarized, he asserted that the Russian Federation is not using nuclear facility for that purpose — Ukraine is. Russian Federation forces ensure its protection, repelling Ukrainian attacks day after day and averting a nuclear catastrophe. “We know what the Kyiv regime is capable of, and the world has witnessed that, as well,” he stated. Calling for the withdrawal of Russian Federation troops would expose the plant to Ukrainian and nationalist forces to use it for their most monstrous provocations., Ms. JENKINS (United States) appealed to the Russian Federation to return control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukraine, noting that once this is done, the world will see how quickly peace returns to the facility., Mr. KARIUKI (United Kingdom) said incidents at the nuclear facility have occurred precisely because the Russian Federation has carried out an unjust invasion of Ukraine., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said the withdrawal of Russian troops and the return of the station to the legitimate control of Ukraine is the only way to remove the nuclear threat at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Expressing appreciation for IAEA’s efforts to ensure safety and security of Ukrainian nuclear facilities, he said that his country has been in close consultation with IAEA, has insisted on the need to send a mission to the site and has negotiated modalities with the Agency. “Despite their public declarations, the occupiers have resorted to manipulations and unjustified conditions for the site visit,” he said. Ukraine stands ready to provide the mission with all the requisite assistance and facilitate its travel through Ukrainian-controlled territory. Given the continued militarization of the Zaporizhzhia site by the Russian armed forces, its shelling and subsequent damage of the site, such a mission must include qualified experts in military aspects. Their expertise can contribute significantly to the preparation of the mission’s final report, outlining the military dimensions of the critical threats and challenges, as well as nuclear safety, security and safeguards at the Zaporizhzhia plant., He went on to say that the Russian Federation’s plans with respect to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to disconnect Ukraine’s energy system and cut off electricity in the south of the country. He urged the Russian Federation to fully implement the resolution adopted by the IAEA Board of Governors on 3 March regarding the safety, security and safeguards implications in Ukraine, cease all actions against nuclear facilities in the country and return control to Ukraine. The international community must exert political pressure on the Russian Federation and demand the same. Moreover, the Russian Federation must allow the IAEA mission to proceed, demine the facilities of the Zaporizhzhia plant and remove Russian military personnel and withdraw their weaponry., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), on the topic of an IAEA mission, referred to his earlier statement, noting that the Kyiv regime is the only delegation present today that said it was the Russian Federation which shelled the station they controlled in Energodar., Mr. GROSSI thanked all Council members for their interventions, which he said are important for enhancing the Agency’s understanding. “We recognize the obvious differences that exist,” he observed. At the same time, a common denominator emerged from today’s meeting: everyone agrees that nuclear safety and security must be ensured, everyone supports the seven pillars and believes that an IAEA mission must take place. “It is no longer a matter of if, but a matter of when,” he said, noting that “the how” must be addressed. He said he will intensify his consultations with Ukraine, Russian Federation and the United Nations, through the Department of Safety and Security, to conduct a mission — “which is so badly needed” — after which he would be able to brief on the visit to “support Ukraine in this important hour” and restore complete safety and security around all facilities in the country., For information media.

Ukraine: UN experts sound alarm on situation of children with disabilities,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,11 Aug 2022,"GENEVA (11 August 2022) – UN human rights experts today expressed concern about the situation of children with disabilities in Ukraine placed in institutions and being displaced to other institutional settings either within Ukraine or further afield., “The current humanitarian crisis stemming from the Russian invasion last February has placed Ukraine in an existential crisis. We deeply appreciate the predicament of Ukraine. Like all conflicts, it is having a disproportionate impact on persons with disabilities especially children with disabilities placed in institutions,” the UN experts said., “The terrible tragedy of war highlights historic policy choices made in the past that badly affect children with disabilities. Ukraine faces the daunting task of reinventing many of its social and economic systems when this war is finally brought to an end,” the UN experts said. “It is our earnest hope that Ukraine will commit itself to a better future for persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities. For our part, we stand ready to provide our advice, solidarity and support to Ukraine on this matter”, the experts said., The experts highlighted three particular sets of concerns., Firstly, it was reported that thousands of children with disabilities have been sent back to their families and communities of origin but without appropriate assessment to determine the best interests of the child and child protection considerations, which may have left some of them with untreated physical and mental health conditions. This may have led to children with disabilities being sent to situations of potential risk and abuse and possibly ending up on the streets or in the hands of traffickers or abusers. “We fully understand the exigencies of war and the immediacy of the hard choices to be made. But this is not a situation that can be allowed indefinitely,” the experts said., Secondly, for those children with disabilities who have remained in institutions, there are allegations of displacement from one institution to another within the country to the detriment of their health and well-being. To the known problems of neglect, abuse, physical restrictions, denial of appropriate stimulation and, access to basic services including education and healthcare in institutional settings, is now added lack of information regarding their whereabouts for their families with few efforts to restore linkages between displaced children and their relatives., “Cross institutionalisation cannot be a strategy for the future”, the experts said., Thirdly, Ukraine has seemingly required third countries to receive children with disabilities on condition that they would be placed in institutions, even when those countries have successfully moved away from institutionalisation as a policy response for their own citizens., “Third countries have a heavy responsibility to assist Ukraine imagine a better future for its citizens with disabilities which include its children,” they said., The experts further expressed the hope that those who fund reconstruction and future development will decline to invest in institutions and instead assist Ukraine to build community support that will enable children with disabilities to flourish with their families and in family-like situations., “We strongly reiterate our many previous calls on the Russian Federation to immediately end its aggression against Ukraine and pledge our assistance to assist Ukraine build a better future for its citizens with disabilities,” the experts said., ENDS, The experts: Gerard Quinn, Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; Siobhán Mullally, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children; Mama Fatima Singhateh,Special Rapporteur on sale and sexual exploitation of children; Cecilia Jimenez-Damary**, **Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons; Tlaleng Mofokeng, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health., The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

Recovery and Reconstruction",11 Aug 2022,"Key updates, According to WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care, there have been 445 attacks on health care, resulting in 105 injuries and 86 deaths, reported between 24 February and 11 August.

Ukrainian village torn apart by war begins long process of rebuilding,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items",11 Aug 2022,"After deadly attacks left much of rural Nalyvaikivka in ruins, UNHCR is helping local families with temporary housing and construction materials as they look to rebuild., By Victoria Andrievska and Saorlaith Ni Bhroin in Kyiv | 11 August 2022, In the quiet rural village of Nalyvaikivka on the outskirts of Kyiv, locals are sifting through the debris of their destroyed homes, hoping to salvage whatever they can. Others gather at garden gates, offering words of support and condolence, trying to come to terms with the loss and destruction of recent weeks. This is the new reality for the close-knit community of Nalyvaikivka. Its main street used to be a hive of activity, a place where locals shared what little they had, and neighbours chatted over garden fences., But on 4 March, the village was awoken by the shrill sound of air raid sirens and shelling overhead. Frantically grabbing a few essentials such as winter coats and gloves, residents ran for their lives to shelter in nearby bunkers., One local family, Yurii, Oksana and daughter Svitlana, fled to their cellar – a cold room used to store homemade jams and marinated vegetables. “As the door of the cellar was closing above our heads, I heard the sound of glass shattering,” says Oksana. When the family emerged from the cellar, they found that their home had been hit., Fearful for their safety, the family fled to a nearby town to stay with friends, only returning some weeks later. “We came back when the troops withdrew from the area and the shelling ended. The whole street was grey from the ashes of burnt buildings. Our yard was full of rubble, slate, window frames, glass. We spent many days trying to clean up, moving very carefully as we didn’t know if there were any unexploded ammunition or other dangerous things in our yard.”, Seeking safety further afield, their 24-year-old daughter Svitlana joined a friend in Slovakia, but returned a month later. “I just couldn’t stay there knowing that my mum and dad had to go through this hell.” Her brother, 31-year-old Oleksandr who lives in Kyiv, is also playing his part, helping the family clear the rubble. The family’s small dog, Bonita, sits and stares at the place where their home once stood., “All my life is invested in this house.”, Oksana, a 51-year-old nurse, spent years building her now destroyed house from scratch, with help from her brother, so her children Svitlana and Oleksandr, would have a safe and warm place to call home. “We never had much money to start and to finish the build in one go,” she says., When Yurii, a 60-year-old construction worker, came into her life four years ago, the pace of the build picked up considerably and together they completed their dream home., “It was built with love and attention to every little detail,” Oksana explains. “This house was like another child for us, we invested so much care and love into it. All my life is invested in this house.”, Many of the villagers have lost everything. Weeks of deadly shelling and missile attacks resulted in the damage and destruction of more than 220 houses, 30 of which were completely destroyed, including seven on Oksana’s street alone. “This was a friendly neighbourhood and now it is a street of horrors,” she says as she surveys the destruction around her., In July, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, met with the family to extend his solidarity to them and their community, and to commend them for their resilience and strength., With millions of Ukrainians reeling from the impact of war and facing the approach of a bitterly cold winter, UNHCR, with the generous support from its donors, is working to ensure people affected by the conflict have a dignified and safe place to stay. Displaced people will receive cash and legal assistance. Housing – including residential centres and homes – will be repaired, and items like blankets, mattresses and lamps will be provided to those in need. But the humanitarian situation continues to worsen, with an estimated 15.7 million Ukrainians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs)., Aside from the trauma of losing their homes, the villagers of Nalyvaikivka are also coming to terms with the loss of people they had known all their lives. Oksana looks over the garden fence at a destroyed house. “Our two neighbours didn’t survive. The son died during the shelling, and his mother died afterwards in hospital.”, Behind the rubble of their former home, next to a field of burnt orange poppies, stands a temporary housing unit where the family currently lives. “In May, we received a temporary house from UNHCR,” explains Oksana standing in the small kitchen. To make the unit feel more like a home, UNHCR also provided mattresses, bed linen, solar lamps and items like soap and towels., Despite all that has happened, the family has not given up. Yurii has already started to rebuild their beloved home, brick-by-brick. A neat pile of construction materials he salvaged from the rubble stands as a symbol of his determination, and UNHCR will provide additional materials to help., Oksana, an avid gardener, stands between a charred cherry tree and her flowers. Using the damaged bricks of her home, she has created new flower beds. “At least I can give new life to the bits and pieces of my ruined house.”, But while the villagers are already busy rebuilding, the terrible loss inflicted on this small rural community has left its mark and residents continue to grieve for those who did not survive. For Oksana, night time is particularly difficult. She struggles with nightmares and her mind and heart race when she thinks back to what has happened., “At my workplace, everybody tells me that I am lucky to have survived. And I say ‘yes, I am alive, but my soul is dead’. My home was like my child. I really want to rebuild it, but I’m not sure if I have enough strength.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-village-torn-apart-war-begins-long-process-rebuilding
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (30 July - 5 August 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,11 Aug 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, while fighting also intensified along the Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Protests against LGBT+ events were recorded in the United Kingdom, while farmers protested across the region., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Ukrainian forces claimed minor territorial gains around the Izium district of the Kharkiv region, but lost control of several settlements in the Bakhmut district of the Donetsk region. Russia also began transferring more troops from the Donetsk region to the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions in response to recent successful Ukrainian counteroffensive operations in the area (ISW, 4 August 2022). Meanwhile, Russian forces used their bases around the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar to launch attacks on Ukrainian forces in the surrounding areas (Bloomberg, 6 August 2022; ISW, 3 August 2022)., Russian forces also continued to shell and launch airstrikes at civilian infrastructure last week, killing over 20 civilians in the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Sumy regions.1 Abductions of civilians from occupied territories also continued, with Russian forces abducting a government official and a school director in the Kherson region last week. Following a successful Ukrainian strike in the Brylivka area in the Kherson region, Russian forces also reportedly forced civilians living close to a local railway station to relocate. Ukrainian sources claim that the displacement of these civilians was likely related to concerns that they would inform Ukrainian forces of the movement of Russian military equipment (Center for Strategic Communications, 5 August 2022; 24 Channel, 3 August 2022)., Additionally, following an explosion at a prison in occupied Olenivka a week prior, activists held protests in several cities across Ukraine to demand increased international support and protection of the rights of Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia. Rallies in support of Ukraine and against the war were held in Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, Germany, Poland, Portugal, and the United Kingdom., Along the Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, clashes intensified last week, particularly in the Lachin (Kashatagh), Shusha, and Martakert regions. The escalation in fighting coincided with an Azerbaijani operation in response to the killing of an Azerbaijani serviceman in the Lachin region on 3 August. During the operation, Azerbaijani forces occupied strategically important heights in the Lachin and Shusha regions, killing two Armenian servicemen and wounding 19 others. The escalation could also be attributed to Azerbaijan’s attempts to pressure **Armenia **into handing over the ‘Lachin Corridor,’ which connects Armenia to Artsakh and is currently guarded by a Russian peacekeeping contingent. According to the 2020 ceasefire agreement, Armenia has until November 2023 to construct a new route to Artsakh and to hand over Lachin to Azerbaijan. However, in recent weeks, Azerbaijani authorities have demanded that the handover occur sooner (OC-Media, 5 August 2022). Last week, Artsakh authorities advised residents of Berdzor, Aghavno, and Sus along the ‘Lachin Corridor’ to leave their homes as this territory will be transferred to Azerbaijan’s control on 25 August (Caucasian Knot, 5 August 2022). Meanwhile, an alternative route connecting Armenia and Artsakh will be under construction until the spring of 2023 (OC-Media, 5 August 2022). The escalation along the Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact contributed to the 342% increase in violence in Azerbaijan and Artsakh last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month., Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, protesters gathered across England demanding the cancellation of the children’s events organized within the framework of the Drag Queen Story Hour tour of libraries last week. Protesters also gathered in Belfast, Northern Ireland, against a family storytime event hosted by a drag queen and an LGBT+ Pride parade as a part of the city’s LGBT+ Pride Weekend celebrations. Meanwhile, LGBT+ Pride parades took place in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland., In the Netherlands, farmers continued their protest last week against the government’s plans to cut nitrogen emissions. However, the number of protest events remained low for the second week in a row, and in the run-up to the first round of negotiations between farmers’ organizations and the government on 5 August (DutchNews, 5 August 2022). Farmers also demonstrated in Flemish Belgium against the Flemish government’s plans to cut nitrogen emissions in the agricultural sector. Elsewhere, protests related to farmers’ working conditions were also reported in Austria, France, Italy, and Spain last week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-30-july-5-august-2022

It had earlier said that shelling on Friday damaged the plant’s external power supply system. In addition to the restored back-up line to the thermal power plant, the ZNPP has one operational power line connecting it to the grid out of a total of four such lines., The need for secure off-site power supply from the grid is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., Ukraine also informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, three at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-90-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-10-august-2022

The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its troops from within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and respect Ukraine’s territory and sovereignty., In that context, we demand that Russia immediately hand back full control to its rightful sovereign owner, Ukraine, of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant as well as of all nuclear facilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders to ensure their safe and secure operations. Ukrainian staff operating the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant must be able to carry out their duties without threats or pressure. It is Russia’s continued control of the plant that endangers the region., We remain profoundly concerned by the serious threat that the seizure of Ukrainian nuclear facilities and other actions by Russian armed forces pose to the safety and security of these facilities, significantly raising the risk of a nuclear accident or incident and endangering the population of Ukraine, neighboring states and the international community. It also undermines the IAEA’s ability to monitor Ukraine’s peaceful nuclear activities for safeguarding purposes., We welcome and support IAEA Director General Grossi’s efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security in Ukraine and we thank the Director General and the IAEA staff for their steadfast commitment in this regard. Against this background, we underline the importance of facilitating a mission of IAEA experts to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant to address nuclear safety, security and safeguard concerns, in a manner that respects full Ukrainian sovereignty over its territory and infrastructure. We strongly endorse the importance of the Seven Pillars of Nuclear Safety and Security as outlined by Director General Grossi., We reiterate our full and continued support for the IAEA.

The Ukraine War and Food Security: Consequences for Norway’s Partner Countries,Analysis,NUPI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",10 Aug 2022,"Stein Sundstøl Eriksen, Summary:, The war in Ukraine is causing disruptions in global food supplies, with grave consequences\ for many developing countries. Both Ukraine and Russia are significant food exporters and major producers of fertiliser ingredients. However, the effects of the war will vary significantly between different countries. Some countries rely on supplies from Russia and Ukraine. Others are less dependent on food imports but depend on Russian and Ukrainian import of fertilisers. Yet others will mainly be affected by general global price increases, especially in the long-term perspective (within the next three years)., However, most of Norway's partner countries are largely self-reliant in food. For them, the main problems caused by the war are the following:\ - Increased prices for fertilizers\ - Higher energy prices and higher interest rates\ - Increased risk of political instability and conflict\ - Cuts in aid, In this situation, Norway should do the following:\ - Avoid cuts in aid to partner countries to fund support to Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees\ - Increase food support to countries most affected by drought and conflict\ - Support partner countries' supply of fertilisers\ - Consider debt relief to countries negatively affected by price increases on energy and higher interest rates., Research for this report was funded by NORAD.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-and-food-security-consequences-norways-partner-countries
Olena Zelenska and UNICEF continue to partner to protect children in Ukraine and their access to learning during the war,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",2 Aug 2022,"The First Lady of Ukraine has teamed up with UNICEF to help protect children’s rights and improve education as the war continues., The First Lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Office in Ukraine, extending an already fruitful partnership to further protect children’s rights, improve education and provide mental health support for those affected by war., Prior to the war, UNICEF had already worked with Olena Zelenska on a project she initiated to reform school meals. Now, they will join forces to protect children and young people, particularly vulnerable groups, from all over Ukraine, as the violence continues to turn lives upside down., “One of the most important directions of our work is informing people,” says Olena Zelenska. “We have to keep telling the world how the war steals childhood from our children. The world should hear about this every day and not forget,” highlighted Ms Zelenska, The Memorandum between UNICEF and the Spouse of the President identifies several core areas of cooperation. This includes access and quality of education in schools and kindergartens; implementing a National Program for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support to immediately address the trauma of war; creating a barrier-free environment for children; and building social inclusion., One of key elements of the cooperation will be the Back to Learning Together Initiative, which UNICEF launches together with the Ministry of Education and other government agencies under auspices of the First Lady ahead of the school year., The campaign will include several components, such as safety of learning spaces, in particular through setup of shelters and arranging activities as well as the guidelines for teachers and mine risk education. The campaign will also cover psychosocial support and engagement of youth and their development.., “We are committed to continue this important partnership between UNICEF and the First Lady. The war in Ukraine – and the destruction wrought on the education system – is having a dramatic impact on the lives of 5.7 million school-aged children. Together with Ms. Zelenska we continue our collaboration in protection of the rights of every child and creating opportunities for their continuous learning in these difficult times. Education is a right and one of the most important investments to provide normalcy, safety for children. Ukrainian children in the country and abroad need safe access to education, mental health support to heal, space and opportunities to connect with their peers and help to catch up with lost learning,” said Mr Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine., The campaign will focus on training of teachers and school psychologists to strengthen psychosocial support of school children. It will also work to recruit young volunteers in communities and update the approach to online learning so that levels of social interaction and engagement of children are increased. It is important that the community supports children and creates opportunities for education, communication, and socialization in safe conditions. Communities and local authorities will play a key role in supporting children and creating opportunities for their education, communication and social interactions in safe conditions., The Back to Learning Together Initiative aims to restore access of Ukrainian children to education and improve their physical health, nutrition, and social-emotional development. This is important for everyone: for parents, children, teachers and school administration., The learning process also helps children maintain mental, physical and psychosocial wellbeing. During the new academic year, adults together with children have the opportunity to choose the modality: online, offline or blended learning. However, access to education should be a priority for every chіld., Media contacts, Nina Sorokopud

$89 Million in New U.S. Humanitarian Demining Assistance for Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. USA,"Contributions
Mine Action",9 Aug 2022,"On August 9 the Department announced its intention to provide $89 million of FY 2022 funding to help the Government of Ukraine address the urgent humanitarian challenges posed by explosive remnants of war created by Russia’s brutal war of aggression., Russia’s unlawful and unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine has littered massive swaths of the country with landmines, unexploded ordnance, and improvised explosive devices. The grotesque use of improvised explosive devices in the manner that we are seeing in Ukraine by Russian actors was previously only associated with ISIS in Syria. These explosive hazards block access to fertile farmland, delay reconstruction efforts, prevent displaced communities from returning to their homes, and continue to kill and maim innocent Ukrainian civilians. The Government of Ukraine estimates that 160,000 square kilometers of its land may be contaminated – this is roughly the size of Virginia, Maryland, and Connecticut combined., U.S. funding will deploy approximately 100 demining teams and will support a large-scale train and equip project to strengthen the Government of Ukraine’s demining and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) capacity., Since 1993, the United States has invested more than $4.2 billion for the safe clearance of landmines and explosive weapons of war (ERW) as well as the securing and safe disposal of excess small arms and light weapons (SA/LW) and munitions in more than 100 countries and territories.

Update 89 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (9 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Aug 2022,"Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that a shelling incident on Saturday near the dry spent fuel storage facility at the country’s Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) caused some damage, but that available radiation measurements continued to show normal levels at the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., According to Ukraine, Saturday’s event – which occurred a day after previous shelling damaged the plant’s external power supply system – injured a Ukrainian security guard at the ZNPP. It also damaged walls, a roof and windows in the area of the spent fuel storage facility, as well as communication cables that are part of its radiation control system, with a possible impact on the functioning of three radiation detection sensors, Ukraine told the IAEA. But there was no visible damage to the containers with spent nuclear fuel or to the protective perimeter of the facility., Based on the information provided by Ukraine, IAEA experts assessed that there was no immediate threat to nuclear safety as a result of Saturday’s incident, Director General Grossi said., However, the shelling on Friday and Saturday at the ZNPP breached virtually all the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict, including those related to a nuclear power plant’s physical integrity, functioning safety and security systems, staff and external power supplies., Saturday evening’s incident showed how the conflict had also compromised nuclear safety and security pillars related to Emergency Preparedness and Response arrangements as well as communications, Director General Grossi said. Ukraine informed the IAEA after the incident that plant staff had restricted access to the ZNPP’s on-site crisis centre, potentially impacting response activities in case of an emergency even if access to an off-site centre remained possible. In addition, the Ukrainian regulator said its communications with ZNPP were “very limited and fragmentary”., The Ukrainian regulator also informed the Agency that the plant continues to have limited availability of off-site power., Director General Grossi reiterated his grave concern about the situation at the ZNPP and that any military action jeopardizing nuclear safety and security must stop. He again stressed the need for an IAEA expert mission to go to the plant as soon as possible to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation., The IAEA is in close contact with the Ukrainian authorities and continues to monitor the nuclear safety and security situation, he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-89-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-9-august-2022

New UNICEF games app nurtures key skills for Ukrainian preschoolers [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Education,8 Aug 2022,"A new mobile application developed by online kindergarten NUMO contains games and stories for children aged 3–6., A new mobile application for preschoolers in Ukraine, offering interactive games aimed at developing skills such as logic and creativity, has been launched by UNICEF., The war in Ukraine had a devastating effect on access to education, especially preschool education. The application is part of a bigger project NUMO which idea is to help parents engage their children in educational and developmental activities thus keeping education accessible, and providing children with a sense of normality during the war., *""Around two-thirds of children are now displaced either within Ukraine or in neighbouring countries. This means that as well as the trauma and suffering related to the war, young children have limited access to preschool education and early learning opportunities and can lose out on essential foundations for lifelong learning. NUMO provides a unique opportunity for continued learning and play and is a great example of cross-country collaboration and innovation to reach young children with joyful and playful experiences. We hope many Ukraine children will enjoy the quality interactive games with the help and in the company of adults. NUMO is an excellent example of UNICEF's use of digital innovations to reach children and their parents in this response.

To help those struggling with connectivity, the NUMO app is available for offline use after being installed on a mobile device and the completion of a short registration form., The app will help children to learn independently, use their leisure time effectively, engage in cognitive activities, develop key skills and take their minds off the war., The app was created by UNICEF Ukraine, together with UNICEF Montenegro, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education of Montenegro and the SoftServe company., Media contacts

The United States Contributes $4.5 Billion to Support the Government of Ukraine,News and Press Release,USAID,Contributions,8 Aug 2022,"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is providing an additional $4.5 billion in direct budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine to help alleviate the acute budget deficit caused by Putin’s brutal war of aggression. The Government of Ukraine will receive the funding in tranches, beginning with a $3 billion disbursement in August. This contribution was made possible with generous bipartisan support from Congress., These funds provided by the United States, through the World Bank, allow the Government of Ukraine to maintain essential functions to its people, including social and financial assistance to Ukrainians further pushed into poverty since the start of the war, children with disabilities, and internally displaced persons., Once these additional funds are fully disbursed, the U.S. government will have provided $8.5 billion in direct budgetary support to the Government of Ukraine. The resources provided today build on previous budget support, enabling the Ukrainian government to carry out core functions – for example, keeping gas and electricity flowing to hospitals, schools, and other critical infrastructure, supporting the provision of humanitarian supplies to citizens, and continuing to pay the salaries of civil servants, healthcare workers and teachers. Robust safeguards put in place by the World Bank, coupled with USAID-funded, expert third-party oversight embedded within the Ukrainian government, ensure accountability and transparency in the use of these funds., Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, USAID has been coordinating with humanitarian partners in the country and region to provide Ukrainians with lifesaving humanitarian assistance while also ramping up critical development assistance to respond to cyber-attacks and threats to the energy sector, countering disinformation, supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector, documenting human rights violations, meeting essential health needs, and ensuring the continued functioning of local, regional, and national government levels., The United States remains committed to supporting Ukraine and its people in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-contributes-45-billion-support-government-ukraine

EU support bolsters WFP’s response in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WFP,"Food and Nutrition
Recovery and Reconstruction",8 Aug 2022,"European Union backing continues to ensure the World Food Programme delivers critical humanitarian support for people affected by the ongoing conflict, At a distribution point in Irpin, in the Ukrainian oblast (administrative region) of Kyiv, which saw heavy fighting earlier this year, people whose lives have been turned upside down by the war receive regular food parcels to last them 30 days., Among those collecting the packs is Valentyna Lakomska. She fled her home with her 2-year-old son and currently has no source of income., “I never thought that I’d need to flee at 30 years old,” she says. “There is no work. If there is some, then wages are minimal, prices are crazy. We need food rations. We need the world’s support, both moral and financial.”, Packs typically contain rice, pasta, canned meat and vegetable oil. In Kyiv oblast and across other provinces, they are provided to people including those who lost their homes or jobs during the war; pensioners, people with disabilities and pregnant and breastfeeding women., Valentyna is among 7 million people currently displaced inside Ukraine, while across Europe there are 6 million Ukrainian refugees. Some families have also remained in areas affected by fighting, being unable to move. In many cases, they have lost their jobs and livelihoods., Liliia collected her food box from the World Food Programme (WFP) the day she celebrated her 41st birthday, in Druzhkivka, Donetsk oblast, only 30 to 40 kilometres from the front line. She lives with her mother, husband and her children., “We have saved our entire lives to afford a home in this city,” she says. “We cannot move and leave everything behind. “I was the manager of a grocery store, but my employer left the town because it’s too difficult to bring food into the region, and customers have become rarer.”, As her husband has also lost his income, the food back is a very welcome., Thanks to support from donors, WFP has been able to scale up its emergency assistance rapidly since March, reaching 2.6 million people in June. WFP uses a flexible mix of food and cash to support people wherever they are, including in areas close to the front line., While cash is prioritized where banks are accessible and markets are functioning, WFP continues to deliver food boxes where they are needed, as well as ready-to-eat rations in places where cooking gas supplies were damaged or destroyed. WFP also works with bakeries to deliver bread, in this way supporting the local economy., The EU, through ECHO (its Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations) contributed €43 million (US$43.8m) to WFP, supporting food and cash-based assistance across Ukraine as well as in neighbouring Moldova, which is currently hosting around 86,000 Ukrainian refugees. , To date, WFP has distributed over US$200 million in cash to displaced families across Ukraine. Cash assistance empowers recipients to make their own choices to meet their essential needs. People receive their cash within 72 hours of registering. Funding from donors like the EU has been vital in a country where war has left almost one in three households food-insecure., “We have a clear mission here to support those families in greatest need with cash and food, in particular in hard-to-reach, frontline areas such as Donetsk, where people are most affected by the war and where food supply chains are often cut. The contributions we received from the European Union allow us to do just that,” says Matthew Hollingworth, WFP’s Emergency Coordinator in Ukraine., “At the same time, we work through existing networks and supply chains so we can support and help to sustain, stabilize and, in some cases, restore systems that need to be functioning once WFP is no longer needed here.”, Read more about WFP's response in Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-support-bolsters-wfps-response-ukraine
"Attacking a nuclear plant ‘suicidal,’ UN chief tells journalists in Japan",News and Press Release,UN News,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",8 Aug 2022,"UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned a recent attack on a nuclear power station in southern Ukraine during a meeting in Tokyo on Monday with the Japan National Press Club., “Any attack to nuclear plants is…suicidal,” the UN chief said, adding that he hoped that the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be able to access the plant for inspection., Both Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility for the strike on the Zaporizhzhia plant over the weekend., While Europe's largest nuclear power site has been under Russian control since the early days of the war, Ukrainian technicians are still running it., Nuclear disaster: ‘Real risk’, Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator, said that Russian shelling damaged three radiation monitors around the storage facility for spent nuclear fuels, in which one worker was injured., The shelling prompted IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi to warn that the way in which Zaporizhzhia was being run coupled with the fighting around it posed “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”., Since then, a preliminary assessment by UN atomic overseer experts found that the safety and security situation seemed stable with no immediate threat, despite that several pillars were breached., “We support the IAEA on their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilization of that plant,” said the UN chief, adding his hope that the IAEA would be able to access the plant., Ukraine-Russia peace deal, When asked why a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine had not yet been realized, the UN chief said they had been working very closely with Türkiye, which had “launched a new initiative in relation to a possible start of peace negotiations”., But he explained that Ukraine cannot accept that “its territory is taken by another country”, and that Russia “does not seem ready to accept” that areas it had taken “will not be annexed by the Russian Federation or give way to new independent States”., Backwards world, Mr. Guterres’ comments followed a visit to Hiroshima over the weekend, where the Secretary-General marked the 77th anniversary of the world's first nuclear attack on 6 August 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people., Amidst Russian threats of a nuclear attack since it invaded Ukraine in February, fears of a third atomic bombing have grown., During Monday’s news conference, the UN chief reiterated his warning over the use of nuclear weapons, saying that if used, the UN would probably be unable respond because “we might all not be here anymore”., Against the backdrop that the world currently has 13,000 nuclear bombs while continuing to make huge investments into modernizing atomic arsenals, Mr. Guterres warned that after decades of nuclear disarmament efforts, we are “moving backwards”., “Stop it,” he appealed, underscoring that the billions of dollars being leveraged into the arms race need to be used in “fighting climate change, fighting poverty, [and] addressing the needs of the international community”., The Secretary-General will next be traveling to Mongolia and South Korea to discuss ways to address North Korea’s nuclear development., ‘Common sense’ restraint, When asked about China's massive military exercises around Taiwan, Mr. Guterres said the UN “abides by a resolution of the General Assembly, the so-called One China policy”., The dispute was sparked by a visit last week to island by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi., “We all want that resolution to correspond to a peaceful environment,” he said, calling for common sense and restraint to allow for an “extremely important” de-escalation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/attacking-nuclear-plant-suicidal-un-chief-tells-journalists-japan

Nearly US$4.3 billion required to respond to worsening humanitarian crisis in Ukraine [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OCHA,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Aug 2022,"Intense hostilities since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February have left at least 17.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, an increase of around 2 million people compared to April (Kyiv, 8 August 2022) The Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, has today called on the international community to continue its support for life-saving operations in Ukraine, as the war continues to drive an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the country. The call comes as the United Nations and humanitarian organizations in the country revised the Humanitarian Flash Appeal to respond to the worsening situation. The financial request increased from US$2.25 billion to $4.3 billion to make sure aid workers in the country have the funding and resources necessary to continue delivering critical assistance and protection services to people across Ukraine until December 2022., “Over the last five months, we have seen how local, national and international humanitarian organizations have joined efforts across Ukraine to increase the scale and scope of operations and provide assistance to more than 11 million people. The reality is that more people need support,” said Denise Brown, explaining that at least 17.7 million people—over a quarter of Ukraine’s population—will need humanitarian aid in the months ahead. “This is an increase of about 2 million more than what we had estimated during the last revision of the Flash Appeal, in April. And we fear it can even get worse during the winter, as more people will probably displace from areas where they cannot access gas, fuel or electricity to heat their homes,” she added., Supporting people during the harsh cold season is one of the priorities during the months ahead. The destruction of thousands of houses and the lack of access to fuel, gas or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life or death, if people are unable to heat their homes., A scale up of the cash assistance is also planned, targeting now 6.3 million vulnerable people until the end of the year. During the first five months of the war, at least 2.3 million Ukrainians received cash assistance to make sure they could make their own choices to meet their vital needs. This also creates a link with the national social protection programme and local markets., The Humanitarian Coordinator stressed that in addition to the funding, aid groups in Ukraine will need safe and unimpeded access to all war-affected areas. “Since the war began, access has been extremely challenging in areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine. I call on the parties to the conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and facilitate the humanitarian response to make sure we can support every person who desperately needs assistance, no matter where they live.”, For further information, please contact:

This updated Flash Appeal covers the period of 10 months following the onset of the war in Ukraine that started on 24 February 2022 (i.e., from March to December 2022). The financial requirement of this Flash Appeal reflects the humanitarian needs from March until the end of 2022, taking into account the funding status and the response achievements to date, as well as the realistic projection of response capacity in the second half of the year. The smaller set of prioritized activities outlined in the “Winter Priority Procurement and Repair Plan,” which was released at the end of June 2022, have been folded into this Flash Appeal and complemented by other critical winterization and winter-specific interventions. These include (but are not limited to) cash for accommodation and utilities, cash or agricultural inputs for farmers to support winterization, heating system repairs, etc. This update of the Ukraine Flash Appeal will be the last iteration in 2022., Overview of the Crisis, More than five months since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, humanitarian needs continue to rise rapidly., Millions of people across the country have endured months of intense hostilities without adequate access to food, water, health care, education, protection and other essential services. Massive destruction of civilian infrastructure has left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without their homes or livelihoods. Too many are now living in damaged homes or in buildings ill-suited to provide protection for the upcoming harsh cold season, where the sub-zero temperatures could be life-threatening. Humanitarian organizations in Ukraine have dramatically scaled up their operations, reaching over 11.7 million people in the first five months of the conflict. The deteriorating situation and consequent need for continued life-saving assistance, and the predictions for a potentially severe cold season, has prompted a new revision and extension of the Ukraine Flash Appeal to ensure that the humanitarian response can be sustained until the end of 2022., The war in Ukraine shows no signs of abating and continues to drive increasing humanitarian needs across the country, especially in the Donbas region, some northern and southern oblasts. Needs also persist amongst displaced people who are now seeking safety in the west and central regions of Ukraine. Intense hostilities and fighting since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February have left at least 17.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, an increase of around 2 million people compared to April, when the Flash Appeal was last revised. Fighting and hostilities have further intensified across the entire front line since May, with clashes and attacks taking a heavy toll on civilians living in cities that have recently changed control, including Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhanska oblast, which are now controlled by Russian Federation forces and affiliated groups. In Donetska oblast, ongoing hostilities are making civilian life extremely difficult in cities still under the control of Ukrainian authorities. ln parallel, civilians are also being killed, injured, and houses and other critical civilian infrastructure are being damaged and destroyed in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts., The frequent use of explosive weapons in populated areas, including shelling from heavy artillery and rockets, as well as missile and air strikes, have left hundreds of civilians killed, injured or maimed. According to data verified and corroborated by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, 12,584 civilian casualties were reported in Ukraine from 24 February to 31 July 2022, including 5,327 people killed and 7,257 injured. The real numbers are likely much higher, but already exceed the verified 10,982 civilian casualties (3,404 killed and 7,578 injured), reported in the previous eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine., Millions who had been uprooted during the first two months of war are now trying to return to their areas of origin, although many have no option other than find safety far from their homes. Between May and July alone, more than 5.5 million people who had been internally displaced across Ukraine returned to their houses, mainly in Kyiv, eastern and northern parts of the country. Displacement dynamics are, however, fluid, and nearly 60 per cent of those who returned home do not feel safe. At the same time, thousands continue to be forced from areas under active fighting. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), about 6.6 million people—at least 64 per cent of whom are women—are still trying to find safety in different parts of Ukraine as of July 2022. In the western parts of Ukraine, internally displaced persons (IDPs) struggle to find adequate accommodation and income, resulting in vulnerability to exploitation, gender-based violence (GBV) and family separation, while incidents of social tensions with host communities have been reported. In addition, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that over 6.3 million Ukrainian refugees are living in different European countries as of 3 August 2022., The war has severely impacted agriculture in Ukraine, leaving thousands of farmers without income, and exacerbated food insecurity among vulnerability groups. Those displaced by the war are the most heavily affected. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), 20 per cent of the people of Ukraine have insufficient food consumption and one in three families are resorting to negative coping strategies. The situation is particularly concerning in the eastern and southern parts of the country, where one in every two families is facing challenges in putting food on their table. In addition, nearly 40 per cent of female-headed families in war-affected areas are food insecure and require support to address specific dietary needs, especially pregnant and breastfeeding women. People with chronic illnesses or disabilities are also facing increasing challenges., With the 2022 harvesting campaign in Ukraine already ongoing, farmers are facing challenges to harvest, store and export their produce. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that there will be a 20 to 30 per cent decline in winter cereal—maize and sunflower—production in Ukraine during the harvest season, as farmers either could not plant or will not be able to harvest their crops. In recent months, there have been mounting reports of fertile land or crops being destroyed during fighting or hostilities. In addition, FAO data shows that some 14 per cent of all storage facilities used by farmers are either damaged or destroyed and estimates the shortage of grain storage space for the new harvest to be 16.3 million tons. With the current trends, the deficit in the new season may reach 20 million tons., Over 5.7 million school-aged children have been negatively impacted by the war, including 3.6 million affected by the closure of educational institutions. Acute and ongoing exposure to conflict-related trauma and the resulting psychological stress is also affecting education and creating a risk of school dropouts and negative coping mechanisms. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MESU) reported that, at the end of July, nearly 2,200 educational facilities had been damaged across the country, including more than 220 completely destroyed. In addition, about 3,500 educational institutions are being used for humanitarian purposes (shelter, centres for the collection/distribution of humanitarian aid, food preparation), further affecting access to education. In the winter, anticipated shortages of electricity and fuel will add to the challenges to ensure children in Ukraine can continue their education., The war is causing enormous mental trauma on people who have seen their loved ones killed, injured, their homes and cities destroyed. Children are particularly affected. Girls, boys and entire families have to cope with loss, grief, anxiety, fear, not knowing about the whereabouts of loved ones, having to leave their homes and schools, witnessing or being subjects of violence and isolation. The psychosocial well-being of children and their emotional resilience is directly linked to the existence of routines and predictability in life, in which access to their school community, social networks and support systems plays a vital role., Massive destruction of civilian infrastructure has made life extremely difficult for millions of people and severely disrupted essential services, particularly health care. More than 70 per cent of all attacks against health care facilities in the world this year–434 out of the 615 recorded so far—have occurred in Ukraine. These attacks have decimated health services at a time when people need it most. Tuberculosis, HIV and viral hepatitis treatment programmes have been disrupted, impeding access to medicines, interrupting testing and delaying treatment. The situation is particularly acute in non-Government-controlled areas (NCGA), where people are facing dire challenges in accessing medical attention or critical medication. Challenges in delivering supplies or services across the front line in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts are reportedly leaving people suffering from chronic or communicable diseases—including HIV, Tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis—without the life-saving treatment they need. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), while 92 per cent of HIV facilities nationwide continue to provide treatment, only 9 per cent of HIV treatment sites are operational in Luhanska oblast. In 2020, Ukraine had the second highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV infections in the WHO European Region and had been identified as one of the top 20 countries with the highest estimated number of drug-resistant TB cases. Across the country, women face an increased care burden, lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services or shelters with sufficient medical supplies for newborn and older people. Access to essential medicine has become challenging for people with disabilities and people with chronic illnesses. Transgender people are also affected due to the lack of available hormone therapy., With large population movements, increased social mixing and the disruption of vaccination services and surveillance, there is an increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Prior to the war, vaccination coverage was already particularly low for polio, measles and hepatitis B, while the COVID-19 vaccine uptake was among the lowest in Europe. In addition, there have been increasing reports of gastrointestinal infections and bacterial diseases. Cases of botulism, linked to the consumption of contaminated meat and fish, have been reported in several oblasts. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are also highly prevalent in Ukraine due to behavioural and biological risk factors, especially in men. Access to essential health services and medications are crucial for the treatment of NCDs, particularly in older people, many of whom have been unable to flee the fighting due to reduced mobility., Access to health services, essential medicines, and market goods is limited by insecurity and movement restrictions due to hostilities, marital law and curfews. Based on the shifting operational context, more than 200 health facilities have found themselves close to the front line or in the areas of changed control. Many rural communities do not have pharmacies or medical centres. The supply chains for medicines, medical supplies and common goods have been disrupted, creating urgent needs. Many distributors are no longer operational, and many government and humanitarian stockpiles are inaccessible due to active hostilities., Damage to critical infrastructure has severely impacted access to water, particularly in non-Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast, and in cities that are now under control of the Russian Federation, including Mariupol, Mykolaiv, Sievierodonetsk, increasing the risk of water-borne diseases. In Donetska oblast, thousands of people receive piped water for only a couple of hours, every other day. Ukrainian authorities have reported that residents of Mariupol are forced to use water from puddles and sewers for non-drinking purposes, as they can only access five litres of drinking water per person per week. People in Mykolaiv are also facing growing challenges in accessing water for drinking or cooking due to the destruction of the town’s de-salinization and purification facilities. Newly drilled wells serve only about 5 per cent of the population, and the extracted water is often below desirable quality standards. There is also increased demand and need for separate public toilets and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities for men and women in collective centres, to mitigate the protection risks to women and children in particular., During the approaching cold season, the destruction of houses and lack of access to fuel or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life or death, if people are unable to heat their homes. According to the Government of Ukraine, over 800,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed in the country since the start of the war, and thousands of people are now living either in collective centres or damaged buildings, without the protection they need against the harsh cold season. In addition, an estimated 244,000 users across the country—including families, business enterprises and services such as schools or hospitals—have no gas supplies, essential not only for cooking but also for heating premises. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, and parts of Kharkivska, Mykolaivska and Zaporizka oblasts, over 620,000 customers do not have electricity in their homes, businesses, schools or health centres, due to structural damage caused to the electrical network., Cold temperatures are predicted to plummet as low as –20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country, severely impacting millions living in sub-standard conditions or without sufficient structural insulation or access to heating. In parallel, many affected communities face significant limitations in accessing functioning markets for solid fuel, stoves, winter clothes, and other winter essentials. The availability of safe and affordable transportation to and from markets is varied. Areas particularly impacted by market access constraints include Sumska and Kharkhivska oblasts and large areas of the Donbas region., There are mounting allegations of conflict-related sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV) being perpetrated against women and girls during the war. Those moving from one part of the country to another, at border crossing points, in transit/collective centers, or in bomb shelters have been reported to be particularly insecure and at high risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment, trafficking, and economic violence. Intimate partner violence is reportedly on the rise across the different regions of Ukraine, and disproportionately affects women. Although GBV-specialized services continue to operate in a number of municipalities and many large cities (except those communities where active hostilities are taking place), essential services are currently affected by significant gaps and limitations. These include state services shifting their focus away from GBV to address other urgent needs of displaced people such as accommodation, social protection, caring for the wounded. The reduced capacity of the already stretched health care system to respond to sexual violence against women and girls is also a challenge, exacerbated by the lack of resources (human and financial) amongst many service providers, broken referral pathways, and limited access of internally displaced people to life-saving information, including how and where to access specialized GBV services., Men face different specific challenges, including mandatory military conscription, which impacts their freedom of movement. Overall, the war is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and creating new challenges for both women and men in the country. Ukraine’s population has a distinctly gendered profile, with 54 per cent women and 46 per cent men, including a particularly large population of older females. Prior to the beginning of the conflict on 24 February, 71 per cent of the heads of households in the areas close to the former “contact line” in Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts were female. Women from vulnerable groups—particularly the elderly—are being left behind and disproportionately affected by disruptions caused by war. At the same time, challenges imposed on men makes the displacement and refugee flow largely gendered, and 64 per cent of people displaced are female. This creates challenges for both women and men to provide for their families and imposes additional burdens on women who often serve in unpaid caregiver roles.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-flash-appeal-march-december-2022

Statement on publication of press release on Ukrainian fighting tactics,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,7 Aug 2022,"Amnesty International deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused. Since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022, Amnesty International has been rigorously documenting and reporting on war crimes and violations committed in Ukraine, speaking to hundreds of victims and survivors whose stories illuminate the brutal reality of Russia’s war of aggression. We have challenged the world to demonstrate its solidarity with Ukrainians through concrete action, and we will continue to do so., Amnesty International’s priority in this and in any conflict is ensuring that civilians are protected; indeed, this was our sole objective when releasing this latest piece of research. While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused and wish to clarify a few crucial points., In our press release, we documented how in all 19 of the towns and villages we visited, we found instances where Ukrainian forces had located themselves right next to where civilians were living, thereby potentially putting them at risk from incoming Russian fire. We made this assessment based on the rules of international humanitarian law (IHL), which require all parties to a conflict to avoid locating, to the maximum extent feasible, military objectives within or near densely populated areas. The laws of war exist in part to protect civilians, and it is for this reason that Amnesty International urges governments to comply with them., This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country., We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations. Russia alone is responsible for the violations it has committed against Ukrainian civilians. Amnesty’s work over the last six months and our multiple briefings and reports on Russia’s violations and war crimes reflect their scale and the gravity of their impact on civilians., Amnesty International wrote to the Ukrainian government detailing our findings on 29 July. In our letter, we included GPS coordinates and other sensitive information about the locations, including schools and hospitals, where we had documented Ukrainian forces basing themselves among civilians. We did not make this information public in our press release due to the security risks it would pose to both Ukrainian forces and to the civilians we interviewed., Amnesty International is not attempting to give the Ukrainian military detailed instructions regarding how they should operate – but we call on the relevant authorities to abide by their international humanitarian obligations in full., Amnesty International’s priority will always be ensuring that civilians’ lives and human rights are protected during conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-publication-press-release-ukrainian-fighting-tactics

World Bank Mobilizes $4.5 billion in Additional Financing for Vital Support to Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,World Bank,"Health
Recovery and Reconstruction",8 Aug 2022,"WASHINGTON, August 8, 2022—The World Bank Group today announced $4.5 billion in additional financing mobilized for Ukraine under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) Project, which aims to help the Government of Ukraine meet urgent needs created by the ongoing war. The financing package is comprised of a $4.5 billion grant provided by the United States., The additional financing will contribute to sustaining the government’s administrative and service delivery capacity to exercise core functions at the national and regional levels. Specifically, the project will help the Government of Ukraine to cover social payments, healthcare services, and pensions, which are essential for the well-being of the country’s citizens in mitigating the social and economic impacts of the war., “Ukraine needs continued government services, including health, education, and social protection to prevent further deterioration in living conditions and poverty,” said David Malpass, World Bank Group President. “We are grateful to the United States and our partners for their ongoing support through our rapid support mechanisms and for the generous grant that will greatly support the Ukrainian people.”, The additional financing adds to the $1.49 billion Investment Project Financing (IPF), approved in June 2022. To date, the World Bank has mobilized nearly $13 billion in emergency financing, including commitments and pledges from donors, to support the continuation of essential government services and to help blunt the widespread human and economic impacts of the war. More than $6.3 billion of this financing has been disbursed as of the end of July 2022., “There is an enormous need for resources to sustain the daily delivery of essential services, as well as for reconstruction,” said Arup Banerji, World Bank Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe. “As such, our development partners have come together, each bringing to the table their respective areas of strength. As the focus turns to recovery and reconstruction, it will also be critical to increase attention to reforms, transparency, and governance, as Ukraine prepares for a transition to post-war recovery. Supporting the continuation of essential social services will support a more successful and less costly recovery and reconstruction.”, PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/06, Contacts

Update 88 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (6 August 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,6 Aug 2022,"Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today issued a statement expressing his grave concern about Friday’s shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and again stressing the crucial importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) being able to send a mission of nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts to the site as soon as possible., Ukraine informed the IAEA that the shelling had damaged the plant’s external power supply system but that two power lines remained operational, the Director General said. It had also triggered the emergency protection system of one of the plant’s three operating reactors. This unit was disconnected from the grid as a result of Friday’s events, Ukraine said., Ukraine also informed the IAEA that there had been no damage to the reactors themselves, no radiological release and no reports of injuries. However, it said a nitrogen-oxygen station, which supports plant operations, and an auxiliary building were damaged. Firefighters had quickly extinguished a fire at the nitrogen-oxygen station, but it still needs to be repaired, Ukraine said. The IAEA has also received information about shelling near the spent fuel storage facility., On Saturday morning, two of the ZNPP’s six units were operating and the radiation situation was normal, Ukraine told the IAEA., Based on the limited information available, Director General Grossi said IAEA experts had made a preliminary assessment that the current nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP seemed stable, with no immediate threat to nuclear safety., The IAEA will continue to closely monitor the evolution of the situation, the progress of repairs and any nuclear safety implications at the site, he said., The Director General said Friday’s events had breached several of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that he outlined at the beginning of the conflict, in particular:, Pillar 1 (Physical integrity): Any military activity – such as shelling – within, or in the vicinity of, a nuclear facility has the potential to cause an Unacceptable Radiological Consequence., Pillar 2 (All safety and security systems and equipment must be functional at all times): As a result of the shelling, emergency protection was activated at one of the units, diesel generators were set in operation, and the nitrogen-oxygen station and an auxiliary building were damaged., Pillar 3 (Operating Staff): This recent activity further increases the stress of the operational team., Pillar 4 (Power supply): This has been compromised as a result of damage to the external power supply system., Pillar 6 (Radiation monitoring and Emergency Preparedness and Response arrangements): In the current status of the site, this recent shelling further jeopardizes the already compromised EPR arrangements and capabilities to respond.
However, the radiation monitoring system is still operational., In his statement, Director General Grossi said any military action jeopardizing the safety of the ZNPP – Europe’s largest such plant – was completely unacceptable and must be avoided., The IAEA has not been able to visit the Russian-occupied facility in Ukraine's south since before the conflict began more than five months ago., Director General Grossi said he would continue his efforts to send an IAEA mission to the site, stressing that this would help to stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the four operational NPPs, but it is still experiencing a partial loss of safeguards data transfer from the Chornobyl NPP, the Director General said., Ukraine also informed the IAEA today that ten of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, three at the South Ukraine NPP, and two at the Khmelnytskyy NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-88-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-6-august-2022

A hospital in Chernihiv gets a new alert system,News and Press Release,UNDP,Health,5 Aug 2022,"UNDP, with the support of the European Union, provides an advanced communications system that informs medical staff about patient needs and records whether care has been provided promptly, Kyiv, 5 August 2022 – Doctors in communities along the front lines of war in Ukraine work under increased pressure as number of those affected by hostilities remains high. What is more, the facilities in which they work are often becoming targets of violence – since the Russian invasion began in February more than 900 health facilities have been destroyed or damaged, obstructing delivery of and access to healthcare., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said that the European Union, together with international partners, will continue supporting the health care sector to help it endure these difficult times: “Ukrainians should have wide access to quality medical care,” he said. “Medical workers who continue working in tough wartime conditions must be provided with everything they need.”, Chernihiv, a city 150 kilometres northeast of Kyiv, has often been in the front line of hostilities, resulting in massive damage to its infrastructure, including medical facilities. The workload on the Chernihiv Central District Hospital and its employees has also increased, and the admission level of the wounded and vulnerable people remains high., To help the hospital better manage its growing workload, UNDP, within UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme and with the financial support of the European Union, provided a smart notification system for the surgical, neurological, therapeutic and intensive care departments. The emergency call system for medical personnel is equipped with software that records the information about the number and speed of calls received by medical personnel. In addition, the emergency call buttons are wireless, waterproof, and uses signal lamps placed near a patient’s room or in separate rooms that duplicate the call for medical personnel., Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said the doctors operating along the front lines often work around the clock caring for patients and war wounded. “Their efforts are heroic, but often hampered by inadequate medical instruments or damaged equipment.”, Fouani said that UNDP is directing much of its efforts to ensuring that “the huge and growing number of Ukrainians affected by the war, as well as vulnerable groups of patients, including children and low-mobility persons, have access to effective, efficient and fully operational medical institutions catering to diverse medical needs.”, Dr. Valerii Vasylynchuk, head of the surgical department of the Chernihiv Central District Hospital, said the new system will reduce the burden on the medical staff. “Our department is constantly overcrowded,” he said. “All 60 available beds are occupied. Now each bed is equipped with a button, which significantly optimizes our work, making us more efficient and effective.”, Background, The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)., Twelve international partners support the Programme: The European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland., Media enquiries, Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Lead; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/hospital-chernihiv-gets-new-alert-system

"First grain shipment to leave Ukraine’s port is first step in providing relief to dire global hunger crisis, says IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,Food and Nutrition,1 Aug 2022,"Odessa, Ukraine, August 1, 2022 — The International Rescue Committee (IRC) welcomes news that the first grain shipment since February left Ukraine’s Black Sea Port today after a deal reached last week set the parameters for freeing regular exports of up to 20 tons of wheat awaiting export. This shipment is the first step in providing relief to a growing global hunger crisis — one that is significantly worsened by the ongoing war in Ukraine blocking key food items from reaching the world market., Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine Country Director at the IRC, said, “I was relieved to see this shipment leave Odessa this morning. This is the first of many lifelines needed to ease the global food crisis and help the millions of people at risk of starving around the world. However, we cannot forget that this blockade should never have happened in the first place. Preventing food from leaving Ukraine has hurt the hungry, especially those suffering a looming famine in East Africa, where many are already dying of hunger, most of them children. Now, these shipments must be guaranteed consistent safe passage – something we are particularly concerned about given Odessa port has been attacked twice just in the last week. The international community must ensure regular and predictable food shipments urgently reach those on the brink of starvation and that Ukraine’s farmers are able to safely grow and transport crops to the ports.”, The IRC is responding to the crisis in Ukraine working directly and with local partners and local civil society to reach those people most in need. We are providing cash to vulnerable families to cover their most basic needs and non-food items like blankets, nappies, and soap, to displaced families. We are supporting local health services that are currently overwhelmed and providing essential protection services to women and children. The IRC is urgently preparing for winter as many families are living in houses damaged by the fighting and have no access to electricity or gas for heating.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/first-grain-shipment-leave-ukraines-port-first-step-providing-relief-dire-global-hunger-crisis-says-irc

Mine Action",2 Aug 2022,"This report is produced by the Mine Action Sub-Cluster in Ukraine in collaboration with partners. It covers the period from 24 February 2022 to 31 July of 2022., OVERVIEW, The month of July saw a further expansion of field operations of NGOs with over 12M m2 of land surveyed and 461K m2 cleared. One hundred and eighteen items of explosive ordnance were recovered and destroyed. Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) reached 40,000 beneficiaries through face-to-face training and 3.14M through digital outreach., Work on the updated Flash Appeal (which will be launched in August) for the period running to the end of 2022 will present 14.6M people in need (PIN) concerning mine action services. Of these 6M will be targeted for the period running to December 2022 through a total estimated budget of $89.4M. New indicators are being introduced which also reflect the developing sector. Earlier in the year EORE activities were a focus as martial law in Ukraine halted field operations, indicators were then expanded to include NTS outputs when restrictions were lifted and now, looking forward, additional indicators capture expanded clearance parameters., From the period 25.02.22 to 12.07.22 the HALO Trust documented 169 civilian casualties from explosive devices – 71 killed and 98 injured from 89 accidents. This is considered a significant under-representation of actual statistics. One key impediment to the efficiency of international clearance operations concerns the restrictions on the use of explosives for the critical activity of destroying landmines and unexploded ordnance. Currently, international organizations are reliant on the Ukrainian military or State Emergency Services to perform demolitions when expertise is already embedded in the ranks of the INGOs., Explosive ordnance disposal in other country settings is undertaken by INGO technical specialists as a routine task. To maximize international investments, reduce the burden on national capacities, and expedite mine action activities to facilitate recovery, reconstruction, and safe return in Ukraine, the MASC is lobbying to change the current explosive disposal practices to reflect the global norm.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-mine-action-5w-situation-report-01-august-2022

Repeated waves of airstrikes and shelling have caused hundreds of civilian casualties and damaged or destroyed critical civilian infrastructure over the last weeks. This includes several health facilities in Mykolaiv, hundreds of houses in Donetska oblast, and scores of schools across eastern and southern Ukraine. Crops have also been destroyed recently in the same area. This massive destruction left millions of civilians trapped in the hardest-hit areas with little or no water, gas, electricity, food and other necessities, often unable to evacuate safely. Over 5.5 million who had been uprooted during the first two months of war have now returned to their places of origin—often living in damaged houses—while nearly 6.7 million are still internally displaced., Humanitarians in Ukraine continued to expand their life-saving operations over the last months and by the end of July, about 11.6 million people had received critical assistance in all regions of the country. Over 8.9 million Ukrainians have received food and livelihood assistance, including agricultural support, and more than 100,000 children and pregnant and lactating women have received nutritional assistance. In addition, 5.1 million people have been able to access health services and 5.6 million have been assisted with protection services, including legal support. Humanitarian partners have also distributed cash assistance to over 2.3 million people, provided clean water and hygiene supplies to more than 5.6 million people, shelter assistance to 1 million people, and have provided education services and learning materials to approximately 200,000 children and educators., The steady scale-up of the humanitarian response across Ukraine is the result of the work of more than 400 organizations, including 263 national NGOs. Over the past months, the number of organizations reporting activities through the humanitarian system dramatically increased, compared to around 120 organizations at the beginning of the year. Humanitarian partners are active in all 24 of Ukraine’s oblasts, providing assistance in areas hosting large numbers of people displaced and regions experiencing fighting. The work was also enabled by the timely support from donors, which provided around 95 per cent of the US$2.25 billion requested by humanitarian organizations in the Ukraine Flash Appeal., The response, however, continues to be impacted by the extremely limited access to areas beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine, where people desperately need support. Since the war began, the United Nations and its humanitarian partners have not been able to send any relief supplies across the front lines, hampering aid worker’s capacity to sustain and scale up operations. Aid organizations have been prevented from reaching cities such as Mariupol in Donetska oblast and Sievierodonetsk in Luhanska oblast, or Kherson in the south, despite repeated calls and engagements with the parties to the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-response-dashboard-february-july-2022

"Ukraine: 1,000 Ukrainian patients transferred to European hospitals",News and Press Release,EC,Health,5 Aug 2022,"As of today, the EU has successfully coordinated 1,000 medical evacuations of Ukrainian patients via its Civil Protection Mechanism to provide them with specialised healthcare in hospitals across Europe., As the number of wounded people in Ukraine increases day by day, local hospitals are struggling to keep up with the demand. At the same time, Poland, Moldova and Slovakia have requested support for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) operations from their respective countries given the large inflow of people. To relieve pressure on local hospitals, since 11 March, the EU has been coordinating patient transfers to other European countries who have available hospital capacity., The patients have been transferred to 18 countries: Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Romania, Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Lithuania, Finland, Poland and the Czechia. Recent operations include the transfer of two patients to Czechia on 3 August and 15 patients evacuated to Germany, four patients to the Netherlands and 2 patients to Norway on 4 August., Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič said: ""Russia's unjustified war in Ukraine is driving Ukrainian health systems to breaking point. To help Ukraine cope with the skyrocketing medical needs, the EU has stepped up its operations. On top of delivering medicines and medical equipment to Ukraine via our Civil Protection Mechanism, we are also coordinating medical evacuations. 1,000 Ukrainian patients have been transferred to hospitals in 18 European countries. I want to thank all countries who are welcoming the Ukrainian patients in this critical time. EU solidarity saves lives."", European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides said: *""From day one, the EU has been working tirelessly to support Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia's brutal military aggression. As part of this, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has allowed patients in urgent need of treatment and care to receive it in hospitals across the EU, while relieving pressure on the healthcare systems of Ukraine's neighbouring countries. This is true European solidarity in action. Together with Ukrainian authorities, we are also looking into ways to bring patients back home when they have finished their treatment, if they choose to do so. This lifesaving work will continue, as will the EU's unwavering commitment to supporting Ukraine"". *, Background, The medical evacuations are financially and operationally supported by the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The MEDEVAC transfer scheme supports the transfer of patients that fulfil the eligibility criteria, be they chronically ill or wounded by the war. The mechanism enables the Commission to report to the Ukrainian authorities where in the EU/EEA countries the patients have been transferred. For a secure transfer of patient data, the patients' health records are shared using the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS)., Phone, +32 2 299 90 75, Mail, miriam.garcia-ferrer@ec.europa.eu, Phone, +32 2 296 91 40, Mail, daniel.puglisi@ec.europa.eu",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-1000-ukrainian-patients-transferred-european-hospitals

All USAID/Ukraine programs remain active and we continue to invest in more than 40 activities run by more than 700 implementing partner staff in the country. All of this helps to make Ukraine stronger, more democratic, and more prosperous, and helps Ukrainians realize the promise of the Revolution of Dignity., Assistance to Critical Sectors, USAID launched the $100 million Agriculture Resilience Initiative to further support Ukrainian agriculture exports and production during the war. Since February 24, we have provided inputs and services to more than 8,000 farmers, accounting for 14% of Ukraine’s agricultural enterprises. This includes the provision of high-quality seed potatoes to 6,215 farmers in 15 oblasts - including in the hard-hit regions of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kyiv, and Zaporizhzhia - and the provision of vegetable seeds to more than 4,000 farmers in 12 oblasts. [Note: the figures overlap as some farmers receive various forms of USAID assistance.], USAID is supporting the delivery of locally-donated food, clothing, medicines, hygiene supplies, and agriculture inputs to hard-hit communities and to communities hosting large numbers of IDPs. In partnership with the All-Ukrainian Association of Communities, USAID has enabled the delivery of 530 tons of supplies to 81 communities, directly benefiting more than 50,000 people. The largest numbers of recipients are in Zaporizhzhya, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Kyiv oblasts., Following Ukraine’s successful connection with the European electricity system made with USAID support, the country’s electricity system operator is now generating roughly $20 million per month in export revenue. On July 28, the European Network of Electricity Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E) approved an increase in Ukrainian electricity export capacity from 100 MW to 250 MW, which is projected to create increased export revenue. USAID is also helping Ukraine repair and upgrade energy infrastructure in preparation for winter., USAID supported the delivery of nearly 500,000 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to Kyiv on July 12.
The U.S. government has donated more than 3.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since the start of the pandemic. Since the start of the war, USAID has also provided logistical support for the distribution of $380 million in donated medicines and medical supplies to communities across Ukraine., USAID continues to provide Ukraine’s local governments with supplies and support to continue delivering public services amid Russia’s brutal war. We recently provided 138 sets of armored PPE to Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and 100 sets of PPE to the Mykolaiv City Council for use by emergency response workers. We also expanded our local governance decentralization activity to support 40 additional communities in four oblasts (Odesa, Rivne,

As heavy fighting continues in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, widescale destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement are still being reported. There are daily reports of shelling in Kharkiv city and Kharkhivska Oblast, resulting in damage to civilian buildings and multiple civilian deaths and injuries, as well as destruction of crops. In the past week alone, one thousand homes were cut off from gas when shelling damaged a gas pipeline., The total number of verified civilian casualties since February 2022 has exceeded 12,000. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has verified that, as of 24 July, 5,237 civilians were killed (2,019 men, 1,379 women, 164 boys and 143 girls) and 7,053 injured, but the actual totals are believed to be considerably higher., The war in Ukraine has exacerbated price increases for cereal grains and food prices globally, becoming a great threat to food security in the global south., On 23 July, one day after the agreement on grain shipments via Black Sea ports was signed in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia, the southern port of Odesa was hit by Russian missile strikes. The attack was condemned by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, but there have since been more attacks in the Odeska oblast, resulting in the deaths of 21 civilians and injuries to 50 others. The port city of Mykolaiv in neighboring Mykolaivska oblast also suffered from multiple shellings, which destroyed a warehouse serving as a humanitarian aid storage facility. Despite the disruption, there is now a glimmer of hope in easing the mounting global food crisis as the first grain shipment left the port on 1 August. Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister of Ukraine, referred to it as “a day of relief for the world,” particularly for nations at risk of food shortages due to disrupted supplies., IOM is concerned about ongoing internal and cross-border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. On 1 August 2022, IOM in Ukraine released the seventh round of its Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, which recorded 6.64 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of 23 July, indicating an increase of 370,000 IDPs (6 per cent) since round six on 23 June. Critically, the report noted a rising need for financial support, NFIs, hygiene items, and food since previous rounds. Of all respondents currently in their place of residence, 18 per cent indicated they returned following a minimum of two weeks of displacement, equivalent to an estimated 5,547,000 returnees and a slight decrease from the estimate from Round 6. As the crisis continues to evolve, and with ongoing displacement, it underlines the need for a continued humanitarian response as well as long-term solutions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-25-04-august-2022
Modern vocational schools for Ukraine,News and Press Release,KfW,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",4 Aug 2022,"KfW is committed to the future of education, KfW is supporting the modernisation of vocational training in Ukraine on behalf of the German Federal Government. The EUR 20 million grant provided at the beginning of August will create centres of excellence at vocational schools to make vocational education and training in the country more attractive. This measure is also intended to contribute to offering Ukrainian youth prospects in their home country., The war continues to dominate everyday life in many regions of Ukraine, but reconstruction is already being planned. The country's existing challenges continue to exist and are further exacerbated by the conflict. Overcoming them also requires modernising vocational trainings so that a qualified workforce can contribute to the reconstruction and revitalisation of the economy in the medium run., A university degree is more popular than vocational training among most school graduates in Ukraine, although apprentices are more likely to find a job than young people with a bachelor's degree. Contributing to the poor image of vocational schools is the fact that many facilities date back to Soviet times. The buildings are in a correspondingly poor condition, and the equipment and curricula are outdated., On behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), KfW provides a grant to modernise chosen vocational schools, which are to serve as models for other vocational training institutions in the form of centres of excellence. Marketing campaigns will accompany the project to show how attractive modern vocational training can be and what opportunities it offers., Modern machines, new learning programmes, The comprehensive renovation of the vocational schools includes the refurbishment of buildings, whereby energy efficiency is increased through better insulation, for example. Modern machines are being purchased that reflect the current state of the art. Vocational school teachers are being trained on the new machines and given further pedagogical training, while new learning programmes and modern approaches are replacing the Soviet legacy. To ensure that the needs of future employers are taken into account, close cooperation with the business community is sought. To meet the challenges of war, apprenticeships are promoted to be important for the country's economic growth and reconstruction., Foundation stone for development, ""The centres of excellence are being created to the most modern standards, which meet the requirements of the labour market. We are confident that future apprentices will use their knowledge and skills to lay the foundation for Ukraine's development during and after the war,"" says KfW Head of Division Dr. Bianca Clausen., Parts of the funds will be used for the modernised vocational schools to share their newly acquired pedagogical knowledge with other institutions in countries of the so-called Eastern Partnership. As a project of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the Eastern Partnership is aimed at countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia., The new BMZ-funded project to modernise the lighthouse schools complements an existing project with which KfW is already implementing EUR 21 million in Ukraine from the EU programme ""EU4Skills: Better Skills for Modern Ukraine"".

Fulmar S is currently at anchorage at the inspection area near north west of Istanbul., The three outbound vessels are estimated to depart in the morning from their respective ports. Timings may be affected based on readiness, weather conditions or other unexpected circumstances. Inspection is expected to take place after arrival at the anchorage area in Turkish territorial waters., The inbound vessel is anticipated to move from her anchorage at 0900hrs after the inspection by the JCC’s inspection team., Drawing from lessons learnt during the first movement of M/V Razoni, the JCC has authorized this movement as a second ‘proof of concept’, testing multi-ship operations in the corridor including an inbound ship. In addition, the corridor has been revised to allow for more efficient passage of ships while maintaining safety., The JCC further acknowledges the need for the commercial vessels stranded in the Ukrainian ports since February to depart to their pre-defined destinations. Their movement will free up valuable pier space for more inbound ships to come in and carry food to global markets in line with the Initiative., As per procedures agreed at the JCC, all participants coordinate with their respective military and other relevant authorities to ensure the safe passage of commercial vessels., The JCC will monitor closely the safe passage of the vessels through the humanitarian maritime corridor., Note to editors: The Joint Coordination Centre was established under the Black Sea Grain Initiative in Istanbul on 27 July 2022. It comprises senior representatives from Russia, Türkiye, Ukraine and United Nations and its role is to enable the safe transportation, by merchant ships, of grain and other foodstuffs and fertilizers from three key Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea to the rest of the world., For info, contact: Ismini Palla (Ms), Media and Communications officer, Joint Coordination Centre, +962770996330, palla@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/note-correspondents-operational-update-black-sea-grain-initiativejoint-coordination-centre

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCR) reports that there have been over 11,500 civilian casualties since the start of the war, with over 5,020 civilian deaths, including 300 children, although the actual number of civilian casualties is likely much higher., Major attacks continue to be reported across the country, resulting in widespread infrastructure destruction, loss of life, and displacement. Fighting has remained concentrated in Eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas region, where clashes, shelling, and strikes have occurred in some areas. A strike on Chasiv Yar in the Government-controlled part of eastern Donetsk oblast this week hit an apartment block killing 34 people, making it the second deadliest strike since the beginning of the war. According to local authorities, several residential buildings, a shopping center, and other civilian buildings were struck in the eastern city of Kharkiv on 11 July, resulting in more than 35 civilian casualties. On 14 July, three strikes hit the city of Vinnytsia, killing 23 persons, including three children. This area is a civilian zone and contains an IOM office., A key emerging concern is the preparation for winter months, when temperatures are expected to drop as low as -20 degrees Celsius in parts of Ukraine and neighboring countries, which could have disastrous consequences for those without adequate insulation and heating. Millions of Ukrainians are facing vulnerable circumstances due to loss of employment and livelihoods while also living in damaged houses or buildings ill-suited for long and harsh winter conditions. It is estimated that there are 44 million sqm of damaged housing, with a current damage estimate of more than $39 billion for the housing sector nationally. In addition, increased security risks have made the delivery of solid fuel to insecure areas intermittent or impossible. Particular vulnerability is present in Kharkivska, Sumska, Zhytomyrska and Kyivska oblasts due to extensive damage to energy and heating infrastructure (OCHA, and Kyiv School of Economics). Early planning is underway to mitigate the severe effects of the cold and to provide warm and safe conditions for all, particularly those who have been displaced by the war., IOM is particularly concerned about the ongoing situation of third country nationals (TCNs), who have yet to receive, or are no longer receiving, substantive protection in countries neighboring Ukraine, but who face unique livelihood and protection risks. TCNs who had been residing in Ukraine with temporary residence permits for work or studies are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain or maintain their status in the EU in neighboring countries, and are in some cases losing that status. Even with potential options to voluntarily return to their country of origin, including those provided by IOM, a lack or loss of protection for TCNs may lead to future irregular migration and increased vulnerability risks, including in their countries of origin.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-24-21-july-2022

While Russian territorial gains in the region were limited, Russian forces took control of multiple locations close to Svitlodarsk (Espresso TV, 27 July 2022)., Russian forces also continued to engage in civilian targeting last week, with dozens of civilian fatalities reported from shelling, airstrikes, and missile attacks in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Sumy regions. In Donetsk, over 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a prison in occupied Olenivka (ISW, 1 August 2022; Suspilne Media, 30 July 2022). Ukrainian and international sources blamed Russian forces for the explosion, while Russia claims that it was caused by Ukrainian rockets. International experts have dismissed Russian claims as being inconsistent with available visual evidence (ISW, 1 August 2022). Meanwhile, new reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces in July surfaced last week, including the rape and killing of nine women and girls in Luhansk and Melitopol (24 Channel, 27 July 2022; Unian, 27 July 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-23-29-july-2022

Not only medicines and band-aids – the PCPM Foundation distributes medical equipment to Ukrainian hospitals,News and Press Release,PCPM,"Contributions
Health",3 Aug 2022,"Six pallets of medical aid have arrived at hospitals in Svitlovodsk, Kharkov and Kryvyi Rih. Since the war started in Ukraine, the Polish Center for International Aid is organizing transports with medical support to Ukraine. Besides band-aids, medication, and special medical equipment (such as Ultrasound and ECG) the local medical facilities also received defibrillators., The PCPM foundation previously helped with medical equipment deliveries to Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Konotop, Korop and Uman. The implementation of needs targeted to medical third parties (such as hospitals or clinics) has been a major challenge for the NGOs supporting them. Oftentimes from the moment of receiving the list of needs to an end of such process a month passes – Tomasz Lipert – PCPM Medical Transport Coordinator points out. To pack a full truck with humanitarian aid you need to attach over thirty palettes to the semi-trailer. As the two PCPM’s logistics department workers Łukasz Saderski and Roman Havrylyuk informed, truck transport is the most economic delivery option. The truck capacity is about thirty-three palettes, so sometimes it can be difficult to deliver the items on time – Roman said., Sometimes it turns out that the medical equipment delivery is not possible at a certain time. In this scenario, the transport to Ukraine goes by smaller vehicles such as vans. A journalist and reporter Jacek Hugo-Bader helped the Polish Center for International Aid twice in delivering medical gear to Ukraine., On how the order-complementing process goes, Tomasz continued “First of all, we need to read the list, get to know what kind of hospital contacts us for assistance. Once we do that, we ask the facility to send such need-list again, but in an electronic form” – he said. Ordering all product firstly requires dividing them by items. To sort medicine, equipment, band-aid, and single-use items into separate groups. ‘The organization ‘Apotheker obne Grenzen’ (‘Pharmacists without borders’) helped with sorting medication. We also submit speared orders buying other medical equipment” – Tomasz informed. The order procedure is time-consuming because each item needs to come from a different supplier, which do not allow bulk orders. Suppliers manage one product at a time – one ultrasound equipment, other ECG. ‘While complementing medicine you need to pay attention to details. From time to time we note a chemical substance, for example paracetamol, but we do not have details about the quantity of boxes, and in what form: cone cells, pills, liquid substances used in needle shots, or in other forms. You need to every single detail’ – he pointed out firmly. A similar issue occurs with single-use products. ‘We see that medical tubes are a vital need, but it is important that we know what kind, because there are so many options to choose from. The order needs to be specific. We do not know if the demand is for throat-nasal tube, for intubation, etheric throb type or other kind. That shows you how important clarification is in this profession’ – he pointed out., Tomasz points out that the described challenges, are only a tiny part of the whole procedure. The Polish Center for International Aid shed a light on significant shortages in the availability of insulin in Ukraine. The country’s most significant factory was destroyed in the first weeks of the war. ‘The delivery of insulin requires a refrigerated transport and there are other critical issues related to it for diabetics. When we saw that every hospital was asking for it, we alerted the WHO (World Health Organization) about the issue. The supply of such a vital medical component cannot depend on NGOs alone. The institutions ought to solve this problem’ – the specialist said., Finally, the coordinator, asked about his projection of the need for medical supplies to Ukraine, replied that the matter depends on the further development of the war. ‘Probably, over time, a different kind of assistance will be needed than is provided now. Currently, where there are direct clashes, battlefield medical assistance needed – bandages, wound stitching kits, and the like. In the later phase of the conflict, people have lost limbs are going to need rehabilitation to return to normal functioning. The need for appropriate orthopedic equipment will, and the supply of such an important medical equipment cannot depend solely on NGOs’., From the start of the war until the end of June, the Polish Center for International Aid sent 2.5 tons of medical gear to Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/not-only-medicines-and-band-aids-pcpm-foundation-distributes-medical-equipment-ukrainian-hospitals

Food and Nutrition",2 Aug 2022,"Canada contributes USD 40 million to cover 2.4 million tonnes of storage, 02/08/2022, Kyiv/Rome – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched a new USD 40 million (Canadian Dollar 52 million) Canada-funded project to further address grain storage shortages in Ukraine., The initiative will allow storage of an additional 2.4 million tonnes of grain between 2022-2023 along with related technical support and equipment. This complements the support of USD 17 million recently provided by the Government of Japan to cover 1 million tonnes of grain storage., This season, with the harvest of winter crops starting in July and spring crops beginning later in the year, Ukraine is expecting to harvest up to 51.1 million tonnes of cereal. Out of a total storage capacity of 75 million tonnes, 14 percent of storage facilities are damaged or destroyed, 10 percent are located in Russian-occupied territories and around 30 percent remain filled with 22 million tonnes of last year’s harvest awaiting export – according to the Government of Ukraine., “Given the unprecedented storage challenges this year, innovative solutions are required at scale. For this reason support to the sector will remain in high demand, likely into 2023,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of the FAO Office of Emergencies and Resilience. “FAO is responding immediately to this situation while taking a longer-term view and looking to invest in durable solutions that build on sectoral capacity, in coordination with the Government at national and local levels.”, The recently developed Grain Storage Support Strategy – an extension to the FAO Ukraine Rapid Response Plan (RRP) – aims to support the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine to cover 4.07 million tonnes, or 25 percent, of the total estimated national storage deficit of 16 million tons in 2022-23. The strategy also includes the support of the State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection to process and export agricultural products from Ukraine, by strengthening government capacity for food commodity testing and certifications necessary for export at border facilities., The immediate impact of the strategy will be an expansion and immediate availability of storage capacity at this critical harvest time for Ukrainian producers of grain and oil seeds, while the longer-term impact will be in sustaining global food supplies. This, in turn, will strengthen food security and protect livelihoods at the household and national levels in Ukraine, and ensure other grain import-dependent countries retain access to adequate supplies of grain, at a manageable cost., “Thanks to the funding provided by Global Affairs Canada, FAO will deliver temporary and fixed grain storage solutions including polyethylene grain sleeves, loading and unloading machinery, and longer-term modular storage units, targeting small and medium-sized farms in 15 oblasts,” said Pierre Vauthier, Head of FAO’s Ukraine Country Office. “In addition, FAO will procure up to USD 2 million worth of laboratory equipment to support six strategic laboratory facilities in surveillance for animal diseases in accordance with the World Organization for Animal Health’s safe trade rules.”, To date, with the additional funds from Canada, FAO has raised $70.4 million against the total of USD 180.4 million needed under the Rapid Response Plan and Grain Storage Support Strategy. An additional USD 110 million are urgently needed to support vulnerable households in rural areas., More on this topic, FAO in Emergencies: War in Ukraine, Ukraine Rapid Response Plan (March–December 2022), Humanitarian Response Update, 21 July, Ukraine: FAO scales up efforts to save upcoming harvest, ensure export of vital grains, Food security in Ukraine: FAO distributes seed potatoes to vulnerable rural families",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fao-canada-join-forces-address-grain-storage-deficit
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (23 - 29 July 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,29 Jul 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued, while over 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed during an explosion at a prison building in occupied Donetsk. Incidents of cross-border shelling and railway sabotage continued in Russia. In the Netherlands, farmers' protests resumed following a brief lull in activity. Demonstrations against the prison conditions for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) prisoners were staged in both France and Spain. Meanwhile, ceasefire violations increased on the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Russian forces continued offensive operations in the Donetsk region, where ACLED records almost half of all political violence last week. Territorial gains of Russian forces in the region were limited last week, with Russia gaining control over locations close to Svitlodarsk, including the Vuhlehirsk thermal power plant (Espresso TV, 27 July 2022)., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling, airstrikes, and missile attacks last week, killing dozens of civilians in the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Sumy regions. Meanwhile, new reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces in July surfaced last week, including the rape and killing of nine women and girls in Luhansk and Melitopol (24 Channel, 27 July 2022; Unian, 27 July 2022). Additionally, a video of Russian soldiers castrating and then executing a captive Ukrainian soldier circulated online last week, revealing that male prisoners of war have also faced sexual violence during the conflict (Washington Post, 30 July 2022). The actual extent of Russian sexual violence in Ukraine is likely much higher than that which has been reported, but the details of these events remain difficult to verify (Democracy Now, 9 June 2022).1, Additionally, over 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed and over 100 wounded in an explosion at a prison building in occupied Olenivka in the Donetsk region last week (ISW, 1 August 2022; Suspilne Media, 30 July 2022).2 The building housed around 2,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war, including soldiers of the Azov Battalion who surrendered to Russian forces in Mariupol in May (New York Times, 1 August 2022). Ukrainian and international sources have blamed Russian forces, potentially with the involvement of the government-linked militants from the Wagner Group, for the explosion either by a precision strike or an internally planted explosive (ISW, 1 August 2022). Ukraine alleges that the attack was meant to cover up the torture of prisoners, hide the embezzlement of funds from the Russian chain of command, and disrupt the supply of weapons to Ukraine by discrediting Ukrainian forces (ISW, 29 July 2022). While Russia claims that the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian rocket attack, international experts believe that the Russian version of events is inconsistent with the available visual evidence (ISW, 1 August 2022)., In Russia, authorities of border regions reported shelling by Ukrainian forces in Alekseevka, Kursk region and Mayskiy, Belgorod region, as well as an airstrike on a border checkpoint in the Bryansk region (Kommersant, 25 July 2022; Kommersant, 29 July 2022; Meduza, 26 July 2022). According to the governor of the Bryansk region, Russian and Ukrainian forces also exchanged cross-border fire near the village of Sachkovichi (Kommersant, 29 July 2022). Moreover, train derailments were reported in the Republic of Kalmykia and Bashkortostan after unidentified individuals damaged railway tracks in suspected acts of sabotage aimed at disrupting the movement of Russian military equipment to Ukraine (RFE/RL, 25 July 2022; Activatica, 29 July 2022). Violence associated with the war in Ukraine contributed to the 136% increase in violence in Russia in the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., Russian police broke up an anti-war demonstration in Moscow, while rallies in support of Ukraine and against the war were recorded in Armenia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom., Farmer protests against the government's plans to cut nitrogen emissions resurfaced in the Netherlands last week following a lull the week prior, mainly in the form of roadblock demonstrations across the country. Heaps of hay and garbage were erected and burned, causing traffic problems on several major highways. Moreover, around 3,000 people, including farmers, fishermen, truckers, and other sympathizers of the farmer protest, gathered at the call of the anti-government group Nederland In Verzet and staged a protest at the Dam in Amsterdam to denounce the Dutch cabinet's agricultural policy (De Telegraaf, 23 July 2022). Farmers also demonstrated in Flemish Belgium against the Flemish government's plans to cut nitrogen emissions in the agricultural sector. Farmers' working conditions also triggered protests in Italy, France, Portugal, and Spain last week., In France, the Peacemakers (Artisans de la Paix) and Bake Bidea organizations led blockades in the Basque country after the public prosecutor's office in Paris refused to request the release on parole of two 70-year-old Basque prisoners, who have been incarcerated for 32 years (La Croix, 23 July 2022). Similarly, Sare Herritarra members staged a demonstration in Spain to demand the end of a special penitentiary policy applied to ETA prisoners and to celebrate the repatriation of 11 Basque prisoners from prisons outside the Basque country., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, the number of ceasefire violations increased last week. Additionally, one Azerbaijani serviceman was injured in a landmine explosion in the Shahumyan (Kalbajar) region. These trends contribute to the 200% increase in violence in Azerbaijan over the past week relative to the past month that is flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-23-29-july-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",4 Aug 2022,"Nineteen civil society organisations have started implementing projects to address the urgent needs among war-affected communities, KYIV, 4 August 2022 – Under the EU4Dialogue program, the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine awarded first 19 grants to the civil society organisations (CSOs) to support the first-line response and recovery among women and men from especially hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities in Ukraine., Selected projects cover psychological, legal and administrative aid provision to both IDPs and their host communities, as well as frontline communities, including the areas where the government of Ukraine regained control. In partnership with the civil society, UNDP helps bridge the gap between local authorities, humanitarian organisations and the most vulnerable groups, to ensure fair, inclusive and effective delivery of humanitarian and recovery assistance., “The EU is working on all fronts to support Ukraine and its people. Since the Russian aggression started, the EU has mobilised around €6.8 billion to support Ukraine's overall economic, social and financial resilience in the form of macro-financial assistance, budget support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid,” said Lawrence Meredith, Director of Neighbourhood East and Institution Building at DG NEAR, European Commission. “In addition, we have been tapping into our ongoing cooperation programmes to respond to the immediate needs on the ground. Within the framework of EU4Dialogue, we aim to support those civil society initiatives that are providing relevant assistance to the most vulnerable and conflict-affected people in their communities.”, The projects will be implemented across Ukraine in Donetsk, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Vinnytsia, Zakarpattia, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. For instance, NGO “Pokrovsk Society of the Blind” will work to ensure communities in Donetsk Oblast have access to clean drinking water. Another project in Donetsk Oblast by the Center for Local Community Development NGO aims at creating a hotline for the residents near the contact line., Acting UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine Manal Fouani said that from day one of the war, UNDP has scaled up its support package to the people of Ukraine, focusing on immediate crisis response, maintaining core government functions, and laying the groundwork for early recovery. “We’re also focusing on resilience and development for the millions of displaced people who have fled the violence, enhancing the capacity of their host communities to avail services for all people in need in close collaboration with the civil society. Locally led recovery efforts have shown immense speed, relevance and impact on war affected people.”, According to the latest estimates, almost 6.3 million Ukrainians have been displaced inside the country, while around 5.5 million have fled for temporary protection to neighbouring countries. As estimated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), nearly 16 million people in Ukraine are in immediate need of humanitarian aid., The EU and UNDP agreed to redirect the funds of the EU4Dialogue project to address the most urgent needs of war-affected communities in Ukraine. The regional project aims to contribute towards building a durable foundation for peace by creating better socio-economic conditions and improving human security for war-affected communities., The grant competition “Civil society response to the needs of women and men, especially hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups” is still ongoing. Up to 40 CSOs in total will be supported within the competition.

Bringing light to war-affected communities in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IOM,Shelter and Non-Food Items,4 Aug 2022,"Kharkiv, 4 August 2022 – In a dark, overcrowded cellar in Kharkiv, Ukraine, 40-year-old Natalia is hiding from near-constant air raids occurring nearby. Together with her son, niece, uncle and mother, she lives in one of the most dangerous areas of the city. Sleeping on a cold floor alongside dozens of others, sometimes she does not see the sky for several days., “We were under very fierce shelling. We had nowhere to run, so we went down to the shelter,” she explains. “We have experienced a lot of things here – births, caring for pregnant women, children and a person suffering a heart attack.”, The second largest city in Ukraine, Kharkiv remains under attack by the Russian Federation. As the death and injury toll in this region increases daily, assistance from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is being delivered to help those living in shelters that were not initially designed to accommodate people., Beyond the necessities like food and medicine, they are desperate for news from their families. Solar lamps provided by IOM are helping displaced Ukrainians charge their mobile phones, enabling them to once again hear their loved ones’ voices., In Chernihiv, the country’s northernmost regional capital, 70 per cent of the city lacked electricity due to infrastructure damage caused by heavy shelling from late February to early April. Almost half of the city’s 300,000 population left and hundreds of civilians were killed, according to local authorities. Even now, chaotic shelling puts the lives of people in the region at risk., “It was very scary to live in the darkness, but the worst thing was the lack of communication with relatives. People turned on their phones just for a while and rationed the charge as their treasure,” explains Olga, a staffer of the IOM partner NGO “Ukrainian Prism” that has been delivering the solar lamps and other aid to the most affected areas., “We transported the first batch of solar lamps from IOM in rubber boats across the frosty Desna River, along with the most important cargo for the residents of Chernihiv, when the city was still besieged,” recalls Olga., From the onset of the war, IOM has been delivering much-needed assistance to affected areas of Ukraine, including mattresses, blankets, kitchen and hygiene sets, containers, and tools for minor repairs. Such items are provided through the humanitarian supply chain that ensures continued delivery of necessary goods like food, shelter, blankets, medicines, and others during a disaster., When the war broke out in February, a massive supply chain operation, unprecedented in its size and scale, was set up by IOM. The IOM Supply Chain team was able to establish a complex cross-border operation to bring life-saving items to the most conflict-affected regions of Ukraine. These items have been tailored to meet the urgent needs of people and correspond to the environment in which war-affected communities are living., Solar lamps have become one of the most sought-after items. As an alternative light source, these lamps do not require electricity. The phone recharge function allows people to stay in touch with their families or seek emergency help., IOM and its growing network of implementing partners have been delivering the lamps and other core-relief aid to some of the most vulnerable and affected residents, medical and ambulance staff, as well as emergency teams who provide life-saving support services in the most affected regions of Ukraine., IOM’s local partner, the charitable foundation “Source of Revival” is doing everything possible to help people who remain in Kharkiv as well as those staying in hard-to-reach cities and villages of the region. Because of the shelling, they often travel to deliver humanitarian aid in bulletproof vests and protective helmets., Kateryna, a mother of two, recalls: “The village suffered a lot: airstrikes, tanks, shelling… We survived the most terrible moments: executions of civilians, violence, and death.”, Over time, humanitarian aid began to reach locals, supporting them on their way to recovery. “Solar lamps are a real help for us – we can charge phones and use them for lighting,” says Kateryna., Since 24 February, with the help of the Ukraine Supply Chain, IOM has delivered more than 71,000 solar lamps to affected communities in 10 regions of Ukraine. Solar lamps are part of a broad delivery of non-food assistance. More than 700,000 items have been distributed to 24 different regions with the support of a growing network of implementing partners and various donors., Written by Alisa Kyrpychova, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/bringing-light-war-affected-communities-ukraine
