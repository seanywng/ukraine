The distribution of generators has been initiated to Kyiv oblast which includes Borodianka, Bucha, Irpin, Ivankiv, Makariv, Vorzel. The remaining generators will be delivered to Kharkiv, Kyiv city and probably Chernihiv., 154 reports of attacks on health care have been verified by WHO, resulting in 73 deaths and 52 injuries. Based on pre- war hospital visit data, an average of 175,000 patients were treated per month (data available for 77 of 100 health facilities attacked)., The Ministry of Health and the European Commission are working together to evacuate wounded Ukrainians using the Luftwaffe of the German Armed forces. The ‘Flying Hospital’ - is serving both adults and children with severe injuries, burns and other diseases that are impossible to treat in Ukraine. The special medical flight covers the evacuation route between Lviv – Rzeszow – Cologne is equipped with six modules of intensive care including systems of artificial ventilation, control of circulatory functions and infusions, as well as a portable ultrasound machine. The facility can take up to 38 places for people with minor injuries or 56 places for the wounded and attended by 25 doctors and nurses.

Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2022,"As the war in Ukraine intensifies, people are fleeing to safety at a rapid pace. 11.9 million people have fled their homes. The majority of those fleeing are women and children who urgently need life-saving support for their physical and mental wellbeing. At the start of the war, an estimated 265,000 women were pregnant in Ukraine, with 80,000 expected to give birth in the coming 3 months., There continue to be heartbreaking reports of attacks on hospitals and health infrastructure, with women giving birth in basements and bomb shelters without adequate medical support. There is an urgent need to prioritise health and protection services to reduce suffering, save lives and support those affected., UNFPA, together with partners, is focusing on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), including maternal and newborn health; and protection from sexual and gender-based violence (GBV), predominately for women and girls and the most vulnerable., UNFPA urgently needs flexible financing to scale its operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Most urgently UNFPA needs financing to provide essential medical supplies and deploy further trained personnel to deliver life-saving services. The combined funding needed is $65.6 million; $47.75 million for Ukraine and $15.7 million for Moldova, and $2.2 million for other neighbouring countries until the end of December 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unfpa-appeal-ukraine-19-april-2022
World Bank Group Response to Global Impacts of the War in Ukraine: A Proposed Roadmap,Analysis,World Bank,Recovery and Reconstruction,12 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, i. The war in Ukraine is having worldwide impacts, with enormous human and economic consequences that continue to unfold. This new crisis – for Ukraine, for countries hosting refugees from Ukraine,and for developing countries affected by the worldwide economic impacts – comes at an exceptionally challenging time for poor people already hit by the pandemic, conflict and climate change. The war threatens to further set back progress toward poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and delay green, resilient and inclusive development. It is likely to deepen inequality across and within countries for decades to come., ii. In Ukraine, the direct and immediate toll of the war is vast, including devastation of Ukraine’s economy, infrastructure and living standards. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led to death, disability and displacement; interrupted human capital formation; and caused large-scale job and income losses. The war is rapidly eroding social conditions, with differentiated impacts, including on refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), host communities, and vulnerable groups – especially women, children, the elderly and the disabled. More than 1 in 4 Ukrainians was forcibly displaced within a span of five weeks, including over half of Ukrainian children. Pressures are mounting on countries in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region that have received more than four million refugees, lost access to workers’ remittances, and face the threat of war spreading beyond Ukraine’s borders., iii. Across the wider developing world, the economic and social impacts are spreading through multiple channels, including commodity markets, trade, financial flows, and market confidence. These impacts are differentiated by country circumstances (i.e., fuel importers versus exporters). The conflict is eroding global confidence, weakening growth, increasing fiscal and financial stress, and worsening food and nutrition insecurity. If protracted, it could also exacerbate policy uncertainty and lead to lasting fragmentation of global trade and foreign investment networks – channels that have historically played a central role in supporting global economic growth and poverty reduction., iv. Importantly, the war’s global repercussions are aggravating the large-scale, ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Compounding the impacts of the pandemic and the climate crisis, including extreme weather such as droughts and floods, ripple effects of the war will likely aggravate hunger, malnutrition, food insecurity and deprivation for millions of people around the world. For policymakers, the war’s impacts will further narrow already limited fiscal space and heighten demands – provoking difficult tradeoffs and new risks that urgent needs will displace focus on long-term development, including the climate agenda. Higher prices for basic necessities, increased scarcity and worsening inequality across and within countries could further increase social disruption and exacerbate fragility, conflict and violence., v. The World Bank Group is redoubling efforts to help clients address the severe and growing impacts of the war in Ukraine while continuing to respond to compounding crises – particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change – and pursue durable recovery. Anchored in the WBG twin goals and with continued focus on fostering Green, Resilient and Inclusive Development (GRID), this proposed Roadmap summarizes the ongoing and proposed WBG response to the global impacts of the war in Ukraine. It integrates lessons learned; highlights key uncertainties and risks; and draws on WBG comparative advantages – including optimizing synergies and coordination across the World Bank, IFC and MIGA., vi. The Roadmap discusses the WBG’s initial short-term response and outlines a medium-term, targeted approach encompassing the 15 months from April 2022 to June 2023. In the remaining quarter of FY22 (April – June), the WBG intends to prioritize an initial crisis response with total commitments of around $50 billion. The initial WBG response will include increasing support to (i) Ukraine, (ii) countries hosting refugees from Ukraine, and (iii) the wider developing world to address crisis impacts on the poor and vulnerable. This will build on the results achieved under the COVID-19 Crisis Response. While supporting the needs arising from the war in Ukraine, the WBG will promote sustained focus on longer-term development priorities that are integral to the achievement of the WBG twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Food prices in real terms are going up rapidly in the context of current and anticipated supply constraints. It is critical to avoid making the situation worse by imposing export restrictions and price controls. Enabling market access and protecting the population against food vulnerabilities through social transfers are central to the WBG response. The WBG’s medium-term response, comprising surge financing to facilitate strong client engagement and meet heightened client demand across the WBG client base, will be set out in a Global Crisis Response Framework Paper to be presented to the Board by end-June 2022., vii. Over the coming weeks, Management will explore with its Board of Executive Directors options to put in place a 15-month WBG crisis response envelope of around $170 billion for the period from April 2022 to June 2023. This will support developing countries as they address the human and development setbacks caused by compounding crises – impacts of the war, including food and fuel price shocks, and disruptions to trade, supply chains and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); the COVID-19 pandemic; and climate change. Support for Ukraine, its reconstruction, its people and impacted nearby countries will be integrated, and supported by analytical work. viii. Comprehensive and customized WBG engagement will extend across the client spectrum, including low-income countries (LICs); middle-income countries (MICs); fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs) and small states. In concert with its development partners, the WBG surge crisis response will provide focused support for developing countries as they confront the impacts of the war. In addition to addressing the impact of the war in Ukraine, the proposed surge financing will sustain WBG high impact support for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as promoting durable economic recovery through GRID. Strong partnerships at the international and national level will be integral to WBG crisis response and client engagement.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-bank-group-response-global-impacts-war-ukraine-proposed-roadmap
IMF Executive Board Approves Establishment of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust,News and Press Release,IMF,"Climate Change and Environment
Disaster Management
Health",18 Apr 2022,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the establishment of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help countries build resilience to external shocks and ensure sustainable growth, contributing to their long-term balance of payments stability., The RST will complement the IMF’s existing lending toolkit by focusing on longer-term structural challenges – including climate change and pandemic preparedness – that entail significant macroeconomic risks and where policy solutions have a strong global public good nature., About three quarters of the IMF’s membership will be eligible for longer-term affordable financing from the RST, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and lower middle-income countries., Washington, DC: Challenges from the pandemic, spillovers from geopolitical shocks, and long-standing structural problems pose an enormous impediment for balance of payments stability and resilient and sustainable growth, especially for low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries. In this context, on April 13, 2022, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the establishment of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) with effect from May 1, 2022., The RST will complement the IMF’s existing lending toolkit by focusing on longer-term structural challenges— including climate change and pandemic preparedness—that entail significant macroeconomic risks and where policy solutions have a strong global public good nature . It will channel Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) contributed by countries with strong external positions to countries where the needs are the greatest, providing policy support and affordable longer-term financing to strengthen members’ resilience and sustainability and thereby contributing to prospective balance of payments stability., The RST will be a loan-based trust, with resources mobilized on a voluntary basis. About three quarters of the IMF’s membership will be eligible for longer-term affordable financing from the RST, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and lower middle-income countries. Access will be based on the countries’ reforms strength and debt sustainability considerations and capped at the lower of 150 percent of quota or SDR 1 billion. The loans will have a 20-year maturity and a 10½-year grace period, with borrowers paying an interest rate with a modest margin over the three-month SDR rate, with the most concessional financing terms provided to the poorest countries., The RST will stand ready to commence lending operations once a critical mass of resources from a broad base of contributors is achieved and once sufficiently robust financial systems and processes are in place, which is anticipated to occur by the end of the year. Fundraising toward the estimated total resource needs of about SDR 33 billion (equivalent to US$45 billion) will be initiated immediately., Executive Board Assessment [1], Executive Directors approved the establishment of a Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to support member countries’ longer-term structural reform efforts by channeling SDRs to low-income and vulnerable middle-income members. They concurred that the envisaged role of the Trust to provide affordable long-term financing to enhance economic resilience and sustainability would contribute to prospective balance of payments stability, consistent with the Fund’s purposes. Directors noted that the economic costs of not addressing macro-critical longer-term structural challenges could be very high, and the support from the RST combined with the additional financing it will help catalyze would contribute to alleviating these risks., Most Directors supported RST operations to initially focus on addressing climate change and pandemic preparedness while maintaining flexibility to add additional qualifying challenges in the future with sufficiently broad consensus. A number of Directors, however, proposed expanding from the outset the qualifying challenges to a broader set of longer-term challenges. Directors generally considered that the proposed eligibility criteria, and the resulting list of 143 RST-eligible members, strike the right balance between breadth of access and resource constraints., Directors broadly welcomed the longer lending terms and endorsed the tiered interest rate structure that increases concessionality for lower income members. They noted that periodic interest rate reviews should balance the need to ensure the financial sustainability of the Trust and provide appropriate terms for borrowers, with an interest rate cap to be considered if needed to protect the lowest income borrowers from rising interest rates, following consultations with contributors., Directors endorsed the proposed lending modalities under RSF arrangements. They generally supported the requirement for a concurrent IMF instrument with upper-credit tranche-quality conditionality., Directors agreed with the access norm of 75 percent of quota with an access cap at 150 percent of quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is lower. Many Directors, however, would have preferred higher access limits for small quota countries, vulnerable states, and other qualifying members with large financing needs to address longer-term challenges. Most Directors agreed that RST access would not count towards triggering existing GRA and PRGT exceptional access policies and high combined access safeguards, although some Directors would have preferred such additional safeguards. Directors also welcomed counting RST credit outstanding toward post-financing assessments triggers, which may be recalibrated as appropriate at the RST review., Directors endorsed the governance structure of the RST, which places the IMF’s Executive Board at its center, complemented by consultation with contributors on key issues and requiring the consent by contributors for certain amendments that affect key contributor interests. They emphasized the need for a timely, comprehensive review of the RST, in three years at the latest. They also agreed to an interim review to take stock of the initial experience and revisit the set of qualifying structural challenges at around 18 months after its operationalization. Directors looked forward to receiving regular updates on the adequacy of RST resources with the possibility to adopt contingency measures at that time, typically near the end of each financial year, and on an ad hoc basis if warranted., Noting the large scale of longer-term structural challenges, Directors underscored the importance of close and systematic coordination with the World Bank and other relevant institutions to leverage specialized expertise, provide coherent policy advice, and catalyze financing. They encouraged the prompt development of a coordination framework for pandemic preparedness similar to the proposed framework for climate change., Directors supported the financial design of the RST based on three pillars: a Loan Account (LA), a Reserve Account (RA), and a Deposit Account (DA). They endorsed the terms of the borrowing agreements for the LA, and the contribution agreements for the RA and the DA as detailed in the RST Instrument, including allowing stand-alone contributions to the RA and DA. Directors concurred that the RST’s robust financial framework and the encashment regime of the LA and DA are critical in maintaining the reserve asset nature of creditors’ claims on those accounts of the Trust., Directors emphasized that the financial risks associated with RST lending should be managed carefully through a multilayered risk management framework, including assessments of the member’s capacity to repay and debt sustainability and the RST’s financial design. They stressed the importance of building up strong buffers via gross and net reserves to safeguard against financial risk and to cover administrative expenses of the Trust. Directors called on all Fund members, within the limits of their laws, to treat the RST as a preferred creditor, consistent with such treatment of the GRA and PRGT., Directors recognized the importance of raising sufficient contributions to meet estimated demand for RST financing, calling on members with stronger external positions to finalize contribution agreements in time to start RST operations around the time of the 2022 Annual Meetings. They supported pooling RST assets with those of the PRGT for investment purposes, and urged contributors to the PRGT’s subsidy accounts to consent in a timely manner to the proposed amendment to the PRGT Instrument that would enable such pooling, which is key for RST operationalization. Directors expected that SDR contributors to the RST would participate actively in SDR transactions through their Voluntary Trading Arrangements to support the conversion of channeled SDRs into currencies., Directors recognized that implementation of the RST would result in new demands on staff resources. They agreed that the RST should pay a fee to the GRA to cover trust management activities which would constitute budget receipts. Directors supported reimbursement of the GRA for the cost of administering the Trust excluding activities covered by the fee, which would be discussed in the context of the annual income paper., [1] At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

Update 57 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (19 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,19 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that direct communications between the national regulator and the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had been restored, more than a month after such contact was lost when Russian forces controlled the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General welcomed the re-establishment of phone communication between the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) and the Chornobyl NPP. He said it was another important step in the process of resuming Ukraine’s regulatory control of the site of the 1986 accident, where various radioactive waste management facilities are now located., Russian forces seized the Chornobyl NPP on 24 February and held it for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March. Ukraine informed the IAEA on 10 March that it had lost contact with the NPP site. The regulator continued to receive information about the situation at Chornobyl through senior off-site management of the plant., “This was clearly not a sustainable situation, and it is very good news that the regulator can now contact the plant directly when it needs to,” Director General Grossi said. Reliable communication with the regulator is one of seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security that he outlined at the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine., The Director General plans to head a mission of IAEA experts to the Chornobyl site later this month to conduct nuclear safety, security and radiological assessments, deliver vital equipment and repair the Agency’s remote safeguards monitoring systems there., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, Ukraine said seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said it was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-57-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-19-april-2022
Preparing for the worst: training health workers to deal with casualty surges from the war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",19 Apr 2022,"Figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) show more than 4000 casualties from the war in Ukraine so far. Yet, as the OHCHR acknowledges, the actual number is likely to be far higher given that it is difficult to access accurate information from areas where intense hostilities are ongoing, and that other reports are awaiting corroboration., Ensuring hospitals are prepared for sudden increases in casualties during this emergency is therefore crucial. A big part of this entails fully training health professionals in these institutions not just in the theory but, more importantly, in the practice of organizing and mobilizing resources to deal with these crises effectively., Training in the Republic of Moldova, Recently, WHO at the request of the Moldovan Ministry of Health organized a 3-day course on mass casualty management (MCM), developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. A total of 32 surgeons, traumatologists and facility managers from 13 hospitals benefitted from the training., The Republic of Moldova, a neighbouring country to Ukraine, has already seen 400 000 refugees cross its border for protection. Preparing its health professionals for a potential surge in war casualties has been a key consideration., And as Ion Chesov, Head of the Integrated Services Department at the Ministry of Health, stressed, the benefits of this training go well beyond the current emergency: “We need to ensure the health system as a whole and the facilities in particular are prepared to face any emergency or unexpected disaster. Knowledge in basic and advanced trauma life support are crucial and form the foundation of medical skills in medical doctors.”, Training in Ukraine, This month, WHO also began rolling out the course in Ukraine. The first participants were staff of an ambulance substation in the Lviv region. Training paramedics in this way will allow them to provide appropriate assistance to victims even before they have reached hospitals. WHO has engaged Ukrainian emergency physicians to deliver the training, and is planning to deliver more sessions across the country., Speaking about the course, Johan von Schreeb, WHO Emergency Medical Team Coordinator in Ukraine, commented: “In the country today, this type of training, unfortunately, is very much needed. We see a lot of mass casualty situations where many people have been injured simultaneously. That is very challenging for the health system and for the staff who have to make rapid, critical decisions for prioritizing the evacuation of the injured. Practising the triage of patients is a very useful exercise, and we need to do more of it. We can’t simply do it using presentations. You have to be exposed to the stress, the decision-making, the organization and the chaos, and we try to simulate that as much as possible through the training.”, About the course, The MCM course was developed in collaboration with WHO’s Emergency Medical Team, the Karolinska Institutet (a WHO collaborating centre) and the WHO Academy. The course developers recognized that mass casualties following disasters and significant incidents, often characterized by large numbers of severe and diverse injuries, can rapidly overwhelm the ability of health facilities to deliver adequate medical care., The training addresses the organization and actions of staff working in emergency units, with a focus on the first 30 minutes after the announcement of a mass casualty incident. Taking a practical, hands-on approach, the training focuses on stabilizing injured patients and carrying out triage, as well as working as a team, acquiring new skills and changing ways of working. In addition, specific MCM trainings are provided to emergency staff working in hospitals.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/preparing-worst-training-health-workers-deal-casualty-surges-war-ukraine

Women and children comprise the vast majority of the 12 million people fleeing their homes., “Women and girls affected by the war in Ukraine face ongoing threats to their health and safety, and their needs must be prioritized,” said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA. “Women do not stop getting pregnant or giving birth during conflict, and their access to lifesaving health services is literally under attack in Ukraine. With health and social service facilities being bombed and shelled, and reports of rape and other forms of gender-based violence rising, UNFPA is focused on meeting the distinct needs of women and girls.”, To respond to soaring humanitarian needs in Ukraine, UNFPA, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, is coordinating and bolstering life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, and protection and response services for survivors of physical and sexual violence., More than 13 metric tons of reproductive health supplies were delivered to seven hospitals in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Zaporizhzhya. An additional 27 tons of critical reproductive health supplies, medicines and equipment have arrived in Ukraine and will be distributed to maternity hospitals in war-torn Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolaiv and four more cities to meet the needs of 1.5 million people. Another 41 metric tons of reproductive health supplies are scheduled to arrive later in April and May. UNFPA is also distributing dignity kits with sanitary pads and other essential items to support women’s hygiene., As women grapple with the threat of violence, and reports of rape and human rights violations increase, UNFPA is supporting 30 shelters, crisis rooms and daily care centres for displaced women and survivors of violence. Psychosocial mobile teams will be dispatched to 12 regions across Ukraine in the next two weeks. Staffed by psychologists and social workers, the UNFPA-supported teams will provide psychosocial support to women experiencing trauma or violence., “Here in Ukraine, the needs are rising exponentially. We are working closely with the government and other partners to provide lifesaving services for women and girls, but much more needs to be done. We need to reach many more people, including survivors of gender-based violence. We are appealing for increased support to respond to this growing humanitarian crisis,"" said Jaime Nadal Roig, UNFPA Representative in Ukraine., In Moldova, host to some 100,000 refugees that are staying in the country, UNFPA has signed an agreement with the National Health Insurance Company to guarantee refugees, including women who are pregnant or have given birth, access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care. This includes critical maternal health services, such as caesarean sections to save the lives of women and newborns., UNFPA recently delivered 10 tons of reproductive health supplies to Moldova, including for the management of obstetric emergencies, to hospitals and 41 youth-friendly health centers in the capital Chisinau and to every district of the country. To ensure women living in host families can continue to access life-saving health services, UNFPA-supported service centers across the country are being expanded with “Orange Safe Spaces” to provide family planning and counseling and referrals for refugees traumatized by the war. The referral system for survivors of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, has been developed based on existing national systems and services in collaboration with the authorities and NGOs specialized in health, legal, and social services, as well as law enforcement bodies., “UNFPA is working with the Government of Moldova and partners to support refugees from Ukraine,” said Nigina Abaszada, UNFPA Representative in Moldova. “It is heartbreaking to hear the stories of women who fled so quickly with so little, and fear for their future and their families. UNFPA supports the government in strengthening the public health system to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of women and girl refugees and host communities and ensure uninterrupted access to needed health and gender-based violence services.”, As part of the United Nations led appeal for Ukraine and the regional refugee response plan, UNFPA seeks $65.6 million to meet the needs of vulnerable people, including women and girls, older people and people with disabilities, in Ukraine and in neighboring countries. UNFPA thanks all governments that have provided support for the health and protection of women and girls., UNFPA media contacts:, Photos and video available on UNFPA response to the Ukraine crisis.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 18 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,19 Apr 2022,"From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 18 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 4,966 civilian casualties in the country: 2,104 killed and 2,862 injured. This included:, a total of 2,104 killed (556 men, 333 women, 39 girls, and 60 boys, as well as 71 children and 1,045 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,862 injured (331 men, 264 women, 59 girls, and 63 boys, as well as 155 children and 1,990 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,129 casualties (739 killed and 1,390 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 1,730 casualties (660 killed and 1,070 injured),  On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 399 casualties (79 killed and 320 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,837 casualties (1,365 killed and 1,472 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 19 April (local time), 205 children had been killed and 367 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-18-april-2022-enruuk
War in Ukraine: FAO renews appeal to bolster agriculture and provide urgent support to vulnerable rural households,News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture

Food and Nutrition",19 Apr 2022,"Over $115 million urgently needed to assist Ukrainian farmers and rural households through December 2022, Rome -- Some $115.4 million are urgently needed to prevent a further deterioration of the food insecurity situation and worsening of the disruption of food supply chains in Ukraine. There is urgency to support Ukrainian farmers in planting vegetables and potatoes during this spring season, and farmers should be allowed and supported to go to their fields and save the winter wheat harvest, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said today., With this Plan, in line with the revised Inter-Agency Flash Appeal, FAO has more than doubled its initial request of $50 million to support 376 660 small- and medium-sized farming households or almost one million people through December 2022., ""As food access, production and overall food availability deteriorate in many parts of Ukraine as a result of the war, efforts to bolster agricultural production and the functioning of food supply chains will be critical to averting a food crisis in 2022 and into 2023,"" said Rein Paulsen, FAO Director of Emergencies and Resilience. ""FAO's immediate concern is to support the ongoing spring planting season and to prevent the disruption of the upcoming winter crop harvesting, which typically occurs in June-July, and could severely threaten food security in the country. Agriculture depends on seasons. There is no time to waste to get ready for the upcoming fall season."", Agriculture is central to Ukraine's economy, playing a key role in protecting food security and livelihoods across the country, as well as the region. The vast destruction of crops and infrastructure due to the war jeopardizes food production and food security., FAO estimates that one‑third of the crops and agricultural land may not be harvested or cultivated in 2022. The forced displacement of civilian populations fleeing the war and the conscription of men into territorial defence forces is resulting in labour shortages and an increased burden on women. This situation is exacerbated by a decrease in the access and availability of crucial agricultural inputs., Preliminary data collected by FAO, through ongoing assessments, demonstrates that farmers at all levels need cash to procure inputs and services for food production and to maintain their farming operations., Scaling up FAO's response, The impacts of the war necessitate a large‑scale expansion of FAO activities and technical support across the country., FAO needs to provide crop and other inputs in the immediate and medium‑term. In the immediate term, the provision of vegetable and crop seed along with cash will ensure that seasonal deadlines for food production are met., Support for livestock holders will include the distribution of small livestock, animal health inputs, feed and fodder to allow vulnerable households to produce milk, meat and eggs to meet the growing local demand., FAO will continue to support medium-sized producers and key market actors along agrifood supply chains to bolster market functionality and access to food in key communities and urban centres., In addition, FAO will provide unconditional cash transfers that can support a wide range of basic needs of displaced and other vulnerable, conflict-affected households. Recipients can use cash to support food production and sale including labour, transportation, veterinary services and equipment, in areas where these are locally available in the markets., FAO's funding to date is of $8.5 million to reach 70 941 people with livelihoods support. It comprises FAO funds and contributions from resource partners including Japan, Belgium, the European Union, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA). The contributions come at a critical time in the response to the crisis. The funds will support small-scale farmers to maintain minimum food production through the provision of wheat seeds and key agricultural inputs. The funding gap is now $106.9 million. With more resources, FAO will be able to reach more people in time for the spring season., More on this topic, Ukraine: Rapid Response Plan March--December 2022, Ukraine: Note on the impact of the war on food security in Ukraine, Gender-related impacts of the Ukraine Conflict, Ukraine: Humanitarian response update, Contact, Irina Utkina

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Apr 2022,"KEY FINDINGS, • Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts have recorded around 50% of all reported conflict events in Ukraine since the beginning of the war on 24 February 2022. Together with high access constraints, the situation has led to severe information gaps around the needs and living conditions of people remaining in these oblasts., • Access dynamics vary within the three oblasts and depend on the degree of active conflict, divided control over the territories, damages to roads and critical infrastructure, and landmine contamination. The encircled city of Mariupol, non-government controlled areas (NGCAs), and contested areas that came under Russian control after 24 February likely experience the highest degree of access constraints and severity of needs., • The humanitarian situation in areas of heavy conflict and shelling is dire, with civilians forced to find shelter and endure frequent electricity, heating, telecommunication, and water cuts resulting from damages to critical infrastructure. Active hostilities drastically reduce the mobility of people and goods, threaten civilian lives, restrict aid delivery, and prevent humanitarians from accessing people in need of life-saving aid., • Russian forces began a new offensive operation in eastern Ukraine on 18 April. Fighting will likely further intensify in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk oblasts in the coming weeks. There are also concerns over international humanitarian law violations as related reports emerge from areas previously affected by intense fighting in the country",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-donetsk-kharkiv-and-luhansk

On 4th March 2022, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, spoke of multiple cases of sexual violence in Ukrainian cities which have been occupied., Following this, four Ukrainian MPs who visited the U.K Parliament, reported that Russian soldiers were deliberately targeting women and children after Ukraine did not surrender. They reported women, including senior citizens, being gang-raped and in some instances killed. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister, Olha Stefanishyna has also accused Russian soldiers of raping Ukrainian women for hours and then killing them., There have been multiple reports of Russian soldiers breaking down the doors of cellars and basement where people were sheltering and raping women. Some women were raped in front of their children and there have been allegations of these violent attacks being filmed and put on porn sites by Russian soldiers. Reports of soldiers carrying drugs, Viagra, and multiple packets of condoms have also come to light, raising questions on whether these items were purchased privately or had been supplied., Due to ongoing hostilities and because many occupied towns and cities have been isolated with most telecommunications down, it has been difficult to independently verify these claims and for reports of sexual violence and further atrocities against civilians to come to light. Reports of sexual violence have been made by civilians who have managed to flee and by survivors from recently liberated areas. Others have been reported on social media or have emerged after the Ukrainian Security Service (SSU) intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers and relatives or friends in Russia where they have bragged about incidents of rape., It is likely that more reported incidents of sexual violence will emerge in the coming weeks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sexual-violence-and-ukraine-conflict-april-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",7 Apr 2022,"THE WAR IN UKRAINE, The war in Ukraine has rapidly taken the form of a series of conflicts in urban contexts. Urban warfare has a long history, but unfortunately, we can see from this conflict just how topical it remains. Generally, a first phase involves imposing a siege and forcing the city to surrender by making living conditions impossible. The sieges of Constantinople, Troy, Stalingrad and so many others are being reproduced as food and water supplies to Ukrainian cities are cut (with the addition of electricity supplies in the modern world). Throughout history these sieges have generally led to massacres, with populations put to the sword, and women and children raped and enslaved. In Ukraine’s recent history, the same chain of events took place at the beginning of the Second World War, with the siege of Kiev by the Wehrmacht whose atrocities are still present in the popular imagination. For many Ukrainians, the idea of surrendering after a siege is impossible. As for the Russian camp, even though current International Humanitarian Law bans such practices targeting civilians, the Kremlin clearly does not care, as is evident from its previous actions in Chechnya and Syria., If the Russians fail to force the Ukrainians to surrender by means of sieges, the alternative for the Russian army is an offensive with tanks and troops on the ground. From a military point of view, this would be more complicated.
In such a scenario, Ukrainian resistance snipers, home-made explosive devices and mines, as well as ambushes, suicide attacks and other ‘weapons of the weak’ would make the Russian troops’ progress slow and dangerous. In order to save troops, armies adopt a simple strategy of total destruction with the attendant terror that this brings.
Modern urban warfare therefore consists of intense bombing to avoid placing an army on the ground who would have to combat guerrilla forces one street - and one building - at a time. Cities are left in ruins and their terrified populations have nowhere to go and nowhere to hide. The objective of this form of urban war is of course to encourage leaders to surrender so that their populations are not massacred. As such, there are two competing objectives: on the one hand, increasing the destruction, and therefore the terror, and on the other, resisting1 (when we are dealing with major shocks of this kind, it is no longer appropriate to speak of resilience).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/key-messages-aid-ukraine-good-practices-and-coordination-issues-7-april-2022

Direct Relief has also shipped 14 million doses of levothyroxine, a drug used to treat impaired thyroid function, for further distribution among health facilities in Ukraine., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. Even though hostilities continue to be concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, several oblasts across the country have been affected by missile strikes, reportedly resulting in multiple civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. Apart from the areas that were affected by hostilities in the past week (eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts, and southern Khersonska oblast), damage and civilian casualties were also reported in Dnipropetrovska (centre), Kirovohradska (centre), Kyivska (north), Lvivska (west), Mykolaivska (south) and Poltavska (centre) oblasts., On 16 April, WCK CEO Nate Mook informed that one of the WCK-operated restaurants in Kharkiv was severely damaged reportedly as a result of a missile strike, injuring four WCK staff members. This incident comes shortly after the statement published by Caritas last week, confirming the deaths of two of its staff members and five of their relatives in Mariupol (Donetska oblast) in mid-March. In response to the Mariupol incident, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths called upon the parties of the conflict to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians., As hostilities rage on, the civilian toll of the ongoing fighting continues to grow. As of 17 April, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 4,890, including 2,072 killed and 2,818 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and airstrikes. OHCHR believes the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration., Impacts on food and nutrition. According to the Ukrainian Minister of Agriculture Mykola Soskyi, even if the fighting ended tomorrow, the wave of high prices for basic food commodities would still be felt globally for another three-to-five years. As reported earlier, Ukraine, along with the Russian Federation, is one of the world’s top producers and exporters of staples, including wheat and barley, maize and sunflower oil. Mr. Sokyi further explained that even if agricultural production were able to continue now, Ukraine then faces the problem of how to export grain and other products in the current circumstances., According to the Minister, there is now a significant surplus of oil and grain in Ukraine. The latter is about 20 million tons and the remnants of wheat stand at twice the domestic demand. Reportedly, certain logistics chains are already operating on the borders with Hungary, Poland and Romania, but the neck of export routes is still too narrow, while the demand is high. Last week, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres presented the first detailed brief of the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance (GCRG), which was set up to study the effects of the war in Ukraine on the most vulnerable. In its brief, GCRG warned that the Ukraine crisis risks tipping up to 1.7 billion people — over one-fifth of the global population — into poverty, destitution and hunger., Impacts on migrants’ rights. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor (EMHRM) has described in a 17 April report Ukraine’s reported detention of dozens of migrants during the current conflict as “inhumane and unjustifiable.” The organization says that around 45 migrants are reportedly being held at the Zhuravychi Migrant Accommodation Centre in Volynska oblast (west) after having attempted to cross the border into Poland and been handed over to the Ukrainian authorities. EMHRM also reports that, after summary court proceedings without any legal counseling or the possibility to claim asylum, the migrants were sentenced to between 6 and 18 months of detention for irregular crossing. The organization describes the conditions at the accommodation centre as difficult even before the recent escalation, which has “significantly worsened” since. The EMHRM report includes descriptions of reported intimidation and violence at the Zhuravychi centre and concludes that its location places dozens of Afghan, Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani and Sudanese nationals at risk solely because of their irregular migration status., Eastern Ukraine. The fiercest fighting reportedly continues to take place in eastern Ukraine, primarily in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts and in parts of Kharkivska oblast. According to the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, between 13 and 17 April, 18 civilians were reportedly killed and another 106 injured as a result of active fighting and airstrikes in Kharkiv alone. Dozens of civilian casualties and scores of homes and other civilian infrastructure damaged were also reported in both Government- and non-Government-controlled parts of Donetska and Luhanska oblast, according to Ukrainian local authorities and entities in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA)., Southern Ukraine. According to the mayor of Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast), on 15 April, 39 civilians were reportedly injured as a result of an alleged attack on the city. Moreover, Mykolaivska oblast Governor Vitaliy Kim informed that the city of Mykolaiv and the surrounding areas had reportedly been under continuous rocket attacks since 17 April, already resulting in damage to power lines and water infrastructure. In addition, according to the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster, Mykolaiv has now been without piped water for four days, forcing people to use water from streams and rivers., Western Ukraine. The city of Lviv (Lvivska oblast), hosting dozens of diplomatic missions and international organizations that relocated from Kyiv, was reportedly hit by several missiles on 18 April, reportedly leaving seven people killed and 11 injured, according to local authorities. The city of Lviv was reportedly last affected by hostilities on 28 March, when the Aircraft Repair Plant was allegedly destroyed. Meanwhile, the incident that happened earlier today is likely the first one that caused civilian casualties, although OHCHR has not yet confirmed the information about the casualties., Displacement. The number of people displaced by the ongoing fighting has now surpassed the 12-million mark: over 4.9 million people have crossed international borders and at least 7.1 million have been displaced internally since 24 February., Between 15 and 17 April, according to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine, more than 4,300 civilians were evacuated from areas affected by hostilities. Evacuations from Luhanska oblast have reportedly become more complicated as the fighting intensifies, and on 17 April, it was allegedly impossible to evacuate people from Lysychansk (Luhanska oblast) due to continuous shelling. Further, no evacuation routes were reportedly agreed upon for 18 April, according to the Ministry for Reintegration. Separately, the Russian Federation reported that, since 24 February, more than 863,600 people, including more than 158,170 children, have crossed into its territory. The UN does not have the means to verify the number of people who crossed international borders reported by the UN Member States. At the same time, as of 17 April, UNHCR estimates that over 522,000 people have sought refuge in the Russian Federation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-18-april-2022
First Person: A month in a Mariupol basement,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,19 Apr 2022,"Invading Russian forces have almost completely destroyed Mariupol, a port city in southern Ukraine. Former resident Alina Beskrovna recalled to UN News, a month-long ordeal sheltering in a basement there as she witnessed fierce fighting and obliteration, before her eventual escape., The United Nations continues to provide assistance inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries to people displaced by the ongoing conflict, “On the morning of the invasion I left my apartment and spent almost a month in a basement on the outskirts of Mariupol, until I escaped on 23 March., The first few days felt like a weird slumber party, just getting together with friends. We had everything we needed…until we didn't., First the electricity went, when Russia bombed the city’s electrical system. Laptops and cell phones began to run out of battery., Then the Russians targeted the water system. We filled up all the buckets we possibly could while the taps were still running, but we quickly realized that a lack of drinking water would be a huge problem., And then we heard a large blast, and the gas went out, which meant gathering and chopping wood, and cooking on open fires outside the basement entrance., ‘People jumped to their deaths’, By the end of the second week, we heard continuous shelling approaching from the northern part of the city, targeting residential districts near us. Two missiles hit a nine-storey building on the other side of the road, right across from our basement. We saw the fourth floor engulfed in flames and people jumping to their deaths., Whenever a missile landed close by, it felt like it was going straight through us. We would feel the shockwaves; the cracks in the basement wall and floor would widen with every single hit, and we would wonder if the foundations of the building could take it., ‘I don’t know if my father is alive’, Early in the invasion, a communication station behind one of the residential high-rises was targeted by the Russians., I knew why it was being done: To leave us completely helpless and hopeless, demoralized, and cut off from the outside world., I lost contact with my father. He was on the other side of the city and I was not sure if I would ever see him again. I only hoped that he would walk over to us, since he knew the address, but he never did. I still don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he was taken to Russia by force., Rumours began spreading about how the city had fallen, how it was now Russian territory. We heard horrific stories of Chechens roaming the streets, raping women, killing civilians at point blank range, and how dangerous it was to even try to leave because of active fighting on all three sides of the city., So, no one dared to escape. Because of the lack of communication with the outside world, it felt as if there was a huge mass murder taking place right around me, and that the world had no idea, and would never find out the true scale of what was happening., Fear of rape, I had two main fears. One was rape – which is used as a weapon of war by the Russian military, and we all knew this – and the second one was being either taken to Russia by force or to the so-called Donetsk People's Republic., I also worried about Mariupol being proclaimed as part of the Donetsk People's Republic – barring any hope of my leaving., I just kept thinking, will they let us out? Is there a way out?, An opportunity to escape, Anyone who didn’t get out in the first three or four days, was unable to leave afterwards, because of active fighting and Russian forces approaching the city from all three sides., Those who tried to flee found themselves in a battlefield., All we could do was wait for a possible corridor to open up. Around the second week of the war, a rumour spread on a Russian Telegram [social media platform] channel, that an organized column was gathering at the theatre, heading west towards Manhush., Everyone who had a vehicle and enough fuel, put some white pieces of cloth on their side mirrors to signify that they were civilians trying to flee, and went to the collection point., But there was nothing. It turned out to be a false rumour., By 20 March, the Russians has completely taken over the strip of land by the Azov Sea, from Berdyansk and Manhush, all the way to the outskirts of Mariupol., Three days later we decided to leave despite reports of civilians being targeted, as the city was being under siege by carpet and precision bombings., I saw with my own eyes how they aimed at apartment buildings, as if they were playing a computer game., We were running out of food and water. I hadn't had a shower for a month., ‘Horrific’ journey, At 7:00 AM on the morning of 23 March, we started out for Zaporizhzhia. After 16 Russian checkpoints, a trip that usually took three hours cost us more than 14., The drive itself was horrific. The Russian military strip-searched us, checking documents and detaining every male.

Protection and Human Rights",18 Apr 2022,"SECRETARY-GENERAL/UKRAINE, The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by the continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities across the country, including most recently Lviv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, which are resulting in numerous civilian casualties and destruction in residential areas, as well as civilian infrastructure. The Secretary-General is greatly concerned by the continuing appalling humanitarian situation in the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been largely destroyed by weeks of unrelenting Russian attacks. The Secretary-General reminds all parties that they must take outmost care exert take all necessary efforts measures to avoid civilian casualties and any damage to residential areas and civilian infrastructure. The Secretary-General strongly urges all parties to enact an urgent and immediate humanitarian ceasefire, which will enable the safe and secure functioning of humanitarian corridors, help evacuate civilian residents and also deliver life-saving humanitarian and medical assistance. Genuine negotiations must be given a chance to succeed and to bring lasting peace. The Secretary-General and the UN stand ready to support such efforts., UKRAINE, Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Ukraine has endured 136 attacks on healthcare facilities, which have killed 73 people, and injured 52 others. This means that Ukraine accounts for more than 68 per cent of all attacks on health care worldwide in 2022., Also today, our humanitarian colleagues said that more than one in four people in Ukraine has been displaced, amounting to 12 million people - including 4.9 million refugees and 7.1 million internally displaced persons. At the same time, returns to Ukraine are increasing. We have reports from border services that more than 870,000 people have returned since 24 February. Recent returnees include women and children and older people, and returnees are creating new challenges for the humanitarian response in terms of reconstruction and reintegration. /... More than 1,300 UN staff in Ukraine engaged in the humanitarian response. We, along with our humanitarian partners, have eight operational hubs: Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Lviv, Uzhorod, Mukachevo, Chernivitzi, Luhansk and Donetsk. Hubs will also be set up in Odesa, Mariupol and Kharkiv, as conditions allow. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) office is reopening in Kyiv – and the Head of Office, Esteban Sacco, is there now. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that as of 15 April, more than 155,000 people have been assisted with multi-purpose cash, provided by 22 partners. This figure is expected to ramp up quickly. A convoy planned for 14 April from Odesa to Kherson could not proceed due to lack of security guarantees. The convoy was offloaded in Odesa on 13 April and the cargo was dispatched to two NGOs, which will distribute the supplies in Kherson oblast through the Ukraine Red Cross and voluntary organizations., The Ukraine Flash Appeal is 68 per cent funded as of 18 April, at $774 million., The Country-based Pooled Fund - the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund - has received $126 million to date, of which $66 million has been paid.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/highlights-noon-briefing-st-phane-dujarric-spokesman-secretary-general-ant-nio
Briefing note: The human rights situation of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities in Ukraine (1 February 2022),Analysis,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,1 Feb 2022,"SUMMARY, In line with the principle to leave no one behind defined in the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 and its unequivocal commitment to end discrimination and exclusion, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has been monitoring the human rights situation of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities., The briefing note presents the results of this work, describes human rights violations and concerns affecting persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities in Ukraine and provides recommendations. The briefing note focuses on two major concerns affecting the rights of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities – institutionalisation and denial of legal capacity – and analyses the impact of these and other concerns on the range of human rights provided in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other universal international human rights instruments applicable in Ukraine., Persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities are the group that is most represented in institutions in Ukraine. They continue to be placed in long-term care facilities, which remain almost the only option for accommodation and social care. Many facilities accommodate over a hundred residents, without the capacity to provide individualised social services and support. Persons living in such facilities are cut off from local communities, the social and medical services provided there, and official employment. Only in rare examples can they return to living in the community. Most of the persons are trapped in long-term care facilities for life. Grave human rights violations, such as torture, ill-treatment, involuntary medication, forced labour and deprivation of personal liberty occur in such institutions. Denial of the right to private life and family life, as well as the right to sexual and reproductive health, is another pervasive human rights concern in long-term care facilities., A decade after Ukraine ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, no measures have been taken to start the implementation of article 12, on equal recognition before the law. Denial of legal capacity continues to be widespread in Ukraine and more than 40 thousand people are not allowed to make decisions about their own lives. A human rights violation per se, the denial of legal capacity of persons with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities also affects other human rights. The law explicitly prohibits incapacitated persons to vote in elections and referendums, establish or join civil society organizations and political parties, dispose of their property and social payments., A complete move away from institutionalising persons with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities and amending the civil legislation on legal capacity could take years or decades. An important start to this process are the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to develop access to social services in the community, which are the precursors of these two major reforms. The briefing note contains recommendations to address the human rights concerns outlined in the paper, including for deinstitutionalisation of persons with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities and reform of the system that regulates legal capacity, and suggests possible directions for cooperation between government, international partners and civil society.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/briefing-note-human-rights-situation-persons-intellectual-and-psychosocial
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 17 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,18 Apr 2022,"Date: 18 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 17 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 4,890 civilian casualties in the country: 2,072 killed and 2,818 injured. This included:, a total of 2,072 killed (537 men, 327 women, 38 girls, and 60 boys, as well as 71 children and 1,039 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,818 injured (327 men, 253 women, 56 girls, and 61 boys, as well as 155 children and 1,966 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 2,103 casualties (732 killed and 1,371 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,712 casualties (653 killed and 1,059 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 391 casualties (79 killed and 312 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,787 casualties (1,340 killed and 1,447 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 18 April (local time), 205 children had been killed and at least 362 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-17-april-2022-enruuk
La détention par l'Ukraine de dizaines de migrants pendant la guerre est inhumaine et injustifiable,News and Press Release,Euro-Med Monitor,Protection and Human Rights,17 Apr 2022,"Zhuravychi - Les migrants noirs et bruns toujours enfermés dans un centre de détention pour immigrés en Ukraine sans possibilité de libération courent un risque grave d'être attaqués en raison de la négligence des fonctionnaires, a averti l'Observatoire Euro-Med des Droits de l'Homme dans une déclaration aujourd'hui. Cette négligence est un nouveau reflet de l'épouvantable double standard en matière de protection des civils en temps de guerre., Au moins 45 personnes semblent rester confinées dans le centre d'hébergement pour migrants de Zhuravychi, une ancienne caserne de l'armée située dans une forêt de pins dans la province de Volyn, au nord-ouest de l'Ukraine. La caserne a été transformée en centre de détention pour migrants en 2007 grâce à des fonds de l'Union européenne., Nombre de ces personnes sont des migrants qui ont tenté de franchir la frontière polonaise, mais ont été interceptés par les gardes-frontières polonais et remis directement aux autorités ukrainiennes. À l'issue d'une procédure judiciaire sommaire, sans aucun conseil juridique ni possibilité de demander l'asile, ils ont été condamnés à des peines allant de six à 18 mois pour franchissement irrégulier., Depuis plus d'une décennie, l'Ukraine agit comme un garde-frontière pour le reste de l'Europe, empêchant les migrants en quête de sécurité d'entrer dans la zone de l'UE. Même aujourd'hui, au milieu des hostilités actuelles, elle semble continuer à jouer ce rôle., Les conditions dans le centre de détention de Zhuravychi étaient déjà difficiles avant le conflit, mais elles se sont considérablement dégradées depuis le 24 février. À la suite de l'invasion russe à grande échelle du pays, tous les migrants détenus ont été déplacés dans l'un des deux bâtiments du complexe, libérant le second pour les soldats ukrainiens., Le centre ne dispose d'aucun abri anti-aérien ou anti-bombe, et les prises de courant dans les cellules ne fonctionnent plus, ce qui rend la communication avec le monde extérieur et l'échange d'informations de plus en plus difficiles. Dans le même temps, les migrants se trouvant dans le centre de détention pouvaient certainement entendre les bruits de tirs d'artillerie et d'explosions, tout en n'ayant aucune idée de l'identité de l'auteur ou de la distance à laquelle il se trouve., Quelques jours après le début de l'invasion russe, un groupe de détenus s'est rassemblé dans la cour du centre pour protester contre leurs conditions de vie et demander leur libération, mais les gardiens ont réprimé la manifestation par la force et ont même frappé certains détenus avec des matraques., Selon plusieurs détenus, les gardes ukrainiens leur ont dit qu'ils pourraient quitter Zhuravychi s'ils participaient à l'effort de guerre ukrainien. Dans ce cas, disent ces détenus, ils auraient tous reçu immédiatement la citoyenneté ukrainienne et des papiers, mais personne n'a accepté l'offre., Jusqu'à présent, il semble que cinq hommes et une femme aient été libérés, et ce uniquement grâce aux fonctionnaires de leur ambassade qui sont intervenus et ont facilité leur voyage en toute sécurité vers la frontière polonaise., Bien que le centre de détention soit situé près de Lutsk - une ville qui a récemment fait l'objet d'attaques répétées - et non loin de la frontière biélorusse, le centre de Zhuravychi semble toujours fonctionner et détenir des dizaines d'Afghans, de Pakistanais, d'Indiens, de Soudanais et de Bangladais, uniquement en raison de leur statut d'immigrés clandestins., ""Il n'y a aucune justification pour garder des personnes déjà déplacées piégées dans un centre de détention au milieu d'une zone de guerre"", a déclaré Michela Pugliese, chercheuse en migration et asile d'Euro-Med Monitor. ""Nous demandons aux autorités européennes et ukrainiennes de les considérer comme les civils vulnérables qu'ils sont, d'écouter leur panique aveugle et de permettre leur évacuation et leur passage en toute sécurité vers les pays voisins, exactement comme [ils le feraient] pour n'importe quel Ukrainien fuyant les mêmes bombes ""., Euro-Med Monitor appelle d'urgence les autorités ukrainiennes à libérer immédiatement les civils toujours piégés dans le centre de détention de Zhuravychi et à leur permettre de contacter leur ambassade ou consulat., En outre, Euro-Med Monitor demande à la Commission européenne de soutenir le passage en toute sécurité de ces migrants vers la Pologne ou ailleurs en Europe en fonction des préférences individuelles, tout comme les réfugiés ukrainiens protégés par la directive sur la protection temporaire ; de leur garantir le même accueil et la même protection au sein de l'UE ; et d'étendre les garanties fournies par la directive sur la protection temporaire à tous ceux qui fuient le conflit, y compris les migrants sans papiers et les personnes au statut juridique incertain qui sont coincés dans un dangereux vide juridique.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/la-d-tention-par-lukraine-de-dizaines-de-migrants-pendant-la-guerre-est-inhumaine-et
Fresh attacks on cities show no safe place for children in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,18 Apr 2022,"Lviv, Monday 18 April – Recent aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine show there is no safe place in the country for children, Save the Children said today. It is now more urgent than ever that parties to the conflict agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, as the best way to protect children from violence, the child rights organisation said., Seven civilians were reportedly killed, and eight injured, including a child, in airstrikes in L'viv this morning. Meanwhile in Kyiv, which has seen relative quiet over the past few weeks, there have been fresh airstrikes over the weekend, leading to the mayor of the city advising residents who fled the capital earlier in the escalation of the conflict not to return., Conflict is surging in the east of Ukraine, with reports of further deaths from airstrikes in Kharkiv yesterday, which was Orthodox Palm Sunday in the country. This follows the deaths of at least 10 people, including a 15-year-old boy and a baby, and injuries of 35 in strikes on the city on Friday., This fresh wave of violence is in addition to the latest official UN figures published on 15 April, showing a total of 4,633 civilian casualties -- both deaths and injuries -- across the country, 418 of them children., Save the Children's Ukraine Country Director Pete Walsh said:, ""With every new incident in Ukraine, the country becomes less safe for children. The attacks of the past few days remind us loud and clear: there is no safe place here for children, and the situation is changing by the day., ""Two thirds of children in the entire country have now been uprooted from their homes. When there are aerial bombardments, children on the move, without shelter or cover, are more vulnerable. Some children in Ukraine have spent eight years living in conflict., ""Already our colleagues are reporting signs of severe psychological distress from the children they are speaking to across the country. The longer this goes on, the worse it will get. Ending the violence now is the only way we can protect children from harm and safely deliver crucial humanitarian assistance to those who desperately need it."", Notes to editors:, You can donate to Save the Children's Children Emergency Fund, which supports children affected by crises, such as the Ukraine conflict, here., ENDS, For further enquiries please contact:, Anna Rauhanen anna.rauhanen@savethechildren.org (based in London), Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fresh-attacks-cities-show-no-safe-place-children-ukraine
Ukraine: Evacuations from Eastern Oblasts (April 2022),Assessment,REACH,"Food and Nutrition

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Apr 2022,"Context and Methodology, Since the escalation of conflict in February 2022, over 7.14 million people have been displaced internally throughout Ukraine. Since the beginning of April, shifts in military trends have led to a second wave of population movement out of Eastern Oblasts, including Donetska and Luhanska, as well as Kharkiv and Mariupol, largely toward the direction of Dnipro. On 7th April 2022, the Mayor of Dnipro urged women, children and elderly new arrivals to move onwards from the city of Dnipro, in the light of the threat of conflict. As a result, key Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) arrival hubs and transit hubs in Central and Eastern Oblasts are seeing an increase in new arrivals, often in areas which were already overwhelmed by the arrival of previous waves of IDPs since the beginning of the conflict. In order to support the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations recently evacuated from the East of Ukraine and to better understand the situation in their areas of origin, REACH conducted a Rapid Assessment through 18 Key Informants Interviews with aid agencies, local authorities and collective site managers in Vinnytsia, Kropyvnytskyi, Cherkasy and Dnipro between April 09 and April 14. Interviews covered population movement patterns, demographic profile of the displaced, as well as local preparedness to new IDP arrivals and critical unmet needs. This brief presents a summary of findings from the assessment mission. Due to the purposive nature of the sampling methodology, findings should be considered indicative only., Summary of Findings, In early April, concerns began to mount regarding a potential large scale offensive in the Donbass region. Authorities in Eastern Oblasts have called for a mass evacuation of women, children and elderly people via Dnipro. In addition to arrivals from the East, KIs report that Dnipro is also receiving evacuees from Kharkiv area to the North, and Mariupol area to the South., Subsequently, there has been a marked increase in arrivals at train stations and at collective sites in Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Kropyvnytskyi, Pavlohrad and Poltava. While it is difficult to quantify overall arrivals, numbers of IDPs registered for longer stays has rapidly increased in these areas, in addition to large numbers of people who do not register due to being in transit, according to Key Informants (KIs)., As Dnipro authorities are strongly encouraging incoming IDPs to move onwards from Dnipro following their arrival, IDPs have been moving westwards toward other Central Oblasts, Kyiv area, and toward the West according to KIs. There is a consensus among KIs that most IDPs arriving in this current wave of displacement are much more likely to settle for the long term in areas closer to their area of origin and increasingly in smaller rural settlements, suggesting that assistance is also required outside urban centers., KIs report that new arrivals are disproportionately women and children, as well as elderly people and persons with disabilities, often from poorer socioeconomic background. Many among new arrivals are reportedly those who were reluctant to leave during previous phases of the crisis due to lack of financial means to resettle elsewhere, or mobility impediments, as well as isolated persons., As of April 15th, KIs in Dnipro were reporting a reduction in numbers of arrivals from the peak observed during the previous week, which is attributed to the attack on the Kramatorsk train station on April 8th, the subsequent drastic reduction in train evacuation routes, and to above cited reluctance to move. Further peaks of arrivals are nevertheless expected as conflict unfolds., While there is a strong response and coordination from Oblast and municipal authorities with support from volunteer networks and aid actors, there are critical unmet needs in areas of arrival or transit, including for medicines, equipment, food and non-food items, in particular in temporary displacement sites. While distributions of food and NFIs have been taking place in some collective sites, local authorities and collective site managers report continued shortages, in particular for hygiene items, equipment and baby food., The current response is relying heavily on private initiatives and the public workforce and KIs expressed concerns regarding the sustainability of the response without structural support to local responders, including through provision of predictable item delivery, scale up of pre-positioning of key items in anticipation of future peaks in arrivals, and gap filling support to existing service delivery.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-evacuations-eastern-oblasts-april-2022
Minister for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine and UNHCR Representative in Ukraine sign agreement to cooperate to help displaced families find sustainable and dignified housing solutions,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Shelter and Non-Food Items,18 Apr 2022,"Kyiv, 18 April 2022 – Today, Oleksii Chernyshov, Minister for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine and Karolina Lindholm Billing, the Representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to find sustainable and accessible housing solutions for people who have been forced to flee their homes due to the war., The war against Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crises ever. In just over 50 days, 11.7 million people – more than a quarter of the population of Ukraine – were forced to flee their homes. More than 4.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 7.1 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine., ‘The intensive shelling has forced millions of Ukrainians out of their homes and caused extensive material damage in large parts of the country. People’s greatest wish is to return home, but for so many, there is no house or apartment left to return to. Repairs will need to start as soon as areas are safe, but this will clearly not be enough. What we hope to do through this partnership is to support the government and the people of Ukraine to find dignified and sustainable housing options for people who have lost their homes’ said Karolina Lindholm Billing., Although comprehensive data on the magnitude of the destruction and damage is not yet available, owing to the volatile security situation, initial assessments indicate that damage to housing is a major concern for residents in 75% of surveyed settlements in Donetska, Kharkivska, Luhanska, and Zaporizka oblasts., ‘For displaced people, finding a safe and dignified place to live is clearly a top priority. UNHCR has been supporting the local authorities in numerous oblasts, where people have arrived to seek safety, to scale up the capacity of temporary reception centres. But this is just a temporary solution. We will also support with refurbishment and repurposing of collective centres, and work with the authorities and partners, and displaced people themselves, in developing a variety of sustainable housing solutions for people who will not be able to go back to their places of origin anytime soon’ added Lindholm Billing., Through this MoU, UNHCR reaffirms its commitment to work with the Government of Ukraine in finding solutions that complement their response efforts to the humanitarian crisis in the country. Within its role as shelter cluster coordinator of humanitarian organizations implementing shelter programs in Ukraine, and as an organization with longstanding experience in providing emergency shelter to displaced people, UNHCR will contribute to mapping and assessing the scale of damages and destruction to civilian housing, conducting repairs of damaged homes and refurbishment of collective centres, and help develop dignified and safe housing solutions for displaced people. In all its programmes, UNHCR takes a people and community-centered approach to ensure that the people themselves are at the centre of policies and programs., This is key for ensuring sustainability and the achievement of long-term solutions for displaced people of various backgrounds, including older persons, persons with disabilities, families with young children and single households., “There is no one-size fits all, and it’s by involving the people affected in the solutions that we make sure that resources are invested in solutions that actually match peoples’ needs and aspirations”, adds Lindholm Billing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/minister-communities-and-territories-development-ukraine-and-unhcr-representative

Timely funding is urgently needed to avoid an immediate pipeline break., In numbers, 1.56 million million conflict-affected people assisted by WFP (estimated), 12 million people in need (UN Flash Appeal, March 2022), 7.1 million internally displaced persons (IOM, 1 April 2022), 4.8 million people displaced to neighbouring countries (UNHCR, 15 April 2022), 186 WFP staff on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, Situation Update, The food security situation continues to deteriorate across Ukraine. Immediate food needs are reported in cities experiencing hostilities and in areas hosting growing flows of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Agricultural production and food provision are also severely affected by the conflict as per recent FAO assessment. The shortage of agricultural labourers and inputs, destruction of food systems assets and infrastructure and the reduced access to arable land will likely limit domestic production and food availability in Ukraine markets over the coming few months., Several cities in the east and south of Ukraine remain inaccessible due to the active conflict. This includes Mariupol where over 120,000 people are stranded, unable to leave the city for several weeks and are in urgent need for food, water and other basic necessities. During a three-days visit to Ukraine this week, WFP Executive Director called for unimpeded access to families trapped in conflict areas and encircled cities in Ukraine, citing lack of access as the biggest obstacle to WFP’s life-saving operations., Supply constraints are challenging timely delivery of humanitarian assistance in some of the hardest hit areas. These include the limited availability of trucks, reluctance of drivers to travel across frontline areas as well as the dwindling fuel supplies. In response, WFP is looking into innovative solutions such as using Uber as a transport mechanism. Alongside, securing additional warehouse capacity and prepositioning humanitarian commodities strategically close to areas with ongoing military operations is underway., The conflict in Ukraine is also unleashing a three- dimensional crisis on food, energy and financial markets. Soaring staples prices, energy price hikes and supply shortage are increasing pressure on households worldwide, in the poorest countries in particular, likely to push up to 323 million people into acute levels of food insecurity. The Heads of the WFP, World bank and the International Monetary Fund urged to support vulnerable countries through grants to cover their financing needs, facilitate unhindered trade and invest in sustainable food production and nutrition security.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-situation-report-13-16-april-2022

In Luhansk oblast, on 11 April, Governor Serhii Haidai reported that one of the humanitarian aid centres established by volunteers in Sievierdonetsk came under heavy fire. On that same day in Kharkivsk oblast, Governor Oleh Synegubov reported that the shelling of Kharkiv city had resulted in the deaths of eight people, with 19 more people injured, including two children. OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 12 April, there have been 4,521 civilian casualties, including 1,932 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., Unexploded ordnances are a growing concern for civilians and humanitarian actors as Russian Federation forces withdraw to the east of the country. The governor of Kyiv region has declared that it is not safe to return to liberated cities in the region because of ongoing demining operations and that it will likely continue to be unsafe until the end of May. Emergency services report that, from 11-12 April, they detected, removed and disposed of 6,252 explosives in the surrounding area. Meanwhile, residents of Kharkiv were warned to stay away from the mines that were dropped onto the city. The mines, which are scatterable explosives, are likely to cause civilian injuries. According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, more than half of the country will require demining activities in some form., IOM continues to be particularly concerned about the steadily rising internal and cross-border displacement as a result of the war. Between 24 March and 1 April, IOM carried out the second round of its rapid assessment on internal displacement, mobility flows and associated needs across Ukraine. As of 1 April, approximately 7.13 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine – around 16 per cent of the country’s population – an increase of over 660,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) since 18 March. From 11-12 April, more than 7,000 people were reportedly evacuated from areas affected by hostilities – including approximately 4,350 persons evacuated on 11 April and approximately 2,670 persons on 12 April – according to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-14-14-april-2022
"Ukraine’s detention of dozens of migrants during war is inhumane, unjustifiable [EN/AR]",News and Press Release,Euro-Med Monitor,Protection and Human Rights,17 Apr 2022,"Geneva– Black and brown migrants still trapped in an immigration detention centre in Ukraine with no possibility of release are at grave risk of being attacked due to officials’ negligence, warned Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor in a statement today. This neglect is yet another reflection of the dreadful double standard with regard to the protection of civilians during war., At least 45 people appear to remain confined in Zhuravychi Migrant Accommodation Centre, a former army barracks situated in a pine forest in Ukraine’s northwestern Volyn province. The barracks were converted into a migrant detention centre in 2007 with European Union funds., Many of these people are migrants who attempted to cross the border into Poland, but were intercepted by Polish border guards and handed directly to Ukrainian authorities. After summary court proceedings without any legal counseling, nor the possibility to claim asylum, they were sentenced to between six and 18 months for irregular crossing., For over a decade now, Ukraine has acted as a border guard for the rest of Europe, keeping migrants seeking safety out of the EU zone. Even now, amidst the current hostilities, it seems to continue to play this role., Conditions in the Zhuravychi detention centre were already difficult before the conflict but have significantly worsened since 24 February. Following the full-scale Russian invasion of the country, all detained migrants were moved into one of the complex’s two buildings, freeing the second one for Ukrainian soldiers., The centre has no air raid or bomb shelter, and the power outlets in its cells are no longer working, making communication with the outside world and the exchange of information increasingly difficult. At the same time, migrants in the detention facility could certainly hear the sounds of artillery fire and explosions, all while having no idea as to who the perpetrator was or how far away they were., A few days after the start of Russia’s invasion, a group of detainees gathered in the centre’s yard to protest their living conditions and ask for release, but guards forcibly quelled the protest and even beat some detainees with batons., According to several detainees, Ukrainian guards said that they could leave Zhuravychi if they joined the Ukrainian war effort. In this case, these detainees said, they would all have immediately been granted Ukrainian citizenship and documentation, but no one accepted the offer., Up to now, it seems that five men and one woman have been released, and only thanks to officials from their embassy who intervened and facilitated their safe travel to the Polish border., Though the detention centre is located near Lutsk—a city that was recently and repeatedly attacked—and is not far from the Belarusian border, the Zhuravychi facility appears to still be operating and detaining dozens of Afghan, Pakistani, Indian, Sudanese, and Bangladeshi people, solely because of irregular migration status., “There is no justification whatsoever to keeping already displaced people trapped in a detention centre in the midst of a war zone”, said Michela Pugliese, Euro-Med Monitor’s Migration and Asylum Researcher. “We ask European and Ukrainian authorities to see them as the vulnerable civilians they are, to listen to their blind panic and allow their evacuation and safe passage to neighboring countries exactly like [they would allow] any Ukrainian fleeing the same bombs”., Euro-Med Monitor urgently calls on Ukrainian authorities to immediately release the civilians still trapped in the Zhuravychi detention centre and allow them to contact their embassy or consulate., Additionally, Euro-Med Monitor calls on the European Commission to support these migrants’ safe passage to Poland or elsewhere in Europe depending on individual preference, just like Ukrainian refugees protected under the Temporary Protection Directive; guarantee them the same reception and protection inside the EU; and extend the guarantees provided under the Temporary Protection Directive to all those fleeing the conflict, including undocumented migrants and people with uncertain legal status who are stuck in a dangerous limbo.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-s-detention-dozens-migrants-during-war-inhumane-unjustifiable-enar

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Apr 2022,"As heavy fighting and missile strikes continue to destroy critical civilian infrastructure, humanitarian needs in Ukraine remain extremely high. Despite access and security constraints, EU humanitarian partners are providing assistance to vulnerable people in different regions of Ukraine., The EU is allocating a further €50 million in humanitarian funding to support the people affected by Russia's war on Ukraine, including €45 million for humanitarian projects in Ukraine and €5 million for Moldova. This brings the EU's total humanitarian aid funding in response to the war to €143 million. This funding is part of the €1 billion support package pledged by the European Commission at last week's global pledging event ‘Stand Up For Ukraine'., This new funding will address the most pressing humanitarian needs by providing emergency medical services, access to safe drinking water and hygiene, shelter and protection, cash assistance, and support against gender-based violence., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said “With millions of people on the move or trapped in active war zones, the needs in Ukraine are already massive. Now, we need to be prepared for a further increase in Russia's ruthless attacks on Ukraine, notably in the east. With this additional €50 million the EU continues to rapidly make available humanitarian funding to its partners in order to further scale-up the assistance. It will help people in hard-to-reach areas who are cut off from access to healthcare, water and electricity, and those, who have been forced to flee and leave everything behind. Ukraine, we are with you.”, Background, Following an invasion by Russia on 24 February, the humanitarian needs in Ukraine have risen to unprecedented levels. The ongoing hostilities endanger the lives of civilians and cause severe damage to housing, water and electricity supply, heating, but also public infrastructure such as schools, and health facilities. Many people have no access to basic needs. The population is exposed to shelling, armed violence, mines, family separation, looting or eviction, and human trafficking. There are high risks of gender-based violence against women and girls., On 28 February, the European Commission announced €90 million for humanitarian aid programmes to help civilians affected by the war in Ukraine. This included respectively €85 million for Ukraine and €5 million for Moldova. On 10 March, the European Commission allocated further humanitarian funding of €3 million to Moldova to support those fleeing Ukraine., The European Commission is also coordinating its largest ever civil protection operation to assist affected people both in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. To date, more than 19 000 tonnes of assistance have been delivered to Ukraine from the EU's logistics hubs in Poland, Slovakia and Romania. The assistance coordinated via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism includes essential supplies like medicines, food, power generators and shelter equipment., Press contact, Veerle NUYTS

Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 Apr 2022,"Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories of Ukraine and UNHCR Representative sign agreement to enable people displaced by the war to access their rights and find sustainable solutions to their displacement, Kyiv, 16 April 2022 – Yesterday, Iryna Vereshchuk, Vice Prime Minister – Minister for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories and Karolina Lindholm Billing, the Representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding that sets out areas of cooperation to enable displaced persons and other people impacted by the war to have access to services and sustainable solutions whilst in displacement., The war against Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crises ever. In 50 days, 11.7 million people – more than a quarter of the population of Ukraine – were forced to flee their homes. More than 4.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine, making this the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 7.1 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine., ‘People’s greatest wish is to go back home. But for so many, there is no home to return to since it’s been destroyed or damaged, or is located in an area that is not safe. It is therefore important that displaced people can access legal, social and other services, find jobs and continue education in the place where they currently have found safety and, importantly, a place to live’, said Karolina Lindholm Billing., Intensive shelling and fighting have caused extensive damage to residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. The full scale of the damage is hard to ascertain at this stage, as the war rages on., ‘What we know for certain is that the needs in Ukraine are growing by the day. Housing is one of the areas of greatest concern. Although hundreds of thousands of people are now staying in temporary reception centres or with hosting families who have generously opened their homes in safer parts of the country, longer term solutions need to be found’, added Lindholm Billing., ‘Over the past seven years, UNHCR has rehabilitated more than 22,000 homes in eastern Ukraine, and knows how much it means for families to be able to return to their house again’, said Lindholm Billing., Since the end of February, UNHCR has expanded the capacity of around 75 temporary reception centres in oblasts receiving displaced persons, distributed non-food items, hygiene kits and food assistance to 250,000 people, provided counselling and legal advice to 53,000 people at border points, in reception centres and through hotlines, and transferred cash assistance to 57,000 displaced people who have sought safety in seven oblasts around Ukraine.

Impact of war on the dynamics of COVID-19 in Ukraine,Analysis,BMJ,Health,15 Apr 2022,"Dmytro Chumachenko, Tetyana Chumachenko
Correspondence to Dr Dmytro Chumachenko; dichumachenko@gmail.com, On 24 February 2022, Russia unreasonably attacked Ukraine. The current estimated number of victims in Ukraine is 18 million. In addition to the destruction and humanitarian crisis caused by the war, Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine came at the peak of the wave of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron strain. The calculated predictive incidence of COVID-19 in Ukraine at the beginning of March, modelled by our group as part of the National Research Foundation of Ukraine project 2020.02/0404, was about 30 000 new cases daily. War significantly exacerbates the situation with COVID-19 in Ukraine, which is confirmed by our analysis of six key factors in the spread of infection., Identification of cases: sick people in the occupied territories and territories where hostilities are taking place do not have the opportunity to seek medical help because medical facilities have been destroyed, and medical personnel are in short supply. Consultations with family doctors are carried out online., Diagnostics: diagnosis is difficult due to hostilities. In the territories occupied by Russian troops, medical facilities practically do not work, there is no laboratory diagnostics, and PCR and rapid tests are not done. In the east and south of Ukraine, in the territories controlled by Ukraine, including cities with more than 1 million people, such as Kyiv and Kharkiv, 2.5%–3% of the capacity of laboratories providing COVID-19 diagnostic services is operating. In this way, only severe cases requiring hospitalisation are diagnosed., Registration: throughout Ukraine, the electronic system for recording COVID-19 incidence is limited, and data are transmitted by telephone from places where there is connection. This leads to a significant decrease in reported cases of COVID-19 compared with real ones. Thus, the Worldometers dashboard shows the incidence of 5000 cases per day, which is six times less than predicted. The Johns Hopkins University dashboard does not show data for Ukraine at all. Thus, it can be concluded that only severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation are registered., Treatment: hospitalisation of seriously ill patients is severely limited due to the overcrowding of hospitals with wounded military and civilians. The number of specific beds has been drastically reduced due to reprofiling to provide emergency medical care to the wounded. This results in reduced access to oxygen. Active hostilities and occupation make it impossible to deliver medicines to such territories. The sharp increase in fatal cases makes it impossible to diagnose COVID-19 after death, and autopsies are not performed. Among the internally displaced population, the provision of medical care is complex because attached family doctors remain in other territories of Ukraine. Contacting a doctor without a declaration is possible only through ambulances, which accept applications only in severe cases requiring hospitalisation., Antiepidemic measures: people in the territories not controlled by Ukraine and territories with active hostilities are forced to hide from artillery and airstrikes in bomb shelters, basements and subways. These places are characterised by high population density, lack of social distancing, lack of mask regime, low ventilation, which increases the intensity of the circulation of the virus. The mask regime is not observed in connection with the introduction of martial law. It is impossible to trace, test and isolate contact individuals in military conditions, and it is impossible to identify epidemic chains. In the context of hostilities, self-isolation is impossible, and people with symptoms continue to infect others. An essential factor in increasing the spread of the virus is the high population density during the evacuation, both in trains and at stations. At the same time, most of the evacuees are children. In Ukraine, children under 12 years of age were not vaccinated, and vaccination of children from 12 years of age began on 13 January 2022, so the vaccination coverage of children is low., Prevention: the vaccine campaign against COVID-19 in Ukraine began on 24 February 2021, exactly 1 year before the war. Only 36.93% of the population were vaccinated with two doses. Such a low level was associated, among other things, with an active antivaccination information campaign conducted by Russia. The population who received two vaccine doses on the schedule should receive a booster dose. However, in the uncontrolled territories of Ukraine and in the territories where active hostilities are taking place, vaccination has been completely stopped. In Western Ukraine, the vaccination campaign continues but with much lower throughput. This is due to the high burden on medical institutions caused by a large number of internally displaced people (6.7 million1) as well as the fact that part of the medical staff was evacuated to neighbouring countries. In connection with the introduction of martial law throughout Ukraine, mandatory vaccination of special categories of citizens (teachers, civil servants, etc) has been cancelled. Vaccination history is not controlled., The chaos of war and accompanying psychological factors have forced the problem of COVID-19 out of the minds of people in Ukraine. Military operations and the humanitarian aspects force people to live in unsanitary conditions without observing COVID-19 prevention measures. The pandemic is no longer the top priority of Ukraine’s healthcare system. This is an essential factor in increasing the dynamics of the spread of coronavirus infection in the country. The war in Ukraine is a critical factor in the new outbreak of COVID-19. This only exacerbates the humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine caused by Russia’s military intervention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-war-dynamics-covid-19-ukraine

Operational Update: $10 Million in Support for Ukrainian Refugees; Medical Support Continues,News and Press Release,Direct Relief,Health,16 Apr 2022,"Over the past seven days, Direct Relief delivered 462 shipments of requested medical aid to 43 U.S. states and territories and 14 countries worldwide, including Ukraine., The shipments contained 24.9 million defined daily doses of medication, including PPE, Covid-19 therapies, diabetes medication, and cancer treatments., This week, Direct Relief, working with the Polish health care company Pelion S.A., announced $10 million in a direct cash assistance initiative enabling Ukrainian refugees in Poland to obtain prescription medications at no cost. Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland, many of whom have no means to pay for much-needed prescriptions, will receive medical care in the neighboring country. But prescription costs still serve as a barrier to access, which this program will address., “The initial funding of $10 million comes from contributions by thousands of individuals deeply concerned about the welfare of Ukrainians who have had their lives upended and threatened. This approach connects that amazing generosity in a practical, important way to the Ukrainian people for whose benefit Direct Relief received the funds,” said Direct Relief President and CEO Thomas Tighe., This short documentary, filmed across Santa Barbara, Lviv, and the Ukraine-Poland border, captures stories from the early days of the war, and offers a lens into the heroism exhibited by healthcare providers and refugees alike amidst war as well as how an aid organization ramps up to deliver tons of supplies into a warzone thousands of miles away, UKRAINE RESPONSE TO DATE, Since February 24, Direct Relief has provided medical aid more than 254 tons in weight and almost 50 million defined doses of medication, with more on the way., In response to a recent levothyroxine shortage, a drug used to treat impaired thyroid function, Direct Relief has shipped 14 million doses – totaling above 30,000 pounds – to Ukraine’s Ministry of Health at their request, and to Charity Fund Modern Village and Town, for distribution to health facilities serving people affected by the conflict., According to Dr. Robert McConnell, a physician at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center and expert in radiation-caused thyroid disease, a pharmaceutical manufacturer of the medication was destroyed by artillery fire.

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (2 - 8 April 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,16 Apr 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, conflict in Ukraine continued amid the Russian retreat from the northern regions. Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine continued across the region. The ruling parties secured the win in the elections in Serbia and Hungary amid accusations of election irregularities. In France, the death of an imprisoned militant Corsican separatist continued to spark demonstration activity and violence. In Switzerland, police killed the suspected abductor of the head of the Federal Commission for Vaccinations., In Ukraine, Ukrainian forces continued operations in the north of the country last week amid the withdrawal of Russian forces from the northern regions. By 8 April, Russian troops had fully pulled out of the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions (Kyiv Independent, 6 April 2022; Ukrinform, 9 April 2022). Heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country, with the majority of armed clashes and shelling events recorded in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions. This violence contributed to the 139% increase in violence in Ukraine last month relative to the past year, flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month.1 Despite the ongoing daily clashes, Russia did not make any significant advances last week (ISW, 10 April 2022). Nevertheless, fighting is expected to escalate in this part of the country amid predictions that Russia will redeploy troops withdrawn from northern Ukraine to the eastern and southern regions in the coming weeks (The Washington Post, 4 April 2022)., Ukrainian and foreign authorities launched investigations last week into war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in previously occupied territories (Independent, 12 April 2022). The Ukrainian Prosecutor General reported that authorities have discovered the bodies of over 1,200 civilians in the Kyiv region alone (Ukrinform, 10 April 2022).2 Multiple reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian troops also surfaced last week, including the reported rapes of more than 25 girls and women during the occupation of Bucha in the Kyiv region in March (BBC, 12 April 2022). These events contributed to the 1073% increase in violence in the Kyiv region last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month., Russian forces also continued to shell civilian infrastructure across the country. Attacks on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region led to over a dozen civilian fatalities last week (Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, 6 April 2022; 9 April 2022). On 8 April, Russian troops fired two Tochka-U missiles at a railway station in Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region, where around 4,000 civilians were awaiting evacuation, killing 57 people and wounding over 100 (Ukrinform, 10 April 2022)., Demonstrations against the Russian military aggression continued in Ukraine last week, with Russian forces dispersing almost all protests held in occupied territories. In the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, Russian forces used stun grenades and live gunfire against protesters, wounding several people (24 Channel, 3 April 2022; Ukraine Crisis, 3 April 2022). In Russia, demonstrations against the invasion continued at a smaller scale, as anti-war activists continued to face pressure and intimidation by the state. Demonstrations took place in a dozen cities, with police arresting over 200 demonstrators (Activatica, 2 April 2022; ODV-News, 13 April 2022). Several arrested protesters reported being tortured in a police department in Moscow (OVD-Info, 2 April 2022)., Moreover, unidentified pro-government groups carried out several attacks against anti-war activists last week. On a train from Moscow to Samara, unidentified assailants threw a mixture of red paint and acetone at Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper (RFE/RL, 7 April 2022). Novaya Gazeta recently halted its reporting following growing state pressure on independent media (The Guardian, 28 March 2022)., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine were also held in Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Georgia, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain, and Switzerland. In Italy, unknown perpetrators targeted two villas on Lake Como belonging to a Russian television presenter and supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A fire broke out at one of the properties in what investigators believe is an arson attack (Unione Sarda, 6 April 2022), while the other was spray-painted with anti-war messages (La Repubblica, 6 April 2022)., General elections were held in Hungary and Serbia on 3 April, amid accusations of irregularities across both elections, as well as acts of violence in Serbia. In Serbia, the incumbent President Aleksandar Vucic was re-elected, despite his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) being unable to secure sufficient votes to gain a majority in parliament (Reuters, 4 April 2022). Several incidents of violence against opposition representatives outside polling stations were reported in Belgrade. The leader of the Movement of Free Citizens party was attacked by SNS supporters after accusing them of using parallel voting lists to track voters (Danas, 3 April 2022). In Hungary, the Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán secured victory, winning 136 out of 199 seats in the parliamentary elections (Index.hu, 7 April 2022; Telex.hu, 4 April 2022). These results come amid allegations of media bias, opaque campaign funding, and control of state resources (EuroNews, 4 April 2022; Telex.hu, 2 April 2022). The OSCE stated that its monitoring missions observed irregularities in both Serbia and Hungary, citing the “absence of a level playing field” (RFE/RL, 4 April 2022)., Meanwhile, in France, violence continued in Corsica last week following the death of prominent Corsican militant separatist Yvan Colonna on 21 March, with demonstration activity recorded in several Corsican cities. Colonna’s death came several weeks after a jihadi prisoner attacked him in the prison of Arles in early March. In Canale-di-Verde, an explosive device partially destroyed the secondary home of a Parisian family. The action has not been claimed so far, but the phrase “For Yvan” was found graffitied on one of the walls (France3, 4 April 2022). Four bombings or attempted bombings targeting secondary homes have been recorded in Corsica since the beginning of 2022. Although these attacks have not been claimed, they come after two National Liberation Front of Corsica (FLNC) militant splinter groups reactivated in September 2021 (Corse Matin, 15 February 2022). While the FLNC — a militant group that advocated for a free Corsican state — ceased operations in June 2014, splinter groups have since committed violence in their name (France3, 23 June 2017; France3, 2 September 2021)., In Switzerland, police killed two people during an exchange of gunfire with the suspected abductor of the head of the Federal Commission for Vaccinations Christoph Berger last week.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 Apr 2022,"This report is produced by OCHA Ukraine in collaboration with humanitarian partners. It covers the period from 09:00 a.m. on 13 April to 12:00 p.m. on 15 April. The next report will be issued on or around 18 April., HIGHLIGHTS, During the reporting period, eastern and southern Ukraine continued to face the fiercest fighting. Attacks were also reported in Kyivska (north) and Zaporizka (south-east) oblasts., According to the findings of Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance (GCRG), the Ukraine crisis risks tipping up to 1.7 billion people — over one-fifth of the global population — into poverty, destitution and hunger., The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported that 1.4 million people are currently without running water across eastern Ukraine and that hostilities-related damage to infrastructure and power cuts put an additional 4.6 million people across Ukraine at risk of losing access to piped water., As of 13 April, the UN and its humanitarian partners have reached 2.5 million people with multisectoral assistance across Ukraine, including 400,000 people reached during the past week alone. Some 2.5 million people were reached with food and livelihoods assistance, over 1 million with health assistance and over 240,000 with water, sanitation and hygiene assistance., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. During the reporting period, eastern and southern Ukraine continued to face the fiercest fighting, causing damages to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties. Civilian casualties and damages to civilian infrastructure were also reported in Kyivska and Zaporizka oblast.
Although the geographic scope of hostilities has reduced compared with the first few weeks following the start of the invasion of the Russian Federation, the needs of millions of people across Ukraine, including displaced and those remaining in hardhit areas, continue to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands remain without or have reduced access to water, gas, electricity and mobile communications, while internally displaced persons (IDPs) in western Ukraine face challenges with securing adequate shelter and finding ways to support themselves and their families.
Following the news about the deaths of two female staff members and five of their relatives at the Caritas office in Mariupol (Donetska oblast) in mid-March, which became available only recently, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (USG/ERC) Martin Griffiths issued a statement, calling on the parties to the conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, homes and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. USG/ERC also reiterated the appeal for the parties to the conflict to urgently agree on clear arrangements for the safe passage of civilians out of areas where their lives are at risk, as well as the safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance into areas where civilians are facing catastrophic levels of need.
As of 14 April, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 4,633, including 1,982 killed and 2,651 injured, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and airstrikes. OHCHR believes the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration.
Impact on global food, energy and finance systems. On 13 April, UN Secretary-General António Guterres presented the first detailed policy brief issued by the GCRG, which he set up to study the effects of the military offensive in Ukraine on the world’s most vulnerable. According to the policy brief, the Ukraine crisis risks tipping up to 1.7 billion people — over one-fifth of the global population — into poverty, destitution and hunger.
The Russian Federation and Ukraine produce around 30 per cent of the world’s wheat and barley, one-fifth of its maize, and over half of its sunflower oil. Together, their grain is an essential food source for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people, providing more than one-third of the wheat imported by 45 African and least-developed countries. At the same time, the Russian Federation is the world’s top natural gas exporter and second-largest oil exporter. Together, neighbouring Belarus and the Russian Federation also export around a fifth of the world’s fertilizers. As a result, commodity prices are reaching record highs across the board. As of 8 April, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food prices are 34 per cent higher than during the same period last year and have never been this high since FAO started recording them. Similarly, crude oil prices have increased by around 60 per cent, and gas and fertilizer prices have more than doubled.
Vulnerable populations in developing countries are particularly exposed to these price swings, as they dedicate a larger share of their income to food and energy. The world’s poorest countries tend to be net food importers and export and import measures on trade can further exacerbate rising food prices. At current price levels, FAO worst-case estimates of increases in undernourishment and food insecurity are also highly likely.
Impacts on health care. According to a report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 13 April, it has verified 119 reports of attacks on health care since the start of the conflict (with 109 confirmed, two possible and eight with probable levels of certainty). WHO specifies that the attacks resulted in a total of 73 people killed, 51 injured. In addition, WHO recorded 105 cases of attacks on health facilities, 13 on transport, 23 on health personnel, 11 on patients, 21 on medical supplies delivery, and two cases affecting medical warehousing.
WHO also notes that the utilization of health-care services by Ukrainians, which had declined by nearly half at the start of the current escalation at the end of February and especially in the north, has gradually increased – reflecting the de-escalation in hostilities. Population movement within Ukraine also contributes to the steady increase of patients who received care outside their permanent places of residence, with the main additional patient workload occurring in the western part of the country. The movement is clearly visible in the increase in the number of antenatal care services and other essential care such as hemodialysis. As more and more women are leaving Ukraine, a declining number of obstetrics and neonatal care cases is observed. WHO concludes in part that the Ukrainian health sector has been demonstrating resilience in the last few weeks, including the ability to resume offering normal services, such as treatment for circulatory diseases.
Impacts on water systems. UNICEF reported that 1.4 million people are currently without running water across eastern Ukraine and that hostilities-related damage to infrastructure and power cuts put an additional 4.6 million people across Ukraine at risk of losing access to piped water. UNICEF reports that at least 20 separate incidents of damage to water infrastructure have been recorded in eastern Ukraine alone. The intensification of fighting in the east and the widespread use of explosive weapons in populated areas threatens to further decimate the water system, which is now at risk of complete collapse, following the impact of eight years of simmering conflict on an already ailing network. In Mariupol (Donetska oblast), thousands of people are using dirty sources as they seek any water they can find. Major cities across Donetska and Luhanska oblasts are also cut off from water supplies, and an additional 340,000 people will lose water supply if a reservoir in Horlivka (Donetska oblast) runs dry. The cities of Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east) and Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north) experienced serious water stoppages in early March, and Kharkiv’s (Kharkivska oblast, east) water system was also seriously affected. UNICEF concludes that there is an urgent need to restore water access and provide emergency supplies to these cities and other areas of intense fighting.
Impacts on vulnerable groups. HelpAge International reports that older persons are among the most vulnerable. HelpAge says they can often be ignored amid hostilities and be left to struggle to survive alone. It points out that since the outbreak of conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, one-third of Ukrainians requiring assistance were over 60, making it the world’s “oldest” humanitarian crisis. Now, the report continues, many older people are hidden away in their homes – saying that a survey at the beginning of March found that 99 per cent of older people in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts had no plans to leave. For many, mobility difficulties mean leaving is impossible, many do not have family nearby to help, and most cannot even reach and access local shelters. HelpAge notes that older people often remain at home in times of ongoing fighting because they often do not want to be a burden, want to protect their homes, or because they have already moved many times before. HelpAge reports that as the military offensive expands around Ukraine, more older people will be left behind, isolated and in urgent need of food, water, heating and health, including mental health, support.
Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. On 13 April, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) issued a report on the military offensive in Ukraine that describes in detail allegations of widespread human rights violations, including the right to life and the prohibition of torture and concerning other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment. The OSCE explained that the report’s mandate included investigating possible contraventions of OSCE commitments and violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. In particular, the report focuses on the far-reaching impacts of the ongoing hostilities on civilians – including those killed, injured, abused, or forced to flee – and on civilian infrastructure, including damage to health-care and education facilities and housing. The OSCE concluded that, while it was not able to verify all reported violations, it did find “credible evidence” suggesting that such violations have been committed. Meanwhile, the OSCE specified that it completed the investigation and the report through its “Moscow Mechanism” for resolving particular human rights issues without the participation of the Russian Federation.
Eastern Ukraine. The heaviest fighting continues to be taking place primarily in the eastern part of the country, with most of Luhanska and parts of Donetska and Kharkivska oblasts affected, and with reported attacks and strikes also taking place elsewhere. As of 14 April, OHCHR reports that nearly 45 per cent (2,047) of all corroborated casualties were recorded in Government- and non-Government-controlled areas (GCA and NGCA) of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. OHCHR also notes that the receipt of information from Izium (Kharkivska oblast), Mariupol, Popasna (Luhanska oblast), where intense hostilities have been ongoing has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration. Moreover, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 12 April, almost 96,000 people in 30 settlements across eastern oblasts were without electricity, while water supplies had been completely cut off in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast).
On 14 April, evacuation buses reportedly came under fire near Borova (Kharkivska oblast). According to the spokesperson of the Oblast Prosecutor’s Office, seven civilians were allegedly killed and another 27 injured.
Southern Ukraine. IMPACT Initiatives conducted rapid needs assessments (RNA) in Ukraine’s southern oblasts, which was published on 14 April. The RNA concludes in part that security concerns were reported across all settlements as the main reason for displacement, followed by damages to housing, lack of housing and socioeconomic reasons. Settlements, including Mykolaiv and Voznesensk (Mykolaivska oblast), reported damages to shelter since the escalation, in addition to challenges in accessing food and disruptions to financial services. Among all assessed settlements, it was reported that security concerns, access to medication, disruption to children’s well-being, and disruption to transportation and/or fuel supply were concerns affecting people’s everyday lives. Education services were also reportedly disrupted in the following settlements: Novyi Buh and Voznesensk (Mykolaivska oblast) and Chornomorsk (Odeska oblast). Across all measured indicators, access to water supply, utilities, and telecommunications was least reported as a concern. Among all assessed settlements, Mykolaiv and Voznesensk reported continuous difficulties in accessing services across most of the measured indicators.
Northern Ukraine. According to IMPACT Initiatives RNA conducted in Ukraine’s northern oblasts, security concerns were reported across all settlements as the main reason for displacement, followed by damages to housing and socioeconomic reasons. Settlements, including Chernihiv, Irpin (Kyivska oblast), as well as Okhtyrka (Sumska oblast) reported damages to shelters since the escalation, in addition to challenges in accessing food, and lack of access to water and utilities. Among all assessed settlements, it was reported that security concerns, access to medication, disruption to children’s well-being, disruption to transportation and/or fuel supply were among concerns. Education services were also disrupted in almost half of the assessed settlements, including Chernihiv and Nizhyn (Chernihivska oblast), Boryspil, Brovary, Irpin, and Kyiv (Kyivska oblast), Okhtyrka, Shostka, and Sumy (Sumska oblast), Holoby and Volodymyr-Volynskyi (Volynska oblast, northwest) and Malyn (Zhytomyrska oblast, north). In particular, Chernihiv and Irpin reported continuous difficulties in accessing services across the measured indicators.
Displacement. Nearly 11.9 million have been displaced since 24 February, including more than 4.79 million that crossed international borders and 7.1 million displaced internally. Between 13 and 14 April, according to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine, almost 3,000 more people were reportedly evacuated from areas affected by hostilities. That included a relatively lower total of just around 380 people on 13 April, all from Luhanska oblast, when no evacuation routes were agreed on. More than 2,550 civilians were evacuated through the agreed-on routes on 14 April, including 289 people from Mariupol (Donetska oblast), over 2,040 from southeastern Zaporizka oblast and 225 more from eastern Luhanska oblast. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation has reported that more than 820,000 people, including over 150,000 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine since 24 February. At the same time, as of 14 April, UNHCR estimates that 484,000 people have sought refuge in the Russian Federation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-15-april-2022

In total, over 6 million people in Ukraine are struggling every day to have drinking water, one of the most essential human needs., Since the start of the war on 24 February, at least 20 separate incidents of damage to water infrastructure have been recorded in eastern Ukraine alone. The most recent intensification of fighting in the Donbas region and the widespread use of explosive weapons in populated areas threatens to push the water system—already impacted by the previous eight years of conflict—to the edge of a complete collapse., “Water is essential for life and a right for everyone,” said Osnat Lubrani, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine, warning about the health risks caused by water stoppages, particularly for children and the elderly. “Poor water quality can lead to diseases, including cholera, diarrhoea, skin infections and other deadly infectious diseases. People are having to live in crowded conditions and are unable to follow basic hygiene measures. This has to be solved,” added Lubrani., The situation is particularly critical in Mariupol, where tens of thousands of people are likely to be using dirty sources, as they seek any water they can find.

Witnessing despair and resilience among people sheltering in Kharkiv’s metro,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",15 Apr 2022,"Voices from the Field, Dr Morten Rostrup from Norway is working with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Kharkiv, northeastern Ukraine. Here, he and a team are providing medical consultations in the underground stations where people are sheltering from the country’s war. This is his first-hand account of what he saw and of the stories of people he met., She was sitting on a bench in front of me at one of the metro stations in Kharkiv. Since the war broke out, the stations have functioned as shelters and thousands of people are sleeping on the platforms and in the train carriages. The woman had been thrown out of bed when a rocket hit her apartment building., She had seen her aunt killed a few metres away from her. She couldn’t talk about it but burst into a flood of tears as she sat looking downwards. She was shaking. She wasn’t alone in seeking medical care this evening. There were many others., A seven-year-old girl who had constant nightmares and was afraid of falling asleep. People experiencing physical pains they couldn’t explain. People who felt like they couldn’t breathe. A woman with sky-high blood pressure who was at risk of having a stroke., An old man who showed me pictures of his three grandchildren. One of the children had been killed in an airstrike two days earlier, the other two were in hospital, one of them critically injured. The children’s father was also killed. The old man had suffered a stroke and had high blood pressure. He couldn’t sleep., I have had many moving encounters with different people over these past few weeks. Our team travels from one metro station to the next. In the evenings we carry out dozens of medical consultations before pulling out our sleeping bags and spending the night there., I have seen the despair, the lack of hope; the confusion, the inability to comprehend how they have ended up in this situation. Losing family members and friends, losing their homes, losing the future they had envisioned for themselves. I have seen the constant fear experienced by so many, and how some people collapse in terror when the sound of airstrikes fills the air., Before travelling to Kharkiv, I spent a few days in the city of Vinnytsia, which is located far from the frontline. We wanted to get in touch with Ukrainian psychologists who could assist the displaced people – many with psychological trauma – who were passing through the city on their way to safety in other countries., This was when I met Olena, a psychologist from Ukraine. Her eyes were blank during our conversation. She had family members in the besieged city of Mariupol and had heard little about how they were doing. Olena said that she couldn’t work now., Before the war, she had worked as a clinical psychologist and treated patients with personal problems. “The patients have stopped coming,” she said. “The problems they had before seem so small now.” Looking at me, she said: “It’s good to meet you. You are so calm. You don’t have the stress and worries that we have. The fact that you are here has a calming effect on us.”, The situation in Kharkiv is very challenging. There are still daily airstrikes. Parts of the city have been levelled to the ground. Half of the city’s 1.5 million people have fled. Some have chosen to stay or were unable to escape due to a lack of money, relatives or other contacts, or simply because they were too old or sick to travel., Some of the people we met told us they would rather die in their own city. We assume that many of the most vulnerable people have not left. Many people have lost their homes, especially in the eastern part of the city., I don’t know how many lungs I have listened to, throats I have looked at and stomachs I have felt. Not because I had a strong suspicion that anything was seriously wrong, but because I knew that a thorough check-up and a conversation acts as reassurance to the patients., Their stress levels are so high that just a small symptom can cause significant anxiety for some patients. When I reassure them that nothing is seriously wrong with them, they thank me. I see the relief in their eyes. The fear of becoming sick in these circumstances plagues many, especially the patients with chronic diseases., It’s easy to forget these victims of the war: the people with increasing mental health problems and those who live with chronic diseases. When a war breaks out and they don’t receive follow-up medical care, diseases like these can have potentially devastating consequences., There are patients with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, epilepsy, diabetes, cancer. Some die – in some war contexts, perhaps even more than those who die from injuries caused directly by the violence. Others are forced to flee to a place where they can get the medical care they need, preferably to another country., Still, it’s encouraging to see how people here are helping each other. At each metro station, small communities have developed. The people sheltering there are well acquainted with each other. Groups of volunteers work to provide everyone with food and water. A medical student at one of the stations runs a small outpatient clinic and pharmacy. The toilets are cleaned., Everyone in Kharkiv is contributing in their own way. Many contributions are also coming from abroad. We see a very strong sense of unity, but six weeks is a long time, especially when you can’t see a solution in the near future., It's still cold in the metro stations. It seems that spring will come late to Kharkiv this year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/witnessing-despair-and-resilience-among-people-sheltering-kharkiv-s-metro

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Apr 2022,"Context and methodology, The escalation of hostilities in Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has prompted a large scale humanitarian and displacement crisis. Local markets are under increasing pressure as domestic production and supply routes for key commodities are disrupted, while demand in areas receiving high numbers of displaced persons is increasing. This brief aims to provide background on potential challenges faced by aid actors and commercial traders alike in terms of procuring items for the purpose of distributions as well as regular supply of markets across accessible areas of Ukraine. The content is based on information collected through secondary data review (SDR) and online monitoring of product availability through a published, searchable database showing availability and price of product in stores of a large super market chain (ATB). When an ATB store suspends its delivery services, for example due to security concerns in conflict-affected areas, its database becomes inaccessible., A scoring system was built around a system of weights assigned to 12 basic food items according to their relative relevance for Ukrainian households: bread (3), eggs (3), milk (1), potatoes (2), carrots (1), onions (1), cabbage (1), chicken (1), oil (1), flour (1), rice (1), buckwheat (1). This was complemented with a similar system of weights for NFI and hygiene items with the following scoring: drinking water (3), diapers (1), body soap (1), laundry soap (1), washing powder (1), toothpaste (1), hygiene / sanitary pads (1).1 Each item reported to be available was multiplied by the weight, allowing to calculate a score for each assessed store, subsequently averaged at the town level. It is important to note that data for an increasing number of non-functioning stores in areas directly affected by the conflict could not be obtained. Furthermore, results shown should be read as indicative, as REACH was not able to independently verify the frequency with which individual shops update product availability data., Availability of basic goods across Ukraine, The online monitoring exercise revealed clear patterns in basic commodities availability in different parts of the country (Map 1). While most stores had some items that were not readily available, there was a clear difference in availability of basic products in oblasts closer to areas directly affected by the conflict compared with oblasts further removed from current hostilities. Stores in oblasts such as Dnipropetrovska, Poltavska and Mykolaivska appeared to be experiencing difficulties with the availability of key staples such as rice and buckwheat. Western oblasts appeared to experience the least challenges with the availability of basic commodities, with most or all monitored groups of items being in stock according to the online database., Key developments, The analysis revealed a number of notable changes since the previous round of online monitoring published on 16 March 2022:, The number of shops for which no data could be obtained increased significantly. While the previous round included data on item availability in stores across oblasts such as Luhanska, Donetska, Kharkivska, Sumska, Chernihivska, Khersonska and Kyiv city, the online database for these stores is no longer accessible. This does not necessarily mean all stores in these locations have closed completely. In some cases, it is possible that delivery services have been suspended., The average food item availability score of shops in conflict-adjacent oblasts such as Dnipropetrovska and Poltavska decreased significantly, with key items now mostly unavailable for online purchase., Alternatively, in most western oblasts, with the exception of Zakarpatska, the average food availability score of shops improved with items now fully or mostly available., In the central oblasts the average food item scores remained mostly similar, with some shops in Vinnytsia and Cherkaska registering an improvement., Pressure on markets seems to affect the availability of food items much more than personal hygiene items such as diapers and body soap., Overall, the average availability score for hygiene items of stores increased considerably in shops across the country, including in conflictadjacent Poltavska oblast.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-emergency-response-rapid-analysis-online-availability-mapping-basic-goods-14

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 14 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,15 Apr 2022,"Date: 15 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation's armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 14 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 4,633 civilian casualties in the country: 1,982 killed and 2,651 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Minister of Interior of Ukraine, according to which as of 7.30 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 2,700 civilians had been killed, including women and children. OHCHR notes the caveat made by the Minister who stressed that that this figure concerns only those civilian deaths on which criminal proceedings had been initiated, and where forensic expertize of dead bodies had been carried out. OHCHR also notes the report of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 15 April (local time), at least 198 children had been killed and at least 355 injured., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 13 April 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 14 April only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 14 April have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, *Since 2014, **OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation's military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact:

Update 53 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (15 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,15 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that there had been no significant new developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Regarding Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors at four nuclear power plants, seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously.

WFP appeals for access to encircled cities in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WFP,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",15 Apr 2022,"KYIV -- The United Nations World Food Programme today called for unimpeded access to families trapped in conflict areas and encircled cities in Ukraine, saying lack of access was the biggest obstacle to its life-saving operations in the war-torn country., ""We're calling on everyone to give us the access we need to reach the people in besieged cities,"" WFP Executive Director David Beasley said at the end of a three-day visit to Ukraine. ""It's one thing when people are suffering from the devastation of war. It's another thing when they're being starved to death."", The encircled city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine is thought to be running out of its last reserves of food and water. No humanitarian aid has been allowed into the city since it was encircled more than two weeks ago. To the west, the city of Mykolaev remains unreachable due to active conflict in the area. WFP is also concerned about several cities in the east., WFP has so far delivered food assistance to 1.4 million people in Ukraine and is ramping up to reach 2.3 million people this month. But getting safe access to cities like Mariupol, where more than 100,000 people are believed to be trapped, will be key., WFP this week expanded food assistance operations to areas which until recently were on the war's front lines. In towns such as Bucha, Hostomel, Borodyanka and Irpin, near Kyiv, WFP is now distributing boxes of pasta, rice, canned meat and cooking oil to traumatized survivors amid the rubble of their former homes., WFP chief Beasley went to Bucha on Thursday to see first-hand the operations being carried out in the area with the help of local church communities. He also spoke with women and children in a nearby centre for displaced people., ""I am shocked. The horror of war is so visible here and I shudder to think what these people have been through,"" he said after walking through streets littered with unexploded mortar shells and visiting a bombed out orphanage. ""But I see hope. I see a community working with energy to clean up and rebuild. We need to support that process."", WFP is scaling up its response to the conflict in Ukraine on a ""no-regrets"" basis, giving out food and assistance very broadly, with the goal of eventually supporting 6 million people caught up in the world's fastest growing humanitarian crisis. Families in conflict-affected areas are receiving food parcels similar to those distributed in Bucha. Meanwhile, in areas where markets are functioning, cash is being distributed so families can buy what they need., Over 7 million people are displaced inside Ukraine and the pre-conflict supply chain systems for feeding the country's population have broken down in many areas. WFP estimates one third of the people in the country and more than half (60 percent) internally displaced people are worried about finding enough to, The conflict in Ukraine is also triggering a wave of collateral hunger elsewhere in the world. Global food prices have increased sharply since the onset of the conflict and are now at an all-time high. These hikes are expected to further limit access to food for millions of people who are already under stress because of food inflation in their countries., Download photos, ###, The United Nations World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change., Follow us on Twitter @wfp_media, @wfp, CONTACT, For more information please contact (email address: firstname.lastname@wfp.org):, Ljubica Vujadinovic, Krakow, Mob. +393890009052, Tomson Phiri, WFP/ Lviv, Mob. +41 79 842 8057, Reem Nada, WFP/Cairo, Mob. +20 106663452, George Fominyen, WFP/HQ +39 349 9336721, Martin Rentsch, WFP/Berlin, Mob +49 160 99 26 17 30, Steve Taravella, WFP/ Washington, Mob. +1 202 770 5993, Shaza Moghraby, WFP/New York, Mob. + 1 929 289 9867",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-appeals-access-encircled-cities-ukraine

"Protection Cluster: Recommendation Note on Humanitarian Evacuations of Civilians in Ukraine, April 2022",Manual and Guideline,Protection Cluster,Protection and Human Rights,15 Apr 2022,"KEY CONCERNS, Security situation at the time of evacuation: The safety of these routes has not been at all times guaranteed and respected by the Russian forces, with many reported incidents of shelling and indiscriminate attacks against civilians trying to leave affected areas.
Lack of adherence with government procedures by civil society organisations involved in evacuation of civilians, posing serious protection risks, including loss of life and family separation.
Coordination issue: evacuation by multiple actors without joint or agreed procedures; lack of information on existing mechanisms for identification and referral of persons in need of evacuation; lack of information on reception capacity in receiving areas.
Evacuation of children from institutions by unknown organisations increasing risks of exploitation, abuse, trafficking and family separation., BACKGROUND, Since 24 February, thousands of civilians in Ukraine have been living under unlawful bombardment, with over 11 million people forcibly displaced internally and across international borders.
While some civilians were able to flee insecure areas using their own means, it is estimated that at least 13 million people are either severely impacted or still stranded in affected areas, unwilling or unable to leave due to military action, heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, land contamination, as well as lack of means to move safely elsewhere.
In situations of armed conflict, the State is responsible for the safety of its citizens and those within its territory; it is therefore their primary responsibility to conduct evacuations if necessary.
Humanitarian actors, however, in cooperation with States, have exceptionally resorted to emergency evacuations or transfers in extreme circumstances, when there was no other way to provide urgent assistance or protection to respond to severe threats to life and security.
In Ukraine, many civilians in hostility-prone and conflict areas are reaching out to civil society and NGOs requesting assistance to leave besieged areas and areas under immediate threats. While humanitarian evacuations1 should always be used as a measure of last resort, to be pursued only in exceptional circumstances when all other options have been exhausted, they are deemed necessary in many areas within Ukraine to save civilian lives.
While the United Nations and the ICRC continue to urge both parties to take practical steps to limit civilian suffering and respect International Humanitarian Law (IHL), attempts to establish humanitarian corridors with satisfactory security guarantees for the safe evacuation of civilians continue to be hindered by ongoing hostilities.
In the current context, it is observed that evacuations in Ukraine have been undertaken both under the leadership of Ukrainian authorities2 and spontaneously by civil society organizations or volunteers, including internal relocations of children and persons with disabilities living in institutions. Evacuations of vulnerable groups within and outside Ukraine without adherence with government procedures or coordination with the Ukrainian authorities are also reported.
Experience has shown that poorly planned humanitarian evacuations may result in a failure to protect, exposing individuals to a range of unintended risks, including family separation, human trafficking and even loss of life. Human rights such as the right to seek safety within and outside of one’s borders; to be protected from arbitrary displacement; and the freedom to choose one’s place of residence should be carefully considered when planning or executing humanitarian evacuations as they can violate the rights of evacuated civilians and should continue to be strictly applied as a measure of last resort.
Therefore, the present Recommendation Note on Humanitarian Evacuations of Civilians in Ukraine builds on existing international guidance,3 lessons learned and previous recommendations issued by the Protection Cluster in Ukraine. The note intends to provide protection actors currently engaged in the humanitarian response with the guiding principles, minimum standards and parameters to follow prior, during and after engaging in humanitarian evacuations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/protection-cluster-recommendation-note-humanitarian-evacuations-civilians-ukraine

This will put enormous pressure on the Government and other national and international partners to provide critical services to the war affected population,” added Fouani. “UNDP’s main priority is to ensure that the core government functions are sustained, and institutions remain fully functional and with increased capacity to respond, manage and cope with complex humanitarian and development challenges.”, The project focuses on the following four areas of work:, Strengthening the crisis/emergency governance structures;, Building data/information analysis systems to support prompt and efficient responses;, Creating an aid management system to better coordinate both humanitarian and development support through a new “SpivDiia” platform;, Enhancing the Government capacities in strategic communications through consular support to the temporarily displaced Ukrainians in the EU countries; and, Establishing an internal decision support unit to coordinate assessments, and provide capacity building and technical support to government and national institutions on damage and losses assessment., The project also will provide analytical support, for example, identifying the strengths and comparative advantages of Ukrainian businesses and assessing the potential trade turnover between Ukraine and the European Union as per Ukraine’s EU Association Agreement and the EU Green Deal., Oleksandr Bankov, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, says the Government welcomes UNDP’s support in strengthening the Ministry’s capacity in analyzing the prospects of accelerating Ukraine’s economic revival in the context of the EU integration., With this, UNDP will also assess the impact of war on Ukraine’s progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as on the specific needs of women, people with disabilities, elderly, and other vulnerable groups, and to build on gathered data and analysis to support in developing the National Recovery and Resilience Building Plan for Ukraine., The UNDP project will provide institutional support to the Government, including digital solutions for improved delivery of public services like state financial support and housing and will strengthen resilience of those communities hosting a growing number of internally displaced persons., UNDP also will research and publish evidence-based products capturing the impact of the war on the social, physical, financial, human, and natural assets in Ukraine. This will provide the much-needed insight to the impact of the war. These damage and impact assessments will be conducted in close collaboration with the Government, local and national partners, universities, think tanks, CSOs, other UN agencies, and development partners., Anatolii Kutsevol, Deputy State Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, said that the new project would help the Government to address existing challenges in preparing a reliable data on damages assessment caused by the war as well as to enhance the capacity of various central and local authorities in preparation of the necessary actions for crisis recovery in Ukraine. “The project will also support the Government in the provision of necessary demining equipment,” he added., Media inquiries:, Yuliia Samus, Communications Team Leader, Yuliia.Samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-launches-new-project-boost-ukraine-government-s-crisis-response-and-coordination

Impacted residents have displayed symptoms of respiratory failure and vestibulo-atactic syndrome., While allegations of Russian war crimes–from the use of internationally banned weaponry to targeting of civilians–have surfaced across the country, Mariupol stands as an emblem of atrocities taking place since the incursion began on February 24. The city’s mayor declared more than 10,000 residents have died to date and warned that the death toll could soon exceed 20,000. He said countless dead bodies lie strewn across streets and that Russian troops have brought mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to dispose of dead bodies., Mariupol has been surrounded by Russian forces for over a month and, despite some successful humanitarian evacuations in recent days, tens of thousands are believed to be trapped with limited access to essential goods and services., Meanwhile, investigations of indiscriminate and targeted attacks against civilians by Russian forces continue in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Videos of the town released on social media last week revealed dozens of dead bodies lying on streets shortly after Russian troops withdrew from the vicinity. Investigators have since unearthed mass graves and other evidence of sanctioned violence. iii Project HOPE’s President & CEO along with the ERT in Ukraine, visited Kyiv, Bucha and other conflictaffected areas this week to further assess needs at health facilities. (See updates on the trip in Ukraine Updates below)., The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) has been tracking casualties of the Ukrainian crisis. As of April 11, OHCHR recorded 1,842 civilian deaths and 2,493 injuries—though the agency cautions actual numbers are likely much higher. Explosive ordnances were the most common cause of reported casualties., This week, a Ukrainian rights group alleged before a United Nations assembly that Russia was using rape as a weapon of war. At the same meeting, the UN Women Executive Director said her agency was “increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence” and that the “combination of mass displacement with large pressure results of conscripts and mercenaries and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians has raised all red flags.”, As a result, women, children, older persons and other populations are at heightened risk of gender-based violence, human trafficking, and other protection concerns.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-13-15-april-2022

"Ukraine: 2.7 million people with disabilities at risk, UN committee warns",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,14 Apr 2022,"GENEVA (14 April 2022) –The continued military attacks against Ukraine are putting the lives of an estimated 2.7 million people with disabilities at risk. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities today deplored the Russian Federation’s aggression despite repeated calls for a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. The Committee issued the following statement:, “The Committee is deeply disturbed that the fate of people with disabilities in Ukraine is largely unknown. There are ongoing reports that many people with disabilities, including children, are trapped or abandoned in their homes, residential care institutions and orphanages, with no access to life-sustaining medications, oxygen supplies, food, water, sanitation, support for daily living and other basic facilities., People with disabilities have limited or no access to emergency information, shelters and safe havens, and many have been separated from their support networks, leaving them unable to respond to the situation and navigate their surroundings., The continued military attacks leave people with disabilities extremely vulnerable and at grave risk of harm. Women with disabilities are at heightened risk of rape and sexual violence that has been widely reported. Few people with disabilities are reported to be internally displaced or to have reached Ukraine’s borders, indicating that many of them have not been able to flee to safety., The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States to ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities when meeting their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. Ratified by both the Russian Federation and Ukraine, the Convention requires States to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of people with disabilities in situations of risk, including armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies., States parties to the Convention also have obligations for cooperation between and among States, and in partnership with representative organisations of people with disabilities and other civil society organizations, to provide humanitarian assistance that is inclusive and accessible., The Committee urges all States, UN agencies, civil society and other stakeholders involved in humanitarian action to recognise and respond to the pleas and requirements of people with disabilities caught up in the hostilities. Their specific requirements, including according to gender and age, should be identified and included in all responses to the crisis. Ensuring access to humanitarian corridors, inclusion in evacuation and crisis response plans and the provision of accessible emergency information and communications are measures which should be implemented., Measures need to be taken to ensure that all people with disabilities are accounted for, protected and provided with immediate access to humanitarian aid, taking into account their individual support requirements. Refugees and internally displaced people with disabilities, and people with disabilities in refugee-like situations need to be provided with support tailored to their individual requirements at border crossings, reception and accommodation facilities and to be provided with relocation assistance. Children with disabilities should be provided with individualised support to ensure they are not separated from their families and are protected from institutionalisation and other harmful practices, such as trafficking., Above all, the Committee calls upon the Russian Federation to immediately end the hostilities and observe and respect the principles of international human rights and humanitarian law., The Committee will continue to monitor the situation of people with disabilities in the conflict, in close cooperation with organisations of people with disabilities and human rights organisations.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-27-million-people-disabilities-risk-un-committee-warns

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 13 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,14 Apr 2022,"Date: 14 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 13 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 4,577 civilian casualties in the country: 1,964 killed and 2,613 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 14 April (local time), 197 children had been killed and at least 351 injured., _________________________________________, An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 12 April 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 13 April only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 13 April have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission*** in Ukraine***, *Since 2014, **OHCHR has been **documenting **civilian *casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available andnumbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-13-april-2022-enruuk

The events took place nearly one month ago but the information has become available only now., Both aid workers dedicated their lives to the service of others through their work for Caritas. On behalf of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, I send our heartfelt condolences to their families and colleagues, and to those of the other civilians who were killed while on the Caritas premises., This deeply tragic and unacceptable event is just one example of this war’s horrific consequences for civilians, including aid workers.

This must stop., I urgently call on the parties to the conflict to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, homes and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine., I also reiterate the appeal for the parties to the conflict to urgently agree on clear arrangements for the safe passage of civilians out of areas where their lives are at risk, as well as the safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance into areas where civilians are facing catastrophic levels of need, especially in areas that have been or remain besieged.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief

Recovery and Reconstruction",13 Apr 2022,"On World Health Day in Lviv, Ukraine, WHO Regional Director for Europe Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge visited health facilities and heard first-hand from health workers and patients who have faced some of the most testing circumstances imaginable amid the ongoing war that erupted on 24 February., Speaking during the visit, the Regional Director explained, “This year I decided to commemorate World Health Day in Ukraine as an act of solidarity – with Minister of Health Dr Viktor Liashko, with all front-line workers and with the people of the country during these very tough times.”, Following meetings with health workers, Dr Kluge highlighted the resilience, heroism and dedication of the country’s health workforce., Since the start of the war in Ukraine, millions of people have been displaced, with many moving to the country’s west as well as neighbouring countries. The health system has also been severely disrupted, with around 300 health facilities situated in conflict areas and 1000 health facilities in changed areas of control., To date, over 100 health facilities have been attacked, killing and injuring civilians, and obstructing delivery of and access to health care for those in need. The war in Ukraine is a humanitarian emergency, and many require health care for both acute and chronic conditions., Regional Director and Health Minister discuss damage and recovery, During a meeting with Dr Liashko, Dr Kluge reiterated WHO’s continued support for the country to address immediate health challenges and sustain long-term reconstruction efforts. The Regional Director emphasized WHO’s pledge to help the country’s health system recover from the serious damage by working with national authorities and partners to “build back better”., The Health Minister praised the support shown by the WHO Country Office in Ukraine, which has been in close contact with the Ministry throughout the war. The Country Office has set up a fully operational office in Lviv and is working to establish a future operational base in Dnipro., In addition, both parties spoke about the need for a decentralized WHO footprint across the country to provide agile support wherever it is needed., Meeting health workers and patients, Following a virtual press briefing, Dr Kluge had the opportunity to visit 3 health facilities – a field hospital, a children’s hospital and an emergency hospital., The Regional Director thanked and expressed his admiration for the health workers who continue to work and deliver care despite the continued hardships and fear they must overcome on a regular basis., The children’s hospital visited by the Regional Director has been able to provide cancer care to children while facilitating the transport of the most serious patients to hospitals around the world, ensuring they receive the vital care they need., Destruction of hard-earned gains, Prior to the outbreak of war, Ukraine had made significant progress on a number of health matters. Since 2015, the Government of Ukraine has been reforming the health system to move towards universal health coverage. Furthermore, the country had begun to turn the corner in its fight against tuberculosis and HIV., Dr Kluge strongly criticized continued attacks on health in the country, which are a violation of international humanitarian law, and reiterated the United Nations Secretary-General’s call for the Russian Federation to commit to a cease-fire., Emergency response, WHO has delivered hundreds of tonnes of medical aid, including to cities on the front line. Central to this effort has been the distribution of life-saving supplies, many originating from the WHO warehouse in Lviv., Speaking with staff at the warehouse, the Regional Director thanked them for their work to provide crucial supplies to health facilities and health workers across the country., However, despite their efforts, Dr Kluge underlined the continued challenge of ensuring safe passage for medical supplies, warning that places such as Mariupol and Donbas have proven difficult to supply., WHO’s response continues to take place in collaboration with over 100 partners. Recently, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) financed the procurement and facilitated the supply of antiretroviral drugs, helping WHO and partners to cover the needs of every person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine for the next 12 months., Thanks to recent donations, WHO’s Emergency Appeal for Ukraine has reached its funding targets. However, amid the ongoing war, WHO is set to launch a new Emergency Appeal for Ukraine in the coming days, requesting donations to treat urgent health needs in Ukraine and support neighbouring countries that continue to provide care to refugees.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/regional-director-pledges-who-support-help-ukraine-s-health-system-build-back-better

Logistics and Telecommunications",14 Apr 2022,"On 10 April, Tetyana Pryadko (not her real name) was phoned by her doctor, who told her that her antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV had arrived. For Tetyana, who has been on treatment for 10 years, it was an important call. Her treatment hadn’t been interrupted once in 10 years, but now she had only a five-day supply left. She lives in Chernihiv, which was on the war’s front line, cut off from the old supply chains that kept her supply of HIV treatment uninterrupted., Before the outbreak of the war, antiretroviral therapy was widely available in Ukraine. Larisa Getman, the Head of the HIV Management and Response Department of the Public Health Centre, Ministry of Health of Ukraine, explained that, “The majority of antiretroviral therapy was procured by the state through the National Procurement Agency.” 100% LIFE is the largest organization of people living with HIV in Ukraine, that implements the procurement of medical goods under the Global Fund projects and operates the humanitarian aid under PEPFAR programs, including emergency supplies of antiretroviral drugs., Valeria Rachinskaya, the Director of Human Rights, Gender and Community Development at 100% LIFE, who herself has been on antiretroviral therapy for many years, explained that the COVID-19 pandemic had actually improved treatment adherence, since it has become the norm to have a multiple-month supply of medicine at home, which was mailed to those who couldn’t access a clinic. Remote counselling and the widespread use of mobile applications have also become routine., “People weren’t without medicines at the start of the war. The worst was for people in the cities that were the most heavily bombed, where not only medical facilities were destroyed but also logistic chains were interrupted,” she said., “Before the war, the whole procurement and delivery process in Ukraine was quite easy,” said Evgenia Rudenka, Head of 100% Life’s Procurement Department. “Cargo was delivered to the airport, we cleared it at our warehouse and transported it. But the war happened, and it was urgently needed to figure out how to deliver those medicines to the country, and, most importantly, how to deliver them to patients. And we worked out these mechanisms from the very first days of the war with our partners.”, At the request of the Ukrainian Public Health Centre, under support of USAID and CDC, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) agreed to help with the urgent supply of antiretroviral therapy. Chemonics, a purchasing agency of PEPFAR, searched around the world for spare stock and secured vital supplies., Through the support of the European Union who immediately developed the special humanitarian aid transit procedures for Ukraine, deliveries have begun to take place through neighbouring countries, primarily Poland and Romania. “Through the support of the Railway Service, we have organized the pickup of the cargo at a separate station away from the main delivery point of most Humanitarian Aid that comes to Ukraine. It was done with the purpose to manage the immediate distribution to regions. (As a huge number of humanitarian supplies from different countries goes through the State Agency for Strategic Reserves of Poland, it is quite hard to take the goods immediately from there). So we have brought in a logistics company that can deliver goods to Ukraine under the humanitarian transit procedure, to a warehouse in Lviv, from where we are able to make the immediate distribution” said Ms Rudenka., The most difficult and the most important part of the process is delivery throughout Ukraine, including the front-line zones., According to Evgenia, many logistics companies have stopped operations during the war, and those that remain have increased the cost of their services by two- or threefold., Commercial organizations are not willing to go to cities such as to Kharkiv, Kherson or Mykolaiv, but volunteer drivers, working in coordination with local authorities, drive there, evacuating people and delivering medicines and other goods., “Where there is fighting, the volunteer drivers will unload at, for example, the regional administration headquarters, and then we communicate with the medical institutions that are the final recipients, we tell them where to pick up the goods,” she said., Even so, several volunteers have come under attack, and four have been killed., “The situation for people living with HIV in Ukraine is desperate. We are trying to deliver medicines, food, and other emergency assistance to people in need, but the work is dangerous and volunteer drivers are putting their lives at risk. If we don’t get more help, I am not sure how much longer we can continue, especially reaching people in the front-line zones,” said Dmytro Sherembey, the Head of the 100% LIFE Coordination Council.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/life-saving-logistics-ukraine

UNAIDS warns that the war in Ukraine risks a humanitarian catastrophe for people living with and affected by HIV [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNAIDS,HIV/Aids,13 Apr 2022,"Urgent call issued for a dramatic upscaling of international support for the heroic efforts of civil society-led networks to reach people with life-saving HIV treatment, GENEVA, 13 April 2022---The war in Ukraine has resulted in the destruction and disruption of health services and logistical supply chains that hundreds of thousands of people living with and affected by HIV depend on for survival. One in every 100 Ukrainians are living with HIV, and lack of access to antiretroviral therapy and prevention services would mean a wave of deaths and risks a resurgence of Ukraine's AIDS pandemic. The community-led networks which are vital to maintaining life-saving services need an urgent upscaling of international support., More than 40 health facilities that offered HIV treatment, prevention and care services before the war are now closed and there are various levels of service disruption at other sites. By 11 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) had verified more than 100 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine, while supply routes within the country have been thrown into disarray. The United Nations Children's Fund reports that attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages have left an estimated 1.4 million people without access to water, while another 4.6 million have only limited access. Meanwhile, the World Bank has said it expects Ukraine's economy to shrink by 45% this year, posing a dire threat to the maintenance of vital health and social programmes., An initial delivery of more than 18 million doses of life-saving antiretroviral medicine procured by the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that arrived in Lviv last week is now being distributed in partnership with the Public Health Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and 100% Life, the largest organization of people living with HIV in Ukraine. If they can be delivered to those in need, the medicines are sufficient to cover a six-month supply for all people living with HIV on first-line treatment. This first tranche is part of PEPFAR's commitment to fund 12-month HIV treatment needs in Ukraine. UNAIDS estimates that 260 000 people were living with HIV in Ukraine before the war broke out, 152 000 of whom were taking daily medication for HIV., The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) is also providing emergency funding to ensure the continuity of life-saving HIV and tuberculosis services., Attention is now on ensuring that the life-saving HIV medicines reach all people in need in time. Civil society organizations are mounting a heroic effort to deliver vital medical supplies and HIV services to people living with and affected by HIV, including to vulnerable populations. They are reaching people in extraordinary challenging locations, despite the huge obstacles. But the civil society organizations on which this delivery and care system depends need further international support to be able to continue their work., ""The situation for people living with HIV in Ukraine is desperate. We are trying to deliver medicines, food and other emergency assistance to people in need, but the work is dangerous and volunteers are putting their lives at risk,"" said Dmytro Sherembey, Head of the 100% Life Coordination Council. ""If we don't get more help, I am not sure how much longer we can continue, especially reaching people in the front-line zones."", UNAIDS, which has released an initial US$ 200 000 in emergency funds to address urgent humanitarian and programme demands in seven cities that have large HIV epidemics (Chernihiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kryvy Rih, Kyiv, Odesa and Poltava), has issued an urgent call to the international community for an additional US$ 2.42 million for civil society organizations providing HIV services in Ukraine and for those receiving refugees affected by HIV in other countries, as part of the wider upscaling needed., ""Civil society organizations and communities of people living with and affected by HIV are the bedrock of the HIV response in Ukraine,"" said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""They urgently require additional financial and logistical support to ensure the continuity of HIV treatment, care and prevention programmes. We urge all donors to be part of enabling this vital service to save lives and prevent a resurgence of the AIDS pandemic in Ukraine."", It is only because Ukraine's pioneering response to HIV has been a partnership between public and community-led provision that it has been able to continue to provide for people even through the horrors of war. But the civil society networks, on whose creativity and courage the HIV services depend, require a boost in international support to ensure continued operations at the level required., Getting medical supplies and services to vulnerable groups of people remains extremely challenging and UNAIDS is working with humanitarian partners in Ukraine and internationally to advance urgent solutions to provide medical and humanitarian support to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians., The Alliance for Public Health is working to provide the emergency support needed during the conflict, using minibuses to meet pressing humanitarian needs, including the evacuation of vulnerable populations and the delivery of food and medicines. Communities on the front line of the response are making exceptional efforts to reach people. For example, mobile clinics have been deployed by the Alliance for Public Health to take opioid substitution therapy to people who use drugs in areas where facilities have been forced to close. UNAIDS is also working with the Global Fund and with a UNAIDS Cosponsor, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, to obtain additional supplies of opioid substitution therapy., The conflict has forced millions of Ukrainians to leave the country and thousands of Ukrainian women and children living with HIV are in need of support in host countries. Civil society networks supported by UNAIDS Cosponsors and partners are helping refugees access antiretroviral therapy in the Republic of Moldova and across the European Union., WHO has helped to broker a deal with the pharmaceutical company ViiV Healthcare to provide donations of HIV medicines to Czechia, Poland and other European Union countries receiving large numbers of Ukrainian refugees., UNAIDS is also urging the international community to help refugee accommodation centres strengthen their support for people facing the highest risks, by expanding psychosocial services, HIV treatment and prevention services, and services related to gender-based violence. A UNAIDS Cosponsor, UN Women, has said that reports of sexual abuse and human trafficking in Ukraine indicate a protection crisis. UNAIDS has warned of increased risks for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people., Ms Byanyima reaffirmed the United Nation's call for an end to the war. ""The biggest need is for peace"", said Ms Byanyima. ""The war in Ukraine must stop---now. Recovery requires an end to this war. And even when it ends there will be so much help needed. Ukrainians living with HIV have been put in grave danger by this war. The civil society-led responder networks for HIV services who risk their lives to save lives need every possible support."", HIV hotline number in Ukraine: 0800 500 451., More support for Ukrainian refugees living with HIV can be found on the ART Initiative for Ukrainians Abroad website, which was established in coordination with Ukraine's Public Health Center. More precise data on the whereabouts and needs of people living with HIV in Ukraine and those forced to flee the country are being collected., UNAIDS, The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) leads and inspires the world to achieve its shared vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. UNAIDS unites the efforts of 11 UN organizations---UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, UNDP, UNFPA, UNODC, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO and the World Bank---and works closely with global and national partners towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Ukraine: Almost 400 children killed or injured with two-thirds fleeing their homes in first seven weeks of war,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",14 Apr 2022,"KYIV, 14 April 2022 – Nearly two thirds of the 7.5 million children in Ukraine have fled their homes since the conflict escalated seven weeks ago, with reports of at least 153 children killed although Save the Children fears the number could be much higher., Latest data from the United Nations estimates that 2.8 million children are now displaced within Ukraine and another two million have fled to neighbouring countries. This means 64% of children in Ukraine, or 4.8 million, are now on the move., The UN has been able to verify the deaths of 153 children and recorded 246 injured so far, although the real number is almost certainly much higher. All children in Ukraine are in imminent danger as an increasing number of hospitals and schools come under attack., In the first five weeks of the war, an average of 22 school were attacked every day. In Mykolaiv last week, a children’s hospital came under attack leaving two girls, aged nine and 15, in critical condition., In Mariupol and other areas most badly affected by the war, children and families are in grave danger, facing potentially fatal shortages of water, food, and medicines., Pete Walsh, Save the Children Ukraine Country Director, said:, “Every single death of a child is one too many. These numbers are beyond tragic, and likely to grow. Families are risking their lives in search of safety. Just last week, 39 people including four children were killed at Kramatorsk railway station during an evacuation., “At Siret border in Romania last week, our staff met a family from Mariupol; a father and five young children. The children were shell-shocked and had been staying in a basement for two weeks, shielding from airstrikes., “This war is spiralling out of control, leaving children with long-term trauma that cannot be underestimated.“, Notes to editors:, You can donate to Save the Children’s Children Emergency Fund, which supports children affected by crises, such as the Ukraine conflict, here., ENDS, For further enquiries please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-almost-400-children-killed-or-injured-two-thirds-fleeing-their-homes-first

Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",12 Apr 2022,"SITUATION OVERVIEW, The armed conflict in Ukraine has caused tragic loss of human life, destruction of cities and civilian infrastructure, and massive displacement of people inside the country and across borders. Although active since 2014, the conflict significantly escalated in late February 2022 as hostilities spread to most parts of the country. It has led to critical concern for the protection of civilians, especially for those trapped in urban centres. While it has necessitated a massive scale-up in providing humanitarian aid across the country, humanitarian access remains challenging. This emergency is on track to become one of the most significant crises in 80 years., After just six weeks, the civilian death toll is estimated to be higher than during the previous eight years of the conflict in the east of the country. The damage to essential infrastructure has been widespread, and access to critical services heavily affected. Across Ukraine, more than 90 health facilities and 800 schools are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed, further increasing people’s vulnerability, and disrupting children’s education and access to services. Relatively low vaccination rates and people congregating in close quarters as they seek safety have also resulted in high COVID-19 and communicable disease risk, which, coupled with limited access to treatment, poses a considerable risk to affected populations., Within six weeks of the escalation, an estimated 7.1 million people were internally displaced (about 1.5 million registered) and more than 4.5 million have left or been evacuated from Ukraine into neighbouring countries. Around half of this number have crossed the border into Poland. After a massive outflow of people, the rate at which people are leaving Ukraine has fallen. However, new movements are still expected from the eastern part of the country., After crossing the closest borders with Ukraine, many people have proceeded onwards to countries across Europe. Countries like Germany and the Czech Republic have received more than 300,000 refugees. The combination of open borders within the Schengen area and increasing two-way traffic at Ukraine’s borders means that keeping a detailed picture of refugees per country is also difficult. Recently, many Ukrainians have started to return home and since early April, more than 500,000 are estimated to have returned, partially in response to the withdrawal of Russian forces from areas around Kiev. People returning to the country face several dangers and challenges, including remnants of the war, damaged infrastructure and housing, and significantly reduced livelihood opportunities., The crisis is also already having a global impact on food prices and commodity availability—conditions that are expected to worsen. Twelve per cent of the world’s calories and 30 per cent of its wheat come from Ukraine and Russia, and the conflict has disrupted the spring planting season. Low-income regions of the world that depend on the countries’ food exports will face increased pressure on food security, which could have significant downstream effects on other crises around the world. Continuation of the conflict will only serve to increase this risk. Although negotiations between the parties to the conflict have been ongoing since the first weeks, a clear resolution remains elusive. Until a ceasefire or peace agreement is in place, the context remains uncertain and unpredictable in Ukraine, neighbouring countries, and further abroad., The current situation in Ukraine is governed by the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, its First Additional Protocol from 1977 and customary international humanitarian law. The International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) calls upon concerned authorities to support and facilitate the humanitarian response of Movement partners, including by ensuring that any restrictive measures contain effective protection of the humanitarian space, by managing any support to the parties responsibly as well as supporting the parties in fulfilling their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law., TARGETING, The number of people affected is unknown due to the developing situation both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries and the current lack of data, access, and assessments. However, based on estimations provided by local authorities and Red Cross National Societies, the total number of people affected by the conflict can be estimated to be up to 18 million, with over 11 million displaced internally or fleeing the country. This Emergency Appeal aims to increase the reach of the Red Cross National Societies to scale up assistance to 3.6 million people in the immediate term and in their transition to a long-term recovery. To date, up to one million people are estimated to have been assisted by Red Cross National Societies in impacted countries., In all countries, the National Societies are uniquely positioned to respond as auxiliary to the public authorities in the humanitarian field. While the situation develops, the Red Cross has exclusive access and is currently the only actor that can deliver humanitarian assistance at scale in many contexts. The IFRC’s wider membership is contributing to the response in support of affected National Societies. Complementarity between this Emergency Appeal and the action of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is ensured through country-level coordination mechanisms at strategic, operational, and technical levels, and with IFRC and ICRC senior leadership oversight. The 3.6 million people targeted by the operation fall into three categories defined in the immediate response strategy., People in Ukraine, including displaced persons and returnees, host communities and those sheltering in places that the Ukrainian Red Cross can reach. Millions of people are directly affected by the conflict in Ukraine, and there are an estimated seven million people displaced within the country, with widespread destruction to housing, facilities, and livelihoods assets. This will be done in close coordination with the ICRC to reach maximum impact., People on both sides of the borders, attempting to cross to safety. Many lack the capacity to support their basic needs including food, water, shelter, and sanitation while National Societies have a permanent and flexible local presence. Support to border areas is also coordinated with the ICRC as per the evolution of the conflict., People in neighbouring countries and beyond who face short-term difficulties in terms of basic needs, as well as long-term socio-economic risks and recovery needs (including people temporarily stranded in foreign countries and supported by Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies upon the request of authorities)., Among all these groups, a particular focus will be on vulnerable individuals by Red Cross and Red Crescent standards, including unaccompanied minors, women with children, single-headed families, older adults, and people with disabilities., The needs are informed by ongoing access to information from Ukraine and activities from neighbouring National Societies supporting people on the move with various services. The general immediate life-saving needs are clear for people on the borders and on the move. In contrast, longer-term needs and activities will be amended depending on the evolution of the situation in the different countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-ukraine-and-impacted-countries-crisis-emergency-appeal-no-mgr65002-12-apr-2022
Collecting data and analysis on how the war in Ukraine is impacting women and girls,News and Press Release,UN Women,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",13 Apr 2022,"Despite the myriad challenges of collecting data in conflict, UN Women has been working tirelessly with partners to gather, analyse and disseminate data to illustrate the differential and disproportionate impacts of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on women and girls. At least five publications have been produced so far, revealing the grim reality of war and its evolution, particularly for the most vulnerable women and girls., The most recent is a rapid gender analysis conducted between 14 and 22 March 2022 based on data, both from before and after the recent invasion. It suggests that the war is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, particularly for older women and single mothers who comprise the majority of Ukraine’s poor. The analysis also quantifies the gendered flow of migrants, with 3.7 million refugees having fled the country (90% of whom are women and children as men aged 18–60 cannot leave) and the number of internally displaced people reaching 6.5 million. It outlines emerging protection concerns around sexual and gender-based violence and the unequal access to services and resources for those left behind. It also includes recommendations for humanitarian leaders, actors and donors to ensure consideration of the gendered dimensions of risk, vulnerability and capabilities in response to this crisis. Recommendations include the need to ensure that data, evidence and women’s voices inform humanitarian responses and are reflected in budgeting, programming and service-delivery, among many others., In partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), ongoing surveys on the displacement patterns, needs and intentions of Ukrainian refugees and third-country nationals have been produced, the first based on 1,777 interviews conducted with Ukrainians crossing into the Republic of Moldova from 9–17 March 2022. An updated report was published in early April, based on 4,384 interviews conducted between 9–27 March at four Moldovan border crossing points and three transit locations, with extended questionnaires delivered in temporary placement centres and private accommodations. The surveys detail their place of origin, intended destinations and main needs at entry points and centres. They reveal that women account for 81% of all refugees surveyed; that 83% of refugee women are travelling with at least one child; and that 87% are travelling with a group. However, with 1 in 10 women travelling alone (mostly aged 18–30 or 60+), young and elderly women are more exposed to harassment, gender-based violence and human trafficking., In close cooperation with the Border Police of the Republic of Moldova, UN Women produced a factsheet in mid-March with data on the demographic profiles of Ukrainian refugees hosted by the Republic of Moldova – the first in a series that will examine the changing gender dimensions of the current humanitarian crisis as new data become available. It reveals that there are 77 children under 11 years for every 100 women, indicating that women are bearing an immense childcare burden over and above the need for shelter, lack of access to basic services and the emotional and psychological distress brought on by displacement., And to better understand the situation for women’s CSOs, between 4–10 March, UN Women conducted an online rapid assessment survey with 67 women’s civil society organizations (CSOs) across Ukraine, 42% of which rely entirely on volunteers. It also includes findings from group consultations organized between UN Women and women CSOs with participation of Ukraine’s national gender machinery. The report aims to help inform the decision-making of national and international stakeholders, and advocate for greater support for CSOs during the war. The survey identifies seven key areas for concern for women and girls: immediate safety threats; a lack of basic necessities; the loss of livelihoods; the psychological impact of war and constant fear; sexual and gender-based violence in public and private spaces; a lack of communication, information and social services; and women face exclusion from planning and decision-making at all levels. Notably, 85% of CSOs reported the need for additional funds in the coming months and the report includes a call to action to prioritize funding for women’s CSOs and their meaningful participation in humanitarian response coordination., More data analysis is forthcoming. Together with CARE, UN Women will also produce a new RGA based on survey data with internally displaced populations within Ukraine, and issue a report on surveys of refugees in Moldova undertaken with the IOM, both expected in mid-April., Through these varied gender data collection and analyses, UN Women seeks to inform the humanitarian response and advocate for the priorities of all women and girls, including those from the most vulnerable groups.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/collecting-data-and-analysis-how-war-ukraine-impacting-women-and-girls
Ukraine’s State Emergency Service – The backbone of the country’s emergency response,News and Press Release,UNDP,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",13 Apr 2022,"When Viktor Vitovetskyi joined Ukraine's State Emergency Service (SES) in 2003, he was enthusiastically looking forward to a career in civil defense in the then newly independent country., He did not expect his job would include dealing with the consequences of war., Viktor started out in Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine and in the capital, Kyiv, supervising compliance of safety rules in buildings and shelters. Now he works in the SES command and control centre in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where he is helping provide vital support to civilians across the country who have been impacted by the war., This includes facilitating their relocation from areas of active fighting. Viktor also helps in coordinating the flows of humanitarian aid entering Ukraine from neighbouring countries., ""Right now we’re dealing with difficult situations that are occurring because of the war, because of the bombing,” he says. “We have to deal with challenges on a bigger scale, ranging from humanitarian needs to the destruction of housing and infrastructure."", Despite the chaos of a war, marked by the devastation of villages, towns and cities and the unprecedented displacement of millions, the State Emergency Service has proven its resilience, becoming almost overnight the backbone of the government's emergency response., Its 70,000 personnel rescue people from under rubble and from fires caused by daily shelling, clear debris and unexploded ordnance to ensure safe passage for residents and humanitarian aid workers, and evacuate people to safer locations., The popularity of the agency has surged, as reflected in an increase in recruitment: In a five-day period, 5,500 volunteers registered to join the service., The partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the SES has also been strengthened because of the war. Since the start of this partnership in 2016, UNDP's role had centred on enhancing the capacities of rescuers in providing timely, quality safety services to affected populations through providing technical assistance and transportation. UNDP also worked to improve the medical, psychological and media skillset of SES personnel., This work was an integral part of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, which is being implemented with financial support from the European Union, and the governments of Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands., With the outbreak of full-scale war in February 2022, the partnership is now adapting to a new environment, on a larger scale. To help SES personnel service communities, whether they are on the frontline, under heavy shelling and siege-like conditions, or in transit or hosting IDPs, UNDP is contributing protection and firefighting equipment, generators for emergency power, food supplies, and specialized tools for removing debris., UNDP is also providing life-saving equipment on the frontline and in areas now housing those internally displaced., State Emergency Service personnel have always endured dangers in their work. But the reality of rescue work during a war has exposed them to danger on a greater scale than they had even imagined: ""There are repeated cases of shelling while they're trying to clear debris and extinguish fires. We have already had more than 20 rescuers killed. This is a terrible situation,"" says Viktor., New recruits now join with the knowledge that their lives could be on the line, and the threat of mines and unexploded ordnance left behind makes the risks even higher., Viktor acknowledges the enormity of the challenge but expresses the dedication and commitment of all SES personnel: “Nobody expected this (war) in the 21st century. Life has totally changed. But our rescuers will work where they are needed, despite the danger.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-s-state-emergency-service-backbone-country-s-emergency-response

"Roma must be equally treated and protected, OSCE human rights head says",News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,14 Apr 2022,"WARSAW, 8 April 2022 – Roma continue to face discrimination and marginalization where support and inclusion should be provided, a fact clearly demonstrated by the situation of Roma currently fleeing Ukraine, said the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) on today’s International Roma Day., “In times of crisis, support for the most vulnerable in our societies is more important than ever,” said ODIHR Director Matteo Mecacci. “It is shocking to see that Roma are currently facing growing discrimination in the face of unprecedented danger. The Roma who have fled Ukraine in recent weeks need assistance and access to everyday services as anyone else does, free from segregation or stereotyping.”, From one generation to the next, Roma remain Europe’s most marginalized community. OSCE countries have committed to combating discrimination against Roma, including in access to housing, citizenship and residence, education, employment, and health services. They have also pledged to ensure that Roma refugees and others who have been forcibly displaced are provided with the documents they need to receive state assistance. Much more needs to be done to fulfil the promise of their full integration in societies in which the human rights of all people are recognised equally., It is crucial that national authorities consult Roma communities and civil society before deciding on temporary measures to help those fleeing combat zones, in line with the Action Plan on Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area. ODIHR works to increase Roma inclusion by providing much-needed space for dialogue between Roma civil society and governments across the OSCE region, helping to move towards inclusive societies., Contacts, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights

EUAM Ukraine: Council further amends the mandate to also provide support in the investigation and prosecution of international crimes,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,13 Apr 2022,"The Council today adopted a decision amending the mandate of the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform in Ukraine (EUAM Ukraine). Under the amended mandate, EUAM Ukraine will also provide support to Ukrainian authorities to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of any international crimes committed in the context of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine., EUAM Ukraine will provide Ukrainian authorities with strategic advice and training on related matters. It may also donate funds or equipment to Ukrainian authorities. The mission will ensure close cooperation with the International Criminal Court and with Eurojust, as well as with member states acting in direct support of the investigation and prosecution of international crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians. Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects, including hospitals, medical facilities, schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately. Those responsible, and their accomplices, will be held to account in accordance with international law., EUAM Ukraine is a non-executive civilian mission established on 22 July 2014.

Statement on Ukraine from the OPCW spokesperson (12 April 2022),News and Press Release,OPCW,Protection and Human Rights,12 Apr 2022,"Statement attributable to the spokesperson for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), The Technical Secretariat of the OPCW is monitoring closely the situation in Ukraine. The Secretariat is concerned by the recent unconfirmed report of chemical weapons use in Mariupol, which has been carried in the media over the past 24 hours. This follows reports in the media over the past few weeks of shelling targeted at chemical plants located in Ukraine, together with accusations levelled by both sides around possible misuse of toxic chemicals., All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty of major importance in the field of disarmament that has been in force since 1997. In doing so, they have solemnly and voluntarily committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons., The use of chemical weapons anywhere by anyone under any circumstances is reprehensible and wholly contrary to the legal norms established by the international community against such use., Since the beginning of the conflict, the OPCW Technical Secretariat has remained in contact with concerned States Parties. The Secretariat has received from both the Russian Federation and Ukraine correspondence regarding threats of use of toxic chemicals as weapons and shared it with all 193 Member States of the OPCW as requested., The OPCW Technical Secretariat has also uninterruptedly been monitoring the situation around declared chemical industrial sites in Ukraine., Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Secretariat remains ready to assist any State Party upon its request, in case of use or threat of use of chemical weapons., The OPCW Technical Secretariat will continue to monitor the situation and keep in contact with concerned States Parties., Background, As the implementing body for the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), with its 193 Member States, oversees the global endeavour to permanently eliminate chemical weapons and to prevent their re-emergence., Over the past 25 years since the Convention’s entry into force in 1997, the Convention is considered to be the most successful disarmament treaty, eliminating an entire class of weapons of mass destruction., Under the Convention, all 193 OPCW Member States have committed without any reservation to never, under any circumstances, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons., Over 99% of all declared chemical weapon stockpiles have been destroyed under OPCW verification. For its extensive efforts in eliminating chemical weapons, the OPCW received the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize., The Convention is supported by a strong verification regime, aimed at reducing the risk of misuse of dangerous chemicals. For that purpose, the Secretariat of the OPCW carries out periodic inspections of the chemical industry of the States Parties., Any toxic chemical intentionally used to cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals would be in contravention of the Chemical Weapons Convention., Both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, having joined in 1997 and 1998 respectively. None of these two States Parties currently have declared chemical weapons., The OPCW Technical Secretariat stands ready to assist, if requested by any State Party, in line with its mandate provided under the Convention and decisions by the Policy-Making Organs (namely the Conference of the States Parties and the Executive Council)., In addition to assistance provided by the Organisation, in the event of an allegation of use of chemical weapons, the Convention provides for investigations to be carried out by the Technical Secretariat in connection with allegations of use under certain strict conditions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-ukraine-opcw-spokesperson-12-april-2022
Update 51 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (13 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,13 Apr 2022,"Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today that he is working closely with Ukraine to finalize the dates and other arrangements for the upcoming International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to help ensure safety and security at the country’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP)., The Director General will head the team of IAEA safety, security and safeguards experts that is expected to travel to the site in northern Ukraine later this month, a few weeks after he went to the South Ukraine NPP to meet with senior Ukrainian government officials and plant staff., The IAEA is planning a series of technical assistance missions in the coming weeks to reduce the risk of a nuclear accident during the conflict in Ukraine. The country has 15 nuclear power reactors at four plants in addition to various radioactive waste management facilities at Chornobyl, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks before their withdrawal on 31 March., As part of the preparations for the missions, the IAEA and its Ukrainian counterparts are discussing what kind of safety-related equipment – including spare parts and components – is needed at the different nuclear sites. At Chornobyl, the site of the 1986 accident, the IAEA experts will also conduct radiological assessments and repair remote safeguards monitoring equipment., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant new developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours, Director General Grossi said., Regarding Ukraine’s nuclear energy reactors, seven are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, two at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The eight other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs and they also continue to have off-site power available., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-51-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-13-april-2022

Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, The Russian Federation launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. As of today, more than 4.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 7.1 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine. That is 11.7 million people forced to flee their homes in under seven weeks - more than a quarter of the population of Ukraine. Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation. Many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. We continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys. UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and for neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., KEY FIGURES - UKRAINE",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-8-13-april-2022

This included:, a total of 1,932 killed (485 men, 313 women, 31 girls, and 54 boys, as well as 72 children and 977 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,589 injured (297 men, 222 women, 52 girls, and 52 boys, as well as 146 children and 1,820 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,994 casualties (698 killed and 1,296 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,631 casualties (621 killed and 1,010 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 363 casualties (77 killed and 286 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,527 casualties (1,234 killed and 1,293 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 13 April (local time), 191 children had been killed and at least 349 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-12-april-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",13 Apr 2022,"Water network and power cuts, a result of conflict-related damage, put an additional 4.6 million people across Ukraine at risk of losing access to piped water, LVIV, Ukraine, 13 April 2022 – More than 6 weeks of conflict in Ukraine have devastated both water and electricity networks, leaving 1.4 million people without access to piped water in eastern Ukraine and a further 4.6 million people across the country at risk of losing water supply., At least 20 separate incidents of damage to water infrastructure have been recorded in eastern Ukraine alone. The intensification of fighting in the east and the widespread use of explosive weapons in populated areas threatens to further decimate the water system, which is now at risk of complete collapse, following 8 years of low-grade conflict on an already ailing network., “Water is essential for life and a right for everyone,” said Osnat Lubrani, UN Resident Coordinator in Ukraine. “The health risks, particularly for children and the elderly, caused by water stoppages are severe, as people are forced to use dirty water sources, resulting in diarrhoea and other deadly infectious diseases,” added Lubrani., Power cuts have stopped water pumps, and explosion-related damage to pipelines are disrupting the flow of water., In Mariupol, thousands of people are using dirty sources as they seek any water they can find. Major cities across Donetsk and Luhansk regions are also cut off from water supplies and an additional 340,000 people will lose water supply if a reservoir in Horlivka runs dry., Sumy and Chernihiv cities experienced serious water stoppages in early March and Kharkiv’s system is also seriously affected. Restoring water access and providing emergency supplies to these cities and other areas of intense fighting is urgent., Since the start of the conflict, the WASH Cluster has confirmed that four water technicians have been injured in Chernihiv and one in Kharkiv, adding to at least 35 water engineers who have been killed or injured in Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014., One year ago, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2573, recalling the international humanitarian law (IHL) obligations of all parties to armed conflicts to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including water facilities. However, civilian infrastructure, including water, sanitation and electricity networks have been destroyed during the war in Ukraine, severely hampering people’s access to vital services., “It is imperative that the parties to the conflict respect their IHL obligations and take constant care to spare civilian infrastructure. In cases where water facilities suffer damage, water technicians must be afforded urgent and safe passage to repair the network,” said Osnat Lubrani., The WASH cluster urges all parties to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and remove military hardware and personnel from positions close to civilian infrastructure., “Young children who live in conflict zones are 20 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal diseases linked to unsafe water than from direct violence, as a result of war,” said UNICEF Ukraine Representative, Murat Sahin. “Their access to water, wherever they are, must not be jeopardised as a result of war – for children, it is a matter of life and death,” added Sahin., The WASH Cluster, led by UNICEF, have:, #####, Notes to editors:, About the WASH Cluster, The Global Water Sanitation and Hygiene Cluster, or Global WASH Cluster (GWC) is a partnership grouping 32 partners and aiming at improving the coordination and the humanitarian response in the WASH Sector.

EU introduces exceptions to restrictive measures to facilitate humanitarian activities in Ukraine,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,13 Apr 2022,"In view of the humanitarian crisis resulting from Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, the Council introduced humanitarian exceptions1 in two sanctions regimes concerning the situation in Ukraine: restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (“Ukraine territorial integrity regime”), and restrictive measures in response to the recognition of the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine and the ordering of Russian armed forces into those areas (“Donetsk and Luhansk regime”)., In particular, organisations and agencies acting as humanitarian partners of the EU, such as the ICRC and the UN specialised agencies, are exempted from the prohibition to make funds or economic resources available to persons and entities designated under the Ukraine territorial integrity regime when the funds or resources are necessary for exclusively humanitarian purposes in Ukraine. In addition, certain clearly defined categories of humanitarian organisations are exempted from the export restrictions and the related prohibition on the provision of services under the Donetsk and Luhansk regime when this is necessary for exclusively humanitarian purposes in the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine. Furthermore, under both regimes, organisations not covered by the above exemptions can request Member States to grant a derogation from the same prohibitions when that is necessary for humanitarian activities in Ukraine., The aim of today’s decisions is to safeguard principled humanitarian action by impartial humanitarian actors addressing the humanitarian needs of the civilian population in Ukraine. It signals the EU’s commitment to adhere to humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law in EU sanctions policy, and to avoid any potential unintended negative impacts of EU restrictive measures on principled humanitarian action., Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians. Russia is directing attacks against the civilian population and is targeting civilian objects, including hospitals, medical facilities, schools and shelters. These war crimes must stop immediately. Those responsible, and their accomplices, will be held to account in accordance with international law. The siege of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities., The European Council demands that Russia immediately stop its military aggression in the territory of Ukraine, immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine, and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders., 1There are two types of exceptions in EU sanctions regimes: (i) ‘exemptions’, which are carve-outs from EU sanctions for specific types of goods or activities, and (ii) ‘derogations’, which are authorisations for specific types of goods or activities that would otherwise be prohibited by EU sanctions., Press contacts, Maria Daniela Lenzu, Press officer, +32 2 281 21 46, +32 470 88 04 02",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-introduces-exceptions-restrictive-measures-facilitate-humanitarian-activities

Health",13 Apr 2022,"Copenhagen, 13 April 2022, The Novo Nordisk Foundation has donated 25 million DKK (~3.4 million EUR), to the emergency response, as a result of the war, of the World Health Organization in Ukraine and countries that are hosting Ukrainian refugees., The funds granted by the Denmark-based Foundation are fully flexible and can therefore be swiftly used to cover urgent needs in WHO's response to a complex health emergency where the situation on the ground is extremely fluid., ""The situation in Ukraine grows more dire by the day and requires continued awareness from the international community. With this grant, the Novo Nordisk Foundation is supporting the important work WHO is doing to ensure access to imperative health services in Ukraine and neighbouring countries affected by the invasion,"" says Hanna Line Jakobsen, Senior Vice President, Novo Nordisk Foundation., The Foundation is one of the largest philanthropic actors in the world. In 2021 alone, it awarded DKK 8.8 billion (EUR 1,182 million) in grants. Previously, the Foundation had, after the war broke out on 24 February, released 55 million DKK/7.4 million EURO to emergency relief efforts in and around Ukraine., WHO's emergency appeal, Taking on one of its biggest public health challenges in decades, the World Health Organization in Europe, barely a week after the war started in Ukraine; issued an emergency appeal, detailing priorities and funding needs in the next three months; a total of 52 million EUR., As of April 13, the appeal is more than fully funded, thanks to donors like the Novo Nordisk Foundation -- enabling WHO to reach up to 6 million people in need., ""Contributions such as this mean that we can train health workers to tackle urgent needs, that insulin reaches those with diabetes, that hospital operating theatres remain equipped and stocked, and that tourniquets and morphine reach facilities treating the wounded. This donation, and others like it save lives,"" said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., Based on growing needs and developments in Ukraine and surrounding countries; and the stark fact that the ongoing hostilities have triggered some of the fastest growing population movements in recent memory, WHO will be issuing a second appeal in the coming days., The total number of forcibly displaced people, internally and across borders, as a result of the war in Ukraine is currently estimated at 11.4 million. Of the nearly 5 million that have sought refuge in neighbouring countries where they require basic health, nearly half are in Poland., Within Ukraine's borders, essential health care is disrupted; jeopardizing the treatment of chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The risk of infectious diseases is significant and routine immunization has come to a halt, as has COVID-19 vaccination. Access to reproductive-, mental- maternal- and ante-natal care, is severely impacted due to security concerns, restricted mobility, broken supply chains and mass displacement., WHO's response, To date, WHO has reached more than half a million people in Ukraine -- through the delivery of 180 metric tonnes of medicine and emergency medical supplies. The UN health agency's priority is emergency and trauma care and continuity of essential health services in the war-torn country., WHO has been in Ukraine since 1994, is the Health Cluster lead agency there and works with more than 80 national and international partners on the ground., From its warehouse in Lviv, western Ukraine, WHO is delivering medical supplies on a near-daily basis through an extensive supply chain across the entire country.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",13 Apr 2022,"The war in Ukraine has destroyed everybody’s lives regardless of who they are. We have watched in horror as children have been passed over heads onto trains, at fathers left to fight, and a steady trail of exhausted, traumatised people of all ages fleeing further West., But it is an uncomfortable truth that while war does not discriminate, the international response does. Time and again, the toll of war on older people is overlooked as they struggle to survive and piece together a new normal. As this conflict unfolds, there are millions of older people confronting the scourge of war, isolated and alone., One in three of the people needing assistance after the Russians invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, were over 60, making it the world's oldest humanitarian crisis. Yet the international community failed to recognise this, failed to identify and respond effectively to meet their specific needs., For many, conflict was not new, having lived through World War II, Soviet rule and the road to independence. Their bodies, minds and communities were already scarred., When I last visited the region in 2016, I saw the toll that the conflict had taken. The local economy was on its knees, poverty and long-term unemployment had rocketed. Younger people had left for work elsewhere, leaving older relatives alone with nobody to care for them. There was no electricity or gas. Untreated chronic health conditions -- like diabetes and high blood pressure -- had caused many to lose their independence, develop disabilities and face unnecessary suffering. The fear of intermittent shelling and the risk of landmines was constant., The contact line exacerbated isolation for so many. Those who lived in non-government-controlled areas, could only access healthcare and pensions by enduring long queues and bureaucracy to cross the line into government-held territory. By 2019, more than 450,000 of the 1.2m pensioners living in areas outside of government jurisdiction were surviving without a basic income because they were required to register as an internally displaced person to receive their pension. Not only were they living in a state of war, they could barely afford basic food supplies or medication., Now, many of the people I met are hidden away within their homes. We surveyed more than 1,500 older people in eastern Ukraine at the beginning of March and found that 99% of older people in Donetsk and Luhansk had no plans to leave. For many, mobility difficulties mean leaving is not possible. Many do not have families nearby to help. Worse still, many cannot even reach the local shelters, making them sitting targets., This experience is not unique. Older people often remain at home in times of conflict. Some may stay because they do not want to be a burden to their families, they want to protect their home, or simply because of moving so many times before. But the body vest of being older is no protection for the barbarity of war. And the hand of assistance frequently fails to reach them in its aftermath., As the war sweeps further into Ukraine, there will be more older people left behind, isolated and in urgent need of food, water, heating, and mental health support. 25% of Ukraine's population is over 60 years old., For those who make it across the border into neighbouring countries, they will also require specific help as they attempt to recover from the journey and navigate new surroundings in a blur., A report from Human Rights Watch examining different conflicts shows how older people are subjected to the same abuses as others -- including killing, attack, abduction, rape or torture -- and can be at greater risk., Of course, the ability to escape is one factor. Reports of older people unable to flee so being pushed back into burning homes by security forces in Myanmar haunt me. But the Human Rights Watch report also documents other challenges, like displaced people facing difficulties in registering for and accessing assistance in South Sudan, having their properties looted in Gaza City, or being arbitrarily arrested and detained in Ethiopia., How do older people access the medication they need or manage without the walking stick they previously used in a war zone? How do they rebuild their homes with no income or family support? How can they recover from the devastating mental health issues of isolation and trauma? This is the challenge we are stepping up to at HelpAge International, as we respond to the impact this crisis is having on the older people of Ukraine., These people represent millions of older women and men in other conflicts around the world, whose specific needs for survival also remain unaddressed and expose them to further danger. For too long, older people have been ignored by international bodies and governments. This is systemic ageism and an example of how bad the global system is at responding to older people's needs., The oldest humanitarian crisis must be a wake-up call for governments and the international community to urgently reset its approach. The specific needs of older Ukrainians must be identified and met. And this should be the start of a more inclusive approach when responding to humanitarian emergencies elsewhere around the world., By Justin Derbyshire, CEO, HelpAge International, This blog was first published by Duncan Green.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-war-older-people-ukraine-and-everywhere-else

The National Assembly of People with Disabilities of Ukraine has confirmed that the situation for persons with disabilities is appalling., ""As a result of the Russian Federation military offensive, people with disabilities cannot leave their homes and are therefore exposed to greater danger; mothers of children with disabilities are afraid that they may be killed and worry about what will happen to their children."", Inclusive humanitarian response for all, Thus, CBM joins EDF to appeal to governments to recognise their obligations to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities., EDF's Disabled Persons' Organisations (DPO) members in Ukraine, Latvia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland have already started this work, or are making plans to do so. Activities for the short to medium term include:, EDF is also exploring collaboration with DPO members in other countries. The overall strategy is designed to ensure that this early response leads to recovery work that builds members' capacity in the longer term.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/cbm-provides-humanitarian-aid
FAO and Belgium provide emergency livelihoods assistance to rural people in Ukraine affected by the war,News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Contributions",13 Apr 2022,"The war in Ukraine is affecting the food security of the most vulnerable rural households across the country. For rural and isolated communities, the war is resulting in large-scale displacement, compounding existing vulnerabilities and disrupting agricultural livelihoods., Food consumption gaps are expected to grow among the most vulnerable. Instability has led to a lack of affordable agricultural inputs, market barriers, price fluctuations, and poor access to water, negatively impacting agricultural activities and food production. Displacement, insecurity and damage to infrastructure puts production at further risk., Without time-critical agricultural assistance, vulnerable farming households’ food insecurity will worsen, potentially compelling them to adopt negative coping mechanisms, including extreme actions like selling productive assets, forced migration and increased gender-based violence. It is therefore critical to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable smallholders and support the recovery of the agriculture sector. Agricultural assistance combined with cash assistance (cash+) is vital to improving food security, especially for the most vulnerable households, including those headed by women, the elderly and people with disabilities. In response, FAO has formulated a Rapid Response Plan to support farmers throughout the country who choose to stay, including internally displaced people and host families, to plant their fields, save their livestock and produce food., Through Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium contributed USD 500 000 to FAO to mitigate the adverse impacts of the war on the food security of vulnerable rural households in Ukraine. With Belgium’s generous support, FAO will assist 880 smallholder farmers (2 640 people) by providing them with season-sensitive agricultural inputs, along with unconditional, multi-purpose cash transfers to prevent the use of negative coping mechanisms such as accumulating debts or selling livelihood assets.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-and-belgium-provide-emergency-livelihoods-assistance-rural-people-ukraine
UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine sign a Memorandum in support of children affected by war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,9 Apr 2022,"UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine signed a Memorandum consolidating efforts to protect childrens’ rights. The focus will be on the protection of the rights of orphan children, children in institutional care, children from foster families, family-type orphanages, foster families that have been taken into care and other children who had to temporarily flee abroad due to war., The Memorandum states that UNICEF will continue providing technical and financial support to the Government to address child protection issues in Ukraine and abroad., One of key challenges is the lack of a centralized information management system between countries to monitor the whereabouts of children and whether their rights are being upheld. For example, over the past week Ukraine’s Child Protection Service has been working to implement a tracking system and set up a database of children from Ukrainian institutions that have been evacuated to other countries., The safety and wellbeing of nearly 100,000 children from Ukrainian institutions is under threat., Within the framework of the Memorandum, Ukraine and EU countries will cooperate through consulates, central and local executive bodies, and local governments. The main objective is to register children, understand where they are located abroad and in what conditions, identify their needs and support those in need., Social workers from Ukraine and EU countries will work together on an identification and tracking system, decision-making mechanisms for registration of children transferred from institutions, unaccompanied children and children that have been separated from their guardians. This work will also ensure the integration of children into protection systems and their further reunification with families in Ukraine., Media contacts, Olha Pryshko

Six weeks on and now, nearly 3 million children in Ukraine need humanitarian assistance., ""More than 4.5 million people, over 90 per cent of whom are women and children, have crossed into neighbouring countries as refugees and IOM estimates that 7.1 million people are now internally displaced and more than 50 per cent of displaced households include children., ""Children are being killed and injured because of the violence around them. The UN has so far verified the deaths of 142 children, with nearly 230 injured. The true figures are most certainly much higher given the scale of attacks. And they have been hurt in the very places where they should be safest – their homes, emergency shelters, even hospitals., ""Attacks using explosive weapons continue in populated urban areas. Homes, schools, hospitals, water systems, power plants, and places where civilians seek shelter continue to come under attack. According to the WHO, there have been more than 100 attacks impacting health care facilities., ""Families are risking their lives to escape. They should not have to do this. As we all saw, Kramatorsk train station in Donetsk oblast was attacked on April 8th, killing dozens of civilians, including children, many of whom were seeking to evacuate to relatively safer areas., ""While visiting Zaporizhzhia in the south-east, I spoke with children and families who had managed to escape areas of intense fighting primarily to the south and east of the town., ""At the intensive care unit, I met 4-year-old Vlad. He had been injured by two bullets to his abdomen. His grandfather told me that Vlad was in a vehicle with ten people when they came under fire. Six people were injured, including Vlad. Thankfully, the doctors think he will survive., ""The head of the hospital told me that since the start of the war, they have treated 22 children who have lost limbs because of the violence., ""The reports of grave violations and other serious rights violations against children are devastating. Children should never be the victims of conflict and must be protected by all parties in accordance with applicable international law., ""And across the country, children are facing severely curtailed access to essential services like health care, protection, water, sanitation and education. The scale and scope of the need for services will only grow as the war drags on and fighting intensifies in other areas., ""UNICEF’s response is evolving to meet the needs of children wherever they may be. We are pre-positioning more supplies in areas across the east where we fear the conflict could worsen. ‘Spilno Centers’ are being established at strategic hubs to support children and families on the move inside Ukraine., ""These integrated services include a space for children to play, staff who can provide some emotional support and other services such as where to get care for existing medical conditions., ""We are also getting cash to 52,000 households to ease some of the impacts of lost livelihoods and setting up life in a new place., ""Across the country, we have reached nearly 600,000 people with life-saving medical supplies through hospitals and maternity homes in Dnipro, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr. And we’ve provided almost 240,000 people with drinking water and hygiene supplies in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Kyiv and Lviv., ""UNICEF’s US$276M appeal for urgent programmes inside Ukraine and US$73.1M for critical programmes in neighbouring countries are being revised significantly upwards to reflect the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation. As of 6 April, there was a funding gap of nearly US$53M for UNICEF’s response inside Ukraine and a US$6.3M funding gap for UNICEF’s response in refugee-hosting countries., ""But humanitarian partners can only do so much.

This included:, a total of 1,892 killed (478 men, 308 women, 30 girls, and 52 boys, as well as 71 children and 953 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,558 injured (291 men, 219 women, 51 girls, and 51 boys, as well as 144 children and 1,802 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,957 casualties (675 killed and 1,282 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,599 casualties (600 killed and 999 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 358 casualties (75 killed and 283 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,493 casualties (1,217 killed and 1,276 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 12 April (local time), 186 children had been killed and at least 344 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-11-april-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Apr 2022,"As conflict in Ukraine continues, the American Red Cross has contributed $12 million dollars toward relief efforts. This support allows the Red Cross network to provide lifesaving aid to those in need --- both in the country and in neighboring areas., The contribution includes $10 million dollars to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to help alleviate the suffering caused by this devastating crisis as well as $2 million dollars to the Danish Red Cross to provide emergency supplies to people displaced within Ukraine. This includes non-perishable food items, first aid kits, blankets and hygiene kits to people fleeing their homes inside the country as well as families sheltering in place and unable to access life-saving supplies., More than 10 million people have been displaced by this conflict, more than four million of whom have fled Ukraine to nearby countries. An estimated 18 million --- a third of the country's population --- will need humanitarian assistance., As the fighting continues and the dire humanitarian situation unfolds, the needs on the ground remain critical. Over the past month, the Red Cross has reached more than a million people with life-saving aid, both within Ukraine and in neighboring countries., ""The devastating reality of Ukraine is that the needs are growing every day. Amidst increased violence and a disrupted supply chain, delivering essential goods in many parts of the country is getting harder --- not easier,"" said Francesco Rocca, President of the IFRC. ""Responding to a crisis of this magnitude takes teamwork, which is why we're working hand-in-hand with the Ukrainian Red Cross on the ground to let people know that they're not alone. Not ever,"" he states., In Ukraine: Aid Amidst the Violence, Under mortal danger to themselves, Red Cross teams are still working tirelessly to help people and communities impacted by conflict. The constant violence across the country has left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity, water and food. Damaged roads have disrupted supply chains, leaving communities cut off from food and basic supplies., In Mariupol, Ukraine, local officials report that more than 90 percent of all hospitals and schools have been damaged, while 40 percent have been completely destroyed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is making every continual effort to deliver urgently needed aid to the city. In its role as a neutral intermediary, ICRC has made detailed proposals regarding safe passage and evacuations for civilians to ease the massive suffering taking place in Mariupol, but the concrete agreements needed to move forward have not yet been reached. Today, civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely., Around the clock, teams are providing emergency aid amid fear and uncertainty. Since the conflict intensified on February 24, Red Cross teams have:, Distributed more than 1,000 tons of emergency aid, including food, bedding, tents, water and hygiene items to more than 300,000 people across Ukraine., Supported the evacuation of over 58,000 people from the towns of Energodar and Sumy and the Kviy, Kharkiv and Kherson regions., Provided first aid training to more than 42,000 people across the country., Assisted with the evacuation of people with disabilities., Supported logistics pipelines into Ukraine to ensure critical items can be delivered., In Kharkiv, Ukraine, ICRC recently provided 60 tons of food, water and hygiene items to people in need.
In the coming weeks, Red Cross volunteers will increase their work reuniting separated families, providing food and other household items, and increasing awareness about areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance. The current needs are tremendous, critical among them include water delivery, support to health facilities and medical care for families wounded., In Neighboring Countries: Help for Those Fleeing their Homes, People impacted by the conflict are heartbroken, as they are forced to flee from their homes. Each day, Red Cross and Red Crescent teams in the region are rolling up their sleeves to assist with this dire humanitarian crisis as it unfolds. In Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Belarus, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Red Cross volunteers are supporting displaced people. Trucks and planes loaded with goods are arriving regularly to provide critical items for those in need., Red Cross teams from all over Europe are also providing aid supplies to those fleeing Ukraine. For example, more than nine tons of aid donated by the Portuguese Red Cross, which includes blankets and hygiene kits, arrived in Moldova this week and are being distributed to families in the community., Teams across eastern Europe are:, Distributing food, water, clothing, bedding, hygiene sets, blankets and even handing out SIM cards so that families can stay connected amid the turmoil., Providing medical care at border crossings., Supplying baby products and services for children., Pitching tents and preparing shelters for refugees who need a comforting place to sleep and feel safe., Providing health-related services and medical support to those in need., Providing psychosocial support for those who are physically, mentally and emotionally stressed., Helping connect people to other essential services.
Role of the American Red Cross, The American Red Cross has donated $10 million dollars to the IFRC in support the vital work being done in Ukraine and in surrounding countries. These funds support the most vital humanitarian needs including food, shelter, critical care items and first aid., The American Red Cross has also deployed international crisis responders to Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania to provide humanitarian relief in support of the international Red Cross operation helping families who fled their homes. These highly trained crisis responders---who are lending skills such as information management, cash assistance programming, GIS systems, communications and leadership---are supporting on-the-ground relief efforts alongside local teams, including the Polish Red Cross, Moldovan Red Cross and Romanian Red Cross., Additionally, in line with its work supporting military families, the American Red Cross has sent trained staff to Europe to support emergency communication needs of U.S. military members, so they can stay in touch with family members back home. The Red Cross Hero Care Network is a Congressionally-chartered program that connects service members and their families in times of need. Red Crossers are also distributing comfort kits, containing hygiene items and other necessities to service members and U.S. State Department staff., Blood Services, At this time, the American Red Cross is not shipping blood products to Ukraine. The American Red Cross does not ship blood products outside the U.S. without a specific request from the U.S. Department of State, from the United Nations, or unless we have a request from affected Red Cross or Red Crescent societies abroad., Can I Volunteer or Donate Goods?, In countries around the world, Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations have their own staff and volunteers who are trained to respond to large-scale disaster operations. The American Red Cross sends highly specialized and experienced professionals with technical skills and expertise abroad only after the Red Cross or Red Crescent team requests assistance. Those not already on the Red Cross's international disaster roster will not have the opportunity to deploy at this time. We encourage you to connect with your local Red Cross chapter for future opportunities or to visit redcross.org/volunteer for more information., While we are grateful for the outpouring of support, it's important to know that neither the American Red Cross, nor our global Red Cross partners, are accepting the donation of in-kind goods such as food, clothing, blankets or toys at this time. These items can be difficult to manage on the ground and divert resources from our mission. Other charitable organizations are better suited to manage such donations., International Humanitarian Law, ICRC called on authorities to adhere to international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and infrastructure delivering essential services, including power and water facilities, schools and hospitals. Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC, requested protection for humanitarian action so that aid agencies can maintain access to civilians. ICRC has also called for parties to agree to terms so safe passage of civilians is possible., Protecting Red Cross Workers, The Red Cross emblem is strictly regulated under humanitarian law. In armed conflict, it may be used by medical staff and facilities, including army medics and vehicles. It may also be used by Red Cross and Red Crescent workers, vehicles, facilities and the humanitarian relief they bring.
Resources for People Affected by the Conflict, If you are trying to locate or get in touch with a U.S. citizen, please contact the U.S. Department of State Overseas Citizens Services Office online or call 1-888-407-4747. However, if you are looking for a family member who is not a U.S. citizen but is located in either Ukraine or Russia, the Red Cross may be able to reconnect you through our Restoring Family Links program., In neighboring countries where Ukrainians have fled, the Red Cross is distributing SIM cards for cell phones, so people can get in touch with their loved ones. Some family members have maintained contact with each other, but the situation is rapidly changing. As of now, most have maintained their own family connections via cell phones, but it is important to note that the telecommunication systems in the region have been affected. The ICRC and Ukraine Red Cross will continue to work together to help reconnect families, despite considerable challenges on the ground., How can I learn more about the Red Cross response?, ICRC and IFRC have a comprehensive list of resources, including maps, press releases, videos, photos and stories, further expanding upon Red Cross efforts in the region, About the American Red Cross:, The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to victims of disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families.

Caritas Internationalis mourns the death of two Caritas staff in Mariupol. “It is urgent to stop the indiscriminate massacre of civilians”,News and Press Release,Caritas,Safety and Security,12 Apr 2022,"“This dramatic news leaves our Caritas family horrified and shocked. We join in grief and solidarity with the suffering of the families and our colleagues of Caritas Ukraine who are living a tragedy”. With these words, the Secretary General of Caritas Internationalis, Aloysius John, expresses the sorrow of the Confederation to the news of the death of two female staff members of Caritas Ukraine Mariupol., It has been known only in the past few hours, but the tragic attack probably took place on the 15th of March, when a tank fired shots at the building of the Caritas centre in Mariupol, killing two staff members and five of their relatives. At this point of time, due to the absence of communication with the city of Mariupol as well as the lack of access to the premises of the Caritas centre, our Caritas Ukraine national office is still collecting information to determine what happened. It is presumed the two Caritas staff members, together with their families, took refuge in the centre during the time of the shelling attack., The president of Caritas Ukraine, Tetiana Stawnychy, asks for special attention to be given to the memory of the victims: “We need your solidarity and prayers for the families of the victims, for the community of Caritas Mariupol, and the community of Caritas Ukraine.”, “Caritas Internationalis reiterates its incessant appeal for peace, as we have been doing for 48 days now. The ‘martyrdom’ in Ukraine – as Pope Francis has called it – must stop, and it must stop now. The international community must do the impossible to stop this massacre immediately. Peace must be given a chance. Armed conflict and violence are not the solution. Human lives must be safeguarded and human dignity upheld. Safety of civilians must be ensured,” adds John., Caritas organisations also condemn the widespread violation of international humanitarian law in several areas of Ukraine. Since the beginning of the conflict, the two Caritas organisations present in Ukraine – Caritas Ukraine and Caritas-Spes Ukraine – have stood by the people and so far, with the cooperation of the Caritas Confederation, have provided around 600,000 people with lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Caritas organisations in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries continue to provide life-saving assistance to the population in the country and to refugees fleeing the war., Caritas Internationalis Secretary General, Aloysius John, says the Confederation are deeply grateful to all Caritas workers and volunteers who continue unceasingly to serve people in need, even at the risk of their own lives.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/caritas-internationalis-mourns-death-two-caritas-staff-mariupol-it-urgent-stop

Already, 4.5 million people who have become refugees and over 7 million people displaced within Ukraine are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Schools, hospitals and public infrastructure have been destroyed - meaning the threat of harm to people, their communities and services which they depend on is displacement as people seek safety., ""This war has been rife with severe breaches of international humanitarian law and attacks on public infrastructure such as the Kramatorsk train station on Friday or schools and hospitals is a clear example of the Age of Impunity in which we live; where those that breach international laws do so without accountability.

In the meantime, attacks, including missile strikes, continue to occur in other parts of the country and, most recently, in central Ukraine., • Nearly two-thirds of Ukrainian children have been displaced in the last six weeks as people continue to flee their homes, especially in areas impacted by escalating hostilities in eastern and southern areas of the country., • The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has financed the procurement of liquefied chlorine for the Kharkiv Vodokanal (water provider) and liquified chlorine gas for Uzhhorod Vodokanal, to facilitate safe water supply, as attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages have left an estimated 1.4 million people across the country without access to water, and another 4.6 million people with only limited access., • Health Cluster partners have delivered over 570 tons of medicines, medical supplies, equipment and kits as of 11 April, as attacks against health facilities continue to rise, with 108 attacks reported by 11 April., • The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warns of a looming increase in food insecurity as a result of the ongoing military offensive alongside a significant leap in global food commodity prices., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. During the reporting period, hostilities intensified in eastern and southern Ukraine, including in eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts and in southern Khersonska oblast., The civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive continues to grow and has already reached nearly 40 per cent of the total number of civilian casualties as a result of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine recorded between 2014 and 2021 (10,982). As of 10 April, the number of civilian casualties since 24 February 2022 stands at 4,335—including 1,842 killed and 2,493 injured—according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). However, the actual number of civilian casualties is expected to be considerably higher, including according to a recent report by the NGO Data Friendly Space., The bombardment of cities and large towns continues. Most recorded civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems and missile strikes and airstrikes. There are critical humanitarian needs for those living in urban areas across Ukraine where bombardments have taken or are taking place. This is partly due to widespread damage to civilian infrastructure affecting essential services such as electricity, heating and clean water, and critically, the disruption of access to food and health care. Particularly worrying is whether the catastrophic conditions currently occurring in Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast), Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast), among others, will be repeated in other cities. In Mariupol (Donetska oblast), fierce fighting continues and there are grave concerns regarding the true extent of destruction, suffering and needs, which is not yet known., Impacts on food and nutrition security. The ongoing military offensive has not only created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis but also a looming increase in food insecurity in Ukraine and beyond, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). This comes on top of the rise in food insecurity and the worsening nutrition situation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many food-importing countries around the world are likely to be seriously affected by the disruption in the export of cereals and the expected rise in the price of their food imports from the Russian Federation and Ukraine. FAO also warns that impacts on food security will be felt well beyond next year if the military offensive lasts longer. Additionally, FAO reports that global food commodity prices made a significant leap last month, reaching their highest levels ever, as the ongoing fighting sent shock waves through international markets for staple grains and vegetable oils. The FAO Food Price Index averaged 159.3 points in March, up 12.6 per cent from February, when it had already reached its highest level since its inception in 1990. The Index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly traded food commodities., Eastern Ukraine continues to face the fiercest fighting, with Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblast being the most affected. Several settlements in Luhanska oblast, including Hirske, Kreminna, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk, have been under heavy shelling for multiple days, resulting in reports of significant damages to civilian infrastructure and multiple civilian casualties. Critical electricity, water and gas infrastructure has been heavily damaged or destroyed, with no possibility to restore water, gas and electricity supplies as hostilities continue. Meanwhile, in Donetska oblast, heavy fighting reportedly continues in Avdiivka, Donetsk, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Marinka and Vuhledar. In addition to over 160 civilian casualties reported by local authorities as a result of the attack on the Kramatorsk railways station, at least 13 civilians were reportedly killed and 11 injured in the Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Donetska oblast. In neighbouring Kharkivska oblast, the fighting continues in Kharkiv and Izium and surrounding areas. As a result of hostilities, at least 11 civilians were reportedly killed, including one child, and 14 injured in Balakliia, Derhachi, Kharkiv, Pisochyn and Zolochiv on 10 April.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",12 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, OHCHR have recorded more than 2,500 civilian casualties since the start of the military offensive on Ukraine, however the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher. Mariupol, Kharkiv and other urban centres have seen heavy use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes. These weapons have hit residential areas causing widespread devastation with hospitals and schools amongst those buildings damaged or destroyed., It is estimated that 12 million (30%) people inside Ukraine will need relief and protection. Eastern Ukraine is the hardest hit area of Ukraine with the most pressing needs, recording nearly 45% of all civilian casualties across the country so far. Humanitarian needs are also high in the northern and southern regions of Ukraine., 6.5 million people have been internally displaced putting tremendous pressure on cities and towns in the west of the country. Another 2.2 million people have expressed the willingness to leave their place of residence but cannot do so due to insecurity, lack of money or not knowing where they can go. A further 3.7 million people have fled to neighbouring countries, the majority of whom are women and children, with the largest numbers arriving in Poland (2.1 million)., The most critical needs are those of civilians in trapped in encircled cities or in areas under constant bombardment. Residents face severe shortages of food, water and a lack of heating and electricity. There have been many attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors to transport civilians to safety or provide a “silent window” in which to deliver humanitarian supplies. However, many have failed to materialise with convoys being shelled or attacked. In addition, 300,000 people in the city of Kherson which is allegedly under Russian control, are running out of food and medical supplies, and unable to evacuate.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-24-march-2022

Nearly 300 people were buried in a mass grave near Kyiv, in the town of Bucha, with more bodies being found on the streets of the town and in nearby Irpin and Motyzhyn. Heavy bombardment of many cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol continues., Approximately a quarter of Ukraine’s population is now displaced with 4.28 million people fleeing across the borders to neighbouring countries and 7.28 million internally displaced. Although these numbers have increased by approximately 1.3 million over the past 2 weeks, the rate at which displacement is occurring has slowed significantly., Efforts continue to negotiate humanitarian corridors to some of the most conflict-affected areas. The aim is to both deliver humanitarian aid and evacuate civilian residents. However, attempts to reach some areas, such as Mariupol have mostly been unsuccessful. The health and living conditions of those in these encircled cities is of mounting concern., The impact of the conflict on the health sector continues with further damage to health infrastructure, challenges in accessing and distributing adequate medical supplies and increasing pressure on areas hosting large numbers of IDPs. There is a lack of information from some of the areas affected by the heaviest fighting where hundreds of thousands of residents are unable to leave or seek medical assistance due to the ongoing insecurity. Attacks on food silos, loss of livelihoods and the ongoing impact of the conflict on agriculture is driving up food insecurity within Ukraine. IDPs cite financial support as their most pressing need., Online learning has resumed for around three million children, but access to education remains limited in conflict-affected areas and the destruction of education infrastructure continues. Both IDP and refugee children also face challenges to accessing online education services or to integrate into host country education systems while at the same time dealing with the psychological impact of conflict and displacement., Neighbouring countries continue to host residents from Ukraine fleeing the war, offering access to basic services including accommodation, healthcare and education. Some countries also provide cash assistance and support Ukrainians in finding work. Overall hosting conditions have been described as adequate though with a few gaps (notably WASH-related). However, discrimination towards third-country nationals is still being reported and protection risks are on the rise due to an important number of unaccompanied children and a high rate of women within the refugees. Whilst the immediate needs of refugees seem to have been met, there is uncertainty as to how the host countries can cope with the pressure of such a large-scale influx over the longer term.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-06-april-2022

Health-care facilities in the firing line – the unacceptable reality of the war in Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",11 Apr 2022,"One of the largest hospitals in eastern Ukraine, providing specialized medical care to a population of 103 000 people, was used to dealing with the consequences of conflict even before the Russian military offensive began on 24 February 2022. Since 2014, the hospital had been playing a crucial role in treating wounded soldiers from the armed struggle in the nearby Donbas region, as well as caring for the 51 000 civilians displaced by the hostilities., But now, this hospital is out of use., “The hospital was critical for the entire area, because there was a resuscitation unit here and all the medical equipment needed to care for the civilian population, as well as the surgery and emergency facilities required for treating casualties of the conflict,” said Viktor, the head of the hospital., In 2019, WHO installed an oxygen generator at the hospital to make sure there was no disruption to the life-saving care being provided to patients, and also donated equipment for washing and sterilizing medical devices., The start of the war, Andriy, one of the hospital’s health-care workers, recalls the terrifying days following 24 February: “Intensive shelling and attacks on the city began the next day, February 25, and lasted for 10 days. Almost immediately our hospital received an influx of wounded people and we had to set up a bomb shelter in the hospital basement to protect the hundreds of civilians seeking refuge. Most patients and health-care workers were only evacuated from the hospital once the situation had got so bad that we were unable to continue providing medical care.”, After a week and a half of bombardment, the hospital was not just out of action, but so severely damaged that any chance of restarting services was impossible., Health care #NotATarget, As of 6 April, WHO had verified 91 reports of attacks on health care in Ukraine, causing 73 deaths and 46 injuries. This is unacceptable., Attacks on health MUST stop. Not only do they endanger lives, they deprive people of urgently needed care and break already-strained health systems., Health systems, facilities and health workers should never be targets. They must remain protected, functional, safe and accessible to all who need essential medical services.

Women’s involvement is both a right and an opportunity for better outcomes,News and Press Release,UN Women,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",11 Apr 2022,"Remarks by United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women, Sima Bahous, at the UN Security Council briefing on the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine., At the outset, I want to express my solidarity with all Ukrainians: women and girls, men and boys, those who have left for safety and those who have stayed. My heart goes out to all families who have lost a loved one. This war must stop. And it must stop now., I returned last night to New York from Moldova, where the consequences of the senseless war in Ukraine were stark. Moldova has rightfully been described as a small country with a big heart. Despite still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, and with determination to achieve their national development priorities, they opened their borders and homes for those fleeing shelling and guns in Ukraine, the majority of whom are women, children, and elderly. An estimated 95,000 Ukrainians are hosted in-country to date. Thousands and thousands more have transited since the war started., At the different temporary shelters that I visited in Moldova, exhausted, anxious, fearful, tearful mothers shared their worries about the future of their country, about the futures of their daughters and sons, and their families. A young girl from Odessa, Tatyana, told me her city is beautiful. She has a dream to become a doctor, and had her studies abruptly interrupted by the necessity to flee. In an act of determination and resilience, she and her colleagues are continuing their schooling online with the help of their teachers as well. Tatyana is determined to not let this war disrupt her dream., Vitally, a young boy of maybe seven, told me about his sleepless nights worried about his father, who was left behind to patrol the streets in their hometown., I witnessed buses full of women and children arrive at the Palanca border, weary and fearful. There, they were met with dignity and with compassion by volunteers from civil society organizations, many of which we support as UN Women., I heard from women’s civil society organizations how they adapted their work overnight. going from grappling with two emergencies—COVID-19 and the energy crisis—to a third. They were able to work with the Government to ensure that basic needs were met, and services provided. They do this without specific humanitarian response training. UN Women, at their request, is supporting them in this adjustment., UN Women is acting on our coordination mandate, working with the refugee response team and civil society partners to ensure that the gendered nature of this crisis is addressed with a gender-sensitive response. This includes providing services with a focus on protection and to address the increased trauma and psycho-social support needs that I saw so starkly: young women who left their homes at night, families who are separated, and the constant fear of the future. This trauma risks destroying a generation. We must continue our support. But most importantly, we must continue all efforts to advance peace., I condemn, in the strongest possible way, the recent attack on Kramatorsk train station, which also killed civilians and UN civil society partners. The people killed in the train station are like the people I met at the border: women, children, and the elderly looking for safety. Humanitarians are not a target. Civilians are not a target., We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability. The combination of mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags. This esteemed Body will hear more on this from the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict on Wednesday., A war of this magnitude impacts the world far beyond the borders of Ukraine. I also heard from the Government in Moldova, and the border police, a need for increased support to monitor border crossings. The risk of human trafficking is increasing as the situation becomes more desperate. Young women and unaccompanied teenagers are at particular risk. I call on all countries to increase their efforts in combating trafficking and commend all the host countries for their collaboration on that and on prevention. I equally call on all countries to support Moldova and others with increased resources for the police forces so that they can ensure support to victims of gender-based violence and trafficking., Gender-sensitive and survivor-centred response must be at the heart of all humanitarian action., Through all these horrors, women continue to serve and lead their communities and support the internally displaced in Ukraine. Women make up 80 per cent of all health and social care workers in Ukraine, and many of them chose not to evacuate. We have seen the women Members of Parliament continue to fulfil their duties in the Verkhovna Rada while bombs fell around Kyiv. And we have also seen the Deputy Prime Minister engaged in the humanitarian response. I have seen Ukrainian women refugees in Moldova also working in the shelters and taking on roles to support each other., Women’s organizations within Ukraine have not stopped working but are adjusting their work to meet the immediate needs of the populations they serve. They do this at great risk to their own lives. They were there before the war, they remain there during, and they will be there to pick up the pieces after. I salute their courage and their steadfastness. They need our continued support., The Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund is already supporting several women’s organizations on the frontline in Ukraine and in Moldova to aid displaced women and girls with shelter, medication, food, and psychosocial support, including to women and girls living with disabilities or HIV/AIDS. The Fund is also providing institutional support to these organizations to sustain them. With your help, we can do much more., Without fail, every Ukrainian man, woman, and child I met had one dream: to be able to return home. However, as I heard yesterday, many do not have homes to go back to., I call on this Council to continue to use all avenues for peace. From UN Women’s own rapid gender analysis, we know that women are asking to be part of the solution. I heard from women in the shelters that they, too, are taking on leadership roles and supporting the refugee responses in the host countries. Many of them are in touch with other women, their friends and families who are supporting the internally displaced populations within Ukraine., We know from experience that women’s participation makes response and recovery more effective and sustainable, and women’s organizations are uniquely qualified to help not just women, but other marginalized and vulnerable groups. It is vital that they are consulted and engaged in all decisions related to the crisis response and related to peace. They need not to be seen as victims only, but as the agents and leaders of change that they are., This Security Council has adopted ten resolutions calling for women to be meaningfully involved in any decision or negotiation about peace and security, and we know that women’s involvement is both a right and an opportunity for better outcomes. This is especially important in a war that has so starkly illustrated gender-based differences. Let us not lose sight of this. I have seen first-hand the impact women’s leadership can have. Yet, women are largely absent from any current negotiation efforts., We ask this Security Council, all Member States, and our development and humanitarian partners, to ensure the meaningful participation of women and girls, including from marginalized groups, in all decision-making processes, in peace, diplomatic, and humanitarian processes. Without this, we will not have peace, development, or human security., To conclude, we strongly echo the Secretary-General’s repeated calls for peace, an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory., Tatyana, the young girl from the shelter in Moldova, must be supported and enabled to pursue her medical degree, and to be a part of the future of her country. The war must stop. And it must stop now., I thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/women-s-involvement-both-right-and-opportunity-better-outcomes
Finding our most useful role in our response in and around Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,11 Apr 2022,"“The severity, scale and speed of the war in Ukraine have created simply enormous needs and suffering,” says Dr Joanne Liu, an experienced paediatrician and member of the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency response team who is just back from Ukraine., “It is clear that the Ukrainian medical system is robust and its capacity to rise to the challenge is impressive,” says Dr Liu, who visited Ukrainian hospitals to help assess their needs and discuss how MSF can help. “The best thing we can do is listen closely and understand the specific areas where our support can provide real added value.”, “We have identified several key areas where our humanitarian and medical support can be of real, practical and sometimes directly lifesaving benefit,” says Dr Liu., Emergency medical supplies, From the start, there was a clear need to get the right medical supplies, to the right hospitals, as quickly as possible. This began with urgent calls received from hospital staff close to frontline fighting and bombing who mostly needed surgical, trauma and wound care medicines and supplies. Lately this has widened to include medicines for diseases such as asthma, hypertension, HIV, hypothyroidism and tuberculosis., We opened a major distribution warehouse in the western city of Lviv and subsequently opened other warehouses in other locations in Ukraine., To date, MSF has brought more than 225 metric tonnes of medical and relief supplies into Ukraine. Much of it has already been dispatched to hospitals and health centres, or to the Ministry of Health for onward transport to the places where it is most needed. Moving supplies around a country at war is not easy, but our teams have found the Ukrainian Railways to be invaluable., We have also brought in five shipping containers filled with thermal fleece blankets, sleeping bags, warm clothes and hygiene items (such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap and towels), and given them to local civil society organisations in Lviv to distribute to people arriving in the city from elsewhere in Ukraine or making their way towards the country’s borders. We have done further distributions of relief essentials in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other locations., Medical train referrals, On 1 April MSF completed its first medical train referral, taking nine patients who had been wounded in or near Mariupol from hospitals in Zaporizhzhia to hospitals in Lviv. We transported them on a two-carriage train kitted out as a basic hospital ward, with a team of nine MSF medical staff on board., Three further referrals by this train were from hospitals close to frontlines of the war in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A total of 114 patients have been medically evacuated to date, with their family members. Further medical referrals by train are planned as the urgent requests from hospitals in the east continue to grow, while a larger and more highly medicalised train is being got ready for use., Mass casualty training and trauma care, “When a hospital receives many patients at one time, we call it a mass casualty situation – when you don’t have enough resources and the patients have too many needs,” says Barbara Maccagno, Emergency Medical Coordinator in Ukraine. “One of the most effective ways to save as many lives as possible is to have systems to help you quickly triage the most severe patients who need to be treated right away, and the patients who are less severe and who can wait a bit longer.”, “It can be learned quite easily, but it does have to be practised, as it is different from the usual way that hospital admissions work,” says Maccagno., We have conducted mass casualty training in hospitals in Berehove, Bila Tserkva, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Lviv, Mukachevo, Odesa, Orikhiv, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, and in hospitals in and around Zhytomyr., Some of the MSF training teams have included experienced war-trauma surgeons, who have given additional hands-on practical training in surgical techniques for extraction of bullets and shrapnel and wound cleaning., Less visible needs, Before the war started, we were treating tuberculosis patients in Zhytomyr; we will continue to seek ways to support them in their treatment, although this is challenging when people are on the move., In Kyiv, MSF has established a telephone hotline for people with non-communicable diseases, which can be used by elderly and vulnerable individuals to get their medication delivered at home. In Kharkiv, we are running mobile clinics for people sheltering in metro stations, many of whom are suffering stress and psychological trauma due to the war., In Chernihiv, we provided a substantial donation of medical supplies to one of the hospitals in the city. We have also set up mobile clinics in neighbouring villages and in the city to respond to health needs., Our teams are also starting to provide mental health support to people who have fled areas of more active fighting and have gathered in Kyiv, Vinnytsia and Berehove or are transiting through Zaporizhzhia. In and around Dnipro, we are providing essential relief items for people who have managed to escape Mariupol and the Donetsk region., Areas with active warfare, The greatest needs are undoubtedly in places with active warfare that our teams cannot reach. Civilians trapped in besieged cities need safe passage to locations of their choice., Humanitarian supplies must be allowed to reach areas where civilians are in dire need. Civilians must be protected under the rules of war and international humanitarian law, in all places and at all times., Around Ukraine’s borders, More than four million refugees have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries, according to UNHCR. In most of these countries, there is massive solidarity to welcome and provide assistance for Ukrainians, and we do not intend to duplicate these activities., In countries bordering Ukraine, our teams are running clinics providing medical care and mental health support at border crossings and sometimes on both sides of the border. We have made donations of medical supplies, and we are supporting local civil society groups, for example, by training them in psychological first aid., While it is heart-warming to witness the solidarity shown to Ukrainian refugees by individuals, we note with distress that the governments of EU member states continue to demonstrate strongly repressive approaches to safe passage for refugees of other nationalities arriving in Europe., We urge safe passage and dignified reception to be extended to all people arriving in Europe as migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, wherever they arrive and by whatever means.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/finding-our-most-useful-role-our-response-and-around-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",11 Apr 2022,"SC/14857, SECURITY COUNCIL
9013TH MEETING (AM), Increasing reports of sexual violence and human trafficking in Ukraine — allegedly committed against women and children in the context of massive displacement and ongoing fighting — are raising “all the red flags” about a potential protection crisis, the Executive Director of the United Nations gender agency warned the Security Council today., Sima Bahous, Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), said she recently returned from the Republic of Moldova where she witnessed buses full of exhausted and anxious women and children arriving from Ukraine. There, they were met with dignity and compassion by volunteers from civil society organizations, many of which are being supported by UN-Women — as part of its coordination mandate — “to ensure that the gendered nature of this crisis is addressed with a gender-sensitive response”., Condemning in the strongest terms an 8 April attack on a train station in Kramatorsk, which killed dozens of women and children waiting for evacuation from Ukraine, she also warned that “this trauma risks destroying a generation”. Allegations of rape and sexual violence perpetrated on those fleeing are now emerging, and the large numbers of displaced persons — with the presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainians in the current conflict — raises red flags., Calling on all countries to support the Republic of Moldova and other neighbouring countries with resources and support, she said through all those horrors, women continue to lead and serve their communities. They make up 80 per cent of all health and social care workers in Ukraine, and many have chosen not to flee. Women parliamentarians, as well as Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister, continue their work as bombs fall all around them. Saluting their courage, she emphasized that women must be involved in all efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the crisis, stressing: “We know from experience that women’s participation makes response and recovery more effective and sustainable.”, Manuel Fontaine, Director of Emergencies at the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said its teams were offloading life-saving humanitarian supplies just a kilometre away from the Kramatorsk attack. Children, families and communities remain under attack, many do not have enough food, and attacks on water systems have left some 1.4 million without access to safe water. As of 10 April, the United Nations has verified 142 children killed and 229 children injured, but “we know these numbers are likely much higher”. Meanwhile, hundreds of schools and educational facilities have also been attacked or used for military purposes., He stressed that nearly two thirds of all Ukrainian children have been displaced since the conflict began, and echoed reports of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence. Against that backdrop, UNICEF and its partners are doing everything possible, both inside and outside Ukraine. However, ongoing fighting is preventing access to many areas of the country. He recounted recent visits to reception centres for internally displaced persons — run mostly by women professionals — that offer access to health and psychosocial services, warm meals and temporary rest. UNICEF is also carefully monitoring the health, rights and dignity of women and girls as the risk of exploitation and abuse grows, he said., Offering a civil society perspective was Kateryna Cherepakha, President of the organization La Strada-Ukraine, who said local human rights groups are currently consolidating efforts to save civilian lives and collect survivor testimonies about the war crimes committed by the Russian Federation. Despite clear indications of their status as civilians — and even as they seek evacuation — unarmed Ukrainian women carrying children have been brutally killed by Russian troops, she said, pointing to attacks on the railway station in Kramatorsk, as well as a maternity hospitals, kindergartens and shelters in Mariupol. Highlighting the increased vulnerability of women in local administrations to the threat of kidnapping, torture and killing, she said female prisoners of war have been exposed to torture and sexual violence., However, she warned against viewing Ukrainian women as mere victims of the Russian military aggression. Ukrainian women volunteers, activists, journalists and human rights defenders are an integral part of her country and its resistance. Calling on all members of the Security Council, international institutions and Governments to demonstrate solidarity, she stressed the need for practical actions to stop the Russian Federation’s aggression., As Council members took the floor, the representative of the United States said that when men like Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin start wars, women and children get hurt, displaced, raped and killed. Highlighting the 8 April missile attack on a train station being used for civilian evacuations, she said that a large piece of the missile had a message in Russian on its side saying, “For the children.” Anyone at risk before war — including women and children, religious and ethnic minorities, people living with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons — is now at heightened risk. In that context, she called for strengthened protection efforts, pathways to healing and access to justice for survivors, agreeing that women are far from passive victims in this war., The representative of Ireland also sounded alarm over “bone-chilling” allegations that children are among those being abused in Ukraine. “Conflict-related sexual violence can constitute a war crime and those responsible must be held to account,” he stressed, adding that accountability must also extend to military commanders who fail to take all “necessary and reasonable” steps to stop such abuses or fail to ensure they are investigated and prosecuted. Warning of an emerging child-protection crisis, he said the international community has a responsibility to respond., Poland’s representative said nearly 2.6 million refugees from Ukraine have already arrived in his country, the vast majority women and children who cross the border with no contacts and find themselves at risk of trafficking and abuse. They are physically and psychologically weakened, unfamiliar with their new surroundings and highly vulnerable to criminals. To protect them, Polish authorities have put measures in place at all border crossing areas and reception centres to control who has direct access to refugees, including through strict identification and registration protocols., The representative of Ukraine said that, over the past week, many foreign leaders, journalists and United Nations officials have visited crime scenes in Ukraine and were shocked by what they saw. The Russian Federation has launched a policy of extermination against his people, he said, also noting that Ms. Cherepakha’s snapshot of the repressions being committed against Ukrainian women are just a few instances of many. Against that backdrop, the national prosecutor’s office is launching a special mechanism to document sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers against Ukrainian women, and is closely cooperating with non-governmental groups and United Nations officials working in a similar capacity on the ground., The Russian Federation’s representative, rejecting the ongoing distortion of his country’s special military operation in Ukraine and promotion of “fakes” by the West, described the attack in Kramatorsk as a classic false flag operation committed by Ukrainian forces. Photographs taken by witnesses made it possible to determine the type of rocket and the direction from which it was launched, both of which point to Ukraine as the perpetrator. Meanwhile, in the city of Irpin, a provocation borrowing the script from Bucha and Nemmersdorf is being prepared, with Ukrainian forces transferring bodies from a morgue into a building basement to stage a shooting event., Also speaking were the representatives of Albania, France, Ghana, Mexico, India, Norway, Brazil, China, United Arab Emirates, Gabon, Kenya, United Kingdom, Romania and Germany., The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 12:59 p.m., Request by Russian Federation to Remove Agenda Items Pertaining to Ukraine, DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation), taking the floor prior to the formal start of the meeting, said that while his delegation is not against adding today’s far-reaching item to the Council’s agenda, it is preferable to delete the two other agenda items pertaining to the situation in Ukraine — namely, those regarding letters to the Council from the representatives of Ukraine and the Russian Federation, which date back to 2014. This reflects common sense, as well as the current situation, he said, asking the Council President to take the necessary procedural steps to amend the organ’s agenda in line with his request., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said today’s agenda item was proposed without prejudice to the 2014 letters referred to by the Russian Federation’s delegate. While the scope of the situation in Ukraine has grown far beyond the circumstances in 2014, “it is important to recognize its history”, and members may wish to refer to those items in the future. As such, those agenda items should be maintained, she said., Mr. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) reiterated that his delegation is not against having meetings continue on approved agenda items, but expressed his hope that his comments will be considered., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), Council President for April, said the process for amending the organ’s agenda is governed by Note 507 and normally takes three years to complete. As such, she suggested the request made by the Russian Federation be discussed in a separate setting in the coming days., Briefings, SIMA BAHOUS, Executive Director, United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), expressed solidarity with Ukrainian women, men, girls and boys, stressing that the fighting must stop now. She recently returned from the Republic of Moldova, which despite still reeling from COVID-19 and other challenges, has opened its borders and homes for people fleeing fighting in Ukraine, mostly exhausted and anxious women and children. Sharing some of their stories, she said buses full of civilians were met with dignity and compassion by volunteers from civil society organizations at the Moldovan border., In line with its coordination mandate, she said, UN-Women is supporting those who have been displaced “to ensure that the gendered nature of this crisis is addressed with a gender-sensitive response”. “This trauma risks destroying a generation,” she warned, condemning in the strongest terms the recent attack on Kramatorsk train station, which killed civilians and civil society members working in partnership with the United Nations. “Humanitarians are not a target; civilians are not a target,” she stressed., Also citing allegations of rape and sexual violence perpetrated on those fleeing, she said the large numbers of displaced persons with the presence of conscripts and mercenaries — and the brutality displayed against Ukrainians in the current conflict — “raises all the red flags”. “A war of this magnitude impacts the world far beyond the borders of Ukraine,” she added, noting that the risk of human trafficking is increasing, with young women and teenagers at the highest risk. Calling on all countries to support the Republic of Moldova and other neighbouring countries with resources and support, she said through all those horrors, women continue to lead and serve their communities. They make up 80 per cent of all health and social care workers in Ukraine, and many have chosen not to flee. Women parliamentarians, as well as Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister, continue their work as bombs fall all around them. Saluting their courage, she said: “They do this at great risk to their own lives.”, Against that backdrop, she noted that the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund continues to support civil society efforts in Ukraine and urged Council members to also provide their support. She also called on the Council to use all avenues to pursue the path of peace, stressing that Ukrainian women are asking to be part of the solution. “We know from experience that women’s participation makes response and recovery more effective and sustainable,” she said, adding that it is vital that women are consulted and engaged in all decisions and negotiations. Emphasizing that women need not be seen as victims, she nevertheless noted that they remain largely absent from all current negotiation efforts. The Council must ensure women’s active participation, she stressed, while also strongly echoing the Secretary-General’s calls for peace and an immediate cessation of hostilities., MANUEL FONTAINE, Director of Emergencies, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), noted that he returned last week from Ukraine. “In my 31 years as a humanitarian, I have rarely seen so much damage caused in so little time,” he said, describing the 8 April attack on Kramatorsk train station as particularly horrifying. That station has been a critical route for thousands of families fleeing Donetsk oblast, an area that has seen some of the war’s worst violence and destruction. “When the station was attacked, it was filled with families desperate to escape the mounting violence,” he said, noting the tragic irony that UNICEF teams were offloading life-saving humanitarian supplies only a kilometre away when that unconscionable attack occurred. “It is just one of many instances in this war where we have seen a blatant disregard for civilian lives and international humanitarian law,” he said., Inside Ukraine, children, families and communities remain under attack, he continued. Of the 3.2 million children estimated to have remained in their homes, nearly half may be at risk of not having enough food. Attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages have left some 1.4 million people without access to water, and another 4.6 million have only limited access. The situation is even worse in cities like Mariupol and Kherson, where children and their families have now gone weeks without running water and sanitation services, a regular supply of food, and medical care. They are sheltering in their homes and underground, waiting for the bombs and violence to stop., As of 10 April, he said, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified 142 children killed and 229 children injured. “We know these numbers are likely much higher, and many of them were caused by crossfire or the use of explosive weapons in populated areas,” he said. Recalling his meeting with children in a hospital intensive care unit in the city of Zaporizhzhia, he said all the systems that help children survive are under attack. Hostilities have damaged or destroyed hundreds of residential homes, and attacks on hospitals, health-care facilities, medical equipment and even health professionals continue, making it harder for people to access care. He added that hundreds of schools and educational facilities have also been attacked or used for military purposes., Applauding the efforts of the authorities to ensure continuity of education, he warned that that can only be a temporary solution. “Lessons from the pandemic show the importance of children learning in a school with their peers and teachers,” he said. Nearly two thirds of all Ukrainian children have been displaced since the conflict began, forced to leave everything behind. Voicing deep concern over increasing reports of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence, he welcomed the outpouring of support from neighbouring countries to welcome refugees, adding that it should be replicated globally for all seeking protection and asylum, “no matter where they are from”., Against that backdrop, UNICEF and its partners are doing everything possible, both inside and outside Ukraine, amid difficult circumstances. Some progress has been registered in recent weeks, with teams and supplies able to reach Sumy, Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, among other cities. “But this is not enough,” he stressed, noting that ongoing hostilities are preventing access to many areas of the country. He recounted recent visits to reception centres for internally displaced persons — run mostly by women professionals — that offer access to health and psychosocial services, warm meals and temporary rest. “These services are critical, but they are not solutions,” he said, noting that resources are already overstretched. UNICEF is also carefully monitoring the health, rights and dignity of women and girls as the risk of exploitation and abuse grows and reiterates the need to ensure that children who have become separated from their families or who live in institutional care are protected, he said., KATERYNA CHEREPAKHA, President of La Strada-Ukraine, noted that she was speaking on behalf of feminist and human rights organizations who are consolidating efforts at the national, regional and community levels to save civilian lives and collect survivor testimonies about the war crimes committed by the Russian Federation in her country. “I speak as a women’s rights activist, as a mother and now also as a displaced person,” she said, adding that women and children are the largest group of internally displaced persons and refugees. Even during evacuation, despite clear indications of their status as civilians, unarmed and carrying children, Ukrainian women have been brutally killed by Russian troops, she said, pointing to attacks on the railway station in Kramatorsk, the maternity and children’s hospitals, kindergartens and the theatre building in Mariupol., Highlighting the increased vulnerability of women in local administrations to the threat of kidnapping, torture and killing, she recalled, among others, Olga Sukhenko, head of the Motyzhyn village. Ms. Sukhenko was tortured and killed with her husband and son after Russian troops occupied the village. Women are important actors of peace and security in Ukraine and they have become targets for the occupiers, she said, noting that there is no information regarding Ukrainian volunteer-medic Julia Payevska who was captured by Russian troops while organizing assistance in Mariupol. Women-prisoners of war have been exposed to torture, including sexual violence, while female journalists have been killed. The cases already reported are just a small part of the iceberg, she cautioned, adding that in the calls for help received by the national hotlines run by La Strada, “we see extreme traumatization and fear for life”., Even those who manage to get to safer places are too traumatized to report, she said, adding that survivors need support, therapy and recovery assistance. Many of these cases will never be disclosed, she said, adding that “Russian invaders” are using violence and rape as weapons of war. “We do not want you to look at us only as victims of Russian military aggression,” she stressed, adding that Ukrainian women volunteers, activists, journalists and human rights defenders are an integral part of her country. Calling on all members of the Security Council, international institutions and Governments to demonstrate solidarity, she stressed the need for practical actions to stop the Russian Federation’s aggression., Statements, Ms. THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that when men like Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin start wars, women and children get hurt, displaced, raped and killed. Highlighting the 8 April missile attack on a train station being used for civilian evacuations, she said that a large piece of the missile had a message in Russian on its side saying, “For the children.” Recalling her meetings with displaced Ukrainians in Romania and the Republic of Moldova, she said the mass displacement includes over half of all of Ukraine’s children. Anyone at risk before war is at a heightened risk of being targeted for physical and sexual violence during a war, she noted, adding that this includes women and children, religious and ethnic minorities, people living with disabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons. Pointing to sobering reports of traffickers targeting women as they seek protection abroad, she cautioned against waiting for lengthy assessments and data. The humanitarian efforts her Government is supporting in and around Ukraine are focusing on networks for survivors of gender-based violence, as well as programmes for child protection, including UNICEF’s mobile child protection teams. Stressing the need for pathways to healing and access to justice for survivors, she added that women are far from passive victims in this war, and they deserve to return to a peaceful Ukraine where they have a say in their own future., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), condemning the relentless brutality of the Russian Federation army against Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure, said that various pieces of the horror puzzle are falling into place, with mass graves and torture chambers and playgrounds studded with bullet holes. Highlighting the devastating impact of this war on women, he noted that thousands of them have been forced to flee their homes while others are bravely defending their country and offering humanitarian assistance. Women and girls face heightened risk of conflict-related sexual violence and human trafficking, he said, expressing concern that Ukrainian children have been trapped in the national nightmare, with large numbers displaced and forcibly deported to the Russian Federation. Destroying educational infrastructure is criminal, he said, asking how does one explain war to traumatized children who had to leave their homes in a matter of hours. President Putin must realize that a war cannot be won through massacres, he said, adding that the massacres perpetrated during the wars in the Balkans did not help the perpetrators win any wars., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said the recent attack against a train station in Kramatorsk might constitute a crime against humanity. “Indiscriminate attacks must cease,” he said, expressing deep concern over alleged sexual violence and expressing support for United Nations efforts to “establish the facts”. Greater support must be provided to sexual abuse survivors. Noting that attacks on hospitals may also constitute war crimes, he said murders and mutilations of children will be a “permanent stain” upon perpetrators and called on the Secretary-General to make use of the Council’s tools to protect children against serious violations. He went on to express support for United Nations actions to prevent human trafficking. He called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the full withdrawal of Russian Federation troops from Ukraine’s entire territory, as called for by the International Court of Justice, and for humanitarian access, adding that the nearly 10,000 children who have arrived in France are able to attend school. He expressed support for investigation and documentation work by the International Criminal Court and noted that €500,000 has been granted to the related fund. He closed by saluting the courage of Ukrainian women on the frontline of the humanitarian, political and military response, recalling that there can be no lasting solution to the conflict without the full participation of women., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), expressing concern over the situation of women, children and older persons in Ukraine, strongly deplored the reported acts of widespread gross violations of international humanitarian law by the troops of the Russian Federation. Condemning the 8 April attack on the train station in Kramatorsk, he also voiced deep concern over the situation of the children of Ukraine who are being scarred by the horrifying images of war. “Children should never go through such experiences and must, accordingly, be protected by all parties in accordance with applicable international law,” he said, calling on the warring parties — especially the aggressor State — to redouble efforts for peace in the interest of Ukraine’s women and children. Ghana also condemns reports of trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, and exploitation, and urges humanitarian agencies to ensure that identified victims are provided with the needed medical and psychosocial care to overcome the trauma of abuse. Meanwhile, women leaders at all levels should be included in coordination mechanisms and decision-making processes, and not counted only as victims., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE (Mexico) said the information emerging from Ukraine paints a “truly devastating panorama”. Condemning the attack on the Kramatorsk train station — which killed dozens of civilians waiting to be evacuated and could constitute a war crime — he said women and children have been the most affected, representing 90 per cent of the refugee population and now facing the risk of trafficking and exploitation. Also spotlighting the trauma of war and its possibly irreversible impact on civilians’ mental health — as well as the serious damage on residential, education and sanitation infrastructure — he said UN-Women and the Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, should continue collecting evidence and studying the many gender-related dimensions of the crisis. As Co-Chair of the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security, Mexico plans to convene a follow-up meeting to maintain the focus on the current topic and give it the prominence it deserves, he said., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India), noting that more than 4.4 million people have moved to neighbouring countries and another 7.1 million are displaced inside Ukraine, said that, having welcomed refugees for centuries, his country knows the importance of treating them equally and with dignity. “We need to keep the gender perspective in mind and act with sensitivity,” he affirmed, calling for a victim-centred approach to preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict. Citing reports of more than 900 education facilities and schools either damaged or destroyed, he said students were among the 22,500 nationals whose safe return home India facilitated. Appealing for an immediate end to hostilities, he emphasized: “No solution can be arrived at by shedding blood.” He went on to reiterate the importance of humanitarian assistance., BRIAN PATRICK FLYNN (Ireland) strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s 8 April attack against a train station in Kramatorsk as yet another attempt to close escape routes for those fleeing this unjustified war. Widespread displacement and trauma, trafficking risks and reports of sexual violence, including rape, perpetrated by Russian soldiers proliferate, he noted, citing “bone-chilling” allegations that children are among those abused. “Conflict-related sexual violence can constitute a war crime and those responsible must be held to account,” he reaffirmed, emphasizing that accountability must also extend to military commanders who fail to take all “necessary and reasonable” steps to stop such abuses or fail to ensure they are investigated and prosecuted. He cautioned that a child-protection crisis is emerging, as the number of unaccompanied and separated children rises. “We have a responsibility to respond,” he said, calling for mitigation of the impact of trauma caused by family separations by offering psychosocial and mental health support, health care and education. He went on to remind Council members that April marks one year since they adopted resolution 2573 (2021) on the protection of civilian objects, while stressing that any peace talks must directly and substantively include diverse women so they can influence the outcome. “Without them, we have no hope for sustainable peace,” he warned., MONA JUUL (Norway), noting that Ukrainian women and girls face a drastically heightened risk of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking, stressed the importance of a gender- and age-sensitive humanitarian response. “There is a tendency to forget that women are also at the front line in every way,” she said, pointing out that they also serve as combatants, as well as deliverers of basic and life-saving services. She went on to express alarm at reports that more than 60 per cent of Ukraine’s children are now displaced. The ongoing violence by Russian forces raises questions about possible war crimes or even crimes against humanity, she said, underscoring the importance of the ongoing investigations by the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) emphasized that the protection of children in armed conflict must be a priority at all times, even when the parties cannot find common ground for peaceful settlement of disputes. He called upon all parties to allow civilians to leave conflict zones and humanitarian organizations to reach those in need. Evidence of the psychological impact of sexual violence in conflict — a crime that affects women and girls, but also men and boys — suggests it is often lifelong and even intergenerational, he noted. Calling on all parties to cooperate with the Commission of Inquiry of the Human Rights Council and thanking UN-Women for its efforts to obtain gender-sensitive data, he warned that women and children forced into the condition of refugees or internally displaced persons are more vulnerable to crimes, including sexual violence and exploitation., DAI BING (China) noted that women and children should be given priority protection in conflict. He called on parties in Ukraine to abide by international humanitarian law, protect women and children, respect the civilian nature of schools and hospitals and to provide special evacuation, rescue and medical assistance to women and children. He deplored that people were killed in the attack on a train station in Kramatorsk, stressing that the cause of the incident must be investigated. All refugees should receive equal protection under international refugee law, and he urged the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UN-Women and UNICEF to continue coordinating support for humanitarian assistance. Psychological and social services should be provided to women and children, and education ensured. Expressing concern over reports of abductions, human trafficking and violence, he encouraged the parties to negotiate and to create the conditions needed for a ceasefire. All other parties should do more to facilitate dialogue and create the necessary conditions for progress in such talks. Imposing sanctions and providing weapons will not bring about peace, he added, noting that sanctions have triggered a food crisis for which the entire world pays a price., MOHAMED ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) said women are not only facing grave violations of international humanitarian law, but also gender specific risks. However, as agents of peace, their participation in prevention, peacebuilding, reconciliation and reconstruction efforts must be guaranteed. Noting that the overwhelming majority of the 4.3 million people who have fled Ukraine are women and children, he said that 89 health facilities across the country have been impacted by attacks, meaning that pregnant women lack maternity care. He cited “deeply disturbing” reports of conflict-related sexual violence and pointed to the conflict’s disruption to education, also stressing that “every child has a right to education”. He called on parties to guarantee women’s full and meaningful participation in peace efforts, especially in the design and implementation of processes for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, adding that sex-disaggregated data collection is a valuable tool to strengthen accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. He also said a gender-responsive approach must be taken in all efforts, urging parties to allow for timely and unimpeded humanitarian access and reiterating the strong call for an immediate cessation of hostilities., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), noting that the number of displaced persons has reached 10 million — including innumerable children who have crossed Ukraine’s borders, unaccompanied — he affirmed that sexual violence and human trafficking are unacceptable, and that independent, impartial investigations must be undertaken. As the war drags on, massive population movements, the breakdown in supply chains and unsanitary conditions are all propitious for the outbreak of an epidemic. He advocated urgent action to meet civilian needs, noting with interest UNICEF’s efforts to bolster its mobile teams and provision of essential services to support children’s protection. Aid for women and children must be stepped up, including mental and emotional care services. Stressing that humanitarians require access to all people in need, he called on parties to forge a humanitarian ceasefire and to negotiate in good faith to bring about a halt to hostilities. “This war must end,” he insisted., Mr. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said his delegation is familiar with the distortion of his country’s special military operation and promotion of “fakes” by the West as part of an intense information war. A new threshold, however, has been set by his counterpart from Albania, who listed an entire list of crimes ascribed to the Russian Federation without presenting any evidence for such claims. Citing staged events “in the tradition of the Syrian White Helmets”, he said the provocation in Bucha is still being promoted as a supposed crime committed by the Russian army, despite “irrefutable evidence” of its staged character. “I won’t get into the details” he said, as his delegation had presented its claims on 5 April, but he described the influence of the 1994 intellectual forefathers on today’s Ukrainian radicals, who created “crowd scenes” and gave special instructions on what to do. He also cited staged events in Nemmersdorf, which created a legend of mass murders and rapes by the Red Army but were debunked by various experts., He said the Bucha provocation was then overshadowed by events in Kramatorsk, a classic false flag operation. On 8 April, Ukrainian forces used a Tochka U rocket to attack a train station in Kramatorsk, from 45 kilometres away from that area, killing 50 people. “The Russian army doesn’t have tactical missile systems, Tochka U,” he said. “They are obsolete; they have been replaced by Iskander rockets.” They are only used by Ukraine’s army, he insisted. Moreover, pictures taken by witnesses made it possible to determine the type of rocket and the direction from which it was launched — and that area is under the Ukrainian army control. It is also easy to identify the serial number of the Tochka U rocket Shu 915, a group of rockets regularly used to shell Donbas. He also pointed to a 14 March attack by the Ukrainian army’s 19 Missile Brigade in Donetsk. “The provocation in Kramatorsk was not very successful,” he said, noting that his delegation has also transmitted information to the United Nations about the staged discovery of mass graves in a town near Kyiv., Describing multiple scenarios, he said that in Irpin, a provocation borrowing the script from Bucha and Nemmersdorf is being prepared, with Ukrainian forces transferring bodies from a morgue into a building basement to stage a shooting event. His delegation expects videos to be circulated by Western media. According to the Ministry of Defence, a town in the Sumy region under the control of Russian forces, Western media have been invited to organize a staged event. He went on to cite reports from residents in Odessa, where Ukrainian army members are wearing Russian military uniforms to prepare a false flag operation. “Please do not tell us later that we did not warn you about this,” he said. “Russia does not wage war against the civilian population.”, The intention is to present Russian soldiers as sadists and rapists, just as the Soviet victors of the Second World War were, he said, stressing that neither the goals nor the Russophobia of Ukraine’s propaganda has changed. Today’s reality, however, is different. In Mariupol, primary school 18 was held by the Nazi Azov battalion. He described how photos of a woman in a basement with her hands hacked off and a swastika burned into her stomach is still being passed off as a Russian war crime. In fact, Ukrainian society has been under the influence of nationalists for eight years, he said, with women presented in a savage light. He pointed to a patriotic video on social media featuring a Ukrainian actress uttering curses against the Russian Federation as she uses a sickle to cut the throat of a Russian soldier, evoking images disseminated by Da’esh. He also doubted that “peaceful Poles” can feel safe when the perpetrators of the Volhynia massacre in 1943 are hailed today as national heroes. There is another Ukraine which is being given the chance for peace, thanks to the Russian Federation’s special military operation., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), thanking all humanitarian actors in the region, added that while the Council has applauded the role of women as peacebuilders, it is also necessary to pause “and let the full weight of their suffering settle into our minds”. Drawing attention to the bombing of homes, hospitals, schools, businesses and other civilian objects, he said victims and survivors are fleeing bombs and bullets overwhelmingly fired by young men who are themselves dying in large numbers. “Mothers are on either side of the war,” he said, adding that it is inappropriate that there are no women at the table in the ceasefire negotiations. Humanitarian actors should ensure that their operations have the ability to aid women and girls, particularly those who are survivors of gender-based violence. For a world barely starting its recovery from the pandemic, he added, the war in Ukraine is a double blow., TARIQ MAHMOOD AHMAD, Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the United Nations of the United Kingdom and Council President for March, speaking in his national capacity, said that President Putin’s invading forces are oblivious to the basic tenets of the Geneva Conventions, which distinguish between civilians and combatants. Condemning the statement by the delegate of the Russian Federation as a distortion of the truth, he said that what is true is that Ukrainian women have demonstrated fortitude and resilience. Displaced Ukrainian women and girls face heightened risks of trafficking and sexual exploitation by criminal gangs, he said, adding that the mounting evidence of war crimes in the country must compel the international community to do more to stand with Ukraine and work ceaselessly to investigate these crimes. His country worked closely with partners to refer the invasion to the International Criminal Court, he said, adding that any peace settlement must also reflect the disproportionate impact of this conflict on women and girls., Taking the floor a second time to respond to the representative of the Russian Federation, Mr. HOXHA (Albania) rejected the assertion that he is embracing propaganda. “What we say here is fact-checked and corroborated,” he stressed, noting that the painful facts raised by his delegation are true, and mentioning them today was only necessary because of Moscow’s actions., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said the lies told today by the Russian Federation predictably “contained everything but the kitchen sink”. Expressing his hope that the Russian Federation’s proposal to remove the 2014 letters regarding Crimea from the Council’s agenda will not be supported by other Council members, he said since the beginning of its invasion Moscow has disregarded the need to protect civilians in Ukraine. Over the past week, many foreign leaders, journalists and United Nations officials have visited crime scenes in Ukraine — and were shocked by what they saw — all while the Russian Federation persists in adding items to its list of war crimes. Stressing that the world’s trust in Moscow and its diplomats is dead, he noted that the enormous suffering ongoing in Ukraine and said the Russian Federation has launched a policy of extermination against his people., During today’s briefing, he said, the civil society briefer provided several examples of appalling repressions against Ukrainian women — of which there are countless instances. Against that backdrop, the national prosecutor’s office is launching a special mechanism to document sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers against Ukrainian women. It is also closely cooperating with non-governmental organizations and United Nations officials working in that capacity on the ground. Adding that Ukraine will help ensure that full and transparent investigations are carried out, he called on UNICEF and UN-Women to continue their full-fledged monitoring of crimes against women and children, while also drawing the Council’s attention to Moscow’s flagrant violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Fourth Geneva Convention., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said nearly 2.6 million refugees from Ukraine have already arrived in his country, the vast majority women and children fleeing fighting. Women and children crossing the border with no contacts or help are at a higher risk of trafficking and other forms of abuse. They are physically and psychologically weakened, unfamiliar with their new surroundings and highly vulnerable to criminals. Noting that reports are now emerging of sexual violence by Russian soldiers against fleeing Ukrainian women and girls, he said addressing the unique needs of women and children crossing the border is critical. Polish authorities have put measures in place at all border crossing areas and reception centres to control who has direct access to refugees, including identifying and registering the names of those accessing reception and accommodation centres; and the names and registration plates of those with whom refugees leave sites. He also noted the importance of providing access to the labour market and to basic services — including psychiatric, psychological and other mental health social services — once refugees have entered safe haven countries., ION JINGA (Romania) strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s unjustified and unprovoked military attack against Ukraine, as well as reported atrocities by its forces. He reiterated strong support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, stressing that “24 February 2022 will remain one of the darkest days in history after the end of the Second World War”. Every day, women and children, older persons and people with disabilities are fleeing their homes. The international community must maintain its focus on the continued reports of horrific rights violations, he added, as Russian military actions disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. For its part, Romania is one of the largest receiving countries for Ukrainians fleeing the terror and working to find solutions to help those in need, whether on its territory or that of Ukraine. He described a two-stage approach involving emergency response to the humanitarian crisis — covering needs at border crossings, humanitarian transport and the transport of refugees to temporary accommodations — and the structural stage of developing protection mechanisms., In that context, he said Romania set up six working groups to design inclusion and protection policies in the areas of health, education, labour, housing, vulnerable persons, children and youth. “The response to all this human suffering has been swift and all-encompassing,” he assured. Between 10 February and 4 April, more than 650,000 Ukrainian citizens entered Romania, and almost 80,000 are currently in the country. Between 10 February and 30 March, almost 4,400 Ukrainian citizens applied for asylum, he said, noting that they can benefit from accommodation in centres organized by the General Inspectorate for Immigration, as well as other material, financial, medical, psychosocial and legal support. All Ukrainian children in Romania, including those who do not apply for protection, have the right to be educated in Romanian schools, receive free boarding school accommodation, food allowance, school supplies, clothing and textbooks. In addition, UNICEF Blue Dot Centres have been set up at several border-crossing points to provide psychological and legal counsel to families and unaccompanied minors., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) expressed support for the work of the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, as well as the independent investigation by the International Criminal Court. She added that all accountability mechanisms must take into account the gendered dimension of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Calling for women’s meaningful participation in decisions regarding humanitarian assistance, the refugee situation, peacebuilding, reconstruction and recovery, she said that the women and children fleeing Ukraine are at risk of falling victim to criminal activity. Further, she added, the disruption of education endangers the well-being of children who often arrive exhausted, traumatized and malnourished in countries of destination. Her Government is providing €20 million to UNICEF to alleviate the suffering of Ukrainian children as part of its humanitarian package for the country., For information media.

Protection and Human Rights",11 Apr 2022,"UNICEF Emergency Programmes Director Manuel Fontaine's remarks at the Security Council briefing on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, NEW YORK, 11 April 2022 - ""Mr President, Excellencies and colleagues, I would like to express my appreciation to Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield and Ambassador Ferit Hoxha for convening today’s meeting. I would also like to thank Ambassador Woodward and the United Kingdom for hosting this briefing during your Security Council presidency., ""I returned last week from a mission to Ukraine. In my 31 years as a humanitarian, I have rarely seen so much damage caused in so little time., Friday’s attack on Kramatorsk train station was particularly horrifying., ""The station has been a critical route for thousands of families fleeing Donetsk oblast – an area that has seen some of the war’s worst violence and destruction. When the station was attacked, it was filled with families desperate to escape the mounting violence. I note the tragic irony that our teams were offloading lifesaving humanitarian supplies only a kilometre away when so many lives were taken away by this needless act of violence., ""The attack on Kramatorsk station is unconscionable. And yet, it is just one of many instances in this war where we have seen a blatant disregard for civilian lives -- and international humanitarian law., ""Inside Ukraine, children, families, and communities are under attack., ""Of the 3.2 million children estimated to have remained in their homes, nearly half may be at risk of not having enough food. Attacks on water system infrastructure and power outages have left an estimated 1.4 million people without access to water in Ukraine. Another 4.6 million people have only limited access., ""The situation is even worse in cities like Mariupol and Kherson, where children and their families have now gone weeks without running water and sanitation services, a regular supply of food, and medical care. They are sheltering in their homes and underground, waiting for the bombs and violence to stop., ""As of yesterday, OHCHR has verified 142 children killed and 229 children injured. We know these numbers are likely much higher -- and many of them were caused by crossfire or the use of explosive weapons in populated areas., ""I met one of those children in an intensive care unit in a hospital ward in Zaporizhizia. Vlad, who is a 4-year-old, was shot twice in the stomach as he was escaping with his family from a contested area. Although still unconscious, Vlad is expected to live, unlike so many others., ""All the systems that help children survive are also under attack., ""Hostilities have damaged or destroyed hundreds of residential houses. Attacks on hospitals, healthcare facilities, and medical equipment -- and the killing and injuring of healthcare professionals -- are making it even harder for people to access emergency care, basic healthcare, and medicine., ""Hundreds of schools and educational facilities have been attacked or used for military purposes. Others are serving as shelters for civilians. Nationwide school closures are impacting the learning -- and the futures -- of 5.7 million school-age children and 1.5 million students in higher education. In the Donbas region, a whole generation of children have already seen their lives and education upended during the past eight years of conflict., ""We applaud the efforts of the authorities to ensure continuity of education. However, this can only be a temporary solution. Lessons from the pandemic show the importance of children learning in a school with their peers and teachers., ""Excellencies, I met families in Zaporizhzhia who told me that they wanted to stay in their homes but were forced to flee when the shelling and violence became too much. Thousands of others now are trying to leave before the fighting closes in around them. They face further dangers along the way – missiles, crossfire and explosive remnants., ""In just six weeks, nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have been displaced. They have been forced to leave everything behind: Their homes, their schools, and often, their family members., ""I have heard stories of the desperate steps parents are taking to get their children to safety and children saddened they are unable to get back to school. A social worker told me a story about parents who were forced to send their children out with a truck driver just to get them away from the line of fire., ""Such unaccompanied children are at much higher risk of violence, abuse, exploitation, and trafficking. Women face similar risks. We are extremely concerned by increasing reports of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence., ""Fortunately, there has been an outpouring of support from neighbouring countries to welcome refugees. The solidarity expressed for Ukrainian refugees has been a very welcome development – one that, surely, should be replicated globally for all seeking protection and asylum, no matter where they are from., ""Excellencies, UNICEF and our partners are doing everything we can., ""Inside Ukraine, we continue to face extremely difficult operating conditions. We have seen some progress in recent weeks, with our teams and supplies able to reach Sumy, Kharkiv and Kramatorsk, among others. But this is not enough., ""On-going hostilities prevent us from reaching those most in need in many areas of the country. We saw that last week in Kramatorsk when our teams were forced to stop offloading supplies and evacuate to safety following the nearby explosions., ""We are also helping local authorities to identify and register unaccompanied and separated children. We are providing families with much needed humanitarian cash assistance and increasing awareness to minimize the risks of explosive ordnance., ""In Zaporizhzhia, I visited a reception centre, set up by local authorities -- run mostly by women professionals -- for displaced people to access health and psychosocial services, have a warm meal, and rest temporarily. These services are critical, but they are not solutions., ""Many of those who were able to flee early have been able to find sanctuary in other countries. It is not clear to us how those who are being displaced now will fare. They have been exposed to violence for longer and may have fewer resources at their disposal., ""Resources are already over-stretched and local residents live in a state of uncertainty as the sounds of air raids and warnings from local officials ring regularly, reminding them that the frontlines may soon reach them too., ""Excellencies, I am particularly concerned about the widespread presence of explosive remnants of war which expose children to the risk of death and horrendous injury. Eastern Ukraine was already one of the world’s most mine-contaminated stretches of land even prior to the recent escalation. This reality is rapidly extending to other parts of the country., ""We are carefully monitoring the health, rights, and dignity of women and girls, as the risk of exploitation and abuse grows., ""And we continue to reiterate the need to ensure that children who have become separated from their families or who live in institutional care are protected and that every effort be made to obtain caregiver consent and authorities’ approval before these children are evacuated or relocated., ""In closing, I want to express how proud I am of our UN teams both inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. The work they are doing is indispensable., ""I want to also salute the remarkable resilience of Ukrainian doctors, nurses, teachers, and social workers -- especially women who have been at the forefront of the response. I was deeply impressed by the care they are providing children and families., ""I visited an underground maternity ward in Lviv that is staffed 24/7 by a team of tireless women – assisting births amidst air raid alerts. Local women’s organizations are mobilizing grassroots networks to care for the most vulnerable, even under the darkest of circumstances. Their courage and commitment are a light in the dark., ""But most of all, I want to entreat all those with the power to end this war to use that power. The lives and futures of millions of children hang in the balance., ""Excellencies, the math is simple. Every day the war continues, children will continue to suffer., ""As Humanitarians, you can count on us to continue doing our work, but there is only so much we can do., ""It is time to end this war. Ukraine’s children cannot afford to wait., ""Thank you."", Media contacts, Joe English

IMF Executive Board Approves the Establishment of a Multi-Donor Administered Account for Ukraine,News and Press Release,IMF,Recovery and Reconstruction,8 Apr 2022,"Washington, DC : At the request of several IMF member countries, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved the establishment of an Administered Account for Ukraine, providing donors with a secure vehicle to direct financial assistance to Ukraine., The Government of Canada has proposed up to CAD 1 billion in their recent federal budget to be disbursed to Ukraine through the Administered Account and the account is available for use by any other members as well as intergovernmental agencies and organizations who wish to use it as a vehicle to provide financial assistance to Ukraine., The Administered Account is intended to channel donor resources in the form of grants and loans aimed at assisting Ukraine to meet its balance of payments and budgetary needs and help stabilize its economy. Donors will benefit from the IMF’s tested infrastructure to quickly deliver authenticated payments. The Account would receive loan or grant resources from donors in either reserve currencies or SDRs and disburse these resources into Ukraine’s SDR account at the IMF., The approval of the Administered Account follows the Board’s approval on March 9 of a US$1.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine under the Rapid Financing Instrument (see also Press Release 22/69 ). IMF staff continue to engage closely with the authorities on their emergency response to the economic dislocations brought about by the war in Ukraine., IMF Communications Department

A 72-year-old refugee from Ukraine tells of a life left torn apart by war,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Health

Water Sanitation Hygiene",11 Apr 2022,"MYKOLAIV, Ukraine – “There were explosions outside, it smelled of smoke. We were almost surrounded, planes were flying overhead. There was so much noise that I couldn’t hear myself speak. We decided to leave the next morning, if we made it through…”, In the midst of Russia’s bombardment of her hometown of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, 72-year-old Valentina Ejova made a decision that would divide her life into before and after. Over the course of a few hours, she packed up her belongings into two small suitcases and left her homeland, friends, and the world as she knew it behind., According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, a quarter of the population of Ukraine have been forced to flee their homes since the invasion began on 24 February. Of these, more than 4.5 million have left Ukraine and a further 6.5 million are internally displaced within the country. As of 9 April 2022, nearly 400,000 had entered the Republic of Moldova since the start of the crisis, the majority of whom are women, children and older people., “Even though my heart ached to leave, I fled my homeland without looking back – I decided that my life is worth more than the material goods I gave up,” Mrs. Ejova said., Women, girls and older people are at heightened risk of exploitation and abuse during a crisis, especially while on the move, at border crossing points and in cramped and often insecure placement centres. For the elderly in particular, existing health and mobility issues make it harder to access already scarce health care and psychosocial support, especially when travelling alone and through conflict areas., Even before the current crisis, older people in conflict-affected areas of Ukraine made up one third of those in need of humanitarian assistance – the highest proportion of elderly people affected by a crisis in the world. Ukraine also has one of the highest life expectancy gender gaps in the world, with women outliving men by an average of ten years: Many elderly women are escaping on their own, putting them at higher risk of sexual and physical violence and abuse., The longest journey of her life, The trip from Mykolaiv to Chișinău, the capital of Moldova, would normally take around half a day; 24 hours after she closed her front door for what may be the last time, Mrs. Ejova had made it to the border. She first joined family friends in a car to Odesa, then after a long search for onward transport, found a minibus heading to Chișinău. The journey was arduous, most of it spent in cold, cramped conditions, alone and towards an uncertain destination., “I have always led an active life, but that trip drained my strength – not so much physically, but emotionally. The fear of driving across minefields or being stopped never left me for a second,” Mrs. Ejova recalled., She was able to breathe a sigh of relief only when she crossed the border. Once in the Republic of Moldova, she was given shelter at a temporary placement centre, where she had been for several days when she spoke to UNFPA. She told us that to her this country meant peace, help and kindness., In both Ukraine and neighbouring countries hosting refugees, UNFPA is supplying medical equipment and referrals to health units, distributing dignity kits with hygiene and sanitary products, deploying mobile health teams, and providing shelters and a support hotline for gender-based violence survivors., “Age is not a diagnosis – I am ready to face challenges in a new country”, Mrs. Ejova was grateful for the help she’d received so far in Moldova and was due to fly to Austria a few days later, which is currently hosting refugees arriving and transiting from Ukraine. This would be her first ever trip abroad, and although she didn’t know anyone there, she was confident she would find her place., “I am 72 years old, yes, but I am ready to study a new language. I am ready to work and to get back on my feet. Age is not a diagnosis – I feel full of strength and energy, I am ready to face challenges in a new country.”, Her voice trembling as she leafed through snapshots of a world she’d left behind, she said, “I have to choose what to leave and what to take with me. I can give up clothes and shoes, but I don’t give up my photos – they are my life.”, After Mrs. Ejova’s husband passed away many years ago, she had lived with her 39-year-old son, who remained in Mykolaiv, which has been almost completely cut off from communication and Internet services. A few days earlier, her son had managed to phone to say he wanted to leave; she hasn’t heard from him since., Mrs. Ejova arrived safely in Austria with just $78 in her pocket: The day before leaving Ukraine she had tried to withdraw money from several ATMs, but all were empty. Unsure whether she would ever see her homeland again, she remained hopeful and determined that in Austria she could find rest and peace., “I want to do everything possible to bring my son to me. He is like his father, he rarely makes any sudden decisions. He is young – young people usually take such decisions more easily. In our case it was the other way around: I pray to be able to see him again.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/72-year-old-refugee-ukraine-tells-life-left-torn-apart-war
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 10 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,11 Apr 2022,"Date: 11 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 10 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 4,335 civilian casualties in the country: 1,842 killed and 2,493 injured. This included:, a total of 1,842 killed (474 men, 301 women, 28 girls, and 50 boys, as well as 70 children and 919 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,493 injured (287 men, 216 women, 49 girls, and 50 boys, as well as 134 children and 1,757 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,916 casualties (656 killed and 1,260 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 1,566 casualties (583 killed and 983 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 350 casualties (73 killed and 277 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,419 casualties (1,186 killed and 1,233 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 11 April (local time), 183 children had been killed and at least 342 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-10-april-2022-enruuk
Russian Invasion to Shrink Ukraine Economy by 45 Percent this Year [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,World Bank,"Agriculture

Protection and Human Rights",10 Apr 2022,"Emerging economies in Europe and Central Asia also hit hard, WASHINGTON, April 10, 2022 – The war against Ukraine and sanctions on Russia are hitting economies around the globe, with emerging market and developing countries in the Europe and Central Asia region expected to bear the brunt, says the World Bank’s latest Economic Update for the region, released today., The region’s economy is now forecast to shrink by 4.1 percent this year, compared with the pre-war forecast of 3 percent growth, as the economic shocks from the war compound the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This would be the second contraction in as many years, and twice as large as the pandemic-induced contraction in 2020., Ukraine’s economy is expected to shrink by an estimated 45.1 percent this year, although the magnitude of the contraction will depend on the duration and intensity of the war. Hit by unprecedented sanctions, Russia’s economy has already plunged into a deep recession with output projected to contract by 11.2 percent in 2022., “The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering. The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine’s economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Vice President for the Europe and Central Asia region. “Ukraine needs massive financial support immediately as it struggles to keep its economy going and the government running to support Ukrainian citizens who are suffering and coping with an extreme situation.”, The war has added to mounting concerns of a sharp global slowdown, surging inflation and debt, and a spike in poverty levels. The economic impact has reverberated through multiple channels, including commodity and financial markets, trade and migration links and adverse impact on confidence., The war is also hitting hard the emerging and developing economies of Europe and Central Asia, a region that was already heading for an economic slowdown this year from the ongoing effects of the pandemic. In addition to Russia and Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova and Tajikistan are projected to fall into recession this year, while growth projections have been downgraded in all economies due to spillovers from the war, weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area, and commodity, trade and financing shocks., Russia and Ukraine account for about 40 percent of wheat imports in the region and about 75 percent or more in Central Asia and the South Caucasus. Russia is also a major export destination for many countries, while remittances from Russia are close to 30 percent of GDP in some Central Asian economies (Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan)., “The Ukraine war and the pandemic have once again shown that crises can cause widespread economic damage and set back years of per capita income and development gains,” said Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, World Bank Chief Economist for Europe and Central Asia. “Governments in the region should fortify their macroeconomic buffers and credibility of their policies to contain risks and deal with potential fragmentation of trade and investment channels; strengthen their social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable, including the refugees; and not lose focus on improving energy efficiency to ensure a sustainable future.”, The deep humanitarian crisis sparked by the war has been the most pronounced of the initial global shockwaves and will likely be among the most enduring legacies of the conflict. The wave of refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries is anticipated to dwarf previous crises. As a result, support to host countries and refugee communities will be critical, and the World Bank is preparing operational support programs to neighboring countries to meet the increased financing needs from the refugee flows., The war-triggered spike in global oil prices also serves to underscore the need for energy security by boosting energy supply from renewable sources and stepping up the design and implementation of large-scale energy efficiency measures., World Bank Group Response to the Ukraine War, The World Bank Group is taking fast action to support the people of Ukraine. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the Bank Group has mobilized an emergency financing package of $925 million in support for Ukraine. This fast-disbursing support will go to help pay wages for hospital workers, pensions for the elderly, and social programs for the vulnerable. The rapid financing is part of a $3 billion package of support that the Bank Group is preparing for Ukraine over the coming months. The invasion has already caused the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. The Bank Group is looking at how to support refugees in host countries., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2022/ECA/79, Contacts, Washington

Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",10 Apr 2022,"About, The Russian Federation’s war with Ukraine has triggered a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and threatened the stability of geopolitical relations. Economic output in the Europe and Central Asia region is forecast to contract by more than 4.1% in 2022—the second major shock and regional recession in two years. Moreover, the war has added to mounting concerns of a sharp global growth slowdown. The economic impact of the conflict has reverberated through multiple global channels, including commodity and financial markets, trade and migration links, and confidence. Neighboring countries in the Europe and Central Asia region are likely to suffer considerable economic damage because of their strong trade, financial, and migration links with Ukraine and Russia. Pandemic disruptions amid rising COVID-19 cases in some major economies have contributed to financial and commodity market volatility, and could ultimately weigh on global growth prospects. The war has also raised the likelihood of a destabilizing wave of refugees, widespread financial stresses among some emerging and developing economies, a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, and food insecurity. A protracted conflict is likely to heighten policy uncertainty and fragment global trade and investment networks., Policy makers need to ensure that they are better prepared to handle future crises as part of a commitment to a comprehensive approach to bolster resilient, inclusive, and green development. They should fortify their macroeconomic policy buffers and institutions to strengthen stability; promote an inclusive and more equal recovery by strengthening their social protection systems to protect the most vulnerable, including the refugees; and keep their focus on improving energy efficiency and green transition to secure a sustainable future.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-and-central-asia-economic-update-war-region-spring-2022-enrutrsqaz

Addressing the increased vulnerability of women to violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, is a priority. UNDP is also engaging local institutions and civil society in the response efforts at community level., The foundations for UNDP’s scaled-up programme of support now and over a longer period are already in place, with UNDP leveraging its longstanding and extensive field presence in Ukraine, which it has maintained despite the ongoing war, and its extensive partnership network in the country., ***, About UNDP, UNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

Ukraine: Leaving Bucha,News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,11 Apr 2022,"Zakarpattia, 11 April 2022 – Bucha. Once a quiet dormitory town near Kyiv, it is now synonymous with the mass killing of civilians in the increasingly brutal war in Ukraine., Yuliia comes from there. Six weeks ago, life was easy: she and her husband Valerii, and their small son Artemko, had just moved into a new apartment in a quiet, green area. She had a job as a hairdresser and loved nothing more than when a client left her salon looking beautiful and confident., Everything changed one awful morning at the end of February. War – violent, loud and terrifying – roared from the north. With her neighbourhood in flames, Yuliia made the decision to flee., She and her family, including her mother Zinaida, joined over 7.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Europe’s largest country (as of 1 April 2022). After four weeks on the road, they arrived in the western province of Zakarpattia, hundreds of kilometers from her shattered home town., When Yuliia saw the horrific pictures and videos of the slaughter and destruction in Bucha, she instantly burst into tears and remained speechless for a while. “This level of violence is impossible to comprehend,” she finally said. “That is not something you would wish on the enemy, but this is something that will never be forgiven nor forgotten.”, From her neighbours, Yuliia learned that after her family had left, their flat was taken over and their belongings were looted. The factory where Yuliia’s mother worked was destroyed by bombs. Even though Ukrainian authorities have regained control, people are still not allowed to come back home due to risks of mines, and other explosive remnants of war., Here in Zakarpattia, they can finally catch a break. Together with a hundred other IDPs, they found a temporary shelter in a school in the small town of Bushtyno. Volunteers from Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic have done their best to turn impersonal classrooms into cozy bedrooms. The sports hall has become a central warehouse for all the necessities of daily life., “So here we are. This is our home now. We have everything we need, and kind people are helping us in every way they can,” says Yuliia. “Even though we are sleeping on mattresses on the floor now, missiles are not flying over our heads and my child is safe. This is the only thing that matters now.”, She hopes that her son will not have any memories of those terrifying weeks of fear and flight. “We do not have many personal belongings but what really breaks my heart is that we were not able to take any toys for Artemko. He loves cars and, at home, he had a lot of car toys, which he misses very much and asks all the time when he can come back home to play with them again. I want him just to be a child, play games and spend time with other kids. If he could have some toys or a bike, he would be really happy. And it would make me happy too.”, Toys, and even a bike might be relatively easy to come by, and bring a smile to mother and child. But right now, they are stuck, with no home, no job, no idea how to move on., IOM has been on the ground providing essential humanitarian assistance to displaced people like Yuliia and her family. IOM response includes food, non-food and hygiene items, cash, mental health and psychosocial support, as well as prevention of human trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse. Over 50,000 people have received practical humanitarian help from IOM in Ukraine since the start of the war., Text and photos by Jana Wyzinska, IOM Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-leaving-bucha

Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",11 Apr 2022,"The war in Ukraine has created a major humanitarian and child protection crisis, jeopardizing the lives of millions of children, tearing families and communities apart, and creating devastating impacts that children will feel for years to come., Joining Forces, an alliance of the six largest international NGOs working with and for children to secure their rights and end violence against them, is deeply concerned about the plight of the children who are enduring the brunt of this conflict. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on schools, hospitals, homes, childcare institutions, and other civil infrastructure are violations of international humanitarian law and we condemn these attacks in the strongest terms., Due to the ongoing conflict, more than 1.8 million children have fled Ukraine in the last weeks. They are overwhelmingly exposed to traumatic experiences, and many suffer from lack of access to basic and necessary services, including education, health care, food and clean water. Girls, unaccompanied and separated children, children in institutional care, and children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable and at heightened risk of violence, sexual exploitation, abuse and human trafficking., The conflict is another threat to children’s well-being, following years of the COVID-19 pandemic that has rolled back progress on children’s rights such as increased poverty, disruptions in learning, and reduced access to social service providers., The Joining Forces partners call for the following urgent actions, which are needed for the care and protection of children and their families:, 1 Children must be protected. All parties must fulfill their obligations under international laws relevant to children. Children are not a target. During armed conflict, international humanitarian law provides general protection for children as persons not taking part in hostilities and special protection as vulnerable persons. All parties must fulfil obligations in the promotion of Security Council Resolutions on Children in Armed Conflict, and prevent the recruitment, use, sexual exploitation and sexual violence against girls, boys and adolescents who are at risk of suffering the six grave violations against children in conflict., 2 The immediate cessation of hostilities until a lasting ceasefire is negotiated and there is a pathway to sustainable peace. The ongoing, indiscriminate violence against civilians must stop. Civilians must be allowed to leave for safer areas., 3 Ensure unimpeded, safe and rapid humanitarian access to all those in need across Ukraine. All parties to the conflict must respect, uphold and enforce obligations under international humanitarian law and the Core Humanitarian Standard., 4 Provide humanitarian aid (protection services, food, shelter, medical care, mental health and psychosocial support) to meet the needs of children, their families and/or their caregivers in Ukraine and in neighboring countries. Humanitarian efforts should support and strengthen child protection systems in neighbouring countries and coordinate with the appropriate authorities within Ukraine. Mental health and psychosocial support services aligned with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support are essential in response to the fear, anxiety, and psychological trauma children are facing., 5 Prevent and respond to all forms of violence against children. The care, protection and rights of all children need to be prioritised and all forms of violence against them must be stopped. This conflict has put children and young people, particularly girls, at significant risk of violence. It is essential that urgent support is delivered to provide holistic programs that address violence against children including sexual and gender-based violence. This includes prioritising funding for child protection and gender-based violence sectors, ensuring resources are available for prevention, and responses meet the ever-growing needs of affected children and young people., 6 Take immediate action to protect and provide services for an estimated 100,000 children – a significant proportion of whom have disabilities – living in institutions inside Ukraine. These children need urgent protection from the ongoing fighting. Their specific needs must be met as a matter of urgency, including contingencies for safe evacuation when it is in their best interests and guaranteeing the highest safeguarding standards. These children are located in facilities that may be in areas of active conflict and they may be without the nurturing care and protection of a parent or caregiver, leaving them, and particularly girls, at heightened risk of injury, mortality, exploitation, neglect, violence and trafficking., 7 Ensure no child is unaccounted for: Prioritize an effective interagency data management system in partnership with national authorities to identify, register and enable the referral of children who are separated or unaccompanied, including children who were in alternative care prior to the conflict. This should build on pre-existing initiatives (like the CPIMS+ and ProGres) and be operational both across Ukraine and in reception countries to account for children in/from institutions alongside unaccompanied and separated children, in particular in the case of cross-border relocation., 8 Ensure equitable treatment at borders prioritising the most vulnerable, and ensure that children, their families and/or caregivers are not subject to any form of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, country of origin, gender, age, ability, sexuality or other perceived differences, as well as special protection of unaccompanied and separated children to prevent exploitation and trafficking., 9 Provide protection and quality emergency care to all children and adults fleeing the conflict, with particular care to strengthen protection frameworks, establish family tracing and reunification procedures, and prevent exploitation, abuse and trafficking for children without parental care, children with disabilities, and girls who are at increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence. This must include:
(a) The creation of child-friendly spaces where children can play, learn and express themselves as they start to come to terms with the conflict and the impact on their lives;
(b) Immediate access to essential services, including mental health and psychosocial support provided in the language of the children and their caregivers;
(c) Multi-sectoral response programming in line with the Child Protection and Gender-Based Violence Minimum Standards and Minimum Initial Service Package for Sexual and Reproductive Health in Crisis Situations;
(d) Coordination amongst national authorities and international and national agencies to ensure the identification, registration and referral of unaccompanied and separated children crossing borders; preventing the separation of children from their families or primary caregivers; and supporting family tracing and reunification, when it is in the best interest of the child;
(e) Interim alternative care in line with the UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children and the Child Protection Minimum Standards. Trained professionals should be ready to support children without parental care fleeing from Ukraine, including foster and residential care professionals, interpreters and psychologists. Authorities and agencies responsible for the oversight of alternative care should ensure regulation and monitoring of care services to meet the best interests and rights of all children.
(f) Provision of cash and voucher assistance to affected families; and
(g) Access to safe, quality education in line with the Safe Schools Declaration outlining a political commitment to protect education from attack and the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. The Declaration and Guidelines have been endorsed by Ukraine., 10 Provide a continuum of care for all children affected by the conflict, linking humanitarian response systems to domestic child protection systems in Ukraine and in countries of transit and destination. Such systems should include measures to support families to stay together; protection, education, and quality alternative care; prioritising family-based care when in the best interests of the child, for children who have lost parental care, and specialised support for girls and children with disabilities. These efforts must connect to longer-term plans to build strong welfare and protection systems., 11 Protect the rights of child human rights defenders who are taking action, as they have the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression, as well as the rights of humanitarian and frontline workers, including those guaranteeing assistance to children affected by hostilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joining-forces-partnership-calls-urgent-actions-be-taken-protect-children-and-their

Perugia Declaration for Ukraine: Call for increased support of independent media and journalists in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IFEX,Protection and Human Rights,9 Apr 2022,"""The safety and security of all journalists to report freely are essential to ensure that the world understands the reality and facts of the ongoing war, including the humanitarian consequences."", This statement was published on gmfd.info on 7 April 2022., Members and partners of the Global Forum for Media Development have launched a declaration at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia in solidarity with media and journalists in Ukraine. The declaration has already been signed by over 60 organisations., #PerugiaDeclaration4Ukraine, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underlined once again the essential role of independent, ethical journalism in assisting citizens to make life-or-death decisions, informing the world, and holding the powerful to account., As a powerful antidote to the disinformation and propaganda that characterise hybrid warfare, and as a pillar of democracy upon which other freedoms and rights depend, journalism in Ukraine is undergoing a terrible assault., The targeting, torturing, and killing of journalists is abhorrent and must be stopped. Those responsible must be held accountable and brought to justice under national and international law. Vicious online attacks against news organisations and individual journalists must also cease. We condemn Russia’s attacks on press freedom and freedom of expression in Ukraine in the strongest possible terms., The safety and security of all journalists to report freely are essential to ensure that the world understands the reality and facts of the ongoing war, including the humanitarian consequences., We stand in solidarity with all journalists and independent media covering Russia’s aggression against Ukraine., The greater the threat to Ukrainian journalists’ lives, livelihoods, and ability to do their jobs, the greater will be our efforts to support them. Funding, protective gear, equipment, housing, training, office space in foreign cities, and psychosocial support – we will do everything we can to support our Ukrainian colleagues’ ability to continue reporting and serving the urgent needs of their audiences., A window of opportunity for journalism and journalists everywhere, In countries with access to independent sources of news, an often sceptical public are recognising the bravery, commitment and professionalism of journalists and media outlets, both Ukrainian and international. Even governments with hostile dispositions to free, independent media are being forced to acknowledge the vital role journalism plays in ensuring that the world sees the invasion of Ukraine for what it is. Tech companies too are waking up to the fact that not all information is equal, and that there is a moral imperative to give due prominence to professional, independent, public interest journalism., This nascent, new-found and rekindled recognition of journalism’s value among the public and policy makers is fragile. Ukrainian reporters and international journalists reporting from Ukraine have earned a window of opportunity. The greatest leaps of progress are often made in times of crisis. We, collectively, cannot afford to squander it., For the sake of the immediate future and safety of our Ukrainian colleagues, and the long term viability of independent, public interest journalism everywhere, this is a moment that we all need to rise to., For the benefit of media and journalists everywhere, we:, To international media and journalists, we ask that you:, To private and public donors and funders of professional journalism, we ask that you:, To the EU, EU member states, members of the Media Freedom Coalition and all states that care about the right to freedom of expression and access to information, we ask you to:, To technology, telecoms, internet intermediaries and advertisers, we ask you to:, We continue to stand in solidarity with all journalists around the world who work in areas of conflict or where freedom of expression is limited, to deliver trusted information in the public interest., Add your organisation as a signature to the declaration using this very short sign up form., **Signatories (individuals: speakers, attendees and friends of the International Journalism Festival):, Add your name to the declaration using this very short sign up form., Check out Perugia Declaration for Ukraine in Italian (Dichiarazione di Perugia per l’Ucraina), Ukrainian (Перуджійська декларація у підтримку України) and Russian (Перуджийская декларация в поддержку Украины)., Visit the International Journalism Festival’s YouTube channel here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/perugia-declaration-ukraine-call-increased-support-independent-media-and-journalists
Joint Statement by EU and Ukrainian operators to help refugees from Ukraine stay connected,News and Press Release,EC,Logistics and Telecommunications,8 Apr 2022,"Ukraine: EU facilitates coordinated steps by telecom operators to help refugees stay connected, At a virtual event today, telecom operators based in the EU and in Ukraine have signed a joint statement on their coordinated efforts to secure and stabilise affordable or free roaming and international calls between the EU and Ukraine. The Commission and the European Parliament have facilitated this joint statement and welcome its signature by 27 operators, with more joining, in the EU and Ukraine, including several EU-wide groups, and the association representing several mobile virtual network operators (MVNO Europe). After a number of spontaneous voluntary initiatives took place, the joint statement aims to establish a more stable framework to help Ukrainians displaced throughout Europe to stay in touch with family and friends back home., The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has disrupted the lives of millions of Ukrainians. An estimated 4.2 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, in particular to Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, from where they are progressively moving to other Member States. In the face of this immediate and growing humanitarian crisis, it is essential that Ukrainian refugees have access to affordable connectivity, so that they can stay in touch with their family and friends and that they can use the Internet and have access to reliable information. The initiative of several telecom operators to waive or reduce international call charges with Ukraine and roaming surcharges for displaced people in Europe is therefore very welcome, and should be put on a broader and sustainable footing., Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: “The possibility to have contact to those who are dear to us and access to information is a lifeline in times of crisis. This is why, together with the European Parliament, we are supporting the initiatives of telecom operators to facilitate affordable mobile connectivity for people who have fled the war. Also we encourage for more similar measures that can make a real difference in these extraordinary circumstances.”, Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, said: “In this emergency situation many telecom operators have shown exceptional solidarity with the people fleeing Ukraine. Today they make an additional important step. We welcome the joint statement by European and Ukrainian operators to make it easier for those suffering from the Kremlin war to stay connected. This engagement will make it possible to have voluntary measures apply as widely as possible throughout Europe. People displaced across Europe will be able to phone home, and people in Ukraine will be able to phone loved ones abroad at affordable conditions.”, European Parliament rapporteur on the new roaming regulation Angelika Winzig (EPP, Austria), said: “I welcome today's important step towards true free roaming for Ukrainian refugees. Our joint efforts have paid off and as the rapporteur for the new roaming regulation, I am particularly grateful that we could facilitate this joint statement. By lowering the wholesale caps Ukrainian operators can more readily offer free roaming within the European Union to their customers, making it easier for them to stay in contact with their family and friends back in Ukraine. This way, no additional financial burden is placed on them during these challenging times. I look forward to building on this”., Joint action by EU and Ukrainian operators, After having reacted quickly to the humanitarian crisis with a number of voluntary measures across Europe, telecom operators have undertaken to further show their willingness to help and support Ukrainians in these tragic circumstances. Recognising the importance of connectivity in times of crisis, and under these exceptional circumstances, the aim of the joint statement is to establish a coordinated approach to ensure that both EU and Ukrainian operators can continue providing affordable connectivity to refugees from Ukraine. The operators are committing to implement voluntary measures, namely to lower wholesale charges for roaming and other charges they charge each other to enable international calls with Ukraine. This will minimise additional costs for both EU and Ukrainian operators, enabling each to cover their respective costs. At the same time, the Ukrainian signatories of this declaration commit to pass on the benefits of the voluntary measures applied by their EU partners to the end users., The joint statement has already been signed by 24 operators based in EU, including several EU-wide groups, the association representing several mobile virtual network operators (MVNO Europe) and all the 3 mobile operators based in Ukraine. A list is available here. The signature took place under the auspices and support of the Commission and the European Parliament, and it has also been facilitated by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, BEREC, and the Ukrainian national regulatory authority, NCEC. The broad support will allow to expand the voluntary measures to support affordable connectivity between the EU and Ukraine and to make them more stable and sustainable for as long as needed., The statement is open to all operators who wish to sign at any time, as from today, and shall apply for three months and will be reviewed to take into account the fast-changing situation, its humanitarian objectives and whether other longer-term measures by public authorities and/or industry would be more adequate. The Commission, BEREC and NCEC will continue to monitor the developments and the voluntary measures., Other actions undertaken by operators, The signatories of this joint statement have taken, as of the first days of this crisis, many actions to ensure connectivity across the board. Telecom operators based in the EU have distributed millions of SIM cards free of charge to refugees from Ukraine. A large and increasing number of refugees using such SIM cards are also benefiting from free international calls to Ukraine. Some EU operators have also enabled free roaming and provided free WiFi and charging in border areas or shelters. In parallel, Ukrainian operators, who keep the connectivity within Ukraine and with Ukraine functioning despite military aggression, have from the early days of this crisis ensured national roaming within the country and offered free international roaming to refugees who fled the war., EU funds can help improve communication, In parallel, EU Member States can make use of the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in financing actions to provide refugees with access to essential services such as communication services. The ESF, for instance, may finance vouchers for refugees, which they can use to purchase mobile communication subscriptions (SIM cards). The ERDF can support secure local connectivity through investment in infrastructure and related equipment for the benefit of refugees. The Commission has made sure through its Cohesion's Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) that there is flexibility in the rules of the ESF, the ERDF and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) to allow a swift reallocation of available funding to emergency support in the current context. These measures would contribute to the sustainability of the voluntary measures by keeping the burden on private stakeholders on both the EU and Ukrainian side manageable.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-eu-and-ukrainian-operators-help-refugees-ukraine-stay-connected
Update 48 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,10 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that it had carried out the first staff rotation at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in three weeks and only the second since late February when Russian forces seized the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General welcomed the news as a much-needed positive step for the wellbeing of the NPP’s personnel and their families, who have been living and working under extremely stressful and difficult circumstances during the conflict. The shift change was also important for the safe and secure operation of the Chornobyl NPP, which was controlled by the Russian military for five weeks until they withdrew on 31 March, he said., During the armed conflict, Director General Grossi has often stressed the necessity of NPP workers being able to carry out their duties without undue pressure and to return to their homes and rest, something that many personnel at Chornobyl have been denied over the past month and a half. The previous change of staff on duty took place on 20-21 March, which in turn was the first since the Russian military entered the site on 24 February., However, the fact that those taking part in Saturday’s staff rotation had to be transported to and from the site by boat on the Pripyat River – as publicly reported by the national operator Energoatom – underlined that the situation at the NPP and the Exclusion Zone around it remained far from normal, he said., Energoatom said river transportation was currently the only way for people living in the city of Slavutych outside the Zone to get to the NPP, where radioactive waste management facilities are located following the 1986 accident., “While it is very positive that Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring regulatory control of the Chornobyl site, it is clear that a lot of work remains to return the site to normality,” he said. “As soon as it is possible, I will head an IAEA mission to Chornobyl to conduct a radiological assessment there, resume remote safeguards monitoring of the facility and its nuclear material and deliver equipment, including spare parts and components, for the NPP’s safe and secure operation. I’m in close consultations with Ukraine on setting a date and organizing a programme of work for the visit, which is expected to take place soon.”, Ukraine also provided more information about the damage to the site’s analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring, saying the premises were destroyed and the analytical instruments stolen, broken or otherwise disabled. In addition, an associated Information and Communication Centre had been looted, parts of its communication lines destroyed, and the automated transmission of radiation monitoring data disabled., Ukraine informed the IAEA already last month that the Central Analytical Laboratory in Chornobyl town had been “looted by marauders” and that it could not confirm the safety and security of its calibration sources nor the condition of environmental samples stored there. Based on the information provided at that time, the IAEA then assessed that the incident did not pose a significant radiological risk., Regarding Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-48-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine

This included:, a total of 1,793 killed (458 men, 294 women, 27 girls, and 46 boys, as well as 69 children and 899 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,439 injured (279 men, 213 women, 47 girls, and 46 boys, as well as 136 children and 1,718 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,880 casualties (642 killed and 1,238 injured)  On Government-controlled territory: 1,534 casualties (571 killed and 963 injured)  On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 346 casualties (71 killed and 275 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv,
Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,352 casualties (1,151 killed and 1,201 injured)
Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.
OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.

Update 47 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that it was gradually restoring regulatory control of nuclear and radiation safety at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) but that the site was still lacking personnel for maintenance and repair work that was halted when Russia took control of the plant in late February, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Providing an update about the situation at the Chornobyl NPP after Russian forces withdrew from the site last week, Ukraine said that despite “the increase in the level of radioactive contamination … due to non-conformity with requirements of radiation safety and strict access procedures”, the radiation situation is “within the limits” for the site., Ukrainian National Guards are ensuring physical protection at the site of the 1986 accident, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located, it said., However, it had not yet been possible to restore the operation of radiation and other sensors due to the absence of required maintenance and other specialised staff, Ukraine said. It added that this situation may also “lead to the failure of other systems and components important to safety” and that the inoperability of the equipment makes the comprehensive monitoring of key safety parameters at the site more complicated. NPP management was aiming to ensure staff rotation and to send additional personnel there for repairs, it said., Director General Grossi said Ukraine’s update further underlined the necessity for IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts to travel to the Chornobyl NPP as soon as it is possible. In close coordination and consultation with Ukraine, the IAEA is developing assistance packages and finalizing logistical preparations for sending several such missions to Chornobyl and other nuclear sites in the country in the coming weeks., The IAEA is aware of recent media reports about the situation at the Chornobyl NPP and the Exclusion Zone set up after the accident, but its experts can only conduct a radiological assessment at the site and deliver required safety-related equipment to the plant when they go there, the Director General said., Apart from the new information about Chornobyl, Ukraine said there had been no other developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours., Regarding Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP.

Information Note: The importance of Ukraine and the Russian Federation for global agricultural markets and the risks associated with the current conflict (25 March 2022 Update),Analysis,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",25 Mar 2022,"Executive Summary, 1.1 Market shares, • The Russian Federation and Ukraine are among the most important producers of agricultural commodities in the world. Both countries are net exporters of agricultural products, and they both play leading supply roles in global markets of foodstuffs and fertilisers, where exportable supplies are often concentrated in a handful of countries. This concentration could expose these markets to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility., • In 2021, either the Russian Federation or Ukraine (or both) ranked amongst the top three global exporters of wheat, maize, rapeseed, sunflower seeds and sunflower oil, while the Russian Federation also stood as the world’s top exporter of nitrogen fertilizers, the second leading supplier of potassium fertilizers and the third largest exporter of phosphorous fertilizers., 1.2 Trade profiles, • Many countries that are highly dependent on imported foodstuffs and fertilizers, including numerous that fall into the Least Developed Country (LDC) and Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC) groups, rely on Ukrainian and Russian food supplies to meet their consumption needs. Many of these countries, already prior to the conflict, had been grappling with the negative effects of high international food and fertilizer prices., 2.1 Trade risks, • In Ukraine, the escalation of the conflict raises concerns on whether crops will be harvested and products exported. The war has already led to port closures, the suspension of oilseed crushing operations and the introduction of export licensing requirements for some products. All of these could take a toll on the country’s exports of grains and vegetable oils in the months ahead. Much uncertainty also surrounds Russian export prospects, given sales difficulties that may arise as a result of economic sanctions imposed on the country., 2.2 Price risks, • FAO’s simulations gauging the potential impacts of a sudden and steep reduction in grain and sunflower seed exports by the two countries indicate that these shortfalls might only be partially compensated by alternative sources during the 2022/23 marketing season. The capacity of many exporting countries to boost output and shipments may be limited by high production and input costs. Worryingly, the resulting global supply gap could raise international food and feed prices by 8 to 22 percent above their already elevated baseline levels., • If the conflict keeps crude oil prices at high levels and prolongs the two countries’ reduced global export participation beyond the 2022/23 season, a considerable supply gap would remain in global grain and sunflowerseed markets, even as alternative producing countries expand their output in response to the higher output prices. This would keep international prices elevated well above baseline levels., 2.3 Logistical risks, • In Ukraine, there are also concerns that the conflict may result in damages to inland transport infrastructure and seaports, as well as storage and processing infrastructure. This is all the more so given the limited capacity of alternatives, such as rail transport for seaports or smaller processing facilities for modern oilseeds crushing facilities, to compensate for their lack of operation., • More generally, apprehensions also exist regarding increasing insurance premia for vessels destined to berth in the Black Sea region, as these could exacerbate the already elevated costs of maritime transportation, compounding further the effects on the final costs of internationally sourced food paid by importers., 2.4 Production risks, • Although early production prospects for 2022/23 winter crops were favourable in both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, in Ukraine, the conflict may prevent farmers from attending to their fields and harvesting and marketing their crops, while disruptions to essential public services could also negatively affect agricultural activities., • Current indications are that, as a result of the conflict, between 20 and 30 percent of areas sown to winter crops in Ukraine will remain unharvested during the 2022/23 season, with the yields of these crops also likely to be adversely affected. Furthermore, considerable uncertainties surround Ukrainian farmers’ capacity to plant crops during the fast approaching spring crop cycle., • The conflict is also likely to affect the ability of Ukraine to control its animal disease burden, significantly increasing the risk of proliferation of animal diseases, notably of African swine fever (ASF), within Ukraine and in neighbouring countries., • In the case of the Russian Federation, although no major disruption to crops already in the ground appears imminent, uncertainties exist over the impact that the international sanctions imposed on the country will have on food exports. Any loss of export markets could depress farmer incomes, thereby negatively affecting future planting decisions., • Economic sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation could also disrupt its imports of agricultural inputs, notably pesticides and seeds, on which the country is highly dependent. This could result in less plantings, lower yields and lower qualities, exposing the Russian agricultural sector and global food supplies, at large, to non-negligible risks., 2.5 Humanitarian risks, • The conflict is set to increase humanitarian needs in Ukraine, while deepening those of millions of people that prior to its escalation were already displaced or requiring assistance due to the more than eight-year conflict in the eastern part of the country. By directly constraining agricultural production, limiting economic activity and raising prices, the conflict will further undercut the purchasing power of local populations, with consequent increases in food insecurity and malnutrition., • Humanitarian needs in neighbouring countries, where displaced populations are seeking refuge, are also set to increase substantially., • Globally, if the conflict results in a sudden and prolonged reduction in food exports by Ukraine and the Russian Federation, it will exert additional upward pressure on international food commodity prices to the detriment of economically vulnerable countries, in particular. FAO’s simulations suggest that under such a scenario, the global number of undernourished people could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022/23, with the most pronounced increases taking place in Asia-Pacific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and North Africa. If the war lasts, impacts will go well beyond 2022/23., 2.6 Energy risks, • The Russian Federation is a key player in the global energy market. As a highly energy-intensive industry, especially in developed regions, agriculture will inevitably be affected by the sharp increase in energy prices that has accompanied the conflict., • Agriculture absorbs high amounts of energy directly, through the use of fuel, gas and electricity, and indirectly, through the use of agri-chemicals such as fertilisers, pesticides and lubricants., • With prices of fertilizers and other energy-intensive products rising as a consequence of the conflict, overall input prices are expected to experience a considerable boost. The higher prices of these inputs will first translate into higher production costs and eventually into higher food prices. They could also lead to lower input use levels, depressing yields and harvests in the 2022/23 season, thus giving further upside risk to the state of global food security in the coming years., • Higher energy prices also make agricultural feedstocks (especially maize, sugar and oilseeds/vegetable oils) competitive for the production of bio-energy and, given the large size of the energy market relative to the food market, this could pull food prices up to their energy parity equivalents., 2.7 Exchange rate, debt, and growth risks, • The Ukrainian hryvnia reached a record low against the United States dollar (USD) in early March 2022, with likely repercussions for Ukrainian agriculture, including a boost to its export competitiveness and curbs on its ability to import., • Although their extent remains unclear at this stage, conflict-induced damages to Ukraine’s productive capacity and infrastructure are expected to entail very high recovery and reconstruction costs., • The economic sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation have also led to a significant depreciation of the Russian rouble. Although this should make Russian exports of agricultural commodities more affordable, a lasting rouble depreciation would negatively affect investment and productivity growth prospects in the country., • Weakening economic activity and a depreciated rouble are also expected to have serious effects on countries in Central Asia through the reduction of remittance flows, as for many of these countries remittances constitute a significant part of gross domestic product (GDP)., • The current conflict may also have global spillovers. While its impact on the global economy remains uncertain at this stage and will depend on several factors, the most vulnerable countries and populations are expected to be hit hard by slower economic growth and increased inflation, at a time when the world is still attempting to recover from the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic., • Agriculture is the backbone of the economies of many developing countries, the majority of which rely on the United States dollar for their borrowing needs. As such, a lasting appreciation of the USD vis-à-vis other currencies may have negative significant economic consequences for these countries, including for their agrifood sectors. Moreover, the potential reduction of GDP growth in several parts of the world will affect global demand for agrifood products with negative consequences for global food security. Lower GDP growth will also likely reduce the availability of funds for development, especially if global military expenses increase.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/information-note-importance-ukraine-and-russian-federation-global-agricultural
Response to the Ukraine Crisis: Social Protection for Food Security and Nutrition,Analysis,FAO,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",7 Apr 2022,"Setting the scene, The Ukraine crisis that began on 24 February has not only created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis but a looming increase in food insecurity, in countries both close and far from the theater of war. This comes on the rise in hunger and food insecurity and worsening nutrition situation stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Moreover, many food-importing countries are likely to be seriously affected by the disruption in the export of cereals and the expected rise in the price of their food imports from Ukraine and Russia., Humanitarian and social protection responses will be needed to cushion the negative impact of these developments on the food security and nutritional status of Ukrainians affected by the war as well as of nutritionally vulnerable groups in food-importing countries, particularly in North, East and West Africa as well as in West and Central Asia., The Ukraine crisis and its repercussions Apart from the millions of Ukrainians who have become internally displaced since the outbreak of hostilities, UN sources estimate that about four million have left the country over the past month – mostly women and children. According to the Ukraine Flash Appeal of March 1st, 2022, 18 million people are projected to become affected by the conflict, including up to 6.7 million newly internally displaced. Many people are seeking shelter in Ukraine’s countryside; among those internally displaced, disabled persons are particularly vulnerable, 1 as are elderly women.2 Additionally, 265,000 women in Ukraine are estimated to be pregnant, of whom about 80,000 will give birth during the first three months of the crisis., The conflict is not only upending the lives of people inside the country, but also straining the capacity of Ukraine’s neighboring countries to absorb and provide protection to those fleeing the war. As the crisis lasts and results in their protracted displacement, it is likely to severely affect the agricultural sector, both in Ukraine and in countries hosting large numbers of refugees. 4 The war is already affecting rural labour markets, employment and working conditions in Ukraine, as well as basic infrastructure and the provision of public services. Ukrainian farms are reporting labour shortages, problems in accessing key agricultural inputs such as fuel, chemicals and fertilizers, and problems in selling and mobilizing produce. Food shortages and lack of access to water are becoming acute, particularly for older adults.5 Roughly 40% of people are currently facing food shortages or expected to do so in the coming three months (Figure 1).6 Disruptions to food value chains (Figure 2) will further worsen food insecurity, which was already on the rise after COVID-19, especially for women.7, The war has already disrupted Ukraine’s agricultural growing season, and questions abound as to whether farmers will be able to harvest existing crops, plant new ones or sustain livestock production as the conflict evolves.8 Labour shortages, coupled with physical access constraints and damage to productive assets, agricultural land and civilian infrastructure as well as shortages of other key agricultural inputs (fuel, fertilizers, agrochemicals, seeds, fodder and medication) will affect the production and performance of farms.9 This will in turn affect their revenues and may limit rural on- and off-farm employment opportunities for remaining workers, which could trigger negative spillover effects on rural and agricultural labour markets in Ukraine., Conflict can also push children into child labour: in 2015, 25% of children aged 5-17 in rural areas were engaged in child labour. 10 Labour shortages on farms, especially in small scale production, may also lead farmers to resort to child labour., Moreover, the massive influx of refugees to neighboring countries is placing a great burden on their capacity to meet the burgeoning needs of people fleeing the war. According to UNHCR, as of 29 March 2022, the majority of refugees have fled to Poland (about 2.3 M), followed by Romania (609,000), Moldova (387,000), Hungary (365,000), Russian Federation (351,000), Slovakia (281,000) and Belarus (11,000). Approximately 90% are women and children. While most countries bordering Ukraine have relatively well-developed social protection systems, these have been set up to tackle idiosyncratic shocks and lifecycle vulnerabilities such as income security in the face of unemployment, the loss of a breadwinner or old age. Provision of social benefits in these countries was never intended to address large covariate shocks of the kind currently facing those leaving Ukraine, and the sudden surge in caseloads will pose a great challenge to the capacity of national social protection systems to provide an adequate and timely response to those made newly vulnerable by the conflict. This is particularly true for non-EU member countries such as Moldova., The longer the displacement and the greater the pressure that a large refugee population places on the limited public resources of Ukraine’s neighbors, the higher the risk that tensions might arise with host communities— unless actions are purposefully taken to anticipate and address such potential tensions. Seasonal migration to neighboring countries where Ukrainians comprise a large portion of seasonal agricultural workers might also get disrupted by the conflict, partly though not solely due to the ban on men aged 18-60 years from leaving Ukraine while martial law lasts. Should large numbers of refugees choose or be forced to stay in the host countries for a protracted period, this could affect the latter’s agricultural labour markets and incomes., Aside from the direct impact of the conflict in Ukraine and its neighbors, its repercussions will be felt in countries far removed from the theater of war. The Russian Federation and Ukraine are among the most important producers of cereal grains, oil seeds and fertilizers in the world.11 Both countries are net exporters of agricultural products, and they both play leading supply roles in global markets of cereal grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertilizers, where exportable supplies are often concentrated in a handful of countries. This concentration could further expose these markets to increased vulnerability to shocks and volatility. Many countries, including several that are among the Least Developed Country (LDC) and Low-Income Food-Deficit Country (LIFDC) groups, are highly dependent on Ukrainian and Russian staple food supplies to meet their consumption needs, and many had been grappling with the negative effects of high international staple food and fertilizer prices prior to the Ukraine conflict. According to FAO, if the conflict results in a sudden and prolonged reduction in food exports by Ukraine and the Russian Federation, it will exert additional upward pressure on international food commodity prices to the detriment of economically vulnerable countries. Under such a scenario, the global number of undernourished people could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022/23, with the most pronounced increases taking place in Asia-Pacific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East and North Africa., Impacts will go well beyond 2022/23 if the war lasts longer.12 This may have long lasting impacts on nutrition and health related outcomes. When faced with increased food prices households tend to protect essential staple foods that mitigate hunger, and decrease the purchase of nutrient rich foods. This together with clean water issues could have devastating effects on the nutritional status, particularly of those already vulnerable to malnutrition, including women and young children. Finally, the World Bank has estimated that in Central Asian countries which are highly dependent on remittances from workers in Russia (such as 31% of GDP in Kyrgyz Republic and 27% of GDP in Tajikistan), remittances could decline 25% on average.13Experience from previous humanitarian crises and shocks shows that social protection can play a key role in protecting rural livelihoods, supporting food security and nutrition, and enabling households to cope, absorb and bounce back from shocks. Social protection can also help rebuild agriculture-based livelihoods affected by the Ukraine conflict and promote decent work for both host communities and refugees., Lessons from the 2008-2009 crisis indicate that the timely provision of income support through targeted transfers to those most in need constitutes the most cost-effective response to forestall increases in poverty and inequality due to higher food prices, enabling households to maintain access to food and essential services., Nutrition programmes may be needed alongside transfer programmes, with growth monitoring to detect hotspots, nutrition education to help households make best use of scarce resources, and micro-nutrient supplementation to help compensate for lower dietary diversity due to changes in food consumption patterns in response to the food price increases.14 Depending on context, some of these nutrition-specific actions could be delivered directly alongside cash transfer programmes. Similarly, the response to COVID-19 showed that unconditional cash transfers were the most effective, efficient and timely social protection instrument to help maintain basic consumption, and that increasing the value of transfers provided through existing social protection programmes provides the timeliest response.15 At the same time, existing programmes may need to be expanded and new ones created to reach population groups who are not currently accessing social protection. The Turkish response to the Syrian refugee crisis in 2016 offers an example of how a host country’s social protection system can be enabled to absorb spikes in caseloads of refugees. To manage the influx of Syrian refugees, the Government of Turkey, with financial support from the European Union, developed a dedicated social safety net for refugees and asylum seekers. The Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN) was integrated within the national social protection system managed by Ministry of Family and Social Policy. Thanks to this integration, programme participants were able to access different types of benefits through one single registration process and one single payment system via a bank card (the ‘Kizilaykart’).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/response-ukraine-crisis-social-protection-food-security-and-nutrition
Assessing investment needs in Ukraine’s agricultural reconstruction and recovery,Analysis,FAO,"Agriculture
Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Apr 2022,"Executive summary, ● While the war in Ukraine is ongoing and its outcome yet unclear, the damage to its agriculture and agrifood sector is already of an unprecedented scale, both in terms of the impact on the national economy and on global food security., ● Reconstruction and rehabilitation plans for Ukrainian agriculture are urgently needed in order to mitigate the impact of the war domestically and internationally but their successful implementation will depend on the achievement of stable and long-lasting peace., ● Damage caused by war to a country with an agricultural output and exports as significant as that of Ukraine is unparalleled since the Second World War. Current damage to infrastructure is estimated in the range of USD 68-199 billion and the economy is expected to shrink by 40 percent in 2022., ● Reconstruction and rehabilitation costs of Ukrainian agriculture due to loss and damage resulting from the Russian aggression on the country will most likely exceed the similar estimated costs following the armed conflict in Syria, considering the complexity of its food system (including export infrastructure) and billions of USD in lost revenues from exports., ● Damages are defined as totally or partially destroyed physical assets and stocks, while losses are calculated in terms of forgone output and incomes as a result of the war., ● The total value of capital stock in Ukrainian agriculture (including down- and upstream sectors) is estimated at USD 29 billion. The potential direct damage to agriculture assets can initially be estimated at USD 6.4 billion (this includes destroyed irrigation infrastructure, storage, machinery and other agricultural equipment, in-port infrastructure, greenhouses, field crops, livestock and processing units)., ● The additional expected economic losses from the war in 2022 are estimated at about USD 22 billion., ● FAO’s International Financial Institutions partners (World Bank, EBRD) have already pledged USD 3 and 2 billion respectively for recovery in Ukraine. However, it is clear that actual recovery and investment needs will be far higher in agriculture and the agrifood industry alone., ● Any agricultural investment/recovery plan will need to be a part of the national recovery strategy, and will need to be based on pre-disaster baseline, damage and loss assessments followed by an assessment of recovery investment needs. Tentative priority areas to be covered by a recovery and investment plan for Ukrainian agriculture will likely include support to rural households and food security, liquidity and access to finance, de-mining, critical inputs supply, seed production and livestock breeding, compensation for lost assets and other areas of immediate and long-term development needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/assessing-investment-needs-ukraine-s-agricultural-reconstruction-and-recovery

Update 46 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (8 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,8 Apr 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is preparing comprehensive assistance packages and finalizing logistical preparations for several nuclear safety, security and safeguards missions to Ukraine in the coming weeks, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Stressing the urgent need to deliver technical support to reduce the risk of a nuclear accident during the conflict, the Director General said he is consulting and coordinating closely with Ukraine on both the specific content of the IAEA’s assistance to its nuclear facilities as well as on the schedule for the expert missions that are expected to start later this month., The IAEA will be the “single point of contact” for such international technical assistance to Ukraine and it is in discussions with the many countries that have expressed interest in backing its efforts to help ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, he added. The IAEA will also send inspectors to carry out safeguards activities in Ukraine in line with its non-proliferation mandate., Signalling strong support, the Non-Proliferation Directors Group of the G7 – comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States – on Thursday issued a statement welcoming “Director General Grossi’s efforts as a major contribution to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine”. They underlined “full and continued support for the Agency”., “The IAEA provided some concrete assistance in the form of radiation monitoring equipment during my visit to the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant last week, but much more is needed. We are ready to transport spare parts and components to Ukraine and to provide expert assessments and advice, both on- and off-site. In the coming weeks, we will shift our assistance activities into a much higher gear,” he said. “To be able to do this, we will also rely on the continued support of our partners.”, Director General Grossi said the IAEA’s priority was to send safety, security and safeguards staff to the Chornobyl NPP as soon as it is possible. They would conduct a radiological assessment, deliver safety-related equipment, and restore the online safeguards monitoring system at the site, which was controlled by Russian forces for five weeks before their withdrawal on 31 March., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no other developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours., Regarding Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-46-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-8-april-2022

Secretary-General António Guterres said in a statement, that the strike - and others against civilians and civilian infrastructure - were ""gross violations"" of international law., Mr. Guterres said the strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine, which killed and injured scores of civilians waiting to be evacuated, ""including many women, children and elderly"", was ""completely unacceptable."", The statement issued by his Spokesperson went on to remind ""all parties of their obligations under international law to protect civilians, and of the urgency to agree on humanitarian ceasefires in order to enable the safe evacuation of, and humanitarian access to, populations trapped in conflict., ""The Secretary-General reiterates his appeal to all concerned to bring an immediate end to this brutal war."", In an earlier statement, on Friday, UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said that many had suffered terrible injuries at the railway station and that the number of fatalities was likely to rise., Assault on the most vulnerable, “It was widely reported over the last two days that the station and surrounding area had been full of civilians attempting to flee intensifying hostilities,” Mr. Awad said in a statement. “We are extremely disturbed by the reports of children, women, the elderly and people with disabilities – the most vulnerable people in the Kramatorsk area – who were caught up in this attack.”, Mr. Awad said the use of explosive weapons, ""with wide area impact in populated areas is a clear violation of international humanitarian law. All military forces, in all conflicts, must not carry out attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. They must do their utmost to protect civilians."", He added that hospitals in the surrounding area were now full of casualties: ""We and our humanitarian partners are ready to do anything we can to help those who are responding to the attack and those who have survived. We have delivered first aid supplies as well as emergency food rations, water purification tablets and blankets., ""We continue to call on all the parties to this conflict to allow safe and unimpeded passage for people who wish to leave, to prevent attacks on essential transportation for civilians, and for life-saving relief supplies to reach those unable to move or evacuate."", The UN Children's Fund Ukraine Representative, Murat Sahin, said that the train station had been the main route out for thousands of families evacuating from Donetsk region, ""which has seen some of the war’s worst destruction"", to relatively safer areas in Ukraine., ""Earlier today, UNICEF offloaded medical kits and emergency supplies at Kramatorsk"", he said., ""Over the past week, UNICEF has delivered about 50 metric tons of life-saving supplies including medicines, water and hygiene kits to Kramatorsk to respond to rapidly deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the east. The UNICEF team was delivering life-saving supplies to the regional health department, a kilometre away from the train station when the attack took place."", Urgent need for 'localized' ceasefires, Local ceasefires are needed more urgently than ever in Ukraine as conflict shifts to the eastern regions following Russia’s withdrawal from the area around the capital Kyiv, UN humanitarians said on Friday, while global food prices spiked to record levels., Six weeks since the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians are believed to be still trapped in the southern port city of Mariupol, where they’ve faced weeks of heavy shelling., But there is still no truce agreement between Russian and Ukrainian forces to let them escape safely, amid continuing mediation efforts by UN emergency relief chief Martin Griffiths., Agreement is key, “What is important is to get the parties to agree on …localised ceasefires,” said Jens Laerke, from UN aid coordination office OCHA. “It is a top priority to get the silencing of the guns in those cities, Mariupol being the worst affected, those where citizens are trapped., “To allow them to get to safety voluntarily, to a place of their choosing. And to allow aid to get in. So, this is an incremental process.”, As fighting moves to the Luhansk and Donetsk regions where Russian-backed separatists already control significant Ukrainian territory, Mr. Laerke said that the UN and its partners are trying to push as much aid in as possible., “People are still hunkered down in basements in Luhansk and Donetsk. We have in our planning convoys to go there…next week. Again, whether that happens again depends on the security situation.”, Exodus continues, Since the war began on 24 February, well over four million people have fled Ukraine, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) confirmed., “The war in Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crises ever,” said UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh. “Within six weeks, more than 4.3 million refugees have fled the country, while a further 7.1 million are displaced internally.”, Inside Ukraine, core relief items have been distributed to reception centres set up by local authorities, but delivering aid to areas of active fighting “remains challenging,” Mr. Saltmarsh explained., Lifesaving convoys, “We continue striving to reach hard-hit areas such as Mariupol and Kherson with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys and have contributed to four such convoys under the humanitarian notification system: two to Sumy, one to Kharkiv and one to Sieverodonetsk, and delivered several additional convoys with the help of partners, reaching 15,600 people with relief items.”, The UN remains seriously concerned over continued attacks on healthcare inside Ukraine, as the World Health Organization (WHO) verified that more than 100 attacks on health care have happened since the start of the war on 24 February., “The attacks so far have claimed 73 lives and injured 51 people,” said WHO spokesperson Fadela Chaib., Skyrocketing food prices, The conflict in Ukraine has also added to fears of skyrocketing global food prices, as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that its Food Price Index had made a “giant leap” to a new high since its inception in 1990., “Driven largely by the conflict-related export disruptions from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, cereal prices jumped by nearly 20 per cent,” said Josef Schmidhuber, Deputy Director, Markets and Trade Division, FAO., Of the 103 attacks to date, 89 have impacted health facilities and 13 have affected transport, including ambulances., $25 billion fund call for food importers, To soften the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on nations that import most of their food needs from both countries, 80 FAO Members on Friday appealed for for the creation of a $25 billion fund to help them in the short term., “This conflict severely aggravates the already considerable food security challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including already-high price inflation of food and agricultural inputs,” said FAO Member States who called for an Emergency Special Session of the UN agency’s Council., To cover the most immediate needs, $6.3 billion is required for the Global Food Import Financing Facility to get off the ground, FAO said, noting that much more funding could be made available from other sources, such as Special Drawing Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund, which amounted to $650 billion in August 2021., “The basic idea is just to alleviate the food import costs, the food import bills for net importers with high net import requirements and low income levels,” said Mr. Schmidhuber.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-un-condemns-deadly-attack-train-station-dozens-civilians-killed
A Statement from HelpAge International in response to the warning that people should flee eastern Ukraine,News and Press Release,HelpAge,Protection and Human Rights,8 Apr 2022,"In response to the warning for all civilians in eastern Ukraine to evacuate the area, HelpAge International’s CEO Justin Derbyshire outlined a more complicated picture:, “In eastern Ukraine, so many older people, including those with disabilities, have already endured eight years of war. Many will stay in their homes - either because of mobility difficulties or because they do not wish to leave the home and land they are connected to., “For those who want to go, assistance must be urgently provided so older men and women and those with disabilities can reach bus and train stations and get the information and support they need on their journeys., “Support at their destinations is also vital so they can access suitable accommodation and have their medical and healthcare needs met, while navigating new surroundings. We will also work with local authorities and our partners to support new care homes in safer areas., “Whether people evacuate or not, the Russian military must avoid harming civilians and civilian infrastructure until a ceasefire is agreed so people can leave safely and those who remain can get the support they need., “Our incredible team of community volunteers and partners – many of whom are older themselves – must be able to continue to deliver food and hygiene items, as well as contact older people to provide emotional support.”, For interviews or more information, contact Lucy Brinicombe, +44 (0)7932 976478 / lucy.brinicombe@helpage.org or Susanna Flood, +44 (0)7768 233757 / susanna.flood@helpage.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-helpage-international-response-warning-people-should-flee-eastern-ukraine
Rapid Capacity Needs Assessment: Report of Oblast Military Administrations,Assessment,DRC,Coordination,8 Apr 2022,"Introduction and Background, After weeks of heightened tensions and escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine, on the 24th of February, Russian troops entered the country and started a military offensive targeting the eastern, southern, and northern oblasts of Ukraine primarily. According to the estimates of international humanitarian organisations, the conflict displaced more than ten million people, the majority of whom are displaced within Ukraine from affected eastern and northern (including Kyiv) oblasts of Ukraine. In addition to the displaced population, humanitarian organisations estimate about twelve million people in need of immediate humanitarian aid, including food, shelter, continued and safe access to medical and education services, and psychological support., The ultimate responsibility for the provision of relief to the population impacted by a humanitarian crisis rests with the Government that controls the affected territory. This also recognizes the capacity of the national, regional, and local authorities and services, as well as efforts made to alleviate needs and enhance the rights of the conflict-affected population under Government leadership prior to the military offensive. The Humanitarian Hubs (HH) established and operating under all 24 Oblasts Military Administrations (OMA)2 have been entitled to coordinate the collection and distribution of humanitarian assistance and response to other humanitarian needs caused by the consequences of the conflict escalation. The regional and local authority capacities to ensure coordination and delivery of services are overstretched, due to the high influx of new internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the east, north and southern parts of Ukraine. The disruption of essential services and significant infrastructure and economic losses are not only exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian situation but also generating critical new humanitarian needs that must be addressed urgently. It is noteworthy that up to 80% of Oblast Military Administrations have no knowledge and prior experience in responding to humanitarian crises and displacement-prone needs., This report focuses on the results of the rapid capacity needs assessment of OMAs that are on the front-line providing aid to affected people. Based on the qualitative data collected from officials working in thirteen oblasts of Ukraine, this report presents the findings on the capacity needs of OMAs and local authorities in IDP registration, humanitarian response and coordination with the Government of Ukraine, the United Nations (UN) Agencies and non-governmental humanitarian organisations, capacity gaps and relevant support needs of Humanitarian Hubs. The findings and results of the assessment will help the humanitarian community design rapid capacity building and technical assistance interventions to increase the efficiency of local actors’ humanitarian response at the regional level.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rapid-capacity-needs-assessment-report-oblast-military-administrations

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Apr 2022,"It is nearly four weeks since the start of the conflict, with 2,421 civilian casualties (925 killed, 1,496 injured) reported by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). However, the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher (OHCHR 21/03/2022). Recent days have seen significant loss of civilian life, with several buildings used as shelters being hit by bombs or shelling, the most serious being two incidents in the encircled city of Mariupol. This brief examines the situation in three cities currently under bombardment by Russian forces, including efforts to evacuate civilian populations and the humanitarian needs on the ground., Key Takeaways, ● The bombardment of cities and large towns continues. Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems and missile and airstrikes., ● Of the cities analysed in this brief, the situation in Mariupol is the most serious. Extensive damage has occurred in civilian areas as highlighted recently by media analysis and drone footage (New York Times 20/03/2022, The Guardian 19/03/2022). Therefore, there are many civilian casualties and consequently a need for urgent medical support, including trauma care., ● Across Ukraine, there are critical humanitarian needs for those living in urban areas where bombardments are taking place. This is partly due to widespread damage to civilian infrastructure affecting essential services such as electricity, heating and clean water, and critically, the disruption of access to food and health care., ● Without the establishment of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones, the situation for many will continue to deteriorate. Particularly worrying is whether the catastrophic conditions currently occurring in Mariupol will be repeated in other cities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-analysis-brief-humanitarian-impact-cities-under-bombardment-21-march

Health centres in the areas most heavily affected by conflict, and where needs are therefore most acute have tended to experience the worst damage. In addition, information from these areas is limited so current figures are likely to be an underrepresentation of the actual situation., ● Disruption of health services, large-scale displacement and the necessity to prioritise trauma treatment are all negatively impacting the treatment of long-term conditions such as diabetes, cancer and HIV. These factors and the limited access to health services due to conflict can all result in indirect deaths., ● Medical supplies across many parts of Ukraine are running low, especially in conflict-affected areas as access to many locations remains blocked. A critical shortage of oxygen is also a major concern and will have an impact on the ability to treat patients with COVID-19 and many other conditions., ● The risk of outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, COVID-19 and measles are being exacerbated due to a lack of clean drinking water, crowded conditions in collective centres and bomb shelters as well as underlying conditions such as low vaccination rates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-conflict-analysis-brief-impact-conflict-health-sector-04-april-2022

Russia’s defence ministry denied the accusation, claiming Russia’s armed forces don’t use the Tochka-U missile found at the site and had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on the day., According to AOAV data on civilian casualties in Ukraine since the invasion began, Russia has used explosive weapons on numerous locations with high concentrations of civilians such as urban residential areas and villages, as well as hospitals, schools, and transport related infrastructure., Particularly shocking examples include the Russian airstrike on a theatre in Mariupol, Donetsk, where hundreds of civilians were sheltering from violence in the city. 300 people are believed to have died in the attack, many of whom were women and children., AOAV has recorded 60 strikes on urban residential areas, resulting in 472 civilian casualties, and 37 strikes on villages, resulting in at least 248 civilian casualties. There have been at least six incidents of Russian explosive weapon use on hospitals and healthcare facilities since 24 Feb 2022, killing 67 civilians and injuring 34 more.

And with energy prices rising in parallel with food prices, ""the purchasing power of vulnerable consumers and countries has further decreased,"" Qu said., Today's high fertilizer prices, meanwhile, could lead to lower fertilizer use next season and possibly beyond, with the real prospect of a drop in food productivity leading to even higher food prices., ""This would potentially result in even more undernourished people in 2022 and months to come,"" Qu warned., Supply disruptions, Russia and Ukraine together account for nearly 30 percent of global wheat exports and about 80 percent of global sunflower exports. Russia is the largest exporter of fertilizers., This means that supply disruptions in these two countries will be felt across global agrifood systems, the Director-General warned., While the supply situation on global food markets is tight and there are reasons for concern, there is also evidence that the current problems can be contained, and that a global food crisis like the one seen in 2008 can be averted, Qu said., That will depend on avoiding a repeat of the mistakes made in 2008, when ""counter-productive policies"" on trade were imposed., “The major difference from 2008 is that today we are facing the big risk that our planting season for next year will be drastically affected - in 2008 the shock was due to a drought and did not put at risk the next planting season,” Qu said., ""We must not shut down our global trade system, and exports should not be restricted or taxed.”, Additional concrete proposals by FAO include:, FAO's work on the ground, FAO has stepped up its efforts significantly since the outbreak of the Ukrainian conflict, reinforcing its team on the ground and publishing a series of crucial data., Preliminary information points to a worsening trend in food security, especially in areas with active ongoing fighting and with the highest numbers of displaced people (up to 15 percent of the total population). Some 20 percent of households lack cash to meet their basic food needs, with destocking of small farm animals, and in some cases large ruminants. In terms of agricultural production, data indicates limited availability of critical agricultural inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, equipment, fuel, and livestock supplies, arising from a combination of logistic and financial issues., An updated Rapid Response Plan for May-December 2022, with a funding request of 115 million dollars, is focusing on maintaining food production, supporting agrifood supply chains, and coordinating the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, in particular through continued assessments of food security, markets and value chains., ""Let us work together today in an efficient, coherent and technical manner to ensure better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all, leaving no one behind – now, more than ever,"" Qu said., More details on today's Council session can be found here",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-world-can-still-contain-impact-global-food-security-right-polices-fao
"FAO Complementary Information Note The impact of the war in Ukraine on rural labour markets (April 2, 2022)",Analysis,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",2 Apr 2022,"Key considerations and entry points for the promotion of decent rural employment in the recovery phase, Since 2014, the armed conflict in the Eastern areas of Donetska and Luhanska has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, affecting the livelihoods of the people living in these areas, those displaced by the conflict, as well as those living in other areas of the country. Economic opportunities and labour markets have been strongly affected by the conflict, with the conflict-affected regions presenting the highest unemployment rates in the country since 2015 (15.7 percent in Donetska and 16.6 percent in Luhanska, against 10.3 percent nationally in the second quarter of 2021), as well as the COVID-19 pandemic [1]., Rural households in the areas close to this conflict have also been affected particularly hard by the situation in the region [1,2]. The current war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation will pose additional threats and negatively impact Ukraine’s rural labour markets, potentially affecting rural households and populations’ livelihoods through multiple pathways. This short note provides a brief overview of rural labour markets and decent rural employment indicators in Ukraine before the onset of the war; briefly reviews potential impacts of the war on decent rural employment in Ukraine; and suggests a few recommendations on how the promotion of decent rural employment can potentially contribute to the recovery phase.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-complementary-information-note-impact-war-ukraine-rural-labour-markets-april-2
UNHCR redoubles its aid inside Ukraine and the region,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Apr 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today’s press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., The war in Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest-growing displacement and humanitarian crises ever. Within six weeks, more than 4.3 million refugees have fled the country, while a further 7.1 million are displaced internally., As people continue to flee, UNHCR is working closely with local authorities in Ukraine to increase reception capacity. More core relief items are being distributed to reception and collective centres set up by the local authorities to expand their capacity to receive more IDPs. Our team is also working with the authorities in various locations to identify buildings needing refurbishment to serve as reception or collective centres., Delivering aid remains challenging in the parts of the country where there is active fighting. We continue striving to reach hard-hit areas such as Mariupol and Kherson with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys and have contributed to four such convoys under the humanitarian notification system: two to Sumy, one to Kharkiv and one to Sieverodonetsk, and delivered several additional convoys with the help of partners, reaching 15,600 people with relief items., The latest such convoy was on 6 April, where UNHCR was among those carrying aid to Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. For weeks, people there have endured relentless shelling and shortages of basics like water, gas and electricity. Our team was able to deliver solar lamps, blankets, hygiene kits, baby formula and tarpaulin sheets to 3,000 people., UNHCR with NGO partners continues providing protection services and referrals to authorities at border points and reception centres. Some 36,000 people have received such assistance and information at border points, transit, and reception centres and through hotlines. These services include legal assistance and psychosocial support among other things. UNHCR also provides protection services closer to conflict hotspots, at first points of arrival. UNHCR’s partners are still present with a significant protection capacity in Donetsk and Luhansk, while in other areas directly exposed to hostilities, connections with communities established before the war have been reinforced, particularly in the Zaporizhzhia, ensuring the distribution of aid., UNHCR is also continuing to send humanitarian supplies into Ukraine from Poland. To date, 96 UNHCR aid trucks have been sent from our warehouse in Rzeszow, to help displaced and conflict affected people inside Ukraine. Supplies include blankets, hygiene kits, tarpaulins; solar lamps; shelter kits, sleeping bags; bedding, jerry cans; kitchen sets; winter clothing and Rubb halls., Poland remains the main country of arrival for refugees, having welcomed more than 2.5 million since the start of the war. While the pace of arrivals is slowing, overall flows continue given the ongoing hostilities. UNHCR staff have observed that newly arrived refugees are coming from various parts of the country, including the east, with some reporting having spent weeks hunkering down at home or in shelters in dire conditions., The priority needs identified by UNHCR for refugees receiving counselling at the UNHCR-UNICEF Blue Dot protection hub in Warsaw include mental health and medical services, financial assistance, child protection and social services, accommodation and access to employment., In Poland, Ukrainian refugees have access to a Polish state ID number (PESEL). Over 700,000 Ukrainian refugees have registered with the authorities, allowing them access to health and other social support from the state; 94 per cent of those registered are women and children., To enable refugees to prioritize their most critical needs, and to complement the national authority-led response in Poland, UNHCR is expanding cash assistance. More than 10,000 people have registered in Warsaw over the past fortnight. UNHCR opened a second centre in Krakow this week. Additional enrolment sites are opening soon in partnership with the state and national NGOs., On 1 March, UNHCR launched the initial Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP), calling for $550.6 million. Since then, under UNHCR coordination, inter-agency teams have been working on developing a fuller RRP reflecting current needs, and that will be detailed later in April. The revised RRP will cover 10 months (March – December 2022) and is expected to bring together 110 partners including over 50 local NGOs, faith-based organizations and academia., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-redoubles-its-aid-inside-ukraine-and-region

Kherson, Poltava, Dnipro, Odesa and Ternopil regions. On 2 April, Ukrainian forces reclaimed control of the north-west area of the Kyiv region. Iryna Venediktova, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine, reported that from 1 to 3 April, a number of civilian bodies had been found in cities occupied by the Russian Federation and were being delivered for forensic examination. The Parliament of Ukraine has addressed the international community on the topic of acknowledging potential war crimes committed by the Russian Federation in Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel and other cities and villages of Ukraine., OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 5 April, there have been 3,776 civilian casualties, including 1,563 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., Continued fighting across the country has exacerbated protection risks for the most vulnerable. While exposure to such risks, including sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), and human trafficking, continues to rise, access to related protection services is becoming increasingly difficult., Operational state-run services have largely shifted their focus away from addressing gender-based violence (GBV) to addressing the needs of IDPs, while service providers still addressing GBV face critical shortages in both human and financial resources. Demand for these services is rapidly increasing, with the breakdown of referral pathways, widening gaps in service provision, and limited access to life-saving information., IOM continues to be particularly concerned about the steadily rising internal and cross-border displacement as a result of the war. Between 24 March and 1 April, IOM carried out the second round of its rapid assessment on internal displacement, mobility flows and associated needs across Ukraine. As of 1 April, approximately 7.1 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine – around 16 per cent of the country’s population – an increase of over 660,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) since 18 March. From 1-3 April, the Government of Ukraine reported that nearly 13,180 people had been evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, including just over 2,000 people from Mariupol, nearly 1,170 from southeastern Zaporizka oblast, and more than 5,850 from Luhansk oblast.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-13-7-april-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Apr 2022,"Supporting agricultural production to bolster food availability and access, Apr 2022, The war in Ukraine that began on 24 February 2022 has led to large scale human suffering across all regions of the country. As the dynamics of the war continue to evolve, large portions of the population are affected by damage to critical infrastructure, lack of basic services and disruptions of supply chains, requiring multisectoral humanitarian assistance., In order to address the rapidly deteriorating food security situation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has updated its Rapid Response Plan (RRP) for Ukraine, calling for a revised funding requirement of USD 115.4 million, to support 327 209 vulnerable smallholder and medium sized farming households through December 2022., The RRP has been designed to meet critical, time-sensitive agricultural deadlines for production and harvest, and address market functionality and access for vulnerable populations. It is anticipated that the RRP will be followed by a continuing programme based on the evolution of the crisis., Overview, The war in Ukraine that began on 24 February 2022 has led to large‑scale human suffering across all regions of the country. As the dynamics of the war continue to evolve, large portions of the population are affected by damage to critical infrastructure, lack of basic services and disruptions of supply chains, requiring multisectoral humanitarian assistance., In order to address the rapidly deteriorating food security situation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed a Rapid Response Plan (RRP) to provide life‑ and livelihood‑saving interventions to support the most vulnerable smallholder and medium‑sized farming households through 2022., The Government of Ukraine has requested FAO to support vulnerable producers through the provision of cash and agricultural inputs, and to support maintenance of overall access to critical markets. FAO will continue to lead strong inter-agency coordination, working with government and Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster (FSLC) partners to ensure that response activities complement those carried out by other actors., FAO’s technical capacity in the areas of livestock and crop production, and leadership on agriculture, food systems transformation and livelihood support, has enabled the Organization to identify inputs that can bolster the production of targeted producers and, therefore, safeguard food security across the country in 2022 and into 2023. With spring planting ongoing, and the harvest of winter wheat likely to be disrupted, farmers need urgent support to meet agricultural deadlines and maintain production. In addition, commercial livestock producers lack physical and/or economic access to animal feed and veterinary medicines, which are crucial to livestock survival and production. This will enable producers to feed supply chains and markets at the current level. Shortages of fuel and liquidity are significant barriers to maintaining production., This RRP is a revision of the initial RRP that was issued by FAO in March.
It responds to the worsening food security situation and the limited availability of critical agricultural inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, equipment, fuel and livestock supplies, arising from a combination of logistical and financial factors., FAO requires USD 115.4 million, increasing its initial request of USD 50 million, to support 327 209 households (981 627 people) through December 2022. FAO will utilize a programmatic approach to implement the RRP whereby individual contributions from resource partners add to the overall achievements of the programme.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-ukraine-rapid-response-plan-march-december-2022-revised-version

"Atrocity Alert No. 295: Ukraine, Venezuela and Nigeria",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,6 Apr 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., RUSSIAN RETREAT REVEALS MASSACRE OF CIVILIANS IN BUCHA, UKRAINE, Following the retreat of Russian forces from the suburbs of Kyiv, Ukraine, at the end of March, reports emerged of hundreds of civilian casualties in previously Russian-occupied areas. Ukrainian authorities have identified the bodies of at least 410 men, women and children in the town of Bucha, many of which were buried in mass graves while others were discovered slain in the street. Reports of targeted killings of civilians in other previously occupied suburbs have also started to emerge. The targeted killing of civilians is forbidden under international law and may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., On 5 April Liz Throssell, Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, cited the horrifying images of people with their hands bound and bodies of women discovered naked and partially burned, stating that, “this is extremely disturbing, and does really strongly suggest that they were directly targeted as individuals… and directly killed.” Throssell stressed that, “it’s hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned.”, Russian officials have denied that any civilians were harmed in their military operations and asserted that the bodies in Bucha were placed there after their retreat. Satellite images and video footage examined by The New York Times, along with eyewitness testimony, provide evidence to the contrary. Since 24 February the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented at least 1,563 civilian deaths, including 130 children, while asserting the real toll is much higher., UN Secretary-General António Guterres joined the international condemnation of the killings in Bucha, as well as calls for independent investigations and accountability. He also echoed his previous warnings regarding the global impact of the war, stating, “I deeply regret the divisions that have prevented the Security Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but on other threats to peace and security around the world. I urge the Council to do everything in its power to end the war and to mitigate its impact, both on the suffering people of Ukraine, and on vulnerable people and developing countries around the world.”, ICC’S CHIEF PROSECUTOR ANNOUNCES OPENING OF A COUNTRY OFFICE IN VENEZUELA, On 31 March, the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, announced the opening of a country office in Caracas, Venezuela, to advance justice for possible crimes against humanity. During November 2021 the Chief Prosecutor opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity and signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Venezuelan government, in which President Nicolás Maduro agreed to “adopt all necessary measures to ensure the effective administration of justice.”, Since 2014 Venezuelan security and intelligence forces have been accused of widespread torture, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances in an attempt to silence political dissent. State agents have also allegedly perpetrated thousands of extrajudicial killings in the name of combatting crime. The UN Human Rights Council (HRC)-mandated Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) on Venezuela reported in September 2020 that serious human rights violations and abuses were authorized at the highest level of government and committed as part of a “widespread and systematic attack” against the civilian population that may amount to crimes against humanity., Although the government has announced measures to address structural impunity in recent months, it has failed to investigate all perpetrators within the security and intelligence forces, including those at higher levels in the chain of command. In September 2021 the FFM warned that Venezuela’s judicial system has contributed to ongoing state violence by perpetuating impunity and facilitating ongoing crimes against humanity, in line with previously identified patterns of serious violations and abuses. The FFM further reported to the HRC on 18 March that “domestic investigations, when conducted, are limited in scope and target low-level, material perpetrators.” The FFM stated that “the lack of disaggregated data and key information on the crimes charged or the rank or level of responsibility of the perpetrators continues to be an obstacle to assessing the State’s real efforts to investigate and prosecute” systematic violations and abuses., A formal presence of the Office of the Chief Prosecutor in Caracas provides a vital and important opportunity for the ICC to directly engage with victims and their relatives, as well as with civil society organizations monitoring and documenting ongoing state-led repression. Elisabeth Pramendorfer, Senior Human Rights Office at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, added that, “it also signals that despite significant efforts by the government to publicly claim a willingness to investigate alleged atrocity crimes and minimize international scrutiny, the domestic system remains ill-equipped to ensure accountability for victims who have been denied justice for so long. As long as high-level state authorities are not held to account, the risk of atrocity crimes in Venezuela persists.”, NEW SPATE OF ATTACKS BY SUSPECTED BANDITS IN NORTH-WEST NIGERIA, On Monday, 28 March, armed men attacked a passenger train traveling between Abuja and Kaduna in northern Nigeria, killing at least eight people. Survivors reported that two explosions derailed the train before armed men surrounded the carriages and opened fire. An estimated 168 passengers remain unaccounted for and are believed to be kidnapped. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari strongly condemned the incident, calling it a callous attack on “a safe means of transport to many.”, While the Kaduna State government has thus far been unable to identify the men responsible for this attack, reports indicate it may have been perpetrated by armed groups commonly referred to as “bandits.” Violent activity by armed bandits has been growing in north-west Nigeria in recent months, including deadly incidents in October and November in Sokoto State and during January in Zamfara State. Last week’s incident marked the second attack against the Abuja-Kaduna rail line since October 2021. Three days earlier, armed men also launched an attack on Kaduna International Airport. These attacks demonstrate a dangerous tactical shift by alleged bandits, which is instilling fear and increasing insecurity for civilian populations., Many of the armed bandit groups have been formed in the past decade in response to growing inter-communal conflict over land and resources. While these groups are driven largely by criminal motives, their activities have exacerbated ethnic tensions as many bandits are ethnic Fulani and prey on settled farming communities. Violence between herding and farming communities has become increasingly deadly as armed groups and gangs engage in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape. At least 4,900 people were killed in such violence between 2018-2020 and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in north-west Nigeria., In an attempt to curb armed banditry, since September 2021 the Nigerian government has deployed a large number of troops to north-west Nigeria, cut off communication networks and imposed restrictions on movement in affected areas. Despite the government’s claim that it is defeating armed bandit groups, attacks against civilians continue unabated. President Buhari has urged the military to “deal ruthlessly with terrorists,” asserting that, “anyone found unlawfully wielding an AK 47 should not be spared!”, The government of Nigeria needs to urgently protect populations by investing in advanced security surveillance equipment, including on perimeter fences of airports and along train tracks. The government should also undertake efforts to comprehensively tackle the root causes of armed banditry, including endemic poverty, corruption, youth unemployment and environmental degradation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-295-ukraine-venezuela-and-nigeria
Ukraine: Russian forces extrajudicially executing civilians in apparent war crimes – new testimony,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,7 Apr 2022,"Russian military forces have extrajudicially executed civilians in Ukraine in apparent war crimes, Amnesty International said today as it published new testimony following on-the-ground research., Amnesty International’s Crisis Response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns close to Kyiv, several of whom had witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence committed by Russian forces., They repeatedly told of deliberate killings, unlawful violence, and widespread intimidation by Russian forces against unarmed civilians across the Kyiv region., “In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International., “Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality., “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.”, To date, Amnesty International has obtained evidence that civilians were killed in indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblast, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol., ‘They shot him in the head’, One 46-year-old woman, from the village of Bohdanivka, said Russian forces entered her village on 7 or 8 March, and parked their tanks on the streets., In the evening of 9 March, the woman – who lived with her husband, 10-year-old daughter and mother-in-law – heard shooting through their downstairs windows. She and her husband shouted that they were civilians, and that they were unarmed. When they came downstairs, two Russian soldiers pushed them and their daughter into a boiler room., She told Amnesty International: “They forced us in and slammed the door. After just a minute they opened the door, they asked my husband if he had cigarettes. He said no, he hadn’t smoked for a couple of weeks. They shot him in his right arm. The other said, ‘Finish him,’ and they shot him in the head., “He didn’t die right away. From 9.30pm to 4am he was still breathing, though he wasn’t conscious. I begged him… ’If you can hear me, please move your finger’. He didn’t move his finger, but I put his hand on my knee and squeezed it. Blood was flowing out of him. When he took his last breath, I turned to my daughter and said, ‘It seems daddy has died’.”, A neighbour witnessed Russian forces breaking into the woman’s house that night, and confirmed he had seen her husband’s body slumped in the corner of the boiler room. The woman and her child escaped from Bohdanivka later that day. The woman’s mother-in-law, aged 81, has limited mobility and was left behind., ‘My father had six large holes in his back’, On 3 March, Kateryna Tkachova, 18, was at home in the village of Vorzel with her parents when several tanks displaying the letter ‘Z’ – which Russian forces have used to mark their vehicles during the invasion of Ukraine – were driven down their street., Her mother Nataliya and father Valeryi left the cellar where they were hiding to go into the street, after telling Katerina to stay where she was. Kateryna then heard gunshots., She told Amnesty International: “Once the tanks had passed by, I jumped over the fence to the neighbour’s house. I wanted to check if they’re alive. I looked over the fence and saw my mother lying on her back on one side of the road, and my father was face down on the other side of the street. I saw large holes in his coat. The next day I went to them. My father had six large holes in his back, my mother had a smaller hole in her chest.”, Kateryna said that her parents were dressed in civilian clothing and unarmed. On 10 March, a volunteer involved in evacuations from areas around Kyiv helped Kateryna leave Vorzel. The volunteer told Amnesty International he had seen the bodies of Kateryna’s parents lying in the street near her house. In a video verified by Amnesty International, the pair can be seen writing Kateryna’s parents’ names, dates of birth, and dates of death on a piece of cardboard, before placing it beside their bodies, which are covered with blankets., ‘They noticed us and immediately opened fire’, During the first days of Russian occupation of the city of Hostomel, Taras Kuzmak was driving around delivering food and medication to bomb shelters where civilians were gathering., At 1.30pm on 3 March, he was with the city’s mayor, Yuryi Prylypko, and two other men, when their car came under gunfire from the direction of a large residential complex that had been seized by Russian forces. The men tried to jump out of the car, but one man, Ivan Zorya, was killed immediately, while Yuryi Prylypko fell to the ground injured after being shot. Taras Kuzmak and the other surviving man hid behind an excavator for hours as shooting continued., He told Amnesty International: “They noticed us and immediately opened fire, there was no warning. I could only hear the mayor [Prylypko]. I knew he was injured, but I didn’t know if it was fatal or not. I just told him to lie still, not to make any moves… They shot at us again at around 3pm, and about half-an-hour after that, I understood there was no life from him. There is a kind of breathing somebody has only right before they die, their last breath. Ivan Zorya’s head was taken off, I think they must have been using something high-calibre.”, Two other Hostomel residents told Amnesty International they had seen Yuryi Prylypko’s body near a church when an impromptu funeral was held for him several days later. Other residents confirmed that in the days leading up to his death, Yuryi Prylypko had been delivering food and medication around the city, always driving a civilian vehicle., Unlawful killings and rape, Amnesty International collected three additional accounts of unlawful killings of civilians, including the account of a survivor of rape whose husband was extrajudicially executed, by Russian forces., A woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty International that, on 9 March, two Russian soldiers had entered her house, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. The woman was able to escape from the village to Ukrainian-controlled territory with her son., Milena, a 24-year-old from Bucha, told Amnesty International that she saw the body of a woman who had lived on her street lying outside her house. The woman’s mother told Milena that her daughter was shot in the initial days of the invasion while looking over her fence at a Russian military vehicle. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab independently verified video footage that confirmed the location of the shallow grave in which she was buried., Volodymyr Zakhliupanyy and his wife fled the city of Hostomel in the first few days of the invasion, but their son Serhiy, 39, was determined to stay., Initially, they spoke by telephone every day, and Serhiy described the heavy fighting in the city. On 4 March, Volodymyr could no longer contact his son. Friends who remained in the city then tried to find Serhiy, and went to the building where he had been sheltering in the basement., Volodymyr told Amnesty International: “When they asked the neighbours, they said that on 13 March my son was taken away [from the basement] by the Russians. When they went looking for Serhiy, they found him behind the garages of the same building… they said he had been shot in the head.”, Life under Russian occupation, Interviewees told Amnesty International they had lost access to electricity, water, and gas in the early days of the invasion, and there was very limited access to food. There was little mobile phone connectivity, and some interviewees said Russian soldiers had confiscated or destroyed mobile phones whenever they saw residents carrying them, or threatened them with violence for having a phone., Threats of violence and intimidation were also widespread. One man in Hostomel said that he saw an entire dormitory of people who were sheltering from shelling who were forced to go outside, where Russian military officers immediately fired gunshots over their heads, forcing them to drop to the ground. Two men from Bucha also said snipers regularly shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home., “As these horrendous accounts of life under Russian occupation continue to emerge, the victims in Ukraine must know that the international community is determined to secure accountability for their suffering,” said Agnès Callamard., War crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law, Deliberate killings of civilians, rape, torture, and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war are human rights violations and war crimes. Those who directly commit war crimes should be held criminally responsible for them. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, hierarchal superiors – including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers and heads of state – who knew or had reason to know about war crimes committed by their forces, but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible, should also be held criminally responsible., Amnesty International is documenting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the war in Ukraine.

Swiss food shipment reaches Odesa,News and Press Release,SDC,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",8 Apr 2022,"Switzerland is organising a series of food deliveries for the suffering civilian population in Ukraine. Yesterday, a transport reached Odesa, a city of over a million inhabitants, which needs to organise sufficient food reserves to sustain the nutrition of the population. The SDC's humanitarian aid deliveries are made at the request of the local authorities., Switzerland has launched a series of aid shipments for the needy population in Ukraine. In cooperation with her Ukrainian partner Astarta-Kyiv, yesterday Switzerland handed over a first consignment of oil, sugar, flour, corn and powdered milk purchased on the Ukrainian market. This action was taken at the request of the authorities of the city of Odesa, who are working on establishing strategic reserves to ensure food distribution to vulnerable population in case of a potential blockade of the city., The delivery of the food was welcomed by the Mayor of Odesa in the presence of a team from the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA). Since last week, an SHA team from Moldova had travelled to Ukraine several times to prepare a series of deliveries amounting to 1400 tons of food products for Odesa in cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities., The actions of the SDC's Humanitarian Aid, which is affiliated to the FDFA, come at a time when the situation in Ukraine is deteriorating. The United Nations estimates the number of people in need of assistance throughout the country at twelve million. The fighting has forced more than 7.2 million people to seek refuge in other parts of Ukraine. Several regions are at risk of food insecurity. Millions of people face shortages of water, food, medical care and electricity due to attacks on civilian infrastructure., Address for enquiries:, FDFA Communication

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, On 7 April, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (USG/ERC) Martin Griffiths visited the hard-hit settlements of Bucha and Irpin outside of Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north). USG/ERC also met with the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kyiv., As of 7 April, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have reached more than 2.1 million people with critical multi-sectoral assistance, including over 716,000 people in Kharkivska oblast (east), more than 362,000 in Kyivska oblast, and over 242,000 people in Lvivska oblast (west)., As of 6 April, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) has delivered almost 3,000 tons of humanitarian aid across Ukraine, reaching more than 400,000 people., Between 31 March and 4 April, 20 trains with more than 3,205 tons of essential relief items arrived in Ukraine from the European Union (EU)., On the morning of 8 April, a railway station in Kramatorsk (Donetska oblast, east) came under attack, reportedly resulting in at least 130 civilian casualties, according to oblast authorities and the National Police. In response, the UN Crisis Coordinator in Ukraine, Amin Awad, issued a statement calling for an immediate investigation into the attack and adequate security conditions allowing civilians to safely evacuate from the hardest-hit areas., So far this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that almost two-thirds of all attacks on health care (103), three-quarters of all health attack-related deaths (73) and more than two-thirds of related injuries (51) worldwide have taken place in Ukraine., IMPACT Initiatives’ Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) shows that eastern Donetska, Kharkivska, eastern Luhanska and south-eastern Zaporizka oblasts have been most affected in terms of damage and destruction to educational facilities. Of the 928 damaged or destroyed education facilities across the country reported by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, around 400 – more than 43 per cent – are located in these four oblasts., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. During the reporting period, hostilities intensified in eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts and in southern Khersonska oblast. The security situation in the northern part of the country is reportedly improving following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine has already started clearing explosive ordnance in areas around Kyiv. At the same time, community services are working on removing the debris of shattered buildings, damaged vehicles and military equipment from the streets of hard-hit settlements surrounding Kyiv, including Irpin. As residents started returning to the capital and surrounding areas, the Mayor of Kyiv urged residents to temporarily hold off on returning to their communities, fearing that hostilities may return to the country’s capital., On 7 April, together with Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Olha Stefanishyna, USG/ERC Martin Griffiths visited Bucha and Irpin – settlements on the outskirts of Kyiv that recently witnessed some of the fiercest fighting across the country. According to the mayors of Bucha and Irpin, at least 320 people were killed in Bucha and between 200 and 300 people in Irpin. Additionally, scores of homes and other civilian infrastructure were destroyed in both settlements as a result of intense military clashes. During the visit, USG/ERC Martin Griffiths echoed the UN Secretary-General’s call for an immediate, independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability. USG/ERC also met with the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, Minister of Defense and the First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in Kyiv to discuss the humanitarian response and humanitarian pauses for delivery of aid and evacuation of civilians, among other issues., The civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive continues to grow. As of 7 April, the number of civilian casualties stands at 3,893 – including 1,626 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,604 casualties – including 499 killed and 1,105 injured – compared to 330 civilian casualties in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 263 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 2,289 civilian casualties., These figures are likely much higher as increased access into some of the hardest-hit areas reveals the magnitude of civilian casualties while fighting rages on in other locations. Following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces from northern Ukraine, including Kyivska oblast, OHCHR plans to carry out an assessment mission in the worst-affected areas around Kyiv, hoping to shed light on the actual number of civilian casualties., Needs assessment in GCA of eastern Ukraine. Between 22 and 28 March, IMPACT Initiatives conducted a RNA to get an overview of the humanitarian situation in affected settlements in the four Government-controlled eastern oblasts (Donetska, Kharkivska, Luhanska and Zaporizka). Concerns about security were reported in all assessed settlements. In 75 per cent of assessed settlements, damage to homes was reported, and in 88 per cent, the level of damage to critical civilian infrastructure, such as schools, industrial facilities and health facilities, was a concern. Movement restrictions were reported in 94 per cent of settlements, with movement in and out of settlements significantly or completely restricted in 33 per cent of the cases, including Izium (Kharkivska oblast), Mariupol (Donetska oblast), Popasna, Rubizhne, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast)., Amongst all assessed settlements, access to medication, disruption to children’s well-being, and disruption to transportation and/or fuel supply were concerns affecting people’s everyday lives. In addition to Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast) and Mariupol, settlements with elevated needs for assistance include Izium, Lysychansk (Luhanska oblast), Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk, where needs were widely reported across all sectors. Most of the assessed settlements (75 per cent) reported a preference for in-kind assistance, likely due to the inaccessibility of both food and non-food items. The delivery of aid via humanitarian convoys is considered as the best method for sending assistance to Izium, Konstantinivka (Donetska oblast), Lysychansk, Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk. According to RNA findings, road and rail transportation for the delivery of assistance could be used in other assessed areas., Disruption to utilities was reported as a concern in 44 per cent of settlements. Of those, 71 per cent reported a lack of heating on at least a daily basis, while 57 per cent reported daily disruptions to electricity and 50 per cent reported daily disruptions to gas. Izium, Kramatorsk, Lysychansk, Mariupol, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk had no heating at the time of data collection. According to the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, as of 7 April, more than 764,000 users in over 1,165 settlements across Ukraine were without electricity, while some 304,000 users across the country remained without gas supply., Laws-of-war violations. According to Amnesty International, the Russian Federation forces have allegedly extrajudicially executed civilians in apparent laws-of-war violations. A team of Amnesty International Crisis Response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns on the outskirts of Kyiv, many of whom had witnessed or had direct knowledge of violence reportedly committed by the Russian Federation forces. Interviewees told investigators about cases of deliberate killings, unlawful violence, including rape, and widespread intimidation by the Russian Federation forces against unarmed civilians across Kyivska oblast. Earlier, between 27 February and 14 March, Human Rights Watch documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north), Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital, including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia.], Eastern Ukraine continues to be the epicentre of the ongoing military offensive, with clashes in Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts intensifying and resulting in multiple civilian casualties as well as damages to critical civilian infrastructure. Several settlements in Luhanska oblast, including Hirske, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Novodruzhesk, Novozvanivka, Popasna, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Toshkivka and Zolote, continue to experience relentless shelling, driving significant humanitarian needs. Civilians continue to come under attack while waiting in queues to receive humanitarian aid. On 6 April, Luhanska oblast police informed that a humanitarian aid distribution centre came under fire, wounding at least five people standing in the queue. This and other similar incidents raise concerns about the possibility of distributing aid in the hardest-hit locations without putting the lives of both civilians and humanitarian workers at risk., In Donetska oblast, heavy fighting reportedly continues in Avdiivka, Donetsk, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Marinka, Novomyhailivka, Sloviansk and Vuhledar, as well as in Ochertynska and Toretska hromadas (communities). Another incident affecting civilians queueing to receive humanitarian aid occurred in Vuhledar on 6 April. At least four people were reportedly killed and four others injured while standing in line at the humanitarian aid distribution centre., Kramatorsk. On the morning of 8 April, a railway station in Kramatorsk came under attack, reportedly resulting in at least 130 civilian casualties, according to oblast authorities and the National Police. The attack took place as hundreds of people waited to board evacuation trains en route to western Ukraine that were forced to stop in Kramatorsk while railway tracks reportedly damaged on the night of 7-8 April were repaired. In response, the UN Crisis Coordinator in Ukraine, Amin Awad, issued a statement calling for an immediate investigation into the attack and adequate security conditions allowing civilians to safely evacuate from the hardest-hit areas., Mariupol. Humanitarian consequences of the ongoing fighting in Mariupol are particularly grave. According to Mariupol’s Mayor, Vadym Boichenko, at least 5,000 people have been killed, including around 210 children, during the past month. As a result of the bombing of one of the city’s hospitals in mid-March, local authorities estimate that at least 50 people have been burned alive. In addition, the Mayor says that 90 per cent of city’s infrastructure has been destroyed, with 40 per cent damaged beyond repair, including at least 2,340 multi-storey apartment buildings and 61,200 homes., In Kharkivska oblast, relentless shelling, airstrikes and missile attacks continue to batter the city of Kharkiv and surrounding areas, like Balakliia, Izium and Lozova. On 7 April, 15 civilian casualties (one killed and 14 injured) were reported in Kharkiv alone. Amid ongoing clashes, oblast authorities continue to urge residents in Barvinkove and Lozova to evacuate., Civilian evacuations. On 6 and 7 April, the Government of Ukraine reported that more than 9,560 people were reportedly evacuated through agreed-upon corridors. According to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine, more than 4,675 people were reportedly evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors on 7 April, including 1,420 people from eastern Luhanska oblast (Kreminna, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk), 1,205 from Mariupol and 2,050 from south-eastern Zaporizka oblast (Berdiansk, Melitopol, Polohy and Vasylivka)., Furthermore, after being blocked at a civilian checkpoint in the town of Manhush (Donetska oblast), a convoy of seven buses accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which had intended to evacuate people from Mariupol, was forced to turn back. Still, the convoy managed to pick up residents of Mariupol, who earlier escaped to the town of Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast), as well as residents of Berdiansk to transport them to Government-controlled Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast). On 6 April, the convoy safely arrived in Zaporizhzhia, transporting more than 500 civilians., Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported that more than 677,750 people, including 131,706 children, have crossed to the Russian Federation from the territory of Ukraine since 24 February. This includes the 19,612 people, including 3,356 children, whom the Russian Federation reportedly evacuated on 7 April.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-8-april-2022

Ukraine: UN relief chief joins call for probe after ‘horrifying’ visit to Bucha,News and Press Release,UN News,"Health

WHO records 100th attack on health care in Ukraine,News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Apr 2022,"L'viv / Geneva, 7 April 2022, A grim milestone has been crossed today in the war in Ukraine – more than 100 attacks on health care verified by WHO since the start of the war on February 24. The attacks so far have claimed 73 lives and injured 51., Of the current total of 103 attacks, 89 have impacted health facilities and 13 have impacted transport, including ambulances., “We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing. Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, at a press conference. “Peace is the only way forward. I again call on the Russian Federation to stop the war.”, “It’s a truly sad irony that we are recording this milestone of over 100 attacks on health in Ukraine on World Health Day,” noted Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe who visited the humanitarian hub of Lviv in western Ukraine today. “I have been personally struck by the resilience and fortitude of health care providers and indeed of the health system itself in Ukraine. WHO has been working to ensure supply lines remain open to allow lifesaving health and medical supplies to reach cities and towns nationwide, and continued attacks on health make this effort all the more challenging.”, This milestone of over 100 attacks on health spans barely 42 days since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. The impact of this violence is not only immediate, in the numbers of deaths and injuries – but also long-term in the consequences for Ukraine’s health care system. It’s a major blow to the country’s efforts to institute health reforms and achieve universal health coverage, a goal it had made significant progress on before the war erupted., “Across Ukraine, 1000 health facilities are in proximity to conflict areas or in changed areas of control,” explained Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine “Health workers throughout the country are risking their lives to serve those in need of medical services, and they, and their patients, must never be targeted. Further, when people are prevented from seeking and accessing health care, either because the facilities have been destroyed or out of fear that they may become a target, they lose hope. The mental health toll wreaked by the war cannot be underestimated, affecting civilians and the health workforce alike."", Attacks on health are unfortunately seen amid conflicts globally. Since 1 January 2022, WHO has verified 160 attacks on health care in 11 countries and territories resulting in 97 deaths and 74 injuries. Outside of Ukraine at this time, Sudan is also witnessing a recent increase in attacks on health care., ENDS, eupress@who.int, mediainquiries@who.int, Notes to the editor, What’s the definition of an attack on health?, An attack on health care is any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services. Types of attacks vary across contexts and can range from physical violence, psychosocial threats and intimidation to use of heavy weaponry against healthcare facilities., Attacks on health care include attacks on health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses., What’s WHO’s role?, WHO has been tasked by WHA to monitor and disseminate reports on attacks on health (WHA Resolution 65.20)., Our Attacks on Health Care initiative aims to strengthen protection for health workers everywhere so they can provide healthcare in a safe environment without disruption from acts of violence. The initiative has three main pillars of work including (1) the systematic collection of data on attacks, (2) advocacy for preventing attacks, and for stopping them if they occur, and (3) the promotion of good practices and heightened awareness for protecting healthcare from attacks., How does WHO carry out its role?, WHO’s Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA), launched in December 2017, is the main mechanism for collecting primary source data of attacks on healthcare in countries with complex humanitarian emergencies. Its methodology allows the cataloguing of attacks and provides data based on a level of certainty for each incident. The resulting information is then made publicly available., Does WHO make other information on attacks on health care publicly available?, WHO does notshare data beyond information published on the SSA dashboard, which has specific measures in place to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and the affected community., Does WHO investigate attacks on health care?, WHO is neither mandated nor equipped to investigate these attacks, including identification of the perpetrators. WHO’s role is to systematically collect and disseminate data on attacks. It does so by verifying that attacks on healthcare have occurred in order to highlight their extent and consequences. Other bodies within the United Nations system have the mandate to investigate attacks on healthcare and WHO cooperates with them.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-records-100th-attack-health-care-ukraine

Update 45 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (7 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Apr 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is aware of recent drone footage said to be showing trenches made by Russian troops in a contaminated area near Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and it is ready to visit the site as soon as it is possible to assess the radiation situation and to provide other safety assistance as needed, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The IAEA is still not able to confirm reports last week of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. Russia took control of the area on 24 February and held it for five weeks before withdrawing last Thursday. Ukraine has told the IAEA that the process of resuming regulatory control of the NPP has begun., Ukrainian authorities this week published footage which they say shows fortifications dug by Russian forces in the Exclusion Zone during their presence at the site. The IAEA has reviewed the footage but can only undertake an independent radiological assessment once its experts are on the site., Director General Grossi said the IAEA also needs to urgently send its nuclear safety experts to the site to make their own assessment of the status of the Chornobyl NPP and restore online monitoring there, which was interrupted at the start of the conflict. The IAEA is prepared to send any other safety-related equipment and components to the NPP, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located., “It is of paramount importance that the IAEA travels to Chornobyl so that we can take urgent action to assist Ukraine in ensuring nuclear safety and security there,” he said. “I’m in close consultations with our Ukrainian counterparts to organize such a visit as soon as it is possible.”, Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no other developments related to nuclear safety and security over the past 24 hours., Regarding Ukraine’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-45-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-7-april-2022
"General Assembly Adopts Text to Suspend Russian Federation from Human Rights Council, Continuing Emergency Special Session on Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine",News and Press Release,UN GA,Protection and Human Rights,7 Apr 2022,"GENERAL ASSEMBLYPLENARY
ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 10TH & 11TH MEETINGS (AM & PM)
GA/12414, Continuing its emergency special session today, the General Assembly took the extraordinary step of adopting a resolution that suspended the Russian Federation’s membership in the Human Rights Council, doing so in the wake of recently revealed images and testimonies of atrocities perpetrated against the civilian population of Ukraine., The Assembly adopted the draft resolution by a recorded vote of 93 in favour to 24 against, with 58 abstentions, signaling the international community’s strong censure of Moscow’s aggressive actions towards a neighbouring State., By the text, the Assembly expressed its grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, noting that the violations were of such a degree that the Russian Federation must forfeit its membership in the intergovernmental body until such time as a review is considered appropriate., Ukraine’s delegate, introducing the text, drew a clear, straight line from the brutalities being carried out in his country to the genocide perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994, the harbingers of which, he said, were “largely ignored” by the United Nations Secretariat. He underscored further parallels, including the fact that Rwanda was a non-permanent member of the Security Council at the time and used its seat as a pulpit for its “genocidal regime”. By the same token, the Russian Federation has instrumentalized its place on that organ “to spread lies almost daily”, he cautioned., He went on to delineate the atrocities uncovered in the wake of Moscow’s withdrawal from Bucha and other Ukrainian cities and villages, describing a scene where “thousands of peaceful residents have been killed, tortured, raped and abducted and robbed by the Russian army”., Warning delegates not to abstain on the vote, he quoted the words of writer and Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel, who in 1999 cautioned that “Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning — it is an end. And indifference is always a friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor, never his victim whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.” Noting that the resolution had been drafted by a cross-regional group of two dozen States and co-sponsored by more than 50, he said that voting “yes” would allow delegates to prove they were not the indifferent bystanders that Mr. Wiesel cautioned against., Speaking after the adoption of the resolution and the suspension of its Human Rights Council membership rights, the Russian Federation’s representative said that his country had decided to suspend its membership of that body before the end of its term. It was taking this step, he said, because that Council has been hijacked by one group of States for its own purposes. He underscored that his country could not remain as part of a mechanism that enables States to blackmail others for their own purposes, especially as those same States had blatantly violated human rights for years., Several representatives questioned the statement made by the Russian Federation’s delegate, with the United Kingdom’s representative noting it “sounds like someone being fired tendering their resignation”. Later, he observed that following on the heels of the suspension, the declaration of the Russian Federation of its withdrawal would trigger a byelection. This means that a Member State from the region will be able to take the seat and protect human rights, whereas, he said, quoting the words of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, “it was difficult to find a war crime that Russia did not commit in Bucha”., Several representatives took to the floor to decry the resolution, with Iran’s representative rejecting it as “politically driven”. He stressed his country’s opposition to the use of the Organization’s human rights mechanisms in the service of the political gains of certain States. Not only that, but the resolution will further deepen the existing confrontation, he said., In a similar vein, Syria’s delegate said that not only were human rights being politicized, but some States were applying double standards in the consideration of these liberties. They were choosing to shine a spotlight on some nations while ignoring violations carried out in others, depending on what best suited their political ambitions., China’s representative also opposed the politicization of human rights as well as the application of pressure on certain States in the name of such rights. A hasty move in the Assembly had forced countries to choose sides, setting new precedents, he said. A move to deprive a State of its legitimate membership in the Human Rights Council should be founded on facts and not through a text whose drafting had not been conducted in an open fashion., Cuba’s delegate, meanwhile, cautioned against activating the suspension of the membership clause in the Council, noting that it could be used to achieve political goals. “It is the Russian Federation today, but tomorrow it could be any of our countries, especially nations of the South, which do not support the interests of domination, and which firmly defend their independence,” he said. He pointed out the irony of the fact that the United States was opposed to the creation of the Council at its inception but has now gone on to activate one of its most contentious clauses., Several delegates chose to highlight the urgent need for continued mediation and diplomacy, with South Africa’s representative stressing that “Wars end when dialogues begin, and wars endure when there is no dialogue”. All parties stand to gain from a negotiated outcome and to lose from violent conflict, he said, praising efforts by both Ukraine and the Russian Federation to hold talks without preconditions., Cambodia’s representative cautioned that the removal of the Russian Federation as a Council member would only isolate it and further entrench the situation in Ukraine. Rather, there was a need to build an environment more conducive to dialogue. “At a fragile time for world peace, security and stability, the engagement among the Member States in all relevant United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Council, is very important,” he said., Mexico’s delegate stressed that the central focus in this regard should be to bring to justice those responsible for atrocities and not to suspend any one State from a subsidiary body of the General Assembly., The creation of an Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine was welcomed by many delegates, including Senegal’s representative. The findings of that mechanism will provide a comprehensive view of the extent of alleged violations, he said, noting that only then can appropriate measures in response be considered. The resolution today anticipates an outcome that has not been confirmed, which is why his delegation abstained on the vote., Echoing those sentiments, the United Arab Emirates’ delegate said that due process must be followed with regard to any violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Her delegation abstained on the resolution as the bodies that comprise the international order were not supposed to be “a club for the like-minded”, but rather spaces where nations could talk freely with one another., Offering a different view, Myanmar’s representative said it was clear that atrocities were being carried out against the citizens of Ukraine. He drew attention to the images coming out of Bucha that, he said, resonated decidedly with the people of Myanmar, who have gone through “massacre after massacre” at the hands of the illegal military junta., Delegates also expressed their conviction that there was already evidence that the hand of Moscow could be seen in reports of atrocities, with Lithuania’s delegate, speaking on behalf of the Baltic States, pointing out that the United Nations itself — through its Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) — had reported on violations by the Russian Federation, which belied the need for further delay. The Office has documented instances of cluster munition use by the Russian Federation in populated areas on at least two dozen occasions, as well as the arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearances of journalists and civil society actors, he said., The United States’ representative said she had visited Republic of Moldova and Romania a few days ago and met with women and children who shared stories of the violence committed by the Russian armed forces. She also cited credible reports of landmines and booby traps left behind in the wake of the Russian Federation’s failure and subsequent withdrawal in some areas. She went on to note the release of images from Bucha of corpses in the street, some with their hands tied behind their backs in what appeared to be summary executions. Against this backdrop, she said the world was watching to see if the United Nations would meet this moment. Ensuring that human rights violators cannot occupy a leadership position in the human rights arena is a step in the right direction, she said., Also speaking were the representatives of Kazakhstan, Venezuela, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, Brazil, Chile, Belarus, India, Timor-Leste, Qatar, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Panama, Thailand, Viet Nam, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Algeria, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Kiribati, Netherlands (also on behalf of Belgium and Luxembourg), France, Denmark (on behalf of the Nordic countries), Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Italy, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Croatia, Spain, Slovakia, Germany, Slovenia, Canada, Japan, Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, Botswana, Romania, Austria, Ireland, Israel and Malta., Also speaking were observers for the European Union and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance., Action on Draft Resolution, SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), introducing the draft resolution titled “Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council” (document A/ES-11/L.4), said that one early morning of April 1993, United Nations delegates had coffee, kissed their loved ones and went to the Headquarters, to do business as usual. That same morning, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent a Special Rapporteur to investigate extrajudicial arbitrary executions in Rwanda and reported that a more robust United Nations response was needed. The findings that abuses could be precursors to genocide were largely ignored by the overstretched Secretariat of the Organization., In early April 1994, the Security Council received letters in which the Rwanda Patriotic Front reminded Member States that “when the institution of the United Nations was created after the Second World War, one of its objectives was to see to it that what happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany would never happen again.” In 1994, Rwanda was a non-permanent member of the Security Council, which allowed its “genocidal regime” to influence other members Council with its view of the situation, just as the Russian Federation’s presence on the Council today allows it “to spread lies almost daily”, he said., In April 2006, in New York, on the docks by the Hudson River, a “state of the art ocean liner was launched”, he said, which was then “docked on the shores of Lake Geneva” and named the Human Rights Council. The adoption of the resolution establishing the Human Rights Council was the culmination of five months of consultations. The ocean liner is going towards icebergs, he said, and it might seem that it should have been named the Titanic instead of the Human Rights Council. “We need to take action today to save it from sinking,” he said, noting the situation in Bucha and dozens of other Ukrainian cities and villages, where “thousands of peaceful residents have been killed, tortured, raped and abducted and robbed by the Russian army”. This, he stressed, shows how far the Russian Federation has strayed from its initial aspirations in the human rights domain. This case is unique and today’s response is obvious, he said. The Russian Federation’s diplomatic note Wednesday stated that the collective effort to preserve the credibility of the Human Rights Council was considered as an approach to preserve “domination and total control in the world”. This is “the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as a victim”, he said. If the Russian Federation is expelled from the Council, it is its own choice., The draft resolution “L.4” is the result of the collective effort of a cross-regional group of two dozen States, with more than 50 Member States co-sponsoring it. He called upon all responsible Member States to support the draft. Addressing those who might opt to be bystanders on the vote and to abstain, he quoted Eli Wiesel’s words to President Bill Clinton in 1999: “Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning — it is an end. And indifference is always a friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor, never his victim whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.” The genocide in Rwanda was largely a result of indifference, he said, noting that the United Nations did not respond to warnings in the Security Council and the General Assembly a year before the tragedy that is commemorated every year on 7 April., Today, delegates will have the chance to prove that they are not indifferent bystanders, he said. “All you need to do is to press the ‘Yes’ button,” he said. “On the other hand, pressing ‘No’ means pulling a trigger and means a red dot on the screen. Red as the blood of the innocent lives lost. And this image of the red bloody dots on this screen will stay with you — and all of us — as long as memory does not fail us. Think about it. Thank you”., The representative of the Russian Federation said the draft resolution under consideration has no relationship to the actual human rights situation on the ground, adding that it is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and an attempt at human rights colonialism in international relations. It is also an attempt to move those who wish to conduct an independent foreign policy to the periphery of international relations. There is a crack that has appeared in the human rights architecture that is decades in the making, he said, noting that the possible exclusion of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council could be a dangerous precedent. As practice has shown, Western approaches in dealing with acute human rights problems in certain countries have not really been successful, he said, stressing that not a single conflict was resolved, but only exacerbated, mainly due to the use by Western countries of sanctions and military intervention., The Russian Federation throughout its membership in the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council has consistently defended the principle of cooperation based on mutual respect and equal status, he said. Its priority has always been to strengthen constructive dialogue involving all interested sides in defending and promoting human rights. He rejected the untruthful allegations against the Russian Federation based on “staged events and widely circulated fakes”, calling on all Member States to really consider their decision and vote against the attempt by Western countries and their allies to destroy the existing human rights architecture., The representative of Kazakhstan called on all parties to cease hostilities, stating that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is dire and that his country has already sent it three planes carrying over 50 tons of goods. He noted, however, that adoption of the draft resolution currently before the Assembly will not contribute to the settlement of conflict. The negotiation process must not be undermined, and all fora must be used to resolve it, including the Human Rights Council. Recalling that membership in the Council can be suspended following the confirmation of gross violations of human rights, he said this requires the collection of unbiased data. Today’s vote should be preceded by an investigation under relevant international mechanisms. For those reasons, he affirmed that his delegation will vote against the draft resolution., The representative of Venezuela said the promotion and protection of human rights must be addressed in a constructive manner, with dialogue and cooperation, and human rights should not be used to attack sovereign States. He expressed his regret that divisions today have increased among members of the United Nations, cautioning: “That is the wrong path.” Such a track may create consequences that will take generations to overcome and will impact the living conditions of vulnerable groups around the country, where people are already suffering due to the increased cost of food and transportation. Also warning about the start of a new arms race, he said the international community faces the danger of a conflict between world Powers “that will destroy mankind as we know it today”. The draft resolution before the Assembly is an example of the politicization of human rights. “Without the Russian Federation, there is no possible peace agreement in Europe,” he said, underscoring that the draft will push the world towards a more acute phase of the conflict., The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea voiced concern that some countries continue to push confrontation and distrust, instead of prioritizing the easing of tensions and seeking a political and peaceful solution to the current crisis in Ukraine. He rejected any politically motivated initiative and lack of objectivity, impartiality and transparency, noting that reported atrocities against the civil population in Ukraine have not yet been officially verified or proven based on real fact or evidence. An independent investigation must be made, and substantive time and effort are required in that regard, he stressed, pointing out that some Member States are acting very recklessly for their political goals by submitting the draft resolution and adding that such political and unilateral action will not help solve the problem at all. Noting the efforts by the Russian Federation to address the humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine, he said the draft resolution is another example of political confrontation aimed at tarnishing one Member State on the United Nations stage., The representative of Iran underlined the need for a peaceful settlement to the conflict under international law, including international humanitarian law. Affirming that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, he expressed concern over the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in and around Ukraine. Calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all parties and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid, he said the international community must support continued direct negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The text under consideration is politically driven, he said, and his delegation opposes the exploitation of United Nations human rights machinery for political ends. Stating that the exploitation of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution A/RES/60/251 deepens confrontation and attenuates constructive dialogue between countries, he said his delegation will vote no on the draft resolution before the Assembly., The representative of Syria condemned the politicization of human rights by some countries and the targeting of the Russian Federation on the pretext of dealing with humanitarian issues in Ukraine. He stressed the need to reject such politicization and underscored the importance of objectivity and non-discrimination in human rights issues. The coordinated Western move to denounce the Russian Federation has no relation to human rights in Ukraine or anywhere else. It is an effort by Western countries to impose their control over the rest of the world. The resolution establishing the Human Rights Council stressed that all human rights are interlinked and that they should be treated in a just and equitable way. However, some States use double standards when dealing with human rights issues, focusing on the situation in certain countries in a manner that serves their own political purposes while ignoring grave violations perpetrated in the full sight of the world. What the Palestinian people have been exposed to at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces is the best proof of that, he said, noting that his delegation will vote against the resolution., The representative of Cuba said that only a few days after concluding a regular session of the Human Rights Council, that body was not even given an opportunity to state its position. Since the start of the negotiating process to create the new Council that would replace the Human Rights Commission, his country has opposed the clause on suspension of membership given the serious risk that it could be used by specific countries which favour double standards, selectivity and the politicization of human rights issues. “It is the Russian Federation today, but tomorrow it could be any of our countries, especially nations of the south, which do not support the interests of domination and which firmly defend their independence,” he stressed. Moreover, he pointed out that the suspension of the United States’ membership in the Council has not happened nor will it despite that country’s flagrant violations of human rights, adding that the suspension clause will not be used against the State which imposed against Cuba for over 60 years a criminal economic and financial blockade — the longest and a systematic violation of the human rights of an entire people. “It is ironic that the country which opposed the establishment of the Human Rights Council and requested a vote against the resolution establishing it is the same one that has conveniently now activated it, as it did in 2011, one of the most controversial clauses of that forum,” he said. The draft resolution under consideration today will establish a dangerous additional precedent, especially for the South, he said, explaining his country’s vote against the text., The representative of Senegal said war is a failure of humanity, at all times and in all places. He expressed support for peace in Ukraine, also because “our countries are collateral victims” of the crisis with serious consequences for economies and populations. He noted Senegal’s President, in his capacity as the current Chairman of the African Union, called for respect for international law and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine — also the reason for his delegation’s support for Assembly resolution A/ES-11/L.2 on 24 March, and for Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/49/1 of 4 March, on implementation of an international commission of inquiry into allegations of human rights violations in the country as a result of the war. Publication of its findings will give the international community a full view of the nature and extent of the alleged violations, and therefore the exact measure of the sanctions to be considered. However, today’s resolution decides on sanction measures without the Commission of Inquiry, thus anticipating the work expected of it, leading his delegation to abstain., The representative of South Africa said that a cessation of hostilities must be the first step in the response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. “Wars end when dialogues begin, and wars endure when there is no dialogue”, he said. He welcomed efforts by Ukraine and the Russian Federation to hold talks without preconditions and expressed his hope that both parties will use diplomacy to de-escalate the situation. All parties have much to gain from a negotiated outcome and much to lose from unnecessary and violent conflict. The General Assembly must encourage mediation and dialogue and adopt outcomes leading to that end. “The international community cannot be indifferent to the killing and suffering of civilians,” he said, calling for an immediate opening of humanitarian corridors. On 4 March 2022, the Human Rights Council supported the establishment of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate violations of international law and related crimes. The Commission has not yet commenced its work. In that regard, the tabling of the resolution today is premature and his delegation will abstain, he said., The representative of Egypt said the draft resolution does not relate to the situation in Ukraine, the principle on the non-use of force in relations among nations. Expressing concern about the functions and mandates of United Nations bodies, he said the draft resolution undermines the Organization’s methods of work and threatens to undermine its credibility, leading to further negative repercussions on its ability to fulfil its role in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. Voicing concern about human rights violations and stressing the obligations of all States in that regard, he said serious human rights violations should be dealt with decisively and in accordance with United Nations’ rules and procedures. “The draft resolution is not being proposed at the right moment,” he said., The representative of Brazil said the establishment of the Human Rights Council, in replacing the Commission on Human Rights, represented a hopeful step towards the strengthening and improvement of the global human rights system. During its relatively short existence, the Council has faced significant challenges, but it has sought to preserve the space for dialogue and negotiation, avoiding political selectivity and double standards. “Today, we may be taking a step into uncharted territory,” he said. Voicing deep concern about allegations of gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine — including the recent reports from Bucha — he said Brazil voted in favour of the Human Rights Council’s establishment of a commission of inquiry mandated to establish the facts about what may amount to violations and abuses of human rights or violations of humanitarian law in Ukraine. Calling on the parties to cooperate with it, he said in today’s vote in the General Assembly, Brazil has decided to abstain. “We believe that the Commission of Inquiry should be allowed to complete the independent investigation requested by the Council, so that responsibilities can be ascertained,” he said, reiterating the need for independence, objectivity and impartiality., The representative of China said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, along with their legitimate security concerns. Reports and images of civilian deaths in Bucha are disturbing and must be verified with accusations based on facts. Dialogue and negotiation are the only way out of the Ukraine crisis, he said, with the international community remaining rational and not setting up obstacles or resistance that add fuel to the fire. Indiscriminate sanctions without a bottom line have created complex new problems for the global post-pandemic recovery, with developing countries suffering while not being parties to the current conflict. Meanwhile, some other developed States provoke tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, which must be rejected. He voiced opposition to the politicization of human rights issues and to exerting pressure on other countries in their name. The draft resolution before the Assembly will deprive a State of its legitimate membership in the Human Rights Council — an issue that must be handled based on facts and truth. He stated the text was not drafted in an open manner, and a hasty move in the General Assembly forces countries to choose sides, setting new precedents. Therefore, his delegation will vote against the draft., The representative of Mexico said that recent reports show the probable occurrence of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian international law. His country has backed the Secretary-General’s call to conduct impartial investigations to ensure effective accountability. At the Human Rights Council, Mexico voted for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate all alleged human rights violations. Mexico is following the inquiry of the International Criminal Court and supports its Prosecutor’s work to establish the facts. Mexico is also following the case brought before the International Court of Justice and reiterates its call for the immediate cessation of hostilities. These processes are under way but have not yet classified the situation in legal terms, he said, noting that they must be supported until they reach their ultimate conclusions. Whether the Russian Federation is a member of the Human Rights Council or not is not a factor that exempts it from obligations under international law. The central point is to bring to justice those responsible, not to suspend a State from membership in a subsidiary body of the General Assembly. Mexico will abstain from supporting the draft resolution. “Even in the midst of the war, all channels should be maintained for dialogue with the authorities of the Russian Federation,” he said., The representative of Chile pointed out that, while his country supports multilateralism, membership in the Human Rights Council involves certain requirements, including conduct consistent with the protection and promotion of human rights everywhere. The suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council is a result of its unacceptable aggression and invasion against Ukraine, he said, explaining his country’s vote in favour of the resolution. He called on all parties to continue negotiations and urged an immediate and peaceful resolution to the conflict., The representative of Belarus said his delegation is categorically against the draft under consideration by the Assembly, as it is motivated exclusively by political interests to demonize and exclude the Russian Federation. This move could have a long-term negative impact, even leading to the destruction of the United Nations as a whole and consolidating the destruction of upholding human rights under its auspices. It is important to focus not on short-term tasks influenced by emotions, but on long-term solutions. Stressing the draft proposed will not only not help resolve the situation in Ukraine, but increase risks for any negotiations, he called on Member State to reflect on the issue, and vote against it., The General Assembly then adopted the draft resolution titled “Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council” (document A/ES-11/L.4) by a recorded vote of 93 in favour to 24 against, with 58 abstentions., By the text, the Assembly decided to suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of the Russian Federation and to review the matter, as appropriate. It also decided to temporarily adjourn the Assembly’s eleventh emergency special session and to authorize the Assembly President to resume its meetings upon request from Member States., The representative of India said his delegation abstained in the vote for reasons of both substance and process. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, India has stood for peace, dialogue and diplomacy. Voicing deep concern about the worsening situation and reiterating his call for an end to all hostilities, he declared: “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.” He condemned recent civilian killings in Bucha, calling for an independent investigation, adding that it is in the global community’s collective interest to work constructively — both inside the United Nations and outside — towards an early resolution to the conflict. All decisions should be taken with full respect for due process, he stressed, adding that this principle also applies to international organizations such as the United Nations., The representative of Timor-Leste noted that today’s vote shows the clear position of States on upholding human rights in all circumstances and in all cases. “The dark period of our own history has taught us enough on the high cost of being victims of war,” he said. Calling for an effective ceasefire, he urged continuing dialogue and negotiations to stop the war and avoid further potentially catastrophic escalation. Timor-Leste calls for more diplomatic initiatives to help find a peaceful solution for all, he added, while emphasizing that all parties must ensure the safety and protection of all civilians., The representative of Qatar said her delegation abstained during the vote. Her country’s position is anchored in the observance of the principles of the inadmissibility of the use of force and the importance of settling international conflicts and ensuring the territorial integrity of States. She stressed the importance of upholding international humanitarian law and commended the tireless efforts of the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations to respond to humanitarian needs. She reiterated the Secretary-General’s call to revert to the path of negotiations and for an immediate ceasefire, as well as calling for all parties to the conflict to exercise self-restraint and to use diplomacy and dialogue., The representative of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, reiterating his call for a peaceful political and diplomatic solution to the conflict, urged the international community to refrain from any action that could escalate tensions. He echoed expressions of grave concern about the recent reports and accusations of human rights and international humanitarian law violations and abuses. “We are of the view that such serious allegations must not be taken lightly and must be backed up by solid evidence and verified by an independent investigation mechanism by the United Nations, specifically the Human Rights Council’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry,” he said. As such, his delegation voted against the draft resolution before the Assembly in view of the need for a credible, neutral, impartial and independent assessment mechanism, before any action is taken., The representative of Indonesia shared the international community’s deep concerns regarding the devastating human rights and humanitarian situation in Ukraine. “We do not take lightly reports of gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights, including recent report from Bucha,” he said, stressing that the Human Rights Council must remain seized of the matter and conduct a thorough and independent investigation. “In the meantime, we have to give the chance for the Commission to work in objective and transparent manners, and present its findings and reports,” he said, calling for due diligence and warning against prejudging that work. For those reasons, Indonesia abstained in the vote on the resolution, he said., The representative of Panama said her county decided to vote in favour of the resolution, especially because Member States must abide by their commitments to human rights when elected to the Human Rights Council. In general, Panama does not support the separation of a Member State from membership in a multilateral forum, however its decision was taken given the flagrant, gross and systematic violations of human rights against civilians in Ukraine. Expressing hope that the Assembly’s action will be temporary, and that Member States will support the principles of respect for the highest human rights standards, she highlighted the need to guarantee universality in considering human rights issues, calling for dialogue and diplomacy to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict., The representative of Thailand said his delegation abstained on “L.4” because of the importance of transparent, impartial and inclusive processes. The decision to suspend any Member State from any body of the United Nations must not be taken lightly. Expressing condolences to the people of Ukraine and those who have lost loved ones, he further voiced concern over the escalation of the humanitarian crisis. Actions must be taken to address any atrocities committed, including in Bucha, and must be transparent and objective. Voicing support for the Independent Commission of Inquiry in concluding its investigation as soon as possible, in a transparent manner, he said: “Another life lost is another life too many.” Thailand continues to provide humanitarian support and affirms that political dialogue is the only way to end the dispute., The representative of Viet Nam said he has followed with concern the situation in Ukraine and learned of recent reports of great loss of life among innocent civilians. He condemned all forms of attacks against civilians, in violation of international law. Recent information should be confirmed in a transparent manner with the parties concerned, he said, underscoring that the ongoing conflict — if not resolved peacefully — will continue to impact the entire world. The only way forward is to resume dialogue with a view to achieving long-term solutions. “There is no viable alternative,” he said. Deliberation and decisions taken by the General Assembly should be based on impartial information, in consultation with Member States. He expressed his hope that Member States will work together towards this end., The representative of Cambodia said the isolation of a Member State through the suspension of its rights in a United Nations body will not help resolve the conflict in Ukraine, but will only trigger and intensify the situation. “At a fragile time for world peace, security and stability, the engagement among the Member States in all relevant United Nations bodies including the Human Rights Council is very important,” he stressed. Further underlining the need to create an environment conducive to diplomatic engagement, he said in view of all those concerns Cambodia voted to abstain on the draft resolution., The representative of Uzbekistan said his country adheres to a balanced and neutral position on the current situation in Ukraine, expressing hope that the parties will find mutually acceptable ways to resolve the situation based on the principles and norms of international law. Explaining his country’s vote against the resolution, he said any decisions by the General Assembly to suspend a State’s right to membership in the Human Rights Council should be based on the outcome of a thorough investigation of the alleged human rights violations., The representative of Malaysia, voicing deep concern over the worsening situation in Ukraine and reports of alleged human rights abuses and violations, agreed with other speakers that those who commit the latter must be held accountable. It is imperative that such atrocities be verified in an impartial and credible manner, he said, supporting the Secretary-General’s call to immediately commence an independent investigation. “Thus, Malaysia is of the view that a critical decision such as the suspension of a member of the Human Rights Council must not be made in haste and should not prejudge the outcome of such investigations,” he stressed, noting that Malaysia decided to abstain in the vote., The representative of Singapore, noting that her delegation abstained in the vote, condemned the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and its continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities, civilians and civilian infrastructure in the strongest possible terms. Reiterating Singapore’s support for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, she recalled that her country supported and co-sponsored the recent draft resolutions titled “Aggression against Ukraine” and “Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine”, as well as the Human Rights Council’s draft titled “Situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”. Against that backdrop, she underlined the need to spare no effort to protect civilians in Ukraine and to remain engaged in meaningful negotiations leading to a peaceful settlement., The representative of Brunei Darussalam, condemning violations of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country, reiterated the importance of upholding the principles of the rules-based framework and respect for international law. Emphasizing that constructive dialogue and engagement are essential to a peaceful solution, she said the suspension of a Member State is counter-productive and may further aggravate an already dire situation. Reiterating the importance of diplomacy, she called upon all parties directly involved to de-escalate tensions and settle all differences by peaceful means., The representative of Kuwait said his delegation abstained on “L.4”, voicing support for all human rights bodies and their protection from politicization, as well as for dialogue and objectivity on those matters. Voicing concern over the images and information over recent days, revealing the extent of violations of international law and international humanitarian law against unarmed civilians, he appealed to the Secretary-General for a transparent international inquiry to identify perpetrators of the crimes. Citing the importance of guaranteeing humanitarian assistance, he welcomed efforts by United Nations bodies to end the hostilities. Since the beginning of the war and of military operations in Ukraine, his delegation has expressed its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and opposed the use or threat of force., The representative of Kyrgyzstan said that the international community should wait for the results of all investigations on violations of human rights in Ukraine, including the Independent International Commission of Inquiry. “It is especially alarming that fraternal people are involved in this conflict,” she said, noting the importance of ensuring the full protection of civilians, as well as medical and humanitarian personnel. The text of the resolution on the suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council is “characterized as politically driven”, she said, noting her delegation is in favour of the carrying out of an independent investigation. Any conflict must be resolved by diplomatic means, including by the creation of new formats and mechanisms, she said., The representative of Algeria said there is no doubt that the images of Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are shocking and strongly condemnable, and the alleged crimes they imply are of the utmost gravity. “However, it is imperative to allow the existing United Nations mechanisms to investigate the facts on the ground in an impartial manner so that justice is done for all the victims,” he said. Such processes must take place far from any interference or pre-judgment, as a sine qua non condition necessary to establish the facts on the ground. Calling for respect for the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity on which the Human Rights Council is founded, he said any attempt to suspend a country from a United Nations body is not conducive to promoting the virtues of multilateralism., The representative of Peru said suspension in the future of the rights to membership of a Member State in the Human Rights Council should be invoked in any situations similar to the present case, where acts of use of force, violation of the territorial integrity of another State, and violations of human rights concur. In that context, he said the resolution does not prejudge the actions undertaken or may be undertaken by the various mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, adding that those inquiries must take place with independence, neutrality, and a focus on the rights of victims, their protection and fight against impunity. Moreover, the investigation of the Independent International Commission, which the Human Rights Council has established with a mandate to investigate alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Ukraine, should take place expediently, objectively and without discrimination, which is all the more urgent and imperative in investigating the massacre in Bucha., The representative of Saudi Arabia said his delegation abstained on “L.4”, a measure that represents a serious precedent and adversely effects the function of multilateralism and international organizations. Condemning all violations of international humanitarian law in all forms wherever they occur, he called for the protection of civilians. However, the decision to suspend a Member State from the Human Rights Council is an escalatory step that aggravates an already tense situation, not only politicizing the work of the Council but marking a unilateral move that gives certain States more rights than others. Noting all States elected to the Council are entitled to exercise their full rights under A/RES/60/251, he said his delegation abstained because aggravating the situation will preclude a peaceful settlement for the region., The representative of the United Arab Emirates said that civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict in Ukraine. Determining the facts on the ground is important to bring justice to victims and, in the long term, to allow communities to reconcile and build sustainable peace. At the Human Rights Council, her delegation voted for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The members of the Commission of Inquiry were appointed on 30 March and their investigations have only just begun. Due process demands that any investigative mechanisms be allowed to complete their work, she said, noting that her delegation abstained in the vote so that any decision made is based on due process. The organizations that make up the international system were not established to be “a club for the like-minded”, she stressed. Spaces to talk to each other in the international arena must be preserved, she said, noting “that idea is in the foundational DNA of this Organization”., The representative of Kiribati, explaining his country’s vote in favour of the resolution, recalled the images of hundreds of thousands of innocent human beings killed in Ukraine over the past 42 days. Joining calls for a speedy end to the conflict through friendly and diplomatic dialogue between the parties, he said it is a wise and civilized practice of the Commonwealth of Nations to encourage its members to be loyal and faithful to its codes of conduct. The codes require all Commonwealth members to respect the rule of law, good governance, and the rights and freedoms of persons, and to deter violations through suspension of any defaulting member, while at the same time allowing time and space for a suspended member to reform its conduct. That practice has worked well for the Commonwealth for decades, he said, noting that it could also work well for the United Nations with respect to any Member State seen by an overwhelming majority to have seriously digressed from codes of conduct for the Organization’s membership., Statements after Adoption, GENNADY V. KUZMIN (Russian Federation) said the resolution adopted is an illegitimate and politically motivated step to punish a Member State conducting an independent and domestic foreign policy. He noted his delegation made the decision to suspend its membership on the Human Rights Council, on 7 April, before the end of its term, as the Council is intended for developing a depoliticized intergovernmental dialogue on the human rights agenda. Unfortunately, that body is monopolized by one group of States for their short-term gain — States which have for years been directly involved in blatant violations of human rights or abetting the same. They will not sacrifice short-term political interests, he stated, with such actions violating the mandate of the Council and undermining trust in that body. The Russian Federation cannot remain a member of an international mechanism that enables the will of those States, which have resorted to open blackmail of sovereign States in pushing through their vote. He stressed that his delegation’s decision to suspend its membership before the end of its term does not mean it will stop contributing to constructive dialogue on human rights., OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, emphasized that the scale and gravity of the Russian Federation’s violations of international law call for a strong, united international response. The European Union supports all measures to ensure accountability for violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Ukraine by Russian armed forces, he said, stressing that the perpetrators of war crimes and other serious violations, as well as the responsible Government officials and military leaders, will be held accountable. Noting that the Russian Federation has violated the criteria for membership of the Human Right Council through its actions in Ukraine, he stressed the necessity if its suspension in order to uphold the Council’s integrity, the General Assembly’s authority and the credibility of the United Nations human rights system. The Assembly’s rare decision today will help to prevent and discourage more violations, he said, pointing out that it is the third time in a month that it has adopted a resolution on Ukraine by a clear majority, while the Security Council remains unable to act., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), speaking also on behalf of Belgium and Luxembourg and associating herself with the European Union, condemned the unprovoked war of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Expressing horror over the reports of atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in currently and formerly occupied territories of Ukraine, she said the images and reports from places like Bucha, Staryi Bykiv, Mariupol and Hostomel show a complete disregard for human rights and dignity of civilians. Noting the personal testimonies of rape and sexual violence that are emerging, she stressed that those actions are unacceptable for any United Nations member, and especially for a member of the Human Rights Council. “Holding a seat in the Human Rights Council is not ‘a free ride’”, she said. “Members sign up to a heightened level of public scrutiny and commit to engage with the Council in a spirit of dialogue, cooperation and self-reflection, grounded in a desire to use their membership to strengthen the enjoyment of human rights at home and abroad… With its actions in Ukraine, the Russian Federation is failing [in] its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council.”, Turning to the credibility of the United Nations, she pointed out that its integrity could indeed be at stake if Member States allow the Russian Federation to commit those atrocities without consequences. Moreover, all efforts must be made to ensure there are independent and effective investigations into what happened in Bucha and other places to ensure truth, justice and accountability, as well as reparations and remedy for victims and their families. Affirming support for the Human Rights Council’s creation of an independent international commission of inquiry, she said the International Criminal Court’s investigation of alleged crimes that may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is complementary to the investigations undertaken by the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine. The perpetrators of those crimes are being watched and evidence is being compiled with a view to their prosecution, she said, stressing that the Russian Federation needs to immediately cease hostilities, withdraw its troops from Ukraine and fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law., The representative of the United Kingdom, taking the floor on a point of order, said he wished to seek urgent clarification from the delegation of the Russian Federation as to what precisely it said in its statement. “This General Assembly voted just a few moments ago to suspend them from the Human Rights Council and that is now done,” he said. But it seemed it was suggesting that it was also withdrawing from the Human Rights Council, which has a different effect. “Now, setting aside the fact that that sounds like someone being fired tendering their resignation,” he said, asking the Russian Federation to be precise on this point: “Will they be sending a note verbale to Member States and to the relevant authorities indicating their full and formal withdrawal from the Human Rights Council for the remainder of their term?” He said that would have a different effect on the next actions that need to be taken and the status of the Russian Federation., The representative of the Russian Federation said he would like to explain that the question that was just asked does not refer to a point of order but refers to the substantive part of his delegation’s statement. “I think we made a very clear statement,” he said., The representative of France said that she did not have a point of order, but maybe the interpreters should clarify, as there might be divergence between French and English versions. She said she was also wondering “exactly what was the statement of the Russian Federation?”, RYTIS PAULAUSKAS (Lithuania), speaking on behalf of the Baltic States and associating himself with the European Union, welcomed today’s adoption and said the Assembly has thus preserved the moral integrity of the Human Rights Council. “There is no place for the aggressor State in the United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world,” he said, citing gruesome reports verified by the Organization’s officials as well as civil society members and journalists on the ground. Meanwhile, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented the Russian Federation’s use of cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times and the use of arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearance of 22 journalists and civil society members in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. Voicing the Baltic States’ full solidarity with the Ukrainian people, he emphasized that “there will be no impunity” and international justice will be done., MARTIN BILLE HERMANN (Denmark), speaking on behalf of the Nordic countries, said they voted in favour of today’s resolution to suspend the Russian Federation’s rights of membership in the Human Rights Council — “not an easy decision”. Voicing support for that organ’s purpose as an inclusive forum for dialogue, he said membership therein carries the responsibility to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. Stressing that the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified and unlawful attack on Ukraine constitutes a gross violation of international law and the United Nations Charter and has had a catastrophic impact on Ukraine, in particular on civilians, he welcomed the establishment by the Human Rights Council of a Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine as well as the International Criminal Court’s opening of an investigation into the situation. “In the meantime, the […] Human Rights Council should not, and will not, be tainted by the full-fledged membership of a State accused of some of the most horrific war crimes seen in Europe since the end of World War II,” he said., KAHA IMNADZE (Georgia), associating himself with the European Union, said the scenes depicting the massacre and brutal atrocities against innocent civilians in Bucha are devastating, stressing that there must be no impunity for any violation of humanitarian law and human rights law. The international community must ensure that justice is served for the crimes committed through all available international legal mechanisms, he said, adding that membership in the Human Rights Council comes with the responsibility to promote and protect human rights to the highest standards. However, the international community continues to witness the Russian Federation’s full disregard for rules-based order and international human rights law and for the Council’s mandate. Thus, his delegation voted in favour of the resolution and calls on Member States to continue to stand up for the principles of the Charter and international law., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said a country that deliberately kills civilians on a massive scale cannot be an active Human Rights Council member. A country that has held international law in total disregard cannot participate in making new standards in this area. The suspension of the Russian Federation’s membership is an initiative that does not have many precedents, he pointed out. Yet, the situation in Ukraine is tragically unique: A permanent member of the Security Council and a Human Rights Council member initiates an unprovoked and unjustified invasion against its neighbouring country and brutally conducts a war, deliberately attacking the civilian population. The creators of the United Nations designed it to prevent future generations from the scourge of war. The further creation of the Human Rights Council was meant to contribute to this goal. It is imperative to safeguard the United Nations achievements for the next generations and to protect the Organization’s credibility. For these reasons, Poland has supported the resolution just adopted, he explained., JAKUB KULHÁNEK (Czech Republic), associating himself with the European Union, said that a permanent member of the Security Council that wages an unprovoked and unjustified war against its neighbour, and deliberately commits war crimes, has no place on the Human Right Council. In addition to the human rights situation inside the Russian Federation, the resolution is first and foremost about the unprecedented and flagrant violation of the Charter, international law, international humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions, he emphasized. The suspension of the Russian Federation’s membership is a necessary and the only logical step to uphold the integrity of the Human Right Council, he said, adding that the Assembly’s rare decision today sends a strong signal to the victims of inhuman violence., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy), associating himself with the European Union, pointed to the horrifying images of civilians lying dead in the streets or in improvised mass graves in Bucha, and the emerging and disturbing testimony about rape and sexual violence by Russian troops against women, children and older persons. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability, he said the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council was necessary to uphold that body’s integrity, reaffirm the General Assembly’s authority, and send the clear message that gross and systematic violations of human rights cannot be tolerated anywhere in the world. Emphasizing the need for accountability on the part of individual perpetrators of violations and to avoid any form of impunity, Italy calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of Russian military forces and a return to negotiations., MYRIAM OEHRI (Liechtenstein) said the last two weeks have seen no let-up in the horrors unfolding in Ukraine. Expressing shock and outrage over the reports and images emerging from Bucha and other parts of the country, which are evidence of war crimes, she said the Russian Federation’s methods of warfare illustrate a systematic disregard for international humanitarian law — in particular the targeting of civilian populations — as it has carried out before in Syria. Accountability remains key. Voicing support for the efforts under way to gather and preserve evidence, welcoming the independent investigation by the International Criminal Court and looking forward to the swift operationalization of the Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, she nevertheless said the continued violations being committed by the Russian Federation abundantly meet the criteria needed for suspension in the latter organ’s membership. As such, Liechtenstein voted in favour of, and co-sponsored, the draft resolution before the Assembly today., JAMES PAUL ROSCOE (United Kingdom) said the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine far fall short of standards of membership in the Human Rights Council, with horrific images of civilians in Bucha deliberatively killed in regions from which that State’s forces have recently withdrawn. Quoting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he said it was difficult to find a war crime that the Russian Federation did not commit in Bucha, with evidence of gross and systematic violations of human rights — the threshold for suspension from the Council. Today’s vote delivers another message to President Vladimir Putin that those who stand by him or speak in his name must stop killing innocent civilians and end this war now. Following suspension from the Council, the Russian Federation declared its withdrawal, which will trigger a byelection; he thus welcomed the opportunity for a Member State from that region who will protect human rights to ultimately take the seat. Today is a victory for human rights and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, he stated., AMATLAIN ELIZABETH KABUA (Marshall Islands) recalled that on 4 March, his country, as a Human Rights Council member, joined 31 others to vote in favour of resolution HRC/49/L1, regarding the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from Russian aggression. All the events which have happened since that vote have only served to confirm the Council’s firm conclusion one month ago. Her country’s vote today on Assembly resolution ES-11/L.4 is consistent with its vote at the Human Rights Council. “It is not an action taken lightly,” she said. The United Nations should have learned lessons about the importance of timely reaction in crisis situations. Objective information, including from the United Nations system, provides the necessary specificity for a political assessment to suspend the Russian Federation’s membership in the Human Rights Council and to keep this outcome under appropriate review., IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), associating himself with the European Union, said a country such as the Russian Federation which so clearly violates the right to life through a brutal aggression against another State “cannot and should not sit on the Human Rights Council — not after we have seen pictures from Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Mariupol and so many other places of massacres in Ukraine”. Regrettably, the Security Council’s rules of procedure do not allow for the suspension of Moscow’s permanent membership nor its veto right, though they are in the current situation both inappropriate and counter-productive for the protection of international peace and security, he said, AGUSTÍN SANTOS MARAVER (Spain), associating himself with the European Union, stressed that “one cannot be jury and party, be a full member of the Human Rights Council and an alleged violator of those same rights”. The same countries that abstained or voted against resolution 49/1 of the Human Rights Council, establishing the Commission of Inquiry into human rights violations in Ukraine, today in turn called for a vote or an abstention on the current resolution, he said, stating that the Commission had not been able to finalize its work. While investigative processes are taking place, respect for the Charter must be exercised as Member States have done, by suspending the aggressor from the Human Rights Council through a General Assembly decision. Expressing hope that the Russian Federation will heed the international clamour against its invasion, he called for an immediate ceasefire, negotiations towards peace, and the recovery of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, affirming his country’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), aligning himself with the European Union, welcomed the adoption of “L.4”, stating the consequences of the unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, in blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter, are unprecedented and outrageous. According to OHCHR, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and 2,195 injured between 24 February and 4 April 2022. “The images from Bucha the world saw last weekend have reached the bottom of living hell, following the Russian decision to start this senseless war,” he said. Allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces, including gang rape and rapes in front of children, do not deserve any further comment. “The face of Russia will be tarnished for a very long time”, he stressed. Such disgraceful behaviour is absolutely incompatible with membership in the Human Rights Council, and his delegation welcomes the swift nomination of highly qualified members to the Commission of Inquiry., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said the Russian Federation has bombed civilian populations and installations, schools and hospitals, with unbearable images of the atrocities committed in Bucha and other towns in northern Ukraine, possibly constituting war crimes. The Russian army continues to deny the humanity of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, and “it is time for this horror to end”, he said. After the international community denounced the aggression on 2 March, and adopted “L.2” on 24 March, the Russian Federation’s only response has been scorn, escalation of the war and violation of international humanitarian law — actions which cannot remain unpunished. By adopting “L.4” today, the Assembly sends a clear message that the Russian Federation’s actions “are contrary to all the values that we have defended since the establishment of the United Nations” and that it must be held to account. He welcomed the courageous decision by the international community to suspend the country, once again calling on it to heed reason and stop the war., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said the thresholds to exclude a Member State from the Human Rights Council are “gross and systematic human rights violations”. The Russian Federation has obviously committed — and continues to commit — such violations. And it is worth noting that it is not committing these violations on its soil, but on the territory of a sovereign and independent neighbouring country. Germany has already contributed €3.5 million to OHCHR’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, he said, encouraging delegates to read its latest report. Berlin just decided to double its contribution to OHCHR to €1 million in 2022. Welcoming the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry by the Human Rights Council, she said her country will provide another €1 million and second specialists in support of the International Criminal Court investigation., BOŠTJAN MALOVRH (Slovenia), associating himself with the European Union, said a member of the Human Rights Council has an inherent duty to uphold the integrity of that subsidiary body and the authority of the General Assembly, as well as make every effort to prevent gross and systematic violations and ensure accountability for perpetrators. Noting images and reports of atrocities and war crimes committed by Russian armed forces in several Ukrainian towns, he called for an international independent investigation and expressed support for all measures to ensure that perpetrators — including Government officials and military leaders — are held accountable for any violations of international law and international humanitarian law. Welcoming the adoption of the resolution, he called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and premeditated war against its neighbour displays contempt for its United Nations commitments, with the situation laying bare the Russian military’s most vicious disregard for human life — killing civilians, bombing hospitals and maternity wards. “None of these facts are in dispute,” he said. The Russian Federation has invaded Ukraine, which existed for many years under the rule of the Soviet empire, and this terrible example of the empire striking back can only be seen as an example of modern-day colonialism. The update on Wednesday by the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reported 3,776 civilian casualties and 1,563 killed — not simply numbers, but evidence of President Putin’s thirst for power. The international community has seen the horrific images from Bucha and Irpin, of women subjugated to sexual violence and civilians killed — which are possible war crimes, he said, stressing the Russian Federation has made it impossible to be indifferent or turn away. The international community has sent a strong message with today’s vote, he said. The Russian Federation’s withdrawal from the Council does not negate suspension, and evil must not prevail., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan), noting his delegation’s co-sponsorship of the resolution, said he is appalled by the recent revelation of atrocities against innocent civilians resulting from the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unlawful aggression against Ukraine. “It is utterly inappropriate that a Member State that caused such a dire calamity remains on the Human Rights Council,” he said, emphasizing that the mass killing of innocent civilians is a grave breach of international humanitarian law. “It is deeply disappointing that we have to act in this way, but this is the inevitable consequence of Russia’s choice.”, MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia) said the images emerging from Bucha make clear that the Russian Federation has committed egregious war crimes, including horrific acts such as executing and raping civilians. Australia voted in support of today’s resolution because being a voting member of the Human Rights Council is not consistent with invading a country and slaughtering its civilians. “These are two things we already know have happened — apart from Russia, no country is suggesting that there has not been an invasion, that there has not been slaughter,” he said, adding that the second fact is that the cause of such suffering is Moscow’s invasion. As such, the Russian Federation should be suspended in real time from the Human Rights Council until it withdraws its forces. While some have argued that the world should wait until the various investigative processes and inquiries have been undertaken — and they will be undertaken — “that’s not what suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council is about”. Instead, it is about making clear that membership in that organ is inconsistent with Moscow’s actions. “Russia needs to hear this message now and understand that its actions will have consequences,” he stressed., EDUARDO MANUEL DA FONSECA FERNANDES RAMOS (Portugal), associating himself with the European Union, emphasized that the Russian Federation must immediately cease hostilities as well as violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Pointing to the images of civilians killed in Bucha, he reiterated the need for a full investigation of any serious violations of international law and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. He reaffirmed his delegation’s support for the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council, emphasizing that its members must strictly adhere to and uphold the highest standards in promoting and protecting all human rights for all. Portugal welcomes the resolution adopted today in light of events in Bucha and other cities during the aggression against Ukraine, he said., CAROLYN SCHWALGER (New Zealand) said Russia is violating international humanitarian law every day the conflict in Ukraine continues. Pointing to the horrific reports of killings and other atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere, she said the Russian Federation has flagrantly and deliberately chosen to disregard its responsibilities as a member of the Human Rights Council and no longer deserves a seat at that table. Emphasizing the need to ensure that country is held accountable for its actions, she noted that New Zealand, alongside 41 other countries, has already referred atrocities in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court and supports all relevant investigations., COLLEN V. KELAPILE (Botswana), condemning attacks and all manner of violations of international humanitarian law, said his delegation is dismayed by the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha and joins the calls for an independent investigation that will result in full accountability on the part of those responsible. Welcoming the Human Rights Council’s active involvement in monitoring the human rights situation in Ukraine, he added that Botswana is confident there will be an objective appraisal of the human rights situation in that country and that the Human Rights Council will advise the General Assembly in a manner that will protect the integrity of the United Nations system., ION JINGA (Romania) noted the profoundly troubling reports of atrocities being committed against men, women and children in Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine. Such acts are not the actions of a rogue soldier or two, but rather part of a deeply troubling pattern, he said. The Russian authorities are responsible for atrocities that occurred while they had effective control of the areas concerned. The brutal aggression being carried out against Ukraine clearly demonstrates that the Russian Federation has violated its commitments as a member of the Human Rights Council. Therefore, it does not belong to this community, whose main aim is to protect human rights, he affirmed., ALEXANDER MARSCHIK (Austria), associating himself with the European Union, said it is vital that the Assembly live up to its responsibilities. While noting the importance of continued dialogue between members of the international community, he declared: “At the same time, however, we are convinced that there is no other way than to take a firm stand and to take decisive action on situations that clearly constitute a blatant violation of international law and a violation of the Charter of the United Nations.” What has been witnessed since the first days of the Russian aggression in Ukraine far surmounts the threshold needed for suspension of the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council. Echoing other speakers’ calls for accountability and support for the Commission of Inquiry, he said Austria nevertheless voted in favour of today’s resolution as the international community must take action., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland), associating himself with the European Union, described the images emerging from Bucha and other towns in the Kyiv region as “truly horrifying”. The Russian Federation authorities are responsible for the atrocities being witnessed, committed while they had effective control of the area. “They are therefore subject to the international law of occupation,” she said, adding that the Russian aggression constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. As a member of the Human Rights Council, the Russian Federation is obligated to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, but its unlawful actions in Ukraine have clearly made a mockery of that responsibility and severely undermine the integrity of the organ itself. Stressing that it is therefore unacceptable for Moscow to continue to hold its seat, she welcomed the Assembly’s decision to suspend it its membership., NOA FURMAN (Israel) said her delegation voted in favour of the resolution, but that should not be taken as tacit approval of the Human Rights Council, which has for too long lacked credibility and discriminated against one State — the only Jewish one. The Council is the clearest example of bias in the United Nations system, passing more resolutions targeting Israel than on Syria, Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea combined. Israel is the only country with a standing agenda item — item 7 — ensuring that it is singled out in every meeting. In 2021, the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel, did not even mention Hamas, she noted — an example of the Council’s absurdity. In 2006, Member States in the Assembly had hoped to replace the Council with something better, but they failed. Israel is assisting Ukraine, she said, expressing hope for the safety of all civilians and a peaceful resolution of the conflict., KYAW MOE TUN (Myanmar) said the United Nations is in crisis. The very purposes of maintaining international peace and security, as well as the territorial integrity of Member States, have been violated. Over the last few weeks, there has been unbearable suffering in Ukraine. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Civilian infrastructure has been damaged and destroyed. All of this can only be stopped with the end of the war itself. He called for the immediate cessation of aggression and attacks against Ukraine, describing the most recent videos coming from Bucha and elsewhere as “horrific”. It is clear that atrocities are being committed against Ukrainian citizens. The appalling killings of civilians must be independently investigated, and perpetrators must be held accountable and brought to justice. The images of Bucha are particularly relatable to the people of Myanmar, who have been experiencing massacre after massacre and atrocities by the illegal military junta against its own people., NICOLA TEGONI, observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta, said that last year, the Human Rights Council permitted 900 interventions from permanent observers, non-governmental organizations and civil societies in its deliberations — many of those contributions focusing on issues that have been highlighted by the situation in Ukraine, including human trafficking, the care and welfare of refugees, internally displaced civilian populations and the plight of migrants. He recalled that a record 82 million innocent civilians have, in recent years, been uprooted by crisis, while some 41 million people in 43 countries are on the brink of famine. He urged Member States, while deciding on weighty matters in the resolution, not to forget the raison d’être of the Assembly: ensuring a peaceful and secure world. “Let not our voices drown out the call for peace and security heard in the anguished tones and cries of ordinary people, homeless, injured and suffering, desperate to return to ordinary lives, within the secure sovereignty of their own borders,” he said., Ms. SOUREK, observer for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said the war of aggression waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine will certainly not stop as a result of Moscow’s membership suspension in the Human Right Council. Its continued presence would ultimately deliver a fatal blow to the already weakened credibility of this body. He expressed support for today’s decision and for a thorough revision of the criteria for States to be represented there. Allowing the Russian Federation and other authoritarian Governments to use the Human Rights Council as a platform to whitewash their dismal performance on human rights is a betrayal of United Nations principles and of the memory of the victims in Bucha. “Many of these victims will have no other grave but our memory,” he stressed., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that despite the Russian Federation’s attempt to spread disinformation, the world has seen the images from Bucha of lifeless bodies in the street, some apparently summarily executed with their hands tied behind their backs. There have been credible reports of landmines and booby traps left behind after the Russian Federation failed in its objectives and troops withdrew. On Wednesday, she saw an Associated Press photograph taken in Kyiv of a six-year-old boy standing in a garden next to his mother’s grave. One day, Ukraine’s infrastructure will be rebuilt, but there is no way to rebuild the lives destroyed by the Russian Federation. She said she was in Republic of Moldova and Romania a few days ago and met with women and children who shared stories of the violence committed by the Russian Federation. Despite everything they have been through, they are determined to return to a peaceful Ukraine. The Russian Federation must be held accountable, she said, noting that the world is looking to the United Nations and asking if it is prepared to meet this moment. “They are wondering if we are a platform for propaganda,” she said, or whether the Organization is prepared to live up to the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The United Nations took a step in the right direction by ensuring that violators of human rights will not be able to occupy a position of leadership on human rights, she said., *For information media.

More than a quarter of the population of Ukraine have been forced to flee their homes. As of today, more than 4.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 7.1 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine.
Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation.
Many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. We continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys.
UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and for neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., Key figures - UKRAINE, 154,232 people reached with essential food and non-food items, winter clothes and shelter materials, 36,009 people received protection assistance at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 33,706 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance. 4,700 already received first payment., 15,600 people received assistance through humanitarian convoys delivered to hard hit areas, 60 buildings assessed with local authorities and 12 already being refurbished and supported to increase accommodation capacity, 73 reception and collective centres equipped with essential items to increase capacity",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-7-6-april-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",7 Apr 2022,"As families fled west to escape fighting, Rymma Mytrak came up with a plan and with help from her neighbours opened a shelter for 80 people within days., By Victoria Andrievska in Velykyi Bereznyi, Ukraine | 07 April 2022, In late February, when Rymma Mytrak saw reports of families fleeing heavy fighting in other parts of Ukraine and moving west in search of safety, she decided to act., The 35-year-old former hairdresser knew from personal experience how important a place of safety is for those with nowhere else to go., “I am from an orphanage myself, so I felt I must do everything possible to help people who – like myself many years ago – needed support,” she explained., Mytrak decided to open a shelter for internally displaced people (IDPs) in her village Velykyi Bereznyi, close to Ukraine’s western border with Slovakia. With no property of her own, she shared her idea on social media and within days the village had rallied to convert an unused storage facility into a hostel for 80 people., “I made an announcement on Facebook about my plans to start a hostel. Four days later, we were already able to start hosting people,” she says., With limited equipment, Mytrak had to be creative to get the facility ready to receive its first guests. “In this room for example we made beds out of office desks. We used all the resources we had at hand.”, Another small room off the building’s long corridor has three sets of bunkbeds squeezed inside, and there is also a communal kitchen equipped with donated appliances and a dining hall with dozens of mismatched chairs arranged at long trestle tables., Mytrak was helped in her efforts by her husband Ruslan – a former military chaplain – and a group of willing volunteers that grew in number after the first families began to arrive., “There were 15 volunteers, all eager to help,” Mytrak says. “And those first IDPs who came here, they started to volunteer too.”, To manage the work involved in hosting, feeding, and taking care of so many people, Mytrak and her husband and two children moved into a room at the hostel which doubles as her office. Some of those who arrive move on after only a night, but many have remained for longer., Among them is Victor Nastych, who arrived with his wife and daughter after fleeing their home in Brovary, an eastern suburb of the capital Kyiv, and was grateful for the offer of accommodation and warm food., “I think there should be a monument glorifying Rymma,” Nastych says. “She has no property, no house. She does everything for people. She goes to the village council and asks for help. Many people know her and try to help.”, With an estimated 7.1 million people currently displaced inside Ukraine, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency is supporting the expansion and establishment of reception centres and providing relief items and other forms of support to those in need. So far, UNHCR has supported the expansion of more than 70 reception centres around the country, each of which can host around 250 displaced people., As part of these wider efforts, the agency recently provided the shelter in Velykyi Bereznyi with thermal blankets to help keep residents warm as nighttime temperatures drop close to freezing., “Every minute is stressful”, The team that delivered the blankets and met with residents to assess their needs included Nadiia Vakhovska, who recently joined UNHCR Ukraine and knows from personal experience what it means to flee your home., “In 2014, there was heavy fighting in Luhansk where I am from. Me and my husband packed a small bag and left, hoping we will come back in just a few weeks. But we never returned,” Vakhovska explains., She and her husband moved several times before settling in Bucha, a small town 30 kilometres from Kyiv, which in recent days has been the focus of global attention due to the horrific images of people’s bodies lying in the streets. The town was previously a haven for others displaced from eastern Ukraine in 2014 and 2015, who took advantage of the cheaper accommodation and proximity to the employment opportunities of the capital., When Bucha first came under heavy bombardment at the start of the current conflict, Vakhovska was forced to flee again when their house was irreparably damaged. Now, she hopes to use her experience to help others suffering displacement for the first time., “Knowing what it is to be a displaced person, I now can offer support and advise to other people,” Vakhovska says. “We overcame the consequences of the first displacement. It gives us hope that we will be able to manage the second displacement too. But despite having this experience and knowledge, it is very difficult and painful. Every minute is stressful.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-volunteer-rallies-village-welcome-displaced-families
WHO and Ukrainian health authorities - united in sustaining health services and medical supply lines on World Health Day and beyond [EN/UK],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Apr 2022,"Lviv, 7 April 2022 – Health system resilience amid the impact of war, urgent and growing needs for affected civilians, and WHO’s support at this time of challenge were center-stage as Ukraine’s Minister of Health, Viktor Liashko met with the World Health Organization’s Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge on World Health Day in Lviv, western Ukraine, where millions of people have sought refuge since the war started on 24 February., Dr Kluge is on a two-day visit to Ukraine to meet with representatives of the Ministry of Health, Ukrainian health professionals, WHO staff working on the emergency response as well as those directly impacted by the war., Mr Liashko and Dr Kluge visited different health facilities - a children’s hospital and an emergency hospital among them – thanking health workers for their lifesaving efforts and meeting with internally displaced Ukrainians in need of essential health services., “Every day I ascertain that our health workers are an example of sacrifice and heroism. They continue saving lives while under attack. Doctors shield pregnant women and newborns with their bodies, and emergency care physicians are the first to go to the hotspots in the country, but none of them have left their jobs. This is an example for the whole Europe and the world,” said Viktor Liashko, the Minister of Health of Ukraine., “I am here in Ukraine to stand in solidarity with the health care workers in the country. I thank them for their dedication and professionalism – as they continue to deliver care in the face of unimaginable human suffering and in scenes of total devastation - that no nurse, doctor, midwife, ambulance driver, pharmacist, therapist or social worker should ever have to experience,” said Dr Kluge., WHO has operated in Ukraine since 1994, working closely with the Ministry of Health to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system - and swiftly respond., “Our preparation for a potential catastrophic health emergency, including the prepositioning of supplies, actually started years ago, when hostilities occurred in eastern Ukraine. Since the current war broke out, we’ve massively scaled up our operations. Our focus is not only on ensuring that the wounded are cared for but also on maintaining essential health services. That means that all those with chronic conditions have access to medicines and medical services, and that hospitals are stocked to remain operational,” Dr Kluge added., In the past six weeks, WHO has reached at least a half-million people and delivered approximately 180 metric tonnes of medical supplies to health-care facilities nationwide, including in Cherkasy, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odessa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhya and Zhytomyr., The shipments include trauma and emergency surgery kits, emergency medical supplies and medicines to support surgical and primary health care needs. WHO also monitors and verifies attacks on health, and has, as of April 6, verified 91 attacks on health care that have caused 73 deaths and 46 injuries., The number of internally displaced people, forcibly displaced by hostilities, now exceeds 7 million. According to IOM, 32% of households of internally displaced people report having a chronically ill family member, 20% a disabled one, and 56% an elderly family member. Also, in more than 60% of the households that are forcibly displaced, there is one child or more, aged 5-18., - For further information: eupress@who.int, Tetiana Dolhova, Communication Officer, WHO Ukraine: dolhovat@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-and-ukrainian-health-authorities-united-sustaining-health-services-and-medical
"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (26 March - 1 April 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,7 Apr 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued into its sixth week. Rallies in solidarity with Ukraine, as well as against rising fuel prices, continued throughout the region. In France, a police shooting in Aulnay-sous-Bois sparked rioting in Paris. Meanwhile, fighting decreased along the Azerbaijan-Artsakh Line of Contact following an escalation in violence the week prior., In Ukraine, Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in the north of the country last week, amid the partial withdrawal of Russian forces in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. On 29 March, Russia announced that it will significantly cut military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine, citing the need for de-escalation for the progress of Ukraine-Russia negotiations (RFE/RL, 29 March 2022). Despite Russian claims of de-escalation, analysts suggest that they are likely to redeploy the withdrawn troops to southern and eastern regions of Ukraine (ISW, 29 March 2022). This is in line with the statement from the Russian Minister of Defense, who claims that the current goal of the Russian military operation is to force Ukraine out of the Donbas region (BBC, 29 March 2022). The withdrawal of Russian forces comes only days after successful Ukrainian counterattacks in the region, with further Ukraine offensive operations occurring last week. By 2 April, the Kyiv region was fully cleared of Russian troops, as was much of the Chernihiv and Sumy regions (RFE/RL, 2 April 2022; BBC, 5 April 2022)., The pullback of Russian troops from northern Ukraine has revealed numerous war crimes committed by Russian soldiers in the previously occupied territories, including looting, abduction, torture, rape, and the killing of civilians (HRW, 3 April 2022). Mass graves and hundreds of executed civilians were discovered in the town of Bucha in the Kyiv region (Washington Post, 3 April 2022). Similar violence against civilians was uncovered in the neighboring settlements of Irpin, Hostomel, Borodianka, and Motyzhyn (Suspilne Media, 4 April 2022)., Meanwhile, heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week, contributing to the 159% increase in violence in Ukraine last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map.1 The heavy bombardment and siege of Mariupol in the Donetsk region continued last week. Around 130,000 civilians remain in Mariupol with no access to electricity, heating, food, and water, as evacuation efforts were slowed down by the destruction of all remaining evacuation buses in the city (Ukrinform, 5 April 2022). According to the city mayor, around 5,000 residents, including more than 200 children, have been killed since the siege of Mariupol began on 2 March (Novoye Vremya Ukraine, 28 March 2022).2, As Ukraine continues to be littered with explosive devices, three civilians died and 13 were wounded last week in mine explosions in the Sumy, Zaporizhia, and Kharkiv regions. Russian forces also continue the heavy shelling of the Kharkiv region, often using indiscriminate cluster munitions and targeting residential areas (UN News, 30 March 2022; Suspilne Media, 24 March 2022). Local police have confirmed that at least 365 civilians have been killed in the Kharkiv region between 24 February and 29 March, although the true number could be much higher (Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, 2 April 2022). These trends contribute to the 3115% increase in violence in the Kharkiv region last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month (for more information, visit ACLED's Ukraine Crisis hub, which offers curated data, an interactive dashboard, the latest analysis, and more)., The Russian retreat from the northern regions in Ukraine also comes amid ongoing acts of railway sabotage in Belarus, complicating the supply and movement of Russian troops. Last week, Belarusian troops shot at individuals trying to destroy two relay boxes on the railway section near the Babino stop near Babruysk (Nasha Niva, 31 March 2022). Around 38 railway workers were also arrested last week as authorities try to crack down on potential ""railway partisans"" (TUT.BY, 30 March 2022; Nasha Niva, 30 March 2022). Meanwhile, reported incidents of violence against detained anti-government activists by prison guards increased last week, particularly in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. While violence in Minsk has not been common lately, it has become increasingly volatile, resulting in a shift from a place of 'low risk' to being considered an area of 'growing risk' by ACLED's Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., People continued to hold demonstrations in Ukraine against the Russian invasion last week. The majority of demonstrations concentrated in the Kherson region, which is almost entirely occupied by Russian troops. Though fewer in number than in previous weeks, demonstration events in solidarity with Ukraine also took place throughout the region, including in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom., Demonstrations against price hikes associated with the increased cost of fuel also continued to be recorded across the region last week. In Northern Cyprus, about 15,000 Turkish Cypriots marched during a general strike against price hikes and the government's policies, demanding their resignation (Detay, 1 April 2022). The mass strike-demonstration affected private and public sector services, including municipalities, hospitals, and schools (Detay, 1 April 2022). This demonstration follows various similar, smaller demonstrations, mostly in Nicosia in previous days. Demonstrations against rising fuel prices were also held in Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, France, Germany, Italy, and Portugal. In Spain, transport workers continued to demonstrate, although at lower levels, under the Platform for the Defense of the Freight Transport Sector., Meanwhile, in France, rioting took place over several days in the Sevran, Aulnay-sous-Bois, and Tremblay-en-France banlieues (outer suburbs) of Paris, Ile-de-France, in response to a police killing last week. On 26 March, a police officer shot a man dead at close range after responding to a call for a stolen vehicle in Aulnay-sous-Bois (Le Monde, 30 March 2022). Relations between communities living in the banlieues and the police have long been fraught, with the majority-immigrant communities facing inequality, stigmatization, and discrimination (The Guardian, 22 October 2015). During the rioting, rioters clashed with police and burned buildings and vehicles, contributing to the 414% increase in violence in Ile-de-France last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in Ile-de-France in the past month., Along the Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations decreased last week after escalating the week prior. Fighting continued to center around Parukh village in the Askeran region of Artsakh, which Azerbaijani troops entered on 24 March. This contributed to the 157% increase in violence in Azerbaijan and Artsakh last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-26-march-1-april-2022

We have purchased and distributed aid according to the needs on the ground. With the help of our partners, we’re continuing to distribute aid to the Kyiv region and to the inhabitants of war-torn villages and towns in the east of the country, where food and other materials are most needed., ""We are able to transport large amounts of freight most efficiently by rail. There is still a shortage of basic food and hygiene products in places of fighting or in places where the Russian army has recently withdrawn, so we would like to continue to run three trains a week in the coming period,"" says Petr Drbohlav, PIN Regional Director for Eastern Partnership and Balkans., Twenty-six trucks loaded with aid were sent to Lviv, where the cargo was transferred to smaller cars for distribution to villages and towns in western Ukraine. This aid was mostly hygiene supplies, but it also included equipment for collective centres where refugees from other parts of Ukraine are taking refuge., We continue to deliver aid to the most affected areas in the east. On Thursday, 31 March, trucks delivered food and hygiene supplies for 4,000 people to the besieged town of Sumy in the northeast of the country. The shipment was part of a UN convoy that delivered food, hygiene kits, medicines, medical kits, blankets and bottled water to the town. Thanks to the efforts of our colleagues in Ukraine, thousands of people, including particularly vulnerable groups such as children and hospital patients, are receiving much-needed aid in the places hardest hit by the war in Ukraine., More aid for 5,500 people arrived on 5 April in Severodonetsk in Luhansk Oblast. This oblast is currently the most affected by the fighting, and thousands of people are cut off from gas and water supplies. Civilians mostly remain in their homes and bunkers awaiting help. The PIN supplied aid was provided as part of a UN-organised convoy that delivered food rations, flour, plastic sheeting, blankets, and four hospital electricity generators., HELPING IN THE WORST AFFECTED AREAS OF UKRAINE, TOTAL VALUE OF AID: €2 234 176, Since the invasion, we have financially supported nearly 150 smaller NGOs working on the ground inside Ukraine. We have provided €1 548 519 to these organisations so far. This money has been used to buy and distribute food parcels, water, and infant formula; these local partners are also equipping bomb shelters to protect people during the fighting. We are also financially supporting associations that are equipping collective centres for internal refugees., We’re giving financial support to two thousand of the most vulnerable people. From our experience in other conflicts, we know how important it is to give people cash to buy the essentials themselves. We plan cash distributions as part of our support in places where the market is at least partially functioning., In addition, we are equipping collective centres for IDPs in western Ukraine. In the last week, we have equipped these temporary accommodations—for people fleeing the war—with mattresses, washing machines, electric stoves, blankets, and baby diapers, for example. In total, we‘ve already helped several thousand vulnerable people with similar equipment., In the east, we continue to distribute hygiene kits with a particular focus on the needs of people with disabilities. Together with partner organisations, we are supplying people in the worst affected areas with durable food and water. We have distributed financial aid to more than 1,000 people in the east and another 1,000 in the west., HELPING WITH THE REFUGEE CRISIS IN MOLDOVA, TOTAL VALUE OF AID: €146 745 (AID TO MOLDOVA €78 208, AID TO ROMANIA €68 537), In Moldova, which has received the largest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita of any country, we’re financially supporting local NGOs. Since the invasion, we have awarded grants to fifteen organisations. The People in Need team has been working in Moldova since 2003, so we know the local context well and have extensive experience with many local organisations., One organisation we’ve supported is running a psychosocial centre; another is taking care of child leukaemia patients who need to be moved from a bombed hospital to safety. We’re also financially supporting an organisation helping members of the Roma community., In Moldova, only 5% of refugees live in state-run facilities. 95% of refugees are accommodated in the households of ordinary Moldovans. Providing facilities for refugees is financially challenging, which is why People in Need, in partnership with the UN World Food Programme, is focusing on setting up financial support for people who house refugees. This assistance will be paid for by the WFP and EU ECHO—the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department., IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, WE’RE HELPING IN HALF OF THE REGIONS, TOTAL AMOUNT OF AID: €1 152 268 (MILLIONS OF CROWNS IN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PLEDGED TO PROVEN ORGANISATIONS), Our colleagues are helping to run the Regional Assistance Centres for Ukrainians, and they’re helping with other integration points: they’re providing information, advice, checking offers of accommodations, translation, looking after children and continuing to cooperate with other organisations. However, we‘re still dealing with hundreds of individual requests for assistance. We are creating Ukrainian teams in our branches; for example, in Kladno, we have hired three new Ukrainian field workers., In Beroun, we have created a platform for cooperation between the municipality, NGOs and other entities that support refugees. Our Pilsen branch is now in charge of organising the integration centre there. In Prague, in cooperation with other NGOs, we continue to monitor and support the responsiveness of the city districts to the challenges presented by the influx of refugees., We’re financially supporting aid organisations across the country, In the cases of acute need, we have used the emergency appeal funds to manage situations that have no other support. So far, we‘ve supported forty-nine helping entities. Smaller local grants help bridge funding gaps for activities at schools or children's centres. We‘ve also helped schools and organisations with project applications to join Ministry of Education programmes that provide adaptation activities., For example, the money from the SOS Ukraine emergency appeal helped provide childcare and the operation of the children's corner of the regional assistance centre, a children's adaptation group, and the implementation of leisure activities and Czech language courses for Ukrainians. A significant cost was the purchasing of food, hygiene products, mattresses, bed linen and towels. We also participated in financing the purchase of a van to transport material and food aid. We’ve also paid for the operation of professional psychotherapeutic assistance and crisis intervention in Ukrainian and Russian languages—conducted mainly by Ukrainian therapists., We’ve talked to hundreds of people on the Ukraine helpline, People fleeing from the violence in Ukraine are being assisted by our multilingual counsellors on our free helpline number 770 600 800. Over the past month, PIN supported counsellors have dealt with hundreds of requests regarding accommodation, interpretation of the Lex (Ukrainian law), residency complications and health care issues. We’re providing counselling, which is often accompanied by social work. With some of the people who have called us, we solved their problems within several days., We are trying to facilitate the entry of Ukrainian children into Czech schools, We’re helping families enrol their children in primary schools and borrow laptops needed to participate in Ukrainian-led online classes. In some cities, we’re planning to open adaptation groups with leisure activities and an accompanying programme aimed at developing speech skills., We’re preparing Czech teachers, and we want to involve Ukrainian teachers as soon as possible, which we are working on intensively. We are inviting applications for the positions of Education Support and Career Counselling staff who will specifically assist pupils and students coming from Ukraine., We are continuing our regular debate programme for schools, Studio JSNS, where students can ask journalists, psychologists, and representatives of aid organisations questions about the war in Ukraine live on air., We want to improve the integration system and provide feedback from the field, Together with other organisations supporting municipalities, communities and families fleeing the war, we coordinate and meet regularly with the leadership of the National Center for Assistance to Ukrainians. We very much welcome information from the Minister of the Interior Vit Rakusan that strategic material is being prepared for the second phase of assistance. We want to improve the system and provide feedback from the field., A clear division of tasks between municipalities, regions, relevant ministries, and central coordination will help to better manage the risks that the current situation entails. As most refugees are mothers with children, i.e., particularly vulnerable people, maximum attention must be paid to their protection., CONTACTS, ASYLUM AND TRAVEL FROM UKRAINE OFFERS AND REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE

This could be carried out against civilians in a smaller strategic town., Summary, • Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv following a declaration that they would focus on the Donbas region., • Evidence of “war crimes” was reported on 02/03 April after the Ukrainians retook Bucha., • Widespread damage and destruction on health facilities suggest further war crimes from targeted and indiscriminate use of air strikes and artillery in many of the larger and besieged cities. These need further investigation., • Russian attempts to link the eastern region of Donbas (see map) with the southern area of Crimea would allow it to concentrate on a smaller area,, • They need to take Mariupol to provide a land bridge, where civilians remain, despite international efforts to evacuate them. The Russians have now resorted to tried and tested methods of heavy artillery and air strikes., • Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out “executions” in Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha, with at least 421 bodies found by 03 April., • Evidence is emerging of sexual violence by armed forces targetting women and girls hiding in shelters., • Russian denials of such reports of war crimes is an established modus operandi that the Kremlin has used in Chechnya, Grozny and Syria., • Although Russia has been accused of considering the use of Chemical Weapons (CW), this is unlikely due to the risks to their own troops; they could look to fire white phosphorus or conventional high-explosives against a number of chemical plants., • Likely that a protracted conflict will continue for many months yet before serious peace talks are considered by either side., • Mariupol may still hold for several weeks to a month despite the warnings of an imminent collapse, though Russia will achieve a significant tactical advantage if it is able to capture Kramatorsk., • Further Russian war crimes are likely to be uncovered as Ukrainian forces move further into northern Ukraine, however President Putin is highly unlikely to be indicted., • The use of a supposedly “accidental” incident using CW continues to rise which will increase further if efforts by Russian ground forces stall once again in the East.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-flash-analysis-and-prediction-07-april-2022

This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 7 April (local time), 167 children had been killed and at least 297 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-6-april-2022-enruuk

Food and Nutrition",7 Apr 2022,"DILI – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today welcomed a US$ 1.5 million donation from the Government of Timor-Leste for the agency’s humanitarian response in Ukraine. “This donation is for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, including people uprooted from their homes and are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance both inside and outside of the country,” said Fidelis Leite Magalhaes, Minister for Presidency of the Council of Ministers., “As a country shares the painful past caused by war and conflict, we understand the impact of the current crisis is having on the Ukrainian people. We hope our contribution can bring some relief to them,” he added., Since the onset of the conflict, WFP has provided life-saving food assistance to more than one million people in Ukraine. WFP is scaling up its response, aiming to reach up to 6 million people in-country in the next three months, and to support 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers who fled to neighbouring countries., “Timor-Leste is very concerned with the current situation in Ukraine. War and conflict benefits no one and leads to widespread suffering. We hope peace may soon prevail for Ukraine and its people,” said Juliao da Silva, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation., The conflict is driving up already high food prices, threatening food security for millions of families across the globe.

UNICEF and World Scouting join forces to support refugee children and families fleeing war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,7 Apr 2022,"Empowering young people engaging in humanitarian action through support and education, GENEVA/BRUSSELS, 7 April 2022 – UNICEF and the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) today launched a regional cooperation agreement to provide critical care and support to children and families fleeing the war in Ukraine., More than 4 million people – including more than 2 million children - have crossed from Ukraine into neighbouring countries to escape the escalating violence and destruction, leaving their lives and their possessions behind. 90 per cent of the refugee population are women and children. The partnership will enable both organisations to scale-up their responses to work to ensure those who are most in need of support can receive it., Joint activities will work to address the urgent needs of refugee women and children in both neighbouring countries - Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, and Slovakia, as well as countries where refugees are continuing their journey, including the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania., “We are delighted to reinforce our partnership with UNICEF at this important moment in Europe’s history,” said Abir Koubaa, Regional Director for the European Scout Region of WOSM. “Scouts were among the first responders to the crisis on the ground and continue to work in significant numbers together. Together with UNICEF we can scale-up these short-term responses while also strengthening our educational methods practices to ensure they can be adapted to the humanitarian situation.”, “This partnership will be critical in providing children and families affected by the devastating war in Ukraine with support and care in the coming weeks and months,” said Philippe Cori, UNICEF Deputy Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. “Empowering children and young people – not only Ukrainians but also those from refugee-hosting countries - to play an active and engaged role in this work will have huge long-term benefits.”, “In Ukraine and throughout neighbouring countries, we have been galvanized by the rapid humanitarian responses of so many young people and organisations,” said Srinath Tirumale, Regional Director for the Eurasia Scout Region of WOSM. “Scouting is proud to to announce this new partnership with UNICEF to deliver needed impact, support and relief on the ground.”, The partnership will support the ongoing efforts of national authorities in the refugee-hosting countries, by linking displaced women and children to the services operated by public institutions. Direct support will also be provided to Scout groups working inside Ukraine to support children and families who are displaced or seeking safety., The cooperation agreement, which is set to continue until July 2023, will initially focus on addressing the immediate needs of refugees. Activities will include the provision of critical and life-saving information to women and children after their arrival, relocation, and settlement. In addition, UNICEF will also support the provision of emergency supplies for refugees distributed by Scouts, as well as temporary accommodation. The existing strength of the Scout Movement in the promotion of well-being will be critical in empowering and supporting young people to feel safe and supported in their new communities and equip them with the skills they need to navigate the coming period of their lives., At the same time, UNICEF and WOSM are working together with other youth networks to engage and empower young people from Ukraine and refugee-hosting countries in the wider response, as well as to ensure their voices are heard in discussions around decisions affecting them. This includes highlighting UNICEF’s U-Report Europe, a digital youth engagement platform. U-Report, first launched in 2011 and now active in more than 95 countries, is an instant messaging platform that uses different tools to link young users with information about the services available to them in the country they are in. These include protection services, legal support, health care services and information, and much more., Beyond the immediate response, WOSM will also work towards creating peer-support volunteers to help adolescent refugees as they integrate into their new host communities. Activities will take a hybrid approach, combining Scouting’s educational method and the humanitarian and adolescent programming expertise brought by UNICEF. This will also make use of the UNICEF Adolescent Kit for Expression and Innovation – a package of guidance, tools, activities, and supplies for promoting the psychosocial support and wellbeing of adolescents affected by humanitarian crises and will involve young Ukrainians in activities and skills building opportunities offered by the Scouts, thus bringing refugees and host communities closer together. Activities will include daily programmes run by the Scouts, national events and regular projects and local actions., Media contacts, Filippo Oggioni Regional Communication Specialist UNICEF ECARO Email: foggioni@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-and-world-scouting-join-forces-support-refugee-children-and-families-fleeing

Plan International warns of a rapidly deteriorating situation for children and families stranded in areas that are encircled with a lack of safe exit routes, facing a daily challenge for survival with limited access to water, food and warmth., Stephen Omollo, CEO, Plan International said “We stand in solidarity with everyone whose lives are being torn apart by the conflict in Ukraine. We are calling for an immediate end to fighting and long-term peace for the sake of all children and young people. We must act now before more lives are lost.”, Through this conflict, humanitarian needs are multiplying by the hour. People who have been forced to flee have left with whatever they can carry - they urgently need shelter, protection, blankets, food, water and medical assistance, and emotional care and support., Dr Unni Krishnan, Global Humanitarian Director, Plan International said: “We are hearing stories of unprecedented human suffering in scale and intensity. Some children are impacted by a second violent conflict and uprooted for the second time in a short lifespan. It is critical that this conflict ends”, “Repeated incidents of missile strikes, bombing and gun fighting in conflicts and wars take a heavy toll on young minds. Left unattended, such violence leaves lasting footprints on their mental health.”, Plan International is working closely with local organisations to help children impacted by the conflict and in desperate need of humanitarian assistance and protection. We are working with organisations in Moldova, Poland and Romania to ensure that children and families receive help as they cross the border from Ukraine., In Germany, Plan International is coordinating with authorities and working with partners in child protection, to provide child-friendly spaces and activities, and provide psychosocial and psychological support for refugee and displaced children and their families., A team from Plan International is in Ukraine to meet with civil society and humanitarian agencies to identify how best to support and strengthen their response., Speaking ahead of Stand Up For Ukraine, the global pledging event for refugees and internally displaced people to take place in Warsaw on 9th April, Dr Krishnan urged donors to prioritise the needs of children, especially girls, in their funding decisions., Dr Krishnan said*: “Ensuring flexible funding from donors is critical to ensure that the response can adapt to a situation that is changing daily”.*, Plan International welcomes the massive and rapid support for the humanitarian crisis arising out of the conflict in Ukraine., Dr Krishan continued: “All funds to alleviate the suffering and of people affected by the conflict in Ukraine must be additional and must not be diverted from other under-funded humanitarian crises taking place globally”., “This conflict has put children and young people, particularly girls, at significant risk of violence. It is essential that urgent support is delivered to provide**holistic programmes to prevent and respond to all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and violence against children.”, The protection and safety of children on the move must be a top priority. Plan International is particularly concerned about the protection and safety of separated or unaccompanied children, especially girls and young women, who are more vulnerable to abuse and trafficking., Millions of children are witnessing the horror of this conflict. The violence will take a heavy toll on the mental health of children, young people and their caregivers. Plan International is supporting organisations to provide psychosocial support to help children begin to deal with the horrors they have witnessed and start on the path to recover from their distress., The conflict in Ukraine has disrupted the education of a generation of children. Getting children back to learning is critical to provide a protective space and a sense of normality. Plan International is working with government authorities and organisations in Moldova, Poland and Romania to support the integration of refugee children into local schools., Read more about Plan International’s response in ‘Through the eyes of a girl: Children’s lives impacted by the crisis in Ukraine’., For more information or interviews, please contact:, Kathryn Irwin

"In solidarity with the health workers of Ukraine this World Health Day: Statement by WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge",News and Press Release,WHO,Health,7 Apr 2022,"L'viv, 7 April 2022, I am speaking to you today from the city of L’viv in Western Ukraine, from where WHO is coordinating its activities within the country., Today is World Health Day, the day on which the World Health Organization was founded 74 years ago in the aftermath of the Second World War, to uphold the principle that health is a human right, and all people should enjoy the highest standard of health., As a doctor myself, I am here in Ukraine to stand in solidarity with the health care workers in the country. I thank them for their dedication and professionalism – as they continue to deliver care in the face of unimaginable human suffering and in scenes of total devastation - that no nurse, doctor, midwife, ambulance driver, pharmacist, therapist or social worker should ever have to experience., This visit provides me with a unique opportunity to talk to frontline health workers, patients, local and national authorities and gather insights on the immediate and longer-term health needs in the country, and to find the best ways for WHO and its partners to deliver assistance., On this World Health Day, I reiterate WHO’s determination to provide health for all – wherever they are across the 53 countries of Europe and Central Asia. We seek to ensure that everyone, in whatever circumstances, will not be deprived of the medicines, treatment and care they may need., I stand with our Director-General, who has consistently called on the Russian Federation for a humanitarian ceasefire, which includes unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in urgent need., In the current situation, WHO’s overarching goal is to ensure that people have sustained access to essential health care, and that we can respond to changing health needs due to the war., Our activities are based around three priorities:, Firstly, to keep health services operational in Ukraine. Even before 24 February, we were prepositioning supplies, and since then we have been working closely with national and local authorities and more than 80 partners to maintain services across the country., We have delivered over 185 tonnes of medical supplies to the hardest hit areas on the country, reaching half-a-million people with materials to support trauma, surgery and primary health care. Last week, we were able to bring in supplies to the encircled city of Sumy. A further 125 tonnes of essential items are also on their way. Assistive products – wheelchairs, other mobility aids, communication aids for the blind, are in transit, and will be distributed across Ukraine soon., An estimated 260,000 people are living with HIV in Ukraine. Just this week, together with the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Ukrainian authorities and partners, we have made sure that the supply of antiretroviral drugs to cover the needs of every person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine will be met for the next 12 months., We have a fully-functional office in L’viv, and are setting up an operational base in Dnipro, in East-Central Ukraine to mobilize resources more quickly and reach some of the most vulnerable people in conflict zones with urgent supplies., Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse. WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults., Our second priority isto work with Ukraine’s neighbours, with countries across the entire European Region and beyond, to ensure that the health needs of those fleeing the war are met, treatment and care for refugees with special needs are maintained, and that the health systems of host countries can manage these large influxes of people., So far, more than 4.2 million people have fled Ukraine since 24 February. I thank the destination countries across the Region for their commitment to extend health services to those arriving, but acknowledge that providing this is challenging and stretching already over-burdened systems. We are working with national authorities to bridge gaps and help deliver supplies where needed, for services such as routine child immunization., WHO is also coordinating with the European Union to triage patients arriving, to make sure that they are received in an EU country that is best placed to treat them., We are channeling support from further afield. The Asia-Europe Foundation has provided $9.5 million from Japan to procure much needed equipment and provide services to manage COVID-19 as well as communicable diseases including measles and polio - for Ukraine and its neighbours., Thirdly, we are supporting the Ministry of Health to rebuild Ukraine’s health system back better. WHO has had a presence on the ground in Ukraine since 1994, supporting the country to strengthen its health system especially the primary healthcare and health financing., Since 2015, and until 24 February this year, the Government of Ukraine had been in the process of reforming the entire health system, moving towards Universal Health Coverage. The country had been making excellent progress on specific challenges – turning the corner in its fight against TB and HIV. It was a beacon of best practice in Eastern Europe, with TB incidence falling by almost half in the past 15 years, thanks to investment in modern diagnostic technologies to rapidly identify TB infection, and effective treatment regimens for multi drug-resistance TB (MDR-TB)., Despite the war, we are determined to support Ukraine and not lose this momentum., WHO is preparing to redeploy teams throughout the country as access and security improves. We are committed to work through a strong decentralized footprint, both during the current humanitarian response, but to also be there with local and national authorities to rebuild the war-torn health system., Health requires peace, well-being requires hope, and healing requires time., I speak on behalf of the entire WHO family when I say that it is my deepest wish that this war comes to an end swiftly, without further loss of life. Tragically, this is not the reality we see., As of today, WHO has verified 91 attacks on health, routine immunization coverage for polio and measles is below the threshold for population immunity, 50% of Ukraine’s pharmacies are presumed closed and 1,000 health facilities are in proximity to conflict areas or in changed areas of control. Roughly 80,000 babies will be born over the next 3 months with insufficient pre-and post-natal care available due to the ongoing conflict., In these dark days, let me reassure you that WHO is committed to be in Ukraine in the short and long term – addressing immediate health challenges, and future reconstruction needs. I would like once again to express my deep admiration to all health workers in Ukraine for protecting the health of the people., Our mandate and humanitarian principles call on us to ensure health for all – including the poor and most vulnerable – wherever they may be., We have prepared for different eventualities, anticipating that health challenges will get worse before they get better., But as WHO’s long history and experience shows, they will eventually get better., The life-saving medicine Ukraine needs right now is peace., ENDS, This statement was delivered to the press in L'viv, Ukraine, on 7 April 2022., Multimedia content available here., eupress@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/solidarity-health-workers-ukraine-world-health-day-statement-who-regional-director

Shelter and Non-Food Items",6 Apr 2022,"La Institución cuenta ya con una cartera de 18 proyectos para la primera atención, y la inserción social a medio-largo plazo, 16 personas de Cruz Roja Española se han desplegado a las zonas afectadas, 6 de abril de 2022. Ya ha pasado más de un mes desde que la situación de conflicto en Ucrania escalara y comenzara el abandono masivo de personas del país, buscando seguridad y refugio en países colindantes, principalmente, pero también en otros de la Unión Europea. En España, más de 33.000 personas ya han sido atendidas en todo el territorio nacional en este primer mes de conflicto, y cerca de 11.000 han sido alojadas en recursos gestionados por la Organización. Para hacerlo posible, Cruz Roja ha movilizado a más de 2.100 personas voluntarias que participan en tareas de logística, traducción, cobertura de las necesidades básicas, información jurídica o atención a la infancia, entre otras., Desde que escalara el conflicto, más de 250 también han solicitado el servicio ‘Restablecimiento del contacto familiar’, una herramienta que trabaja en colaboración con todo el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja para poner en contacto a personas que, en este caso por la situación en Ucrania, lo han perdido., Del mismo modo, cerca de 9.000 personas han solicitado de manera telefónica o vía redes sociales algún tipo de demanda informativa o de asesoramiento en este contexto, y más de 6.100 han sido trasladadas por equipos de Cruz Roja desde los puntos de llegas más habituales hasta los destinos en los que pernoctan o se alojan., En cuanto a los niños y niñas, son más de 4.300 los que han podido evadirse de esta situación con las actividades de entretenimiento de Cruz Roja Juventud y sus Equipos de Sensibilización e Información en Emergencias, quienes, además, atienden sus demandas adaptando la respuesta a su edad y necesidades, y les informan de manera sencilla lo que está ocurriendo si lo necesitan., Cabe destacar que Cruz Roja, antes de la escalada del conflicto, preparó una respuesta ante posibles escenarios como el que se vive a día de hoy: preparó recursos de alojamiento y albergue, se preparó logísticamente, y preactivó a su voluntariado, especialmente a cerca de 200 personas que hablasen ucraniano o fueran nativas de este país, para, así, realizar una atención efectiva en su idioma y comprendiendo su cultura y posibles problemas a detectar entre la población llegada., Hoy en día, el idioma no está siendo una barrera para dar respuesta a las demandas de la población atendida, e incluso Cruz Roja ha puesto a disposición de quienes lo necesiten su atención telefónica habitual (900 22 11 22) en ucraniano las 24 horas del día, sumando este idioma a los oficiales en España, el inglés y el francés habituales., Cruz Roja calcula que 18 mi8llones de personas están afectadas por el conflicto, y que más de 4,21 millones de personas han cruzado las fronteras, más de la mitad hacia Polonia (2,45 mill.)., La respuesta internacional de Cruz Roja Española Cruz Roja Española ha desplegado a 16 personas para participar en la respuesta coordinada del Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. Entre las tareas que realizan, se encuentran las logísticas, las de coordinación, la gestión de voluntariado, la coordinación de distribuciones, la protección e inclusión de género, además de las sanitarias a través de su ERU (Unidad de Respuesta en Emergencias) de Salud. Se encuentran en Ucrania, Polonia, Hungría y Moldavia., En remoto desde el país también participa más personal: un equipo para el soporte del desarrollo de un software para la gestión de voluntariado convergente internacional, y otro equipo SIMS Officer, con el soporte al equipo de Gestión de la Información., Además, se ha realizado ya el envío de 16.000 toldos plásticos, más de 5.000 kits de cocina, cerca de 10.000 mantas y 13.500 esterillas, y se ha dado apoyo directo a la Cruz Roja Ucraniana y la Cruz roja Danesa, en la región de Chernivtsi, suroeste de Ucrania y frontera con Rumanía., Todo ello ha permitido ya que se hayan movilizado más de 1.200 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria, y se hayan atendido a más de 120.000 personas, de las cuales, 3.800 reciben apoyo psicosocial., La atención de Cruz Roja a las personas refugiadas Una de las principales labores que está desarrollando Cruz Roja en España es la atención, desde su llegada, a las personas provenientes de la zona de conflicto. Desde que se detectaran llegadas, se han desplegado dispositivos especiales de acogida en los principales aeropuertos del país, así como en estaciones de tren, para su primera asistencia., Cabe destacar que una parte de las personas procedentes de Ucrania tienen familiares o una red de contactos en España con la que alojarse, por lo que se les presta una primera atención, apoyo en el traslado (si lo necesitan) y asesoría legal para acogerse a la protección temporal de acuerdo a la directiva de la Unión Europea, y no requieren de atención adicional; otra parte de las personas que llegan requieren de apoyo en alojamiento, y en coordinación con el programa de Acogida y Protección Internacional del Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones, son derivadas a recursos de acogida de Cruz Roja, entre otras organizaciones., Cruz Roja atiende a las personas con protección temporal procedentes de Ucrania en base a siete ejes prioritarios, con un nivel de intensidad reforzada para los perfiles de mayor vulnerabilidad; estos siete ejes atienden la cobertura personalizada de las necesidades básicas, el fortalecimiento de su bienestar emocional, la asistencia jurídica en el proceso de solicitud de Protección Internacional, el refuerzo de competencias y habilidades para la autonomía personal, la creación de itinerarios para la inserción laboral, la creación de redes con la sociedad de acogida y el fomento de una participación ciudadana igualitaria, y el refuerzo y apoyo en la escolarización para garantizar el éxito escolar., El Sistema Estatal de Acogida de Acogida e Integración de personas beneficiarias y solicitantes de Protección Internacional se articula en dos grandes fases. La primera consta de la acogida en el centro; la fase de acogida tiene un carácter estatal, y su objetivo es garantizar tanto la cobertura de las necesidades básicas como el fortalecimiento de las competencias personales para una vida autónoma en la sociedad de acogida, mediante el apoyo social, jurídico, psicológico, laboral o de aprendizaje del idioma. La segunda parte trabaja la preparación para la autonomía; se pone en marcha solo cuando las personas han recibido una resolución favorable a su solicitud de Protección Internacional. En ese caso, aunque finalicen su estancia en el dispositivo de acogida, pueden seguir necesitando apoyo para la cobertura de sus necesidades básicas, el fortalecimiento de sus competencias y el seguimiento de su proceso de integración socio laboral., En este contexto, la Institución ha puesto en marcha una cartera de proyectos que van desde la primera acogida de emergencia (un mes), hasta la asistencia legal, la atención psicológica, el aprendizaje del idioma, la traducción e interpretación, o la orientación laboral básica, pasando por las ayudas de manutención temporal, las ayudas al alquiler o el equipamiento de centros para su correcta atención, en recursos de protección temporal. Del mismo modo, esta cartera de proyectos cuenta con espacios de ludoteca para menores, el restablecimiento del contacto familiar, o la adquisición y envío de elementos de primera necesidad para la población afectada a nivel internacional. Son, en total, 18 proyectos diferentes que buscan minimizar el impacto de la situación en las personas afectadas, y ayudarles a su inserción social y recuperación en su nuevo entorno., Célula ‘Crisis Ucrania’, Cruz Roja ha puesto en marcha a principios del mes de marzo la Célula de ‘Crisis Ucrania’, en la sede central de Cruz Roja Española, para la detección y cobertura de necesidades vinculadas al conflicto., A través de esta célula, se detectan las demandas en tiempo real, en coordinación con toda su red territorial de Asambleas y voluntariado, y se ponen en marcha los dispositivos de atención necesarios para dar la mejor y más eficaz respuesta en el menor tiempo posible. Así, la Organización organiza de manera transversal todos los recursos de los que dispone a nivel nacional y entre sus diferentes Áreas de Conocimiento y departamentos, entre los que se incluyen todas las herramientas de atención social, respuesta en emergencias o voluntariado, entre otras., Está constituida por más de 30 personas de Inclusión Social, Salud, Socorros, Voluntariado, Marca y Comunicación, Cruz Roja Juventud, Empleo, Servicios Generales, Centro de Operaciones, Cooperación Internacional, etc., que, de manera conjunta, apoyan a los equipos territoriales para ofrecer una respuesta integral y adaptada a las personas., La Célula ‘Crisis Ucrania’ se divide en tres islas de trabajo; en una primera zona se encuentran concentrados los recursos para la acogida e integración de las personas, lo que conlleva todo el sistema de atención a la llegada, hasta medidas que pudieran implementarse en el futuro a medio y largo plazo, como las vinculadas al empleo, o las mejoras de competencias para su inserción en la sociedad; en la segunda zona se concentra el servicio de datos y la comunicación, donde se interpretan y registran todas las atenciones con un sistema de inteligencia aplicado, que posteriormente Cruz Roja comunica a través de todas sus vías internas y canales externos, y que van en paralelo a la creación de recursos informativos que sirven de guía o consejos para las personas llegada de Ucrania. En la tercera isla de trabajo se concentran los servicios transversales, una zona multidisciplinar en la que las áreas de Salud, Socorros, Cooperación Internacional, o Voluntariado trabajan junto al resto de equipos agrupando la intervención con las personas., Para Cruz Roja la organización es clave: sólo a través del voluntariado organizado se puede ofrecer una respuesta rápida, eficaz e integral en una situación de emergencia como la que el país vive en este momento con la llegada de personas provenientes de Ucrania. Junto a la importante solidaridad ciudadana, el voluntariado -base fundamental de la Organización- está siendo clave en estos momentos en lo que aporta valor adicional gracias a su preparación, recursos y respuesta coordinada., RECURSOS AUDIOVISUALES

Health in peril as war takes a heavy toll on Ukraine’s environment,News and Press Release,IOM,"Climate Change and Environment
Health",7 Apr 2022,"Ukraine, 7 April 2022 – Four million people have fled Ukraine, a further 7.1 million others are internally displaced and civilian casualties are growing daily, but the brutal consequences of the war don’t stop there. Massive environmental damage – which started with the outbreak of hostilities in Donbas in 2014 – is already having an impact on the health of Ukrainians, and this is expected to continue for years to come., For generations, women like Tetiana have tended small market gardens to provide fresh fruit and vegetables for their families. She’s from Vasylkiv, about 30 kilometres from the capital Kyiv, but fled when her hometown came under heavy shelling as Russian troops tried to capture a local aerodrome., “We left very fast in the morning, packing like we were going for the weekend – only absolute necessities, and went to stay with my friend in the town of Tarashcha, a few hundred kilometres away. The next morning, I learned that several missiles hit a fuel depot near Vasylkiv, and for several days firefighters could not extinguish the fire,” Tatiana recalls., “My brother told me that even now, a month later, they can still smell the smoke when they are inside the house, although they keep the windows shut all the time,” said Tetiana., She wants to go home when it’s safe, but doubts if she will ever be able to grow vegetables or fruit as the soil is likely to be severely contaminated., The incident at the oil depot in Vasylkiv was one of the first technogenic hazards caused by the war. As of the end of March, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine jointly with local NGOs recorded 111 attacks against industrial sites, energy plants, water stations, gas pipelines and unique natural resources. The Government qualifies these as “crimes against the environment”, causing an impact that Ukrainians will feel long after the war ends., According to data from the Ukrainian NGO Ecoaction, Kyiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions are the most affected in terms of environmental damage. The situation in eastern Ukraine was already alarming as many industrial sites and coal mines were affected by the armed conflict which started in 2014., As it transformed into a full-scale war a month ago, tracking and measuring ecological damage amidst the ongoing fighting became challenging. Ukrainian authorities are determined to document all incidents as they prepare to take their case to the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, referring to the First Protocol of the Geneva Conventions which requires the warring states to protect the environment from ""large-scale, long-term and serious damage."", “During the first month of the war, over 1,100 missiles were launched on the territory of Ukraine, and about 4,000 units of military equipment of various types were destroyed,” says Yevhenia Zasiadko, the head of Ecoaction. “This will lead to the accumulation of carcinogenic waste as spilt fuel from exploded missiles contaminates the soil and groundwater with chemicals and heavy metals.”, The habitats of rare and endangered species are also being destroyed. According to a Ukrainian Conservation Group, 44 per cent of the most valuable areas of natural reserve fund are located in the war zone. The notorious nuclear plant in Chornobyl and another in Zaporizhia were apparently mismanaged, and wildfires in the Chornobyl exclusion zone threatened to spread nuclear waste into the atmosphere., Meanwhile, residents in many other cities, towns and villages across Ukraine already feel how the war is polluting their air, water and soil. As some of the heaviest fighting took place around Kyiv, the air quality in the city has plummeted. On 19 March, the residents were asked not to open their windows or leave their homes unnecessarily, as pollutant concentration in the air was 27.8 times higher than the World Health Organization’s guidelines., Civilians in and near areas which have been heavily bombed face sustained exposure from inhaling fine dust particles from destroyed buildings, which are often mixed with heavy metals and other toxic substances. This carcinogenic dust may cause longer-term health threats with effects that may not present themselves for years or even decades after the war ends., On 21 March, shelling caused an ammonia leak at the chemical factory near Sumy, endangering the surrounding areas. Such larger-scale hazardous leaks often leach into underground water – if there are no other sources of drinking water, this can cause immediate harm upon ingestion. Other risks, such as the release of radiation and toxic chemicals from nuclear power plants, are expected to have varied damaging health consequences., In the short-term, Ukrainians staying in areas with intense hostilities are likely to see an increase in asthma, pneumonia and acute bronchitis, health authorities warn. The long-term health effects for those exposed to hazardous materials or chemicals may include cancer, organ damage, and weakening of the immune system, which may take months or years to appear. Taking in to account these environmental issues, public health risks and food insecurity will be critical for Ukrainians deciding whether or not to return home., “The implications of this war will be long-standing, it will take many years for those who have been displaced to overcome the negative environmental and health impacts of war, not to mention the psychological scars,” says Elizabeth Warn, Deputy Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine., “People returning to their homes after being displaced inside and outside Ukraine, will need to be provided with sustainable livelihoods, housing, jobs and health care to rebuild their lives and strengthen their resilience.”, To help those affected by the Ukraine crisis, IOM has launched a Flash Appeal and fundraising page., If you have been affected by the crisis and need support, please call one of IOM’s Hotlines., Written by Iryna Tymchyshyn with IOM Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/health-peril-war-takes-heavy-toll-ukraine-s-environment

Water Sanitation Hygiene",5 Apr 2022,"Geneva – Over 7.1 million people have been internally displaced since the invasion of Ukraine, according to the second Ukraine Internal Displacement Report issued by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). This represents a 10 per cent increase in number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine since the first round of the survey on 16 March., IOM conducted its second survey between 24 March and 1 April to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility, and assess needs in Ukraine to inform the overall humanitarian response., “People continue to flee their homes because of war, and the humanitarian needs on the ground continue to soar,” said IOM Director General António Vitorino., “Humanitarian corridors are urgently needed to allow the safe evacuation of civilians and ensure the safe transportation and delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid in order to rapidly assist those internally displaced.”, According to the survey, more than 50 per cent of displaced households have children, 57 per cent include elderly members, and 30 per cent have people with chronic illnesses., Within the first month of the war, the income of displaced households dropped sharply. While only 13 per cent of now displaced households reported a monthly income under 5,000 Ukrainian hryvnias (USD 170) prior to 24 February 2022, currently 61 per cent of them indicate that their household income has been lower than 5,000 hryvnias since the start of the war., Over one third of displaced households indicate that they have had no income in the last month., Cash and financial support, transportation, food, shelter, and hygiene items are among the most pressing needs for displaced people. Access to medicines and health services remains the second most pressing need for both those displaced, and those staying at their places of residence., IOM teams on the ground continue to provide essential humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons and host communities, but more communities in need remain trapped., Tangible support provided so far has included food, non-food and hygiene items, cash, mental health and psychosocial support, as well as information campaigns to help prevent human trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse., The cessation of hostilities in Ukraine is of utmost importance, to allow for humanitarian access to all affected populations., ***, For more information, please contact:, In Geneva:, Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int, +41794035526, Paul Dillon, pdillon@iom.int, +41796369874, In Ukraine:, Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, +38 067 447 97 92, Karolina Krelinova, kkrelinova@iom.int, +380 503635331, In Vienna:, Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int , +43660 3776404",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/71-million-people-displaced-war-ukraine-iom-survey

War in Ukraine: RSF’s Lviv centre steps up operational assistance to journalists in the field,News and Press Release,RSF,Protection and Human Rights,7 Apr 2022,"Distributing helmets, bulletproof vests and safety manuals, providing online training, psychological support and financial aid, and taking legal action – Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has been moving ahead on all possible fronts via its Press Freedom Centre in Ukraine since 11 March to meet the needs of journalists risking their lives to cover this war., As direct attacks on reporters increase in Ukraine, with a total of seven journalists now killed while covering the war, RSF’s Press Freedom Centre in the western city of Lviv has been steadily stepping up its activities., “Journalists are a prime target for Putin's regime, so every action helps those who are resisting and helps to tell the world about the horror now sweeping Ukraine, said Alexander Query, the coordinator of RSF’s Lviv centre. Every vest, every helmet and every safety kit protecting a journalist who is reporting what is happening here is a bulwark against the enemies of a free press. We thank all those who, through their generosity and commitment, are helping to support our operations in the most concrete manner possible.”, Here is an initial summary of the assistance and support provided to Ukrainian journalists from this hub set up in the west of the country nearly a month ago with help from many partners:, 158 bulletproof vests and 100 helmets made available
A total of 158 vests and 100 helmets had been delivered to Lviv by 6 April. Since the beginning of the war, a total of four deliveries have been made to the Centre, with difficulties due to the need for specific permits that slow down their delivery via Poland. RSF has ordered a total of 541 bulletproof vests and 490 helmets since the Centre opened in Lviv., The Institute of Mass Information (IMI), a Ukrainian NGO that is an RSF partner, and the National Union of Journalists in Ukraine (NUJU) put the total need at around 700 vests and helmets., RSF’s safety guide translated into Ukrainian
RSF’s Safety Guide for Journalists, which was produced in partnership with UNESCO and offers practical advice to reporters going to high-risk areas, has been translated into Ukrainian by the NUJU. A thousand copies are being printed and it is already available on a dedicated website., Physical and psychological safety training provided to 78 journalists
As part of its operational support for journalists, the Lviv Press Centre has managed – in record time – to organise online training sessions in Ukrainian that are designed to help reporters and their fixers to safeguard their physical and mental health. Two training sessions per week are offered, one in psychological safety lasting two hours and the other in first aid. Nearly 80 Ukrainian journalists had received the training by 6 April., A physical safety training session – in person and in English – was also organised for the Centre’s staff and for all requesting journalists., 1100 first aid kits available soon
These very complete and compact medical kits can be used to treat any injury in an emergency. Deliveries are problematic but 1100 kits are expected at the Lviv Centre soon and will be distributed to journalists in the field., 65 journalists and 15 media to receive emergency funding
Despite difficulties linked to the transfer of international funds during the war, money orders were finally released on 31 March and were sent to some of the 65 journalists identified by RSF as beneficiaries because they have been deprived of their usual sources of funding., At the same time, RSF Assistance staff have identified some 15 independent Ukrainian media outlets that will be given the emergency funding they need to be able to continue working., Five complaints with ICC, one in France, concerning 29 journalists
RSF’s litigation specialists are about to file two more complaints with the International Criminal Court in addition to the three already filed with the ICC and the one filed in France. These six complaints concern acts of violence against at least 29 journalists and the destruction of broadcasting equipment. In almost all cases, RSF has established that the Russian armed forces were responsible and that these acts can be regarded as war crimes.

This includes 2.1 million child refugees and 2.5 million children still in Ukraine who have fled their homes. More than 1 in every 2 Ukrainian children is now displaced, out of an estimated pre-war population of 7.5 million. Overall, more than 25% of the population have fled their homes., The Ukrainian government is currently predicting that the country’s economy will shrink by 40% by the end of 2022. Infrastructure damage has been extensive, with an estimated 23,000 km of roads have been damaged due to the conflict., Human Rights Watch have reported horrific human rights atrocities in Bucha and elsewhere in the country. The lives of civilian men, women and children affected by this conflict must be protected above all else. All sides of this conflict must redouble their efforts to ensure accountability so that this does not happen again., Our rapid needs assessment in Bucharest found that 43% of people we surveyed are staying outside of centers and of those, 41% are staying in strangers’ homes. Over half (51%) of families have at least one child under 5 years old.
Families also expressed much less certainty of what to do now. Most families we spoke to in Iasi were pretty sure they were only transiting through Romania. In Bucharest, families have typically been here longer already (1-2 weeks) and 53% are not sure of their next move., World Vision is deeply concerned about the risk of child trafficking and abuse as women and children continue to cross borders without registration.

MRG and partner worried about the state of minority and Roma rights in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MRG,Protection and Human Rights,6 Apr 2022,"This statement was delivered by Yulian Kondur in the name of MRG and Chirikli at the Human Rights Council’s Interactive Dialogue on the situation of human rights in Ukraine, 49th Session, held on Wednesday 30 March 2022., Thank you Chair,, On behalf of Roma Women Fund Chirikli and Minority Rights Group, we urgently draw the attention of the Human Rights Council to the situation of Roma and other marginalized minorities in Ukraine, following the invasion of the Russian Federation. We strongly condemn misinformation regarding the situation of Roma and other minorities and the instrumentalization of minority rights by the Russian Federation at the UN and internationally to justify its illegal actions., As specialized NGOs working on minority rights in Ukraine, we cannot accept that the legitimate advocacy for the right to equality for all Ukrainians be instrumentalized to make the case for war. Roma face discrimination in all parts of Europe, including in Ukraine, but Roma CSOs have always been able to work freely and cooperate with the Ukrainian authorities, to address these issues. We have always been able to raise our concerns, including here at the UN, without fear of reprisals., The invasion by Russia has led to loss of life, mass displacement and dramatic impacts for Roma and all Ukrainians. We have documented cases of Roma not being able to receive safe passage, due to a lack of documentation, as well as cases of discrimination in the allocation of humanitarian assistance in countries hosting and receiving refugees. Similar cases have also been documented relating to students and other residents of African origin or descent. We are also deeply concerned by ongoing reports of arbitrary detention and disappearance of indigenous Crimean Tatar activists undertaken by Russian authorities on Ukrainian territory., We call on international humanitarian actors, including the UNHCR, to cooperate with networks of Roma, CSOs, human rights monitors and mediators, which have now been established in Ukraine and countries receiving refugees from Ukraine, in order to ensure equal access to humanitarian assistance and refugee status., I thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mrg-and-partner-worried-about-state-minority-and-roma-rights-ukraine

The next report will be issued on or around 8 April., KEY FIGURES (FLASH APPEAL 2022), 12M people in need

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says around 7.1 million people have been displaced internally, bringing the total number of people displaced internally and across borders to 11.4 million. According to IOM, cashbased support, including access to money, medicines and health services as well as transportation are the most pressing needs of affected people., As of 6 April, UN agencies and humanitarian partners of the Cash Working Group, co-chaired by ACTED and OCHA, have reached 68,000 people across Ukraine with around US$15.4 million in multipurpose cash assistance., On 5 April, a fourth UN-organized convoy facilitated by OCHA through the Humanitarian Notification System (HNS) delivered eight trucks of critical relief supplies for some 17,000 people in Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast, east)., As of 6 April, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says that 50 per cent of the emergency medical supplies requested by the Government of Ukraine have been delivered, covering the needs of some 100,000 people., Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe. According to local authorities, the situation is much worse than in Bucha and other towns outside Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), where laws-of-war violations were allegedly committed against civilians. Mariupol’s Mayor Vadym Boichenko called on the international community to help push forward evacuation processes for 130,000 people still trapped in the city without access to food, water and medicine., As active fighting and shelling intensify in eastern Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vershchuk urges residents across eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts to evacuate while it is still possible, warning that a further escalation could potentially cut off evacuation corridors., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. On 4-5 April, the sounds of air raid sirens and explosions rang out over several oblasts as fighting continues. The situation in the most affected areas of northern, southern and eastern Ukraine is becoming increasingly dire as active hostilities intensify in existing hotspots and expand into new areas previously spared the worst of the ongoing military offensive. Needs and protection risks continue to grow. Meanwhile, access to affected communities to address growing needs and protection risks remains largely limited. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that people trapped in areas facing active hostilities cannot safely evacuate, leaving many people’s needs unmet while driving others to attempt dangerous self-evacuations to escape in search of safety and humanitarian assistance., As of 5 April, the civilian toll stands at 3,776 – including 1,563 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,241 casualties – including 420 killed and 821 injured – compared to 326 civilian casualties in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 259 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 2,209 civilian casualties., These figures are likely much higher as increased access into some of the hardest-hit areas reveals the magnitude of civilian casualties and active fighting continues. As of 5 April, following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces from hard-hit areas outside Kyiv, local authorities of the nearby Hostomel estimate that more than 400 civilians have been killed, while authorities in Bucha and Borodianka (Kyivska oblast) estimate that at least 320 and more than 200 civilians, respectively, have been killed in these towns. On 5 April, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova announced that around 5,000 war crimes are now under investigation in the country., Population movements and needs. Between 24 March and 1 April, IOM carried out the second round of its rapid representative assessment on internal displacement, mobility flows and associated needs across Ukraine. As of 1 April, approximately 7.1 million people have been forcibly displaced within Ukraine – around 16 per cent of the country’s population – an increase of over 660,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) since 18 March. This is a worrying trend as increased internal population movements place people on the move at risk and may potentially overwhelm already-limited response capacities in host communities. According to the IOM survey, more than 50 per cent of displaced households have children, 57 per cent include older persons and 30 per cent have people with chronic illnesses. Moreover, around 30 per cent of IDPs report that they are considering further movement from their current location, possibly creating additional challenges for humanitarian actors attempting to effectively identify and address the needs of people continuously on the move., In total, 11.4 million people have been displaced within the country and across international borders, including nearly 4.3 million people, mainly women and children, who have fled across international borders – a 30 per cent increase compared to around 3.3 million as of 18 March. Based on the information provided by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) received from the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, more than 537,000 people have crossed into Ukraine since 24 February. This is a significant figure that suggests that migration back to Ukraine is likely increasing, potentially creating new challenges for the humanitarian response as people will need support to reintegrate into their communities or find suitable host communities if returning to their homes is no longer a viable option., For those trapped in their communities, 16 per cent say it is not safe for them to leave amid active hostilities, while 6 per cent report staying in order not to leave family members behind and 3 per cent report they would not know where to go. For those people still in their communities of origin, only 21 per cent believe it is completely safe while, on the other hand, 40 per cent say their communities are either somewhat safe (29 per cent) or completely unsafe (11 per cent). Both displaced and non-displaced people say their biggest needs are cash-based support, including access to money (i.e., receiving money, no money in ATMs), medicines and health services as well as transportation., Gendered impacts, risks and vulnerabilities. The protection situation for most women and children, especially those on the move or trapped inside cities experiencing active hostilities, continues to worsen. Even before the recent escalation, three-quarters of women in Ukraine had experienced some form of gender-based violence (GBV) in their lifetime. While protection risks continue to rise amid a worsening security situation, including sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and human trafficking, access to related protection services is deteriorating. According to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, reports have already surfaced of cases of sexual violence against women, children and older persons, which are now under investigation., Those state-run services which are still operational have largely shifted their focus away from GBV to addressing the needs of IDPs, while those service providers still working on GBV face critical shortages in both human and financial resources. At the same time, demands for these services are rapidly increasing, with the breakdown of referral pathways, widening gaps in service provision and limited access to life-saving information, including on the availability of GBV services, continues to increase the vulnerability of women and children. In this context, it is the non-negotiable responsibility of all humanitarian actors to effectively mainstream protection against GBV and SEA across all response activities., Impacts on health services. As health needs continue to rise, access to critical health services becomes increasingly restricted. Of the more than 90 attacks on health care since 24 February, 77 have directly affected health facilities, a number that is likely to increase as almost 1,000 health facilities are located in areas experiencing active fighting or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces. With hostilities-related trauma and injuries on the rise, many hospitals have been repurposed to care for the wounded, leading to disruptions to basic and routine health services, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Close to half of all pharmacies across the country are thought to be closed, limiting access to essential medicines. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) says many health workers are either displaced or unable to work, creating serious gaps in health coverage., Impacts on education. Amid ongoing hostilities, access to education remains severally restricted, especially in eastern Ukraine, where increasingly intense clashes will have both immediate and longer-term impacts on access and educational outcomes for months or even years to come. The ongoing military offensive will greatly complicate an already challenging education context in Ukraine. Even before the recent escalation, around 30 per cent of education facilities in eastern Ukraine reported not having enough teachers, a problem that will only be exacerbated as thousands, including teachers and other educational personnel, continue to flee their homes., According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, of the nearly 930 educational institutions damaged or destroyed across Ukraine, more than 380 of them – around 41 per cent of all educational institutions damaged or destroyed – are located in the eastern Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts. Save the Children says that more than 20 schools a day on average have been attacked across the country since 24 February. Attacks on education facilities endanger the lives of children and the futures of the country’s approximately 7.5 million children – 5.5 million of whom are still in Ukraine – especially in the eastern part of the country., Eastern Ukraine continues to be the epicentre of the ongoing military offensive, with clashes in Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts intensifying in recent days. On 4-5 April, several settlements in Luhanska oblast experienced significant shelling, especially Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk. Amid escalating hostilities, reports of damaged homes and critical infrastructure are on the rise in the oblast. In Novodruzhesk, Maloriazantseve (Luhanska oblast) and Sievierodonetsk, nearly 132,000 users across more than 35 settlements have been cut off from gas supplies after a pipeline was reportedly damaged. As of 5 April, almost 96,000 users in 30 settlements across the oblast are without electricity, while water supplies have been completely cut off in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk, and partially in Hirska hromada (community) and Lysychansk (Luhanska oblast)., In Kharkivska oblast, relentless shelling, airstrikes and missile attacks continue to batter the city of Kharkiv and surrounding areas, like Barvinkove, Chuhuiv and Derhachi. According to oblast authorities, more than 50 incidents of shelling were recorded in Kharkiv and nearby settlements on 4 April, compared to less than 20 the day before, a clear sign of the intensification of fighting in and around Kharkiv – the country’s second-largest city. On 5 April, shelling in Kharkiv reportedly left at least four dead and three others injured. The same day, at least two civilians were killed and five more injured in the Chuhuivskyi district. Amid escalating clashes, oblast authorities have urged residents in Barvinkove and Lozova to evacuate., In neighbouring Donetska oblast, intense shelling continues in Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, Marinka, Mariupol, Vuhledar and Svitlodarsk. The situation in Mariupol is particularly concerning. The already dire situation in the encircled city is greatly exacerbated by the repeated delay of humanitarian corridors that prevents the evacuation of vulnerable people and the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance. For more than five weeks, at least 130,000 people stuck in the city have faced critical shortages of food, water and medicines and remain cut off from electricity and communications. On 4 April, local authorities warned that the situation in Mariupol is much worse than in Bucha and other towns on the outskirts of Kyiv, where laws-of-war violations have been allegedly committed against civilian populations. That same day, the Mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, appealed for the international community to come together to push forward evacuation processes for those who remain in the conflict-ravaged city., Civilian evacuations. On 4 and 5 April, the Government of Ukraine reported that more than 7,220 people were reportedly evacuated through agreed-upon corridors, including nearly 3,050 from the ravaged city of Mariupol. After being blocked at a civilian checkpoint in the town of Manhush (Donetska oblast), a convoy of seven buses attempting to reach Mariupol, accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), was forced to turn back. Still, the convoy managed to pick up residents from Mariupol who had already reached the town of Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) earlier. At the time of writing, the convoy, followed by some 40 private vehicles, including residents of both Berdiansk and Mariupol, is en route to Government-controlled Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast). Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reports that 640,009 persons, including 125,538 children, have crossed to the Russian Federation from the territory of Ukraine since 24 February 2022. This number includes 19,249 persons, including 2,864 children, whom the Russian Federation reportedly evacuated on 5 April., Industrial disasters and environmental health risks. On 4 April, a chemical plant was reportedly damaged in Donetska oblast, according to the Ukrainian Joint Forces Operation (JFO) Command. No environmental hazard risk was reported, though several industrial facilities and goods were allegedly damaged. The following day, on 5 April, in Rubizhne, Luhanska oblast authorities reported that a nitric acid container was damaged amid intense clashes in the town, prompting local authorities to advise residents to stay indoors and wear protective masks, as the corrosive acid expelled could cause chemical burns or lead to serious injury. While these incidents did not result in immediate negative impacts on people’s health and the environment, they served as the latest in a series of reminders of the potentially devastating environmental and health consequences of the ongoing military offensive.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-6-april-2022
Racing to Document War Crimes in Ukraine,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,5 Apr 2022,"This is the beginning of what might well be a long process, but it is essential that we preserve evidence for future justice, Published in: The Telegraph, Hugh Williamson
Director, Europe and Central Asia Division, Seven Ukrainian civilians executed by Russian soldiers in two separate incidents. A case of repeated rape. These are just two of the many Human Rights Watch findings on apparent war crimes committed by Russian forces in recent weeks., They show unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence on the part of Russian soldiers. One of the executions took place on March 4 in Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv. Five Ukrainian men were told to take off their jackets and boots, kneel on the roadside and put their T-shirts over their heads. Then one of them was shot at short range., Russian troops recently withdrew from Bucha, and TV crews later filmed dead bodies strewn in the street and burnt-out cars. We are concerned that many such deaths may be the result of war crimes. It is too early to say for certain now, and legal proceedings are still at a nascent stage, but that is why it is important for the evidence to be established., We have also documented a number of apparent war crimes in other areas that need urgent investigation. Take, for instance, Russia’s attacks that killed civilians and destroyed civilian buildings, including hospitals; the use of banned weapons such as cluster munitions and anti-personnel landmines, and blocking access for humanitarian supplies to towns under siege. We have also documented the apparent abuse of Russian prisoners of war., International collaboration is vital to investigate every such case and bring those responsible to justice. It is good to see that the Ukrainian authorities have opened an investigation into what happened in Bucha, and that the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court last month opened an investigation into alleged war crimes. The United Nations Human Rights Council also opened a Commission of Inquiry into violations of the laws of war in Ukraine, and its work could provide important assistance to the ICC and other judicial authorities., As these investigations get underway, we must also ensure the adequate preservation of evidence. Human Rights Watch has verified and assessed hundreds of videos and photographs so far and is ensuring that all of it is being carefully logged and archived. Crime scenes should be cordoned off and forensic specialists given urgent access., Finally, members of the international community need to maintain political will, both in the medium and long term. This is the beginning of what might well be a long process, but as yet more terrible evidence emerges from Ukraine, it is clear that the work of gathering and investigating is indispensable.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/racing-document-war-crimes-ukraine
"Statement by Ms. Alice Wairimu Nderitu, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on developments in Ukraine and the need to reinforce prevention efforts in the Western Balkan region in light of that situation",News and Press Release,UN,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",6 Apr 2022,"(06 April 2022) The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, expressed her dismay and condemnation at the disturbing event at Bucha, with indication of hundreds of victims deliberately targeted, which point to very serious signs of possible commission of war crimes. The Special Adviser echoed messages by the Secretary-General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ukraine for an immediate ceasefire and an effective and independent investigation leading to criminal accountability over the killing of civilians in this location., In parallel, Special Adviser Wairimu Nderitu reiterated her call for the intensification of diplomatic efforts to bring an end to this conflict, as well as for the protection of civilians and the extension of humanitarian corridors so that risks against them can be mitigated. The Special Adviser reminded the parties of their obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law and called on them to abide by those obligations in the conduct of their operations. “Only the end of hostilities will bring peace to the homes of terrorized citizens, but even in conflict they should never be deliberately targeted. International law must be upheld at all times,” emphasized the Special Adviser., At the same time, Special Adviser Wairimu Nderitu alerted on the impact of this crisis in other regions in Europe. Specifically, thirty years since the start of the military siege of Sarajevo, she called on all actors in position of responsibility to strengthen efforts for prevention in the region of the Western Balkans, in light of existing concerns and grievances from the painful legacy of the past being exacerbated by dynamics of deterioration associated to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine., The Special Adviser noted that she undertook her first official visit to Bosnia and Herzgovina, in June 2021, followed by official visits to Serbia and Montenegro in November that year. “In my visits to the region, many interlocutors have alluded to serious absence of trust, insufficient commitment to healing and trust-building by political leaders – including derogatory rhetoric by some, even amounting to hate speech –, dynamics of division being exacerbated for political purposes, and insufficient space for the work of local peace champions to take root in a soil which – for all the reasons above – remains less than fertile. All of this has taken a turn for the worse, not for the better, within the last few months.”, In the view of the Special Adviser, “in the last six weeks, the conflict in Ukraine has deteriorated some of these dynamics. A number of my interlocutors in the region have shared graphic information on displays of hatred in response to the conflict in that country which should constitute an alert call for all of us. Open vindication of violence against members of one national group, appeal to religion as a source of legitimacy for violence, or alignment of national pursuits to the cause of warrying parties in the Ukraine conflict do not only constitutes symptoms of insufficient healing in a region where conflict was present; they are also signs that the risk of recurrence is real and serious.”, The Special Adviser also noted that, next to those who are seeking to exploit the Ukraine crisis to advance division and hatred in the Western Balkans, stand citizens who cannot but feel anxious as the sounds and sights of Kyiv, Kharkiv or Mariupol bringing back everything they endured in the 1990s., Special Adviser Wairimu Nderitu also alluded to a number of international actors alerting of the risk of ‘spill-over’ from Ukraine to other regions in Eastern and East-Central Europe. In her view, while the geo-strategical circumstances under which such risks could materialize remain uncertain, “we should not question the fact that the Western Balkans remain of critical significance for key players whose geo-strategic interests meet in this region. It is not surprising that anxiety raises when disputes over geo-strategic interest are generating insurmountable costs in Ukraine.”, At the same time, the Special Adviser emphasized that the main source of division in the region continues coming from the inside rather than the outside, and that therefore the most solid risk mitigation efforts will also need to come from the region itself. In this respect, she underlined the need to prioritize reinforcing initiatives aimed at bringing people together in a region where they are often pulled apart. In her view, “this is a time to advocate for moderation by those in a position of leverage, from political to religious to community leaders, who can lead the way in building trust among the different ethnic, national and religious groups in the region. It is a time to empower peace champions who continue bringing change in their immediate communities, but that often lack the visibility and support their work requires to be replicated elsewhere. It is a time to counter hate speech with messages of openness and understanding. It is a time, in short, to build peace from the top down and from the bottom up, day in and day out.”, Special Adviser Wairimu Nderitu expressed her intention to conduct new visits in the region, not only to reinforce her commitment to healing and trust-building, but also to actively support those who tirelessly work to advance such efforts. “Peace-builders will continue to be instrumental in building a future free of genocide and other atrocity crimes. The time to support them is now.”, *****, For media queries please contact:

Medical supplies are increasingly in scarce supply as 77 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine have been recorded by the UN World Health Organization since the start of the conflict., In addition, Human Appeal is supporting temporary civilian shelters inside Ukraine operated by local NGO, the Ukrainian Muslim Women's League. Human Appeal aims to help some 2,700 internally displaced civilians find shelter, food and sanitation as they make their journey away from cities under attack. The temporary shelters are spread across the Ukrainian cities of Chernivtsi, Lviv and Vinnytsia. According to UN estimations, Ukraine has 6.5 million internally displaced people due to the conflict, many of whom need urgent medical attention., ""The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is getting worse with non-stop bombing of civilian areas. More people are evacuating from different towns and villages to relatively safer cities. Many families arrive in these cities seeking shelter and basic food provision. As an international humanitarian organization, we can see the same tragic pattern unfolding in Ukraine that we face in Syria with millions of families bombed, displaced and hungry. It is our responsibility to step up and help,"" commented Raya Homsi, Institutional Funding Manager at UK NGO Human Appeal., The announcement of Human Appeal’s latest humanitarian support initiative comes as new research shows there is a low threshold of awareness amongst the UK public for the enormity of the scale of ongoing humanitarian crises worldwide. In a survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of Human Appeal, a quarter of respondents from the UK did not know the scale of humanitarian crises affecting millions of people in long running conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Somalia., The research was conducted last month to mark the six- and eleven-year anniversaries of the escalation of conflicts in Syria and Yemen.

This included:, a total of 1,563 killed (379 men, 237 women, 24 girls, and 43 boys, as well as 63 children and 817 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,213 injured (254 men, 196 women, 44 girls, and 40 boys, as well as 104 children and 1,575 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,567 casualties (487 killed and 1,080 injured)  On Government-controlled territory: 1,241 casualties (420 killed and 821 injured)  On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 326 casualties (67 killed and 259 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 2,209 casualties (1,076 killed and 1,133 injured)
Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.
OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region),
Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Borodianka (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.

The project will help provide safe access for humanitarian deliveries through the restoration and maintenance of critical routes, to be implemented by UNDP over a period of six months in collaboration with UN sister agencies and mine action partners., Five weeks into the war, the widespread presence of landmines, cluster munition, and other Explosive Ordnance pose a considerable and mounting threat to civilian populations and prevent lifesaving provisions from being delivered to hard-to-reach affected communities which further exacerbate an already catastrophic and life-threatening situations., In parallel, the mounting number of damaged and unstable buildings and subsequent extensive debris pose a real threat to human health from uncontrolled collapse, contamination, and prevention of access to basic services., “Delivery of food and medication are immediate needs for the war-affected communities and can only be delivered when safe passage and access to target locations is safely ensured,” said Manal Fouani, acting UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine. “With this timely and highly strategic support from Japan, such safe access will be further enabled. UNDP highly welcomes the initiative by the Government of Japan to be among the first partners to contribute to the emergency clearance of explosive ordnance and debris removal in Ukraine.”, A statement released on April 5 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan regarding their Emergency Grant Aid for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries stated that: “The Government of Japan will continue to provide support for and stand by the people of Ukraine who are facing hardship, in collaboration with the international community, including the G7 members.”, UNDP, as the lead UN mine action cluster coordinator in Ukraine and in close collaboration with UNMAS, UNICEF, GICHD, and other partners, will leverage its long-term in-country presence and experience to facilitate safe access for both humanitarian and critical infrastructure repair through:, identifying critical delivery routes in close coordination with local authorities on their immediate needs for access and humanitarian actors,, liaising with the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) to survey and clear these routes of EO presence,, facilitating safe access with the demolition of any unstable structures and the removal of debris, and, maintaining cleared routes for continued safe access., While the situation remains fluid, UNDP will carefully select the areas for emergency safe access and restoration of critical infrastructure in consultation with the State Emergency Services (SES), the Government of Ukraine and in alignment with partner UN agencies and NGOs, where the humanitarian needs are most acute., This project is part of the UNDP’s integral response to the UN system-wide appeal launched on 1 March, 2022 to support immediate efforts to protect and assist those most affected in Ukraine., Media enquiries, Yuliia Samus, UNDP Communications Team Leader, yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/japan-contributes-us45-million-clear-explosive-ordnance-and-remove-debris-ukraine

Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items",4 Apr 2022,"Last updated on 31 March 2022, Since the beginning of the war in late February, UNDP and its partners have sought to bring relief to those people most affected by the fighting in eastern Ukraine through the State Emergency Services, local NGOs, Ombudsperson’s offices, local police and municipalities. In addition, UNDP and its partners are working to support internally-displaced people (IDPs) in the west of Ukraine. While relatively limited, compared to the Country’s overall humanitarian needs, UNDP’s direct outreach was and continues to be fast and agile as it is not required to wait for humanitarian convoys, relying instead on its ground support and existing partnerships and local networks., Specifically, UNDP’s immediate response was characterized by timely and quality interventions with enhanced access to affected populations and leveraging local partnerships through:, · Re-programming/repurposing some of the existing development funds/investments (over US$20M), redirecting them to those in need (in line with the mandate of the Government's priorities), through which, some early results have been, inter alia:, i. Supporting the Government of Ukraine with crisis coordination and emergency response programming, including with the Ministry of Digital Transformation to track displaced people and to develop new digital services for IDPs, and for all Ukrainians requiring social and humanitarian assistance;, ii. Assisting the Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Foreign Affairs on countering misinformation;, and with relocating Ukrainian production facilities;, iii. Creating employment opportunities for IDPs;, iv. Supporting the rapid repair of damaged critical infrastructure;, v. Purchasing and delivering food and non-food items (including light towers, medication, first-aid supplies etc) for the State Emergency Service for IDPs living in emergency shelters in transit hubs and hosting areas: 50 percent of the emergency medical demand requested by the Government was delivered to meet the needs of some 100,000 individuals – providing the Health Ministry with blood tests used for transfusion during surgeries, in particular for wounded civilian population;, vi. Facilitating a system to record and organize information and form a single register of environmental damage caused by the war in Ukraine (at Operations Headquarters under the State Environmental Inspectorate);, vii. Working with the Ministry of Energy to evaluate the damage caused by the active military actions to the energy system; and, viii. Developing and launching platforms to identify, analyze and mediate community-level conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, especially in those with high numbers of IDPs., · Developing macro-economic projections of the cost of the war in Ukraine based on a scenario modeling exercise – which estimates that 18 years of development gains will be lost with more than 90 percent of Ukrainians plunging into poverty and extreme economic vulnerability, leaving deep social and economic scars for generations to come., · Continuing efforts to leverage and mobilize UNDP’s extensive partnership base and expand to new entities, particularly where UNDP has mandate, experience and comparative advantage, ensuring that early recovery proceeds in parallel with the humanitarian response from the outset. This will be achieved by modelling a humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach specifically calibrated to the situation in Ukraine and guided by the main principle of national and local ownership of proposed solutions:, o As an example, under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, implemented in eastern Ukraine, Canada contributed US$8M to expand the delivery of public services and build resilience of local governments, communities, emergency and other services, enabling them to respond to urgent needs of people fleeing violence., o With funding from the EU, SIDA, the Netherlands and Canada, UNDP has already implemented nearly 50 targeted quick recovery and emergency assistance initiatives across Ukraine, and at least 60 more similar initiatives are in the pipeline. They include support to shelters for the displaced population in central and western Ukraine; food, medical supplies and other non-food items for people in most affected regions; support with the delivery of humanitarian assistance; and equipment and supplies to the emergency services and hospitals. Further support will be provided to strengthen resilience and build capacities of local governments, emergency services and community organizations to respond to the impacts caused by the war, o And with support from Sweden, UNDP is helping to provide digital support services for refugees and displaced people, allowing people to register for accommodation, · Providing operational and administrative support to other agencies operating in Ukraine (WFP, UNFPA, UNWOMEN, FAO, OCHA, DSS) to further enable the implementation of the humanitarian assistance as per the mounting needs., UNDP’s operational capacity has been bolstered with targeted and specialized expertise from UNDP’s pool of experts where an additional 15 Senior SURGE Advisors were deployed to Ukraine to work on substantive areas that include crisis governance, mine action, debris management and environmental hazards, resilience building, damage assessment and livelihoods recovery. The additional resources complement the existing workforce of 350 Staff/personnel on the ground and aim at scaling up the direct support availed to the Government from the onset of the war., Concurrently, the UN Assistant Secretary General, Ms. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, UNDP Bureau Director for Europe and CIS, visited Ukraine on 22 March, meeting with the team and partners in Lviv and Mukachevo, confirming that UNDP is on the ground to stay and deliver providing assistance to the Ukrainian people, especially the most vulnerable and the war affected ones, the Government and State institutions, working closely with the international, national and local partners (UN and non-UN/NGOs, CSOs among others)., Besides the assistance provided – summarized above – UNDP has numerous interventions in its pipeline, to support the Government and the people of Ukraine in the immediate future. Some noteworthy examples include (in a non-exhaustive list):, · Enabling locally led response to the most urgent needs in conflict affected areas, transit hubs, and hosting areas., a. UNDP is in the process of importing 30 generators to power critical infrastructure, PPEs sets and individual first-aid kits to support the work of the State Emergency Services in rescuing operations, · Enabling service provision:, b. UNDP Ukraine is in the process of awarding small grants to CSOs engaged in the provision of legal counseling, psychological counseling, and organization of distribution of aid in conflict affected areas, transit hubs and hosting regions, c. UNDP is working on supporting community policing in western oblasts, d. In Zakarpattia, UNDP has started provision of technical support to local law enforcement agencies (police patrols) to organize the influx of additional enforcement coming from eastern regions, to aid in maintaining law and order in hosting areas, · Preparing for the recovery phase:, e. UNDP Ukraine is adapting the community mobilizations models tested in the east, thereby establishing platforms for the planning of local recovery across Ukraine. These will be modeled over the Community Security working groups gathering local authorities, law enforcement agencies, civil society representatives to jointly identify and find solutions to community-level security issues. These can be expanded to encompass discussion of local recovery priorities, Finally, looking ahead, UNDP has developed a programmatic offer which aims at preserving development gains, sustaining the government functions and supporting lives and livelihoods in Ukraine by:, (i) supporting the government in sustaining public services provision, (ii) sustaining livelihoods and critical infrastructure, (iii) supporting Ukrainian institutions and civil society to ensure inclusion, protection and empowerment of vulnerable groups",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/summary-undp-s-activities-ukraine-1-31-march-2022
UK to donate fleet of ambulances to Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. UK,"Contributions
Health",6 Apr 2022,"A fleet of NHS ambulances will provide urgent care for those injured by Russian attacks in Ukraine following a donation from the UK., UK NHS trusts donating around 20 ambulances to the Government of Ukraine, donations will help replace Ukrainian ambulances lost to Russian bombardments and provide urgent care to injured, Ukraine’s health services stretched as Russian attacks hit civilian shelters and hospitals, The donation of around 20 NHS ambulances will help bring vital lifesaving care to Ukrainians remaining in towns and cities under attack from Russian bombardments., This donation will help replace those Ukrainian ambulances lost to Russian attacks, bolstering the existing fleet’s resilience as the barbaric war goes on., It is estimated more than 12 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance across Ukraine., The conflict has stretched Ukraine’s health services, with Russia’s indiscriminate attacks targeting civilian shelters and even hospitals., South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SCAS) is leading the way, donating four of its ambulances, with further donations from NHS trusts across the country soon to follow., The first ambulances will arrive in Ukraine this week, destined for Lviv in the west of the country, where they will be transported on to those areas most in need., Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:, ""We have sadly seen day after day the horrific impacts of Putin’s cruel war on the people of Ukraine, including evidence of appalling acts by Russian troops in towns such as Irpin and Bucha., ""The UK has been among the biggest aid donors, providing food, medicines and generators to help those affected.

Last month the UK government also brought 21 Ukrainian children with cancer to receive care through the NHS in England., Background, UK NHS trusts have donated ambulances to the Government of Ukraine, following a request from HM Government. The NHS’s national ambulance service fleet strategy requires the replacement of ambulance vehicles every 5 years. After this time, vehicles are decommissioned and either kept back for resilience, given to approved charities or sent to auction. All vehicles and medical supplies are checked before being sent to ensure they meet the standards required., To date the UK has donated 5.29 million items of medical supplies to Ukraine, including:, Media enquiries, Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk, Telephone 020 7008 3100, Contact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/uk-donate-fleet-ambulances-ukraine

"Ukraine: Crisis averted for now – WHO, PEPFAR and partners ensure supply of antiretroviral drugs for people living with HIV [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
HIV/Aids",6 Apr 2022,"Faced with alarming reports of disrupted HIV treatments threatening the lives of thousands of people, WHO, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Ukrainian authorities and partners are ensuring the supply of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), covering most of the needs of every single person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine for the next 12 months., ""This war has the potential to undermine the hard-earned progress of recent years on a number of health issues, including HIV. We couldn't let that happen when Ukraine had begun to turn a corner on HIV, with fast-growing access to antiretroviral drugs, as well as improved diagnosis and treatment,"" said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., WHO, together with PEPFAR; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Ukrainian Ministry of Health's Public Health Centre (UPHC), and the nongovernmental organizations Alliance for Public Health and 100% Life, ensured the procurement of 209 000 packs of the antiretroviral drug TLD (tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir)., This means that most of the needs of every single person known to be living with HIV in Ukraine will be met for the next 12 months. The first batch of the ARVs has crossed the Polish border into Ukraine and is about to be transported to HIV service facilities across the war-torn country., The threat of disrupted treatments, An estimated 260 000 people are living with HIV in Ukraine. Prior to the war, over half, or nearly 150 000 people, were on life-saving antiretroviral treatment, including more than 2700 children. Without the access to medicines they now have, these people would have been at grave risk., To keep opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB) at bay, continuous access to ARVs is vital. This is in line with WHO's strategy of tackling what is sometimes referred to as a dual epidemic; with TB being one of the leading causes of death in people infected with HIV., ""What made this possible in a matter of weeks -- much faster than ever before -- is the fact that everyone was aware of what was at stake: the looming threat of treatments cut short. Every actor involved did their utmost to prevent disrupted treatments or people forced to change medication, something that can lead to loss of life,"" said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine, Disrupting, stopping or changing HIV treatment can lead to complications including drug resistance, posing a grave threat to a patient's health and making the disease more difficult and expensive to treat., In addition to the highly efficient and cost-effective TLD, about to be delivered to health facilities across Ukraine, a procurement of additional ARVs is ongoing. A donation of the HIV drug dolutegravir will also be available soon, to treat infants living with HIV., Resilient HIV services, The impact of the war has been devastating for Ukraine's health system. HIV services, however, although still reeling from the impact of COVID-19, have shown remarkable resilience since the war started in late February., On 21 March, almost a month after the war erupted, only 36 out of 403 antiretroviral treatment sites in the country had shut their doors, while the majority were either fully or partially functioning. Amid the devastation in the city of Mariupol, an HIV-treatment centre remains open. Even in regions hugely impacted by hostilities, such as Chernihiv and Zaporizhia, services have continued., A number of lessons learned from the pandemic have benefitted HIV services in past weeks -- multi-month prescribing, drugs delivered by post and consultations by phone being just three examples of such good practice., The main need remains in Ukraine, As the number of people fleeing hostilities in Ukraine grows by the hour, currently at more than 4 million, so does the number of refugees in need of consistent access to appropriate medication regimens in host countries., Refugee-hosting countries are advised to support the provision of ARVs to continue treatment for people enrolled in therapy., However, due to the fact that men are the majority of those in need of ARVs, and that male Ukrainian citizens aged 18--60 are prevented from leaving the country, the main need for the drugs remains within the country's borders., As of today, some 6.5 million people are internally displaced in Ukraine., ""Ensuring continued HIV treatment and sufficient stocks where people find temporary refuge -- not only in terms of HIV but also in the context of other communicable and noncommunicable diseases -- will be an ongoing challenge to humanitarian responders and Ukraine's health system,"" noted Dr Habicht. ""WHO and partners will continue to do everything in our power to implement immediate and longer term measures to address Ukraine's health emergency."", ENDS, Note to editors, For further information contact: eupress@who.int, Photo and video sources, available to the media:, Audiovisual material: http://who.canto.global/v/UkraineEmergency, Photos: EURO Photo Library",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-averted-now-who-pepfar-and-partners-ensure-supply-antiretroviral-drugs

"Secretary-General Reminds Security Council Members of Need for Solidarity, Expressing Deep Regret over Inaction on Suffering Ukraine, Poor Countries",News and Press Release,UN SG,Protection and Human Rights,5 Apr 2022,"SG/SM/21229, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the Security Council meeting on Ukraine, in New York today:, The war in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture founded on the United Nations Charter. Because of its nature, intensity and consequences., We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries., The war has led to senseless loss of life, massive devastation in urban centres and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. I will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha. I immediately called for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability., I am also deeply shocked by the personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence that are now emerging. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has spoken of possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law. The war has displaced more than 10 million people in just one month — the fastest forced population movement since the Second World War., Far beyond Ukraine’s borders, the war has led to massive increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers, because Russia and Ukraine are lynchpins of these markets. It has disrupted supply chains and increased the cost of transportation, putting even more pressure on the developing world. Many developing countries were already on the verge of debt collapse, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of adequate liquidity and debt relief, stemming ultimately from the unfair nature of our global economic and financial system. For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns., That is why I asked the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to Russia and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. Under-Secretary-General Griffiths will update you on the humanitarian situation and the results of his contacts so far. Under-Secretary-General [Rosemary] DiCarlo will also brief you on the political dimensions. But, as Secretary-General of the United Nations, it is my duty to call the attention of the Council to the serious damage being done to the global economy, and particularly to vulnerable people and developing countries., Our analysis indicates that 74 developing countries, with a total population of 1.2 billion people, are particularly vulnerable to spiking food, energy and fertilizer costs. Debt obligations take up some 16 per cent of developing countries’ export earnings. In small island developing States, the figure is 34 per cent and rising because of increased interest rates and the need to pay for expensive imports., In the past month alone, wheat prices have increased by 22 per cent, maize by 21 per cent and barley by 31 per cent. Brent oil prices on 1 April were more than 60 per cent higher than at the same time last year. A series of events have led to that, not only the present situation. Natural gas and fertilizer prices more than doubled over the same period. We are already seeing some countries move from vulnerability into crisis, and signs of serious social unrest., The flames of conflict are fuelled by inequality, deprivation and underfunding. With all the warning signals flashing red, we have a duty to act. The Global Crisis Response Group on food, energy and finance that I set up last month has formulated some initial recommendations for the consideration of Member States, international financial institutions and others., On food, we are urging all countries to keep markets open, resist unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions and make reserves available to countries at risk of hunger and famine. This is not the time for protectionism. Humanitarian appeals must be fully funded. People caught up in crisis around the world cannot pay the price for this war. On energy, the use of strategic stockpiles and additional reserves could help to ease this energy crisis in the short term., But the only medium- and long-term solution is to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, which is not impacted by market fluctuations. This will allow the progressive phase-out of coal and all other fossil fuels. Renewables are already cheaper in most cases., And on finance, international financial institutions must go into emergency mode. We need urgent action by the G20 and international financial institutions to increase liquidity and fiscal space so that Governments can provide safety nets for the poorest and most vulnerable. The reform I have been calling for of the global financial system is long overdue. All these actions are closely linked with the prevention agenda and with building and sustaining peace., The war in Ukraine must stop — now. We need serious negotiations for peace, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. This Council is charged with maintaining peace — and doing so in solidarity. I deeply regret the divisions that have prevented the Security Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but on other threats to peace and security around the world., I urge the Council to do everything in its power to end the war and to mitigate its impact, both on the suffering people of Ukraine, and on vulnerable people and developing countries around the world.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-general-reminds-security-council-members-need-solidarity-expressing-deep

Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia., More than 1 million people, mostly women, received information about women’s health, GBV and psychological advice for families prepared by UNFPA experts and partners., The Flash Appeal and the Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP) are being updated and extended until the end of 2022., Situation Overview, Since the start of the war, ongoing hostilities in Ukraine continue to drive unprecedented levels of displacement both inside the country and across international borders. Over 10 million people – roughly a quarter of the Ukrainian population– have fled their homes. Nearly 6.5 million are forcibly displaced within Ukraine, and over 4.2 million have fled to neighbouring countries. The Protection Monitoring Highlights of the Protection Cluster confirmed that the groups reporting being most affected by the situation or facing barriers in obtaining support were women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities. More than 12 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave because of heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, and lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the war, with continued reports of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, including health infrastructure and health workers. The humanitarian situation in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north) is also deteriorating. As of 1 April, the number of attacks on health facilities verified by the World Health Organizationhad risen to 82. Gender-based violence (GBV) specialized services continue to operate except in those communities where active hostilities are taking place, including Dnipro, Vinnytsia, Lviv and Odesa. Referral pathways for GBV survivors are not fully functioning in many locations and access to police services is limited., The Ombudsman and Ministry of Interior of Ukraine reported cases of rape and sexual violence in non-government-controlled areas. Human Rights Watch documented ""apparent war crimes"", including rape, in Russia-controlled areas, and local officials in Bucha (Kyiv oblast) reported the discovery of a mass grave of civilians allegedly killed by Russian troops. The UN Secretary-General and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an independent investigation of these reports., Ongoing hostilities in Ukraine have already caused major disruptions to the medical supply chain and logistics infrastructure. The lack of consistent and predictable private sector logistics providers (infrastructure and personnel) within the country leads to significant bottlenecks in last-mile distribution as well as high competition over limited assets across the country., Close to 100 partners are part of the health cluster and over 60 of the protection cluster in Ukraine. UNFPA chairs the GBV Sub-cluster under the Protection Cluster and the SRH Working group under the Health Cluster, with meetings held on a weekly basis to ensure a coordinated response.

Update on IDP Figures in Ukraine 5 April 2022 [EN/UK],Situation Report,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,5 Apr 2022,"The beginning of the war in Ukraine (24 February) triggered massive and rapid displacement within and outside the country, adding to the already existing 854,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Ukraine. While the centralized IDP registration system (administered by the Ministry of Social Policy) in place since 2014 is not yet able to capture all new IDPs in the country, IOM, REACH, UNHCR, OCHA, and the Protection Cluster agreed to work together to ensure the humanitarian community receives credible and harmonized population figures for IDPs in Ukraine., Since 9 March, IOM rolled out a survey of the general population in Ukraine to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility flows. The results of the survey were presented to the Protection Cluster, UNHCR, REACH and OCHA, and after a collective review of the methodology and findings, the group agreed that the figures provided by IOM are a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine. On 16 March, the results of the first round of IOM’s survey indicated that 6.48 million persons were internally displaced persons in Ukraine, The latest round of IOM’s survey was completed and presented on 5 April, leading to the updated population figure of 7.1 million IDPs in Ukraine (10% increase compared to the previous round). The second round also observed an increase of IDPs coming from Northern areas (Sumy, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv) and Kyiv., It is worth noting the remarkable ongoing efforts by Ukrainian authorities to expedite the registration of IDPs through their Unified IDP Registry, administered by the Ministry of Social Policy. The Government registration system has been in place since 2014 but was not initially enforced after the war started due to high numbers of new IDP arrivals and overstretched capacities in areas receiving IDPs., On 13 March 2022, however, authorities amended the Resolution 509 on IDP registration to adapt the system to the current context, including the delegation of authority of registration of IDPs to new and additional Government staff working in social protection institutions, centers for provision of administrative services (TSNAPs, in Ukrainian acronym), and executive authorities in villages and territorial communities. The Government registration system aims at confirming the internal displacement, assessing the needs of the IDP and allowing access to targeted assistance and services. Finally, since 4 April, Ukrainians are also allowed to record their change of residence through the digital application Diia, which will allow IDPs to alert the Government of their forced displacement and boost registration efforts., As of 5 April, in consultation with authorities, REACH reported that 1.6 million IDPs were already registered by authorities in 13 Oblast administrations of Ukraine. The humanitarian community remains committed to supporting the registration efforts of the Government, to allow official IDP figures to be duly updated.

"Describing relentless Russian attacks against his country, Ukraine President challenges Security Council to act for peace or disband United Nations",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 Apr 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9011TH MEETING (AM)
SC/14854, In an impassioned address to the Security Council today detailing the death and destruction caused by Russian forces in Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the President of that country challenged members to uphold international law or disband the United Nations, calling for the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system., The Council also heard briefings from the Secretary-General and two other senior United Nations officials on the political and humanitarian situations in Ukraine., President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, detailing actions of the Russian Federation, said that the most terrible war crimes since the Second World War are being committed in his country. Likening their actions to those of Da’esh, he said Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days, in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, he added, stressing that the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there”., Emphasizing that the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, especially Article I — to maintain international peace and security — are being violated, he asked: “What is the point of all other Articles?”, adding: “Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?” If not, “you need to act immediately”. To support peace in Ukraine, the Council must either remove the Russian Federation from the organ as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether” if there is nothing it can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted., The Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto power does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions, he said. If tyranny in places from Syria to Somalia had received a response, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched. Instead, the world watched, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg., He then proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force aggressors to peace. For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system, he said, proposing the creation of a “U24 office” specializing in preventive measures to maintain peace., United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the war in Ukraine as one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said., The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire., Mr. Griffiths, also Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, recounted his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary-General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid., While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. He expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine on 7 April to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response. Updating the Council on the situation on the ground, he said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled., Rosemary Dicarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noting that the number of civilians killed has more than doubled since her 17 March briefing, said: “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war.” The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, with early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggesting that, if the war continues through 2022, 18 years of hard-won socioeconomic gains in Ukraine could be rolled back. While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations., Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”, In the ensuing discussion, most Council members expressed shock at the images of corpses coming out of Bucha while the Russian Federation’s representative argued that those images are fake and were staged., The representative of the United States said that the heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images from Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to its “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council as that country uses its membership as a platform for its propaganda., Albania’s representative, also backing the call for the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council and noting this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. Describing Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, he said it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes. “You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured, deploring that the Russian Federation has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria., Likewise, the Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional steps ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The bloc has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression., The Russian Federation’s representative retorted that Ukraine’s President is laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented by the Ukraine delegation to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days., The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who, in fact, do not care about Ukraine, he said, imploring Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation. President Zelenskyy should find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long-awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging Mr. Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals., China’s delegate said that the disturbing images from Bucha must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions against the Russian Federation on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only expedite the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, adding that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard., Kenya’s representative recounted that, in April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed., In a similar vein, Brazil’s delegate warned against the Council becoming “a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said., The United Arab Emirates’ delegate urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such willful destruction. She also expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance., Also speaking today were the representatives of Gabon, Ireland, Mexico, India, France, Norway, Ghana and the United Kingdom., The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 1:10 p.m., Letter Dated 3 April from Russian Federation Requesting Meeting on 4 April, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) asked about his delegation’s two requests to convene a meeting on 4 April in connection with the horrific provocation by Ukrainian forces in Bucha. The United Kingdom’s delegation, as Council President, considered it was possible to “blatantly violate” the Council’s rules, marking the second time it issued a decision that was not coordinated with anyone. “This is an outrageous situation,” he stressed, asking the United Kingdom on what basis it decided it could act in such a manner, in contravention of existing norms and rules, and stressing that it should have instead convened a meeting and addressed the advisability of his delegation’s request through a vote. He pointed out that during its Council Presidency, the Russian Federation did not refuse any of the six meetings on Ukraine. He demanded an explanation for the decision and expressed hope the United Kingdom would not challenge any future requests., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) clarified that her delegation, as Council President, did not in fact reject the Russian Federation’s request. It had indeed received the letter on 3 April requesting the meeting and, in line with the obligation of the Presidency to schedule a meeting, proposed to either schedule it alongside today’s meeting — which is well within the 48-hour limit, the convention — or to hold the meetings sequentially. The Russian Federation turned down both proposals. Her delegation shares the view this is an urgent situation, and it offered either to hold a separate meeting today, or to combine a meeting with the current one. She noted that the presidency made its decisions in line with the Council’s provisional rules of procedure and that it had received no other complaints from Council members., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) replied that his delegation has evidence that “this was no less than 24 hours before” the meeting that it had requested. “This is confirmed in documents,” he said, nonetheless expressing hope that her comments reflect the fact that the presidency will not refuse Member State requests for meetings., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom) noted that her delegation, as Council President, will not refuse to hold meetings in the future., Briefings, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that the war in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, founded on the Charter of the United Nations, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said. He said he will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha and had immediately called for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability. He was also deeply shocked by the personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence that are now emerging. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has spoken of possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law., The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. But as Secretary-General of the United Nations, it is his duty to call the attention of the Council to the serious damage being done to the global economy, and particularly to vulnerable people and developing countries, he stressed. United Nations analysis indicates that 74 developing countries, with a total population of 1.2 billion people, are particularly vulnerable to spiking food, energy and fertilizer costs. Debt obligations take up some 16 per cent of developing countries’ export earnings. In small island developing States, the figure is 34 per cent and rising., Some countries are moving from vulnerability into crisis, and signs of serious social unrest are emerging, as the flames of conflict are fuelled by inequality, deprivation and underfunding. “With all the warning signals flashing red, we have a duty to act,” he said, noting that the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance he set up in March has made some initial recommendations for the consideration of Member States, international financial institutions and others. He urged all countries to keep markets open, resist unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions, and make reserves available to countries at risk of hunger and famine. “This is not the time for protectionism. Humanitarian appeals must be fully funded,” he said, stressing: “People caught up in crisis around the world cannot pay the price for this war.” While the use of strategic energy stockpiles and additional reserves could help to ease the energy crisis in the short term, the only medium- and long-term solution is to expedite the deployment of renewable energy, which is not impacted by market fluctuations., “The war in Ukraine must stop — now,” he said, stressing the need for serious peace negotiations, based on Charter principles. Expressing deep regret over the divisions that have prevented the Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but also on other threats to peace and security around the world, he urged the Council to do everything in its power to end the Ukraine war and to mitigate its impact, both on the suffering people of Ukraine and on vulnerable people and developing countries worldwide., ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that the security situation in Ukraine has seriously deteriorated since her 17 March briefing. The number of Ukrainian civilians killed has more than doubled; Ukrainian cities continue to be mercilessly pounded, often indiscriminately, by heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; and hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in encircled areas under nightmarish conditions. “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war,” she said. The horror deepened this past weekend, as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha, the town near Kyiv formerly held by Russian forces. Many bodies were also found in a mass grave in the same locality. Reports by non-governmental organizations and media also allege summary executions of civilians, rape and looting in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions., Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”, While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations. Noting the reported withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Chernobyl nuclear site, she said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that this will hopefully allow it to conduct an assistance and support mission to provide technical advice and to deliver equipment, where necessary, as soon as possible. All Ukraine nuclear sites must be fully protected and secured, and military operations in or around these locations must be avoided., Expressing grave concern over the persistent use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in or near populated areas, she said such weapons are causing most civilian casualties, as well as massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has received credible allegations that Russian forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. Allegations that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons are also being investigated. Emphasizing that indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes, she said: “The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to.”, As of 4 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total of 85 attacks on health‑care facilities causing at least 72 fatalities and 43 injuries, she said. Seriously concerned about reported cases of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of persons who have been vocal against the Russian invasion, she called for their immediate release. She also pointed to allegations of conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces, including gang rape and rapes in front of children. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to seek to verify all these allegations, she said, noting disturbing videos depicting abuse of prisoners of war on both sides., “The many credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, from the areas recently retaken from Russian forces, must not go unanswered,” she said, supporting efforts to examine these allegations and gather evidence, and stressing the need for accountability and justice. Gravely concerned about the risk of human trafficking, as one quarter of Ukraine’s population is displaced, she said suspected and verified cases are surfacing in the surrounding countries, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM)., The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, she said. Early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggest that, if the war continues through 2022, Ukraine faces the prospect of losing 18 years of socioeconomic progress. This would set the country — and the region — back decades and leave deep long-term social and economic fissures, she said, highlighting UNDP’s work to preserve Ukraine’s hard-won development gains, including helping the Government to sustain essential governance structures, basic services and livelihoods, such as through cash-based assistance. The war has damaged Europe’s security architecture; its economic repercussions are evident far from the battlefield, she said, warning that the longer the war continues, the greater the risk of it further weakening global peace and security institutions and mechanisms. “This war was started by choice. There is no inevitability to it or to the suffering it is causing,” she said, adding: “The United Nations is ready to do everything within its means to help bring it to an end.”, MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled., He said the ground and air offensives and counteroffensives are making life nearly impossible for civilians, with families, the elderly, women and children trapped by the fighting. For more than five weeks, the people of Mariupol have been caught up in fighting, while other cities — including Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv — remain cut off from essential goods and services. “Perilous conditions are hampering our efforts to access civilians — or for them to access us,” he stressed. “Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks”. He called on all parties to protect civilians and allow impartial humanitarian organizations safe, rapid and unimpeded access to all civilians in need, wherever they are in Ukraine., For its part, the Organization and its partners are making every effort to dramatically increase support, he said. Six thousand volunteers from the Ukraine Red Cross, together with those from local non-governmental organizations in eastern Ukraine, are working tirelessly to provide a lifeline to communities. The World Food Programme (WFP) meanwhile has reached more than 1.3 million people with cash and food assistance and plans to reach around 2.5 million people in this month. Health partners report more than 180 tons of medical supplies were delivered, with another 470 tons on the way, addressing the health needs of 6 million people., He also announced that, after much effort, in the past day another convoy was dispatched from the humanitarian coordination hub in Dnipro to Severodonetsk — in the far east. “Today, food, winter clothing, non-food items, medicine and hygiene kits were offloaded to the Ukraine Red Cross and will reach the hands of those in most need in Severodonetsk,” he assured. Following notification to both parties, four convoys in total have provided critical support to people in some of the cities with ongoing fighting. Several more are planned. “While these are initial steps, it gives us a basis to now expand, taking our efforts to scale,” he said., Reiterating his concern over the growing number of reports of human trafficking, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and the region — many of which overwhelmingly impact displaced women and children — he said the United Nations is bolstering protection and gender-based‑violence services to provide specialized care for survivors. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society organizations, he added., He went on to recount his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary‑General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering, including by pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid., While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. On 7 April, he expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response., On that point, he said the humanitarian response since February has been scaled up, allowing his team to meet the needs of 1.4 million people. Stressing that funding must not be diverted from other crises, he said conflict, climate shocks and COVID-19, compounded by soaring food and fuel costs, could push another 47 million people into severe food insecurity. The total number of people who will not know where their next meal comes, could be driven to 325 million — by far the highest in recent history and well over double what it was less than three years ago., He closed by reminding the Council of what it already knows: “The world cannot afford this war.” He called on the Council — and all Member States with influence — to support the pursuit of peace and alleviation of humanitarian suffering, for the sake of the people of Ukraine and those around the world who cannot afford to bear the burden this war will impose on them., Statements, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine, briefing the Council via videoconference, said he had returned from Bucha on 4 April, an area newly liberated from Russian troops. Stressing that “there is not a single crime they would not commit there”, he recounted how they sought and purposely killed anyone who served Ukraine, including women outside their houses, and then burned the bodies. Addressing the Council today in honour of the deceased, those who were shot in the head after being tortured and others who were thrown into wells, crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars, those whose limbs were cut off and tongues pulled out because the aggressors did not hear what they wanted to hear., He said these actions are no different than those of Da’esh, except that they are being perpetrated by a member of the Security Council, one that is destroying borders and taking away the rights of countries that are self‑determined, in constant pursuit of a policy to destroy ethnic and religious diversity. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. He said the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there” and that the global institution established to prevent aggression “simply cannot work effectively”. While the world can now witness Russian military actions in Bucha, it has yet to see what those troops have done in other occupied Ukrainian cities. “Geography might be different, but cruelty is the same, crimes are the same,” he assured. “Accountability must be inevitable”., He recalled Article I of the Charter of the United Nations, stating that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace. With this foundational document being violated, starting with Article I: “What is the point of all other Articles?”, he asked, drawing attention to the most terrible war crimes being committed since the Second World War. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, deliberately creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities., The response by the Russian Federation is always the same, he said, most evidently on display after its downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Donbas or during the war in Syria: “They will blame everyone just to justify their own actions,” and offer different versions of events to obfuscate what is true, he said. They will say all videos are staged. However, it is 2022: There is evidence and satellite images. Full, transparent investigations can be conducted, maximum access can be granted for journalists and maximum cooperation extended with international institutions, with involvement by the International Criminal Court to establish truth and full accountability. “Every Member State of the United Nations should be interested in this,” he said, in order punish those who believe they can get away with anything., He described Russian leaders as the colonizers of ancient times, who need Ukraine’s wealth and who have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to their own country and abducted children. He accused the Russian Federation of wanting to “turn Ukrainians into silent slaves” andopenly stealing everything, “starting with food and ending with gold earrings that are pulled out and covered with blood”. He warned that “we are dealing with a State that is turning the veto of the United Nations Security Council into the right to die”, undermining the global security architecture. If it continues, countries will rely only on the power of their own arms to ensure security, rather than international law and global institutions., Going forward, he offered options. The United Nations can be simply closed. “Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?”, he asked. If not, “you need to act immediately”. The United Nations Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions. Determination is needed. The massacres from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped long ago. If tyranny had received a response to the war it had waged, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched., Instead, the world watched, he said, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, brought before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg. Recalling that Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann did not go unpunished, he said “it is time to transform the United Nations”., He proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization have not been achieved, and will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force the aggressors to peace. “The power of peace must become dominant.”, For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system. He proposed the creation of a “U24 office” that specializes in preventive measures to maintain peace and recalled his country’s evacuation of more than 1,000 people from Afghanistan at its own expense, taking in people of different nationalities and ethnic groups, without distinction. “We helped all of them,” he emphasized, conveying its moral right to propose reform of global security system., Now, decisions are needed from the Security Council in support of peace in Ukraine, he said. He recommended either removing the Russian Federation as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, and then exerting utmost efforts to establish peace. Or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether”, he said, urging its members to admit if there is nothing they can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted. He then asked them to watch a video., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), speaking in her national capacity, then thanked President Zelenskyy for his leadership in wartime and the extraordinary fortitude and bravery of the Ukrainian people during the unprovoked and illegal invasion., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) gave her own account of the refugee crisis in parts of Europe, noting that she returned last night from her trip to the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Behind bombed‑out buildings are destroyed lives, she said, telling the stories of three Ukrainians she spoke to. They are just a few among the more than 10 million people displaced, of whom about 4 million people left Ukraine, she stressed. Commending the “big heartedness” of the neighboring countries that host them, she said the United States has committed $1 billion in new humanitarian funding to support these refugees and is welcoming 100,000 refugees from Ukraine to her country. The heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images coming out of Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to their “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council. Moscow uses its membership in that organ as a platform for its propaganda. Recalling 141 Member States voted in the General Assembly against the Russian aggression, she said “now is the time to match those words with action”, she said., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), describing the events described by President Zelenskyy as “revolting”, commended Ukrainians for their heroic resistance and resilience. “You have the world on your side,” he said. “Slavia Ukraine.” Noting that this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, he said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. While the Russian army is in disarray, it has not stopped its shelling and bombardments, leaving behind unspeakable horrors and soul-crushing images: executions of people with a bullet in the neck, or with their hands tied behind their backs; people shot on their bicycles. There are images of mass graves and looted homes, acts that are usually only attributed to thugs. He described Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, noting that, time and again, the Council has heard that the Russian Federation is not to blame. Yet, it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes., “You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said, or non-governmental organizations on the ground. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” These crimes, verified by Human Rights Watch, call for answers, investigations, accountability and justice. The Russian Federation has the obligation to abide by the laws of war, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and its First Additional Protocol, and the International Court of Justice opinion that it must halt its military activities. The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured. He expressed support for the call to suspend the Russian Federation from participating in the Human Rights Council, noting that it has blocked the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Ukraine, denying the international community of the eyes it needs there and leading to more war crimes and humanitarian disasters. Indeed, it is out-gunned and out-numbered by the Ukrainian resistance. It has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) said that one day of war is one day too many. While the conflict is in its sixth week, the number of displaced people now exceeds the 10 million mark, including nearly 4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. This is a frightening humanitarian catastrophe, with transregional knock-on effects, she said. Expressing concern about reports of atrocities in Bucha, she stressed the urgent need for a United Nations to carry out an independent probe into the incidents. The Security Council should not lose sight of its responsibility to restore peace and security by offering an alternative to war. This war has gone on too long, she said, calling for a ceasefire, and the creation of the conditions for the safe, unfettered deployment of humanitarian aid to the populations in distress. Expressing her country’s appreciation to the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, she asked that the same welcome be granted to all people in distress without distinction of origin or of race, including African nationals and students., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the Emergency Relief Coordinator should know better than anyone the efforts being made by his country to organize humanitarian corridors. Without any participation from Ukraine, the Russian Federation saved 123,500 people in Mariupol. Over 600,000 have been evacuated to the Russian Federation since the special operation began. “We’re not talking about coercion or abduction,” he clarified, adding that their voluntary decisions are supported by videos on social media. To Ukraine’s President, he said: “We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military,” which are uncorroborated by eye-witnesses. Recalling the many hopes tied to the President’s election, as he had pledged an end to the war in Donbas and protection for its Russian-speaking inhabitants, he said “we were on the verge of correcting injustices” sparked by the events at Maidan in 2014. However, those hopes failed to materialize, as the President now calls people in Donetsk and Luhansk a subspecies, repeating remarks by his predecessor who said those people would “rot in their basements”. He accused the Ukrainian President of launching a linguistic inquisition against Russian speakers in the region, and being responsible for the explosions occurring across Ukraine “because there was, unfortunately, no other way to bring peace to the Donbas”., He went on to blame Ukraine’s President for refusing to comply with the Minsk agreements. To claims that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, he retorted: “Not only are they there, they are running the show”, calling Ukraine’s national heroes Nazi collaborators, responsible for the killing of Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews. While Ukraine’s President pretends not to acknowledge Ukrainian Nazis, they are often young people and “they’re not concealing it”, he said. They decorate their clothes with swastikas and give Nazi greetings to one another. There are many in the national battalions, including the Azov battalion. And they are not just killing Russian prisoners and soldiers; they are killing their own people, showing unrivalled cruelty by using civilians as human shields. Reading out testimonials about cruelty of Ukrainian nationals, including from a grandmother who said the Azov battalion did not allow her to leave her basement, and offering accounts of girls who were stripped naked and had their jewellery stolen, he went on to describe Ukrainians in Mariupol who since 25 February have taken up armed positions and fired against residential buildings. When asked why they were taking these actions, he said Ukrainian soldiers replied that they would do so until they destroyed the Russian spirit. It was the Donetsk people’s republic forces who helped one woman escape., He accused Ukraine’s President of laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days. The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who in fact do not care about Ukraine. He implored Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation and questioned how people could sink to such depths of cruelty, notably laid bare by the Azov battalion. He expressed hope President Zelenskyy would find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long‑awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging President Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals. He must make decisions that are right for his country., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) stressed that the world has witnessed a level of destruction not seen in Europe in many years, pointing particularly to the shocking images of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha and piled into improvised mass graves. There can never be impunity for such crimes, she said, calling for full investigation and prosecution by domestic and international courts, including the International Criminal Court. Noting that her country will continue to support such efforts, she called for accountability and justice for the victims and survivors of this war. “We at this table share that responsibility in face of such atrocities,” she said, calling on the parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law. Pointing to increasing allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers, she stressed that conflict-related sexual violence can constitute a war crime and that the perpetrators of such crimes must be held accountable. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, she highlighted the spillover effects of the war throughout the world, including deterioration of food security, surging energy prices and increasing poverty, with the most vulnerable and impoverished in developing countries to suffer the most., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) echoed calls for an independent and thorough investigation of the recent human rights violations in Ukraine, while reiterating pleas for a broad, effective and immediate cessation of hostilities. Noting that Brazil supported the General Assembly’s recently adopted resolution on the country’s humanitarian situation, he said the Council “must not become a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said, adding that it should support civilians wishing to flee to safety and urging the parties to grant safe passage. Meanwhile, there can be no politicization of humanitarian actions nor selective application of international humanitarian law, and geopolitical objectives must not supersede the quest for peace nor prolong the suffering caused by war., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) said the continued contestation of the truth about Bucha — even as the world beholds civilians murdered with their hands tied behind their back — “is the surest sign that we stand on the precipice”. In April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed. What started as a special military operation is now a war which has led to thousands of dead civilians and millions of refugees, and no one can doubt that there are flagrant violations of international law, international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations under way in Ukraine. Condemning the unjustifiable actions undertaken in recent weeks, he called for an impartial and prompt United Nations investigation into the atrocities committed in Bucha and urged the parties to make clear to their military officers that they will be held to account for their actions. He also called for the urgent safe passage of civilians, especially from Mariupol, Kherson and other besieged cities., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) recalled that, through two General Assembly resolutions, the international community has sent a strong, clear message against the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Noting that the International Court of Justice also demanded the immediate suspension of military operations on Ukraine territory, he said it is up to the United Nations to ensure compliance with the Court’s decisions. All mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes established by international law must be used towards that common goal. Strongly condemning the atrocities committed in Bucha, he said the international community must protect the civilian population. Mexico supports the Secretary-General’s call for prompt, impartial investigations to identify the perpetrators. It will also closely follow the work of the International Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged international crimes committed in Ukraine, as well as the Commission on Inquiry, created for the same purposes by the Human Rights Council. The efforts of the international community to deal with the humanitarian crisis are only temporary, he said, stressing that the solution must be an immediate cessation of hostilities and a political agreement., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) said that since the Council last discussed Ukraine, the security and humanitarian situations have only deteriorated. Describing recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha as deeply disturbing and condemning them unequivocally, he called for an independent investigation and expressed his hope that the international community will continue to respond to Ukraine’s humanitarian needs. India supports calls urging for safe passage guarantees to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies and has been sending aid to Ukraine and its neighbours. It continues to call for the immediate cessation of violence and an end to hostilities. “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option,” he stressed, taking note of the parties’ ongoing efforts in that regard. Also voicing concern that the impact of the crisis is being felt beyond the region with increasing food and energy costs – especially for many developing countries – he said it is in everyone’s interest to work constructively, both within and outside the United Nations, towards an early resolution to the conflict., ZHANG JUN (China) welcomed the round of talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, urging the international community to create space for diplomacy, instead of creating obstacles and adding fuel to the fire. His country attaches great importance to humanitarian aid, calling on parties to the conflict to abide by the principle of civilian protection. Calling for neutrality and impartiality in humanitarian assistance, he said civilians should be spared from any violence. Turning to the disturbing images from Bucha, he said they must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only accelerate the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, deploring that more than 30 years after the end of the cold war, geopolitical risks remain. Stressing the need to uphold sovereignty of States, he said that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. China’s only goal is peace, and Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France), stressing that the war of aggression has reached a new threshold of horror following events in Bucha, Borodianka and Motyiyn, condemned in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russian forces, which could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Moscow has added to its disgrace that of invoking lies and denial. She urged the Council not to give in to hatred and to instead take action, first and foremost by maintaining the strongest possible pressure on Moscow to compel it to end its war, which is compromising global security. Stressing that France, with its European partners, will continue to support Ukraine, she said credible, independent inquiries must be allowed to judge these actions. She called on the sides to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry. International humanitarian law must be respected, and civilians and humanitarian personnel protected. Noting that the European Union has mobilized €500 million in urgent support, she said all efforts must be made to achieve a cessation of hostilities. After this is secured, France will support Ukraine’s authorities in seeking a political solution, while maintaining dialogue with the Russian Federation. She also called on the Russian people to find ways to express their opposition to the aggression and to break the logic of hatred., MONA JUUL (Norway), stressing that the need for peace in Ukraine could not be more urgent, said her delegation is appalled by the reports emerging from the areas around Kyiv and other regions. “We are deeply shocked by the atrocities committed against civilians in places that have been held by Russian forces, including Bucha,” she added, citing evidence of mass graves, as well as the destruction of homes, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. “Russia is desperate to hide the truth about the war,” she said. However, atrocities must be investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice. She welcomed the establishment by the Human Rights Council of a Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine and urged the International Criminal Court to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, while urging Moscow and anyone holding evidence to fully cooperate with those investigations. Norway has called for a negotiated solution to end the war, in view of the massive suffering and displacement, the global implications of the conflict and the fact that reconstruction will take decades., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) echoed concerns raised over the prolongation of the war in Ukraine and the increasing humanitarian cost arising from the unjustified aggression by the Russian Federation. Expressing grave concern over reports of alleged gross violations of international humanitarian law and international criminal law, including emerging reports and images of killings and human rights violations, he echoed the call for an independent, impartial and thorough investigations to establish facts and to hold all perpetrators accountable. The killing of children, the elderly, medical personnel, humanitarian workers and journalists is particularly deplorable, he said, condemning such acts unreservedly. Calling for restraint by all sides and emphasizing the urgency of an unconditional nationwide cessation of hostilities, he urged the Council to focus its attention on confidence-building measures that facilitate a negotiated settlement, and on the wider question of European security on the basis of international law and other internationally agreed frameworks., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said the briefings delivered today are a reminder of the rapidly deteriorating conditions in Ukraine, with the rising death toll a grim reflection of the human cost of war. To the shocking images emerging from Bucha, and the crimes they entail, she said: “We must establish what has happened here,” underscoring the imperative that “we do not get caught up in a war of narratives”. Existing mechanisms must be able to conduct investigations and she voiced support for an independent investigation. With the war now in its sixth week, an immediate cessation of hostilities is imperative. The United Arab Emirates views ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv as “a very positive development” and remains hopeful that they can translate to de‑escalation on the ground. She urged others to support these efforts, noting that establishing a viable humanitarian ceasefire could offer a bridge to broader negotiations. The priority must be to alleviate civilian suffering. The Council must continue to reaffirm the need for all parties to abide by their international humanitarian law obligations, and to the principles of distinction and proportionality., Difficulties for providing humanitarian access must be urgently addressed. Stressing that false narratives and disinformation cause real harm for humanitarian organizations, she said technology has only increased the scale and speed of harmful information in reaching audiences online. She also urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such willful destruction. She expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), Council President for April, speaking in her national capacity, recalled that the United Nations was created in the wake of a European war of aggression that laid waste to Europe and engulfed the world. Yet, the world is seeing another war of aggression in Europe, hearing again today about the devastating impact of the Russian Federation’s unilateral and illegal military action on Ukraine, on surrounding countries and the region, and on the security and prosperity of the wider world. Now, as the Russian Federation is forced into retreat from areas around Kyiv, the brutality of the invasion is laid bare, she said, noting the horrific images from the towns of Bucha and Irpin of civilians deliberately killed in areas from which Russian forces have recently withdrawn. These acts, and all other credible incidents, must be investigated as war crimes. Her country fully supports the work of the International Criminal Court and the work of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and other national prosecutors. “As we and so many others have said so many times, all of this could be stopped if the Russian Federation ends this war now,” she said., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor again, pointed again to the events in Bucha, which led to far-reaching conclusions by Western countries. All units of the Russian armed forces fully withdrew on 30 March from Bucha as a gesture of good faith. During the time when the town was under Russian control, not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence. People moved around freely and used their cellphones. The Russian army supplied 450 tons of humanitarian assistance to the towns in Kyiv Oblast. People were not prevented from leaving the towns to the north. The southern areas of Bucha, including residential areas, were shelled around the clock by Ukraine forces. On 31 March, the mayor of Bucha confirmed that there were no more Russian soldiers left in town; he did not mention any people being shot with hands tied. It is hard to believe that the mayor would not have noticed 280 corpses on the street. In an eight-minute video about a mop-up operation by Ukraine’s police on 2 April, there were no bodies of civilians on the street. Testimonies of crimes by the Russian armed forces appeared on the fourth day after their withdrawal., He expressed displeasure at how these Ukrainian videos were picked up by Western media and human rights organizations that claim to be impartial, adding that, if bodies were out in the open for several days, they would have shown signs well known to forensic specialists. The New York Times even went further to report that the bodies had been there since 20 March. In videos circulated by Ukraine, there were many bodies wearing a white armband. White armbands were worn by civilians after the entry of Russian forces. In one of the videos posted on social media by Ukraine radicals, there is a call to shoot anyone not wearing a blue armband. One member of the municipal council of Bucha stated, in an interview by Medusa, that she did not see the Russian armed forces execute civilians and that the Ukrainian armed forces are guilty of most violations., He warned that Ukrainian disinformation and staging experts are preparing staged videos for future release by Western media, predicting that there will be a further horrible provocation similar to the one about Bucha. The aim is to depict Russian soldiers as murderers and rapists, he said, adding that modern technology allows for the creation of any video. To his United States counterpart, he said her country’s crusade to expel the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council was a manipulation, reminding other delegations that the United States left that organ when it criticized United States soldiers in Afghanistan., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that his Russian counterpart decided to quote from an interview in Medusa, but failed to quote the interview in full. The woman he had quoted said that Russian soldiers gave dry rations, and after lowering them, they tossed grenades into the basement. This is Moscow’s idea of humanitarian assistance. He asked the Russian representative how Russians got to the level of cruelty of the Nazis and when they started enjoying acting like Nazis by killing civilians, attempting to redraw internationally recognized borders and deciding to resolve the Ukrainian issue in the way that Adolf Hitler attempted to resolve the Jewish issue. “I’m appalled over your cynical and outright lie that you don’t hit civilian targets,” he said. “You hit civilian targets and you killed civilians.”, He said that, at a press conference the Russian Federation gave on Monday, Mr. Nebenzia stated that civilians were killed by the Russian army. In Mr. Nebenzia’s mind, a hospital destroyed by the Russian army on Monday was a military target and a child killed there was a Ukrainian nationalist. However, Ukraine will win and so will the world. If there is anything to thank the Russian representative for, it is his acknowledgement of a “war” the Russians waged against Ukraine, not a “special military operation”. That confession should impact the United Nations assessment of what is happening in the centre of Europe. Mr. Nebenzia should be reminded that former German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop denied any knowledge of concentration camps and racial extermination policies, but was found guilty by the Nuremberg war crime tribunal, adding: “We all know what happened to him on 16 October in 1946.”, OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union delegation, speaking in its capacity as observer, said the Russian Federation’s war of aggression is in a blatant violation of international law, the Charter and the “acquis” of OSCE, jeopardizing the rules-based order, as well as European and global security. Stressing that the images from Bucha are a “stain on our common humanity”, he demanded that Moscow immediately stop its military aggression, unconditionally withdraw all forces from Ukraine’s entire territory and fully respect its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders, as demanded by General Assembly resolution A/ES-11/1., Accusing the Russian Federation of directing attacks against civilians and targeting civilian infrastructure, he welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The European Union has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression. It has mobilized € 1.1 billion in emergency aid, on top of the €2.4 billion in humanitarian, emergency and early recovery assistance provided to Ukraine since 2014. And in the largest operation under the Civil Protection Mechanism, 29 European countries, together with Norway and Turkey, have sent over 13,000 metric tons of medicines, hospital equipment, ambulances and firefighting equipment, food aid and energy supplies. A Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund also has been set up to channel support to post-war reconstruction, he added, calling for an immediate ceasefire, safe passage for civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian access., For information media.

Update 43 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (5 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,5 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the process of resuming regulatory control at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has begun, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine also reported that the next rotation of operational personnel working at the Chornobyl site will be possible only when security conditions allow it. Many NPP personnel live in the city of Slavutych outside the 30-kilometre Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident., Representatives of the State Administration of the Exclusion Zone are currently in the Zone, carrying out checks at storage facilities and other facilities outside the Chornobyl NPP site, Ukraine added., Out of the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine said seven were operating, including two at Zaporizhzhya, three at Rivne, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, including both units at Khmelnytskyy, or held in reserve., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-43-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-5-april-2022

Safety and Security",5 Apr 2022,"On 4 April, a four-person team from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) visited Mykolaiv, southeastern Ukraine, to meet with city and regional health authorities. At around 3.30 pm, as the MSF team entered the city's oncology hospital, which has been treating wounded since the beginning of the Ukraine war, the area around the hospital came under fire., ""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" says Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine, currently based in Odesa. ""As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body. However, we are not in a position to give exact numbers of dead and injured."", ""Fortunately, our staff were able to take cover and were not hurt in the explosions,"" says Lacharité. ""Although the windows of their vehicle, parked outside the hospital entrance, were blown out by the blasts."", “Bombing such a large area within a residential neighbourhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings. Hospitals, patients and medical staff must absolutely be spared from attack.”
MICHEL-OLIVIER LACHARITÉ, MSF HEAD OF MISSION IN UKRAINE, The team reported that the regional paediatric hospital, about 300 metres away, was also hit. No large crater was visible. In the wake of the explosions, they saw numerous small holes in the ground, scattered over a large area. These elements could be consistent with the use of cluster bombs., The neighbourhood where the oncology hospital is located is a residential area in the east of the port city, where many medical facilities are concentrated., At the time of the airstrikes by Russian forces, the MSF team was preparing to launch new activities in support of people displaced by the war, in partnership with a local organisation., “Bombing such a large area within a residential neighbourhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,” says Lacharité. “In the past two days, three hospitals in Mykolaiv have been hit by airstrikes.”, “In addition to yesterday’s strikes, Hospital No. 5, located in the south of the city, was hit on 3 April,” says Lacharité. “Hospitals, patients and medical staff must absolutely be spared from attack.”, MSF is currently assessing how to expand our planned activities in Mykolaiv.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/area-around-hospitals-houses-bombed-mykolaiv

Shelter and Non-Food Items",5 Apr 2022,"(Dnipro, 5 April 2022): Today, the United Nations and humanitarian partners delivered eight trucks of critical supplies for people in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Luhanska oblast. Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the intensifying hostilities, with thousands of people cut off from gas and water supplies and residential buildings repeatedly hit by shelling in Sievierodonetsk, preventing people from safely evacuating and severely restricting their access to basic necessities., The convoy brought food rations, flour, plastic sheeting and blankets for some 17,000 people, as well as four hospital electricity generators, from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), INGO People in Need (PiN), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP). The notification system for the movement of humanitarian supplies was facilitated through the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)., “We’re in Sievierodonetsk today, where fighting is ongoing and civilians in the city are in urgent need of assistance. The UN and humanitarian partners delivered ready-to-eat meals, canned goods, flour and essential relief items such as blankets, mattresses, solar-powered lamps, and other household items,” said Markus Werne, the Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator., These items will be provided to those most in need through the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, while deliveries will also be made to vulnerable people who remain in their homes or bunkers around Sievierodonetsk., The Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator also stressed that, “we will continue to deliver here and to cities across Ukraine but what we require is protection of civilians and continued access.”, For further information, please contact:, Amanda Pitt, in Lviv: +31 6 282 632 76, +380 50 380 7943, pitta@un.org, Saviano Abreu, in Lviv: +380 681 334 432, WhatsApp/Signal: +254 780 530 141, deabreuisidoro@un.org, OCHA press releases are available at www.unocha.org or www.reliefweb.int.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-supply-convoy-reaches-sievierodonetsk-un-and-partners

DiCarlo: Ukraine war threatens global peace institutions - Security Council Briefing on Ukraine by Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo,News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",5 Apr 2022,"Madam President,, Since I last briefed this Council on 17 March, the security situation in Ukraine has seriously deteriorated. The number of Ukrainian civilians killed has more than doubled. Ukrainian cities continue to be mercilessly pounded, often indiscriminately, by heavy artillery and aerial bombardments., And hundreds of thousands of people, including children, the elderly and the disabled, remain trapped in encircled areas under nightmarish conditions. The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war., The horror deepened this past weekend, as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha, the town near Kyiv formerly held by Russian forces. Many bodies were also found in a mass grave in the same locality., Reports by non-governmental organizations and media also allege summary executions of civilians, rape and looting in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions., Madam President,, Away from the fighting, diplomatic efforts to end this war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued. We commend the Government of Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with Russia and Ukraine to help bring about peace., We welcome the willingness of the sides to continue engaging to reach a mutual understanding. This requires good faith and earnest efforts. Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground., While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns elsewhere. The General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to withdraw entirely from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations., We also take note of the reported withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Chernobyl nuclear site. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that this development will hopefully allow it to conduct an assistance and support mission to provide technical advice and to deliver equipment, where necessary, as soon as possible., All nuclear sites in Ukraine must be fully protected and secured. Military operations in or around these locations must be avoided., Madam President,, The numbers tell a tragic, if yet incomplete, story. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, at least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 injured between 24 February and 4 April 2022. OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher., We are gravely concerned by the persistent use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in or near populated areas. Such weapons are causing most civilian casualties as well as massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems., OHCHR has received credible allegations that Russian forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. Allegations that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons are also being investigated., As noted by the High Commissioner, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes. The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to., In besieged cities, a significant increase in mortality rates among civilians can also be attributed to the disruption of medical care and basic services. People with disabilities and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. As of 4 April 2022, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 85 attacks on health care facilities resulting in at least 72 fatalities and 43 injuries., Madam President,, We are seriously concerned about reports of cases of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of persons who have been vocal against the Russian invasion., As of 30 March, OHCHR has documented the arbitrary detention and possible enforced disappearance of 22 journalists and civil society members in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions. 24 local officials have also been detained in regions under Russian control, 13 of whom have been subsequently released., We call for the immediate release of all individuals who have been arbitrarily detained, including journalists, local officials, civil society activists and others., Also as of 30 March, OHCHR has recorded seven journalists and media workers killed since hostilities began. Another 15 have come under armed attack, nine of whom were injured., Allegations of conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces have also emerged. These include gang rape and rapes in front of children., There are also claims of sexual violence by Ukrainian forces and civil defense militias. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to seek to verify all these allegations., We are also concerned about disturbing videos depicting abuse of prisoners of war on both sides. All prisoners of war must be treated with dignity and full respect for their rights in accordance with international humanitarian law., Madam President,, The many credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, from areas recently retaken from Russian forces, must not go unanswered., We support efforts to examine these allegations and to gather evidence. Ensuring accountability and justice for acts committed during the war will not be easy, but it is essential., Madam President,, We are heartened by the generosity of neighboring countries who have accepted millions of refugees and the solidarity of Ukrainian people, who are hosting their displaced compatriots., With more than 10 million people displaced either within Ukraine or abroad as refugees—or roughly one-quarter of the population -- the United Nations is gravely concerned about the heightened risk of human trafficking., Indeed, suspected and verified cases of human trafficking are surfacing in the surrounding countries, according to the International Organization for Migration., Madam President,, This war is devastating Ukraine now, but it also threatens its future. Early assessment projections by UNDP suggest that if the war continues through 2022, Ukraine faces the prospect of seeing 18 years of socio-economic progress lost., This would set the country – and the region – back decades and leave deep long-term social and economic fissures., UN agencies, including UNDP, are working to help preserve Ukraine’s hard-won development gains. This involves supporting the Government to sustain essential governance structures and basic services, including emergency measures to sustain livelihoods, such as cash-based assistance., Madam President,, The war in Ukraine has damaged Europe’s security architecture. Its economic repercussions are already evident far from the battlefield. The longer the war continues, the greater the risk that it will further weaken the global institutions and mechanisms dedicated to preserve peace and security., The war was started by choice. There is no inevitability to it or to the suffering it is causing. The United Nations is ready to do everything within its means to help bring an end to it., Thank you, Madam President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dicarlo-ukraine-war-threatens-global-peace-institutions-security-council-briefing

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",5 Apr 2022,"Madam President,, As you have just heard from the Secretary-General and USG DiCarlo, Ukrainian civilians are paying far too high a price for war., Let me speak briefly about humanitarian needs and what we are doing to meet them, before I refer to my recent travels., In the last six weeks, as we have heard, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children. We know this is very likely a serious underestimate., Homes and civilian infrastructure – bridges, hospitals and schools – have been damaged and destroyed., Current figures on displacement tell us more than 11.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, of whom more than 4.2 million are now refugees in generous neighbouring countries that Rosemary has just been referring to., In total, more than a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled in this extraordinarily short time., And, unfortunately, these figures will continue to rise until we can find a pause, and some peace., Madam President,, The ground and air offensives and counteroffensives are making life nearly impossible for many civilians in Ukraine. Families, the elderly, women and children have been trapped by fighting already for too long., For more than five weeks, the people of Mariupol have been caught up in the fighting. It is well documented that Mariupol is a centre of hell. Other cities like Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv remain cut-off from essential goods and services., The perilous conditions are hampering our efforts to access civilians - or for them to access us., We restate here that civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks and to locations of their own choice and selection., It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and to allow impartial humanitarian organizations safe, rapid, unimpeded access to all civilians in need, wherever they are in Ukraine., Madam President,, As the world watches humanitarian needs soar in Ukraine, the United Nations and its partner organizations are making every effort to dramatically increase our support to affected civilians., The work of the 6,000 volunteers from the Ukraine Red Cross, as we have noted before in this chamber, together with the local Non-Governmental Organizations in eastern Ukraine, continue to work tirelessly at the front line of assistance to communities., The World Food Programme has reached more than 1.3 million people with cash and food assistance and plans to reach around 2.5 million people in this month., Health partners report that more than 180 tons of medical supplies were delivered in Ukraine, with another 470 tons on the way. This will address the health needs of around six million people in the months ahead., And I am pleased to say that, after much effort, in the past day another convoy was dispatched from our humanitarian coordination hub in Dnipro to Severodonetsk - in the far east., Today, food, winter clothing, non-food items, medicine and hygiene kits were offloaded to the Ukraine Red Cross and will reach the hands of those in most need ., Indeed, following notification to both parties, as part of the notification system that we and the International Red Cross are involved in, four convoys in total have provided critical support to people in some of the cities encircled by war and experiencing ongoing fighting., While these are initial steps, it gives us a basis to now expand to scale, to provide much more than one convoy a day., Madam President,, Let me also emphasize to this Council how concerned I am over the growing number of reports we receive of human trafficking, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and in the region. As ever, such horrific incidents as we are seeing there overwhelmingly impact displaced women and children more than others., We are bolstering protection and gender-based violence services through agencies and through the wealth of civil society organizations in Ukraine, to provide specialized care for survivors. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society, including very particularly, local women organizations., Madam President,, Today, I address you from Geneva, having just returned from Moscow overnight., As you know, the Secretary-General as he said, charged me to bring both sides together, on humanitarian grounds, to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce humanitarian suffering, including in particular the pursuit of pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire., Yesterday, in Moscow, I had long and frank exchanges with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergei Vershinin, and then separately with the Deputy Minister of Defence, Alexandre Fomin., In my meetings with these senior officials I also discussed humanitarian convoys of safe passage, including the four which have already been able to move. I outlined possibilities for building further on that cooperation, sharing specific suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid. In effect, for humanitarian pauses in different parts of Ukraine to save lives and bring back a modicum of safety for people living in those places., My counterparts received these suggestions and assured me of their intent to carefully study these ideas which I left with them. We agreed to remain in close contact., I came away from these meetings believing that we have a very long road ahead of us, but it must be travelled, and we will travel it., Tomorrow, I plan to travel to Ukraine to have discussions with senior authorities from the Ukrainian Government in Kyiv on Thursday on these same issues, and others that they will present to me and also to see first-hand with our Crisis Coordinator, Amin Awad, on the humanitarian response., Madam President,, Thanks to generous donor contributions, many from governments in this chamber, the humanitarian response since February has been scaled up allowing us to meet the needs of one and half million people. We will need sustained financial support for needs in Ukraine., And like the Secretary-General, I also want to stress as he has done consistently, that funding must not be diverted from other crises., Madam President,, As you heard from David Beasley last week, conflict, climate shocks, COVID, compounded by the soaring food and fuel costs could push another 47 million people globally into severe food insecurity., The total number of people around the world who will not know where their next meal comes, could be driven to the astonishing figure of 325 million people around the world. That is by a long distance the highest in our recent history, well over double what it was less than three years ago., Madam President,, I close by reminding the Council of what it already knows well: the world cannot afford this war. And neither can the people of Ukraine., Like others, I call on all Council Members, and all Member States with influence, to support all efforts from whatever part they come from, in the pursuit of peace and the alleviation of humanitarian suffering., For the sake of the people of Ukraine, and the sake of those around the world who cannot afford to bear the additional burden this war imposes on them. And all of us we must as the Secretary-General says, silence the guns., Thank you Madam President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-2

Mass Killings of Civilians in Ukraine Must Be Investigated as War Crimes,News and Press Release,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,5 Apr 2022,"The Hague, April 5, 2022 -- Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) calls for the killings of civilians and the atrocities committed in towns near Kyiv, including Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel, to be investigated as potential war crimes. CIVIC urges the international community to break the cycle of impunity and hold perpetrators accountable for their crimes in Ukraine., Images showing dead civilians with their hands tied behind their back and corpses strewn about the streets in Bucha suggest that multiple executions have taken place., New satellite imagery of mass graves in Bucha, dug as early as March 10, seem to confirm CIVIC's initial analysis. According to our initial findings, two weeks into the invasion, Russian Armed Forces had shifted their attacks to deliberately target civilians and civilian infrastructure in an effort to break resistance and instill terror., Numerous accounts of rapes in Russia-controlled areas have also been recorded. CIVIC asks for all acts of sexual violence and abuses to be investigated and their perpetrators to be held accountable., ""The perpetrators of these crimes must be held accountable, and each civilian's killing must be answered for,"" said Federico Borello, CIVIC's Executive Director. ""How many more times we will say 'never again', only to see such hideous crimes being committed again? Impunity must be eradicated if we want to prevent the next Bucha."", CIVIC reminds all parties to the conflict to abide by their international obligations. International humanitarian law prohibits, among other things, intentional killing, rape and all forms of sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of civilians., ""Those ordering or overseeing the slaughter of civilians cannot hide behind their soldiers. One doesn't need to carry a gun and pull the trigger to be found guilty of war crimes,"" warns Borello. ""Similarly, those who carry out killings cannot hide behind orders they received.

اقرأ البيان الصحفي باللغة العربية, Geneva, New York – The President of the Convention that bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines which has been adopted and is observed by over 80% of the world’s countries, is calling for an immediate cease of the use of these weapons in Ukraine, State which signed this Treaty in 1999., “The use of landmines violates key principles of international humanitarian law and further exacerbates the heavy toll being brought upon the civilian population of Ukraine. They impede access to humanitarian corridors, and prevent delivery of essential humanitarian emergency aid,” said the Ambassador of Colombia to the UN in Geneva, H.E. Alicia Arango Olmos who presides over the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, also known as the Ottawa Convention or Mine Ban Treaty., The condemnation follows a report published by Human Rights Watch pointing to the use of a fairly new type of air-deployed anti-personnel mine in Ukraine, and other reports surfacing on traditional and social media, indicating that anti-personnel mines, both, factory made and of an improvised nature are being used in Ukraine. The comments were made during a press briefing at the United Nations., “We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation; it should be clear that the use of landmines by any party in conflict is prohibited under international humanitarian law. All of Ukraine’s neighbors, except for Russia are part of the Convention. The absolute majority of States that have not yet joined have refrained from using such insidious weapons. It is hence undeniable the detrimental, aggravating scourge that these mines represent.”, Ukraine first experienced landmine contamination as a result of the conflict that began in 2014. As State Party to the Convention, Ukraine undertook to fulfill obligations including clearing contaminated areas under its jurisdiction or control, providing education on the risk of mines and other explosive remnants of war (ERW), and assisting mine victims. According to data from the 2021 Landmine Monitor as provided by Ukraine, there were over 2,700 mine and other ERW casualties between 2014 and 2019, bringing the total number of casualties to more than 4,700. The current conflict may only increase those figures, which already are some of the highest in Europe., “Starting on 4 April, the international community will commemorate a week for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. Let’s take this opportunity to highlight the effect of anti-personnel mines on civilian populations in Ukraine and in protracted conflicts like Afghanistan, Colombia, and Iraq… or places like Angola, Cambodia, Chad, or Zimbabwe, where mines lay dormant decades after conflict have ceased, killing and maiming civilians including children. We must stand firm in the Convention’s legally binding premise to ‘never, under any circumstance, use anti-personnel mines, develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer to anyone, directly or indirectly, anti-personnel mines’”, concluded the Ambassador., Editorial note: The Convention was adopted and signed 25 years ago and entered into force in 1999. It is the prime humanitarian and disarmament treaty aimed at ending the suffering caused by landmines by prohibiting their use, stockpiling, production, and transfer, ensuring their destruction, and assisting the victims. Together the States Parties have destroyed nearly 54 million mines. Demining has resulted in millions of square metres of land that were once dangerous to be released for normal human activity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/president-convention-bans-landmines-calls-immediate-cease-use-insidious-weapon

Water Sanitation Hygiene",5 Apr 2022,"5 April 2022 - In its third tranche of humanitarian aid to support Ukrainian refugees, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) has committed another S$1.12 million in medical and first aid kits, medical equipment and medicines for rare diseases, hygiene and essentials. Meanwhile, SRC has deployed a two-person team on a mission to Ukraine's neighbouring countries that are hosting the majority of the refugees, including Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Slovakia, to oversee the humanitarian response and aid distribution contributed by the People of Singapore to SRC's humanitarian response to Ukraine, and to explore opportunities to expand our operations. The team arrived in Hungary yesterday, and will be working closely with humanitarian partners on the ground to support the fast-growing refugee crisis., Following the devastation of the Ukrainian communities, the need for humanitarian support within Ukraine has increased tremendously, and the Ukrainian Red Cross has scaled up its response under very challenging circumstances. SRC has therefore committed another tranche of USD 100,000 to the Ukrainian Red Cross, to support its response to the affected communities, including the distribution of medicines, first aid kits, food, hygiene products etc., “The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is catastrophic and continues to grow. Our latest tranche of aid reflects our utmost priority, which is to help the most vulnerable persons, including children and youth, women with infants and young children, the elderly, patients with rare diseases and persons with disabilities. Besides supporting the provision of immediate relief aid, we will continue to focus on addressing basic needs, emergency shelter, protection, health, water, sanitation, hygiene, and psychosocial support,” said Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General / CEO of the Singapore Red Cross., The SRC is also in close contact with the Ukrainian Club in Singapore, Ukrainians living in Singapore, as well as Singaporeans living in and around Ukraine, to facilitate SRC's work on-the-ground. The Singapore Red Cross and Ukrainian Club is working in collaboration to deliver up to 3,000 medical kits to Ukrainian cities from the borders in Poland., “The Ukrainian Club is glad to be able to work with the Singapore Red Cross to deliver humanitarian assistance to those in need in Ukraine and the neighbouring countries. This project to deliver medical kits is timely given the huge number of injured civilians requiring urgent medical attention. We hope to continue to collaborate with SRC to facilitate these critical humanitarian response efforts,” said Dr Galyna Kogut, President of the Ukrainian Club Singapore., The latest disbursement follows SRC’s first tranche of aid worth US$100,000, which arrived in Ukraine on 4 March, and was distributed by the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as part of their ongoing response; and its second, worth S$2.4 million on 10 March, to assist Ukrainians in-country and across six neighbouring countries - Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia, Moldova and Romania. This brings the total disbursement to S$3.66 million. (Details in Annex)., At least 80 individuals and groups have stepped forward to fundraise for, and support the SRC’s public fundraising appeal, in aid of affected communities in and around Ukraine. To date, more than S$6 million has been raised, within five weeks from the start of the appeal on 25 February., The Red Cross Movement continues to play an important and active role in and around Ukraine. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society has provided assistance to over 400,000 people in March, and continues to run its operations in-country to assist the vulnerable. The Red Cross is supporting three logistics pipelines into Ukraine at Lviv, Uzhhorod, and Chernivtsi and providing emergency surge support in technical areas. Medical supplies, food and relief items are continually deployed into the country across various locations, to respond to skyrocketing humanitarian needs. The Red Cross presence and humanitarian work in crisis situations are targeted at assisting and protecting civilians, medics, aid workers, casualties, and prisoners of war, regardless of race, language, religion, nationality and warring factions. Neutral and impartial humanitarian action must be respected., The Singapore Red Cross has also activated its “Restoring Family Links” (RFL) service to assist Singapore residents to locate their immediate family members who may have been affected by the disasters with whom they have difficulty in contacting.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-crisis-singapore-red-cross-sends-3rd-tranche-aid-2-person-team

The number displaced by the conflict could reach 10 million according to some estimates., SITUATION OVERVIEW, In the past few days, Russian forces appeared to disengage from Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and surrounding areas. The withdrawal has allowed for a clearer picture of the devastation wreaked since the incursion began on February 24., Analysts warn Russia’s tactical shift is not necessarily the beginning of de-escalation, particularly as there has been little progress in peace talks. Instead, it is likely Russian forces are regrouping in response to recent stalls and loses with an intention to either return to Kyiv or concentrate their efforts in other parts of the country., Newly released video of the town of Bucha, located north of Kyiv, showed the bodies of at least nine civilians, including one child, lying in the street shortly after Russia forces withdrew from the area. Bucha’s mayor told news outlets that some 270 residents were later found buried in two graves. He estimates 40 bodies have been left in the streets. Evidence is growing that residents were fired upon “purposely and indiscriminately” as Russian troops exited the town., Devastating reports from Bucha and other parts of the country from which Russian forces have withdrawn have invigorated international demands for an investigation into Russian human rights violations., To date, there have been credible reports of indiscriminate shelling in civilian areas, use of internationally banned weaponry, and forced transportation of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops. On April 3, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the Russian assault on his country as a genocide. Russia has dismissed such allegations as “provocation”., As Russian forces withdraw from the north, fighting is expected to escalate in Ukraine’s east and south—which have been heavily targeted since the early days of the invasion., This week, a humanitarian effort to evacuate citizens of Mariupol was denied by intense fighting in the area. The International Red Cross has also said one if its evacuation teams, charged with helping civilians flee areas that are either besieged or regularly under attack, is being detained outside Mariupol. It is not clear who has detained them.Russian forces have surrounded the southeastern port city for over a month, cutting off supplies of food and other essentials and trapping 130,000 civilians., Nearby, in Odessa, Russian forces struck an oil refinery and nearby fuel storage facilities on Sunday. The city’s council said Odessa was attacked from the air, causing fires in several areas., The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) has been tracking casualties of the Ukrainian crisis. As of April 3, OHCHR recorded 1,430 civilian deaths and 2,097 injuries—though the agency cautions actual numbers are likely much higher. Explosive ordnances were the most common cause of reported casualties., The conflict has devasted Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure—hospitals, schools, residential areas, and utility works have been damaged or destroyed by aerial attacks.
In addition, disruption of supply chains and heavy fighting has limited civilians’ ability to flee as well as distribution of goods, including food and medication., Massive displacement, moreover, has exacerbated risks faced by already vulnerable populations. Displacement to date has largely impacted women, increasingly their exposure to gender-based violence and human trafficking. Children, older people, and other at-risk populations have also been disproportionately impacted. These groups have significant MHPSS and protection needs that are only likely to increase in the coming months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-12-5-april-2022

They are working directly with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health on the ground to supply vital medical kit. The money will be spent on baby incubators, oxygen concentrators and more than 3,000 thermal blankets., The money is all thanks to the overwhelming generosity of the British public who have donated more than £200m to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal., Michael Mosselmans, Head of Humanitarian at Christian Aid, said:, “We are determined to respond as quickly as we can to make sure the money so generously donated by the British people is put to immediate use. Our existing relationship with Crown Agents, who are inside Ukraine, means we can achieve that.”, Fergus Drake, Crown Agents’ CEO, said:, “As the conflict exacerbates the humanitarian crisis by the day, a continuous supply of vital medical items going to those still in Ukraine is essential. Doctors have begun to see a steep rise in premature babies since the beginning of the conflict. Those babies need special medical attention, and so do the countless adult patients suffering from injuries and trauma because of the atrocities.”, Crown Agents has been working with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health for more than five years and in the country for 25 years.

As growing numbers of people are registered at a faster pace, these figures are expected to increase quickly., • Human Rights Watch (HRW) has documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north), Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, an appeal echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine Osnat Lubrani., • In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll (1,430) of the ongoing military offensive has already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined (1,320 civilians killed in 2015-2021)., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. The situation in the hard-hit eastern, northern and southern areas of Ukraine is becoming increasingly dire. Unmet needs continue to accumulate as access to food, water, medicines and other basic necessities remains severely restricted. Ongoing clashes prevent people trapped in partially or fully encircled cities from safely evacuating while simultaneously blocking much-needed aid from reaching those most in need. Some of the worst-affected areas include Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson (Khersonska oblast, south), areas surrounding Kyiv, Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), Okhtyrka (Sumska oblast, north-east), Izium (Kharkivska oblast), Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast, east), Trostianets (Sumska oblast), Volnovakha (Donetska oblast) and Sumy (Sumska oblast), as well as settlements in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts located close to the areas of active fighting.
As of 3 April, the civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive stands at 3,527 – including 1,430 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,198 casualties – including 405 killed and 793 injured – compared to 320 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 253 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 2,009 civilian casualties., In less than six weeks, the civilian death toll of the ongoing military offensive already surpassed the total number of civilian deaths from the last seven years (2015-2021) of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine combined, when around 1,320 civilians were killed. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely much higher and will continue to rise as fighting intensifies in the eastern and southern parts of the country., Damages and losses. The Ministry of Economy says that Ukraine’s economy shrunk by 16 per cent between January and April this year, projecting a 40 per cent decline by the end of 2022 – double of the recent projection issued by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal says that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion. As of 3 April, Ukravtodor – the state-owned road construction company – estimates that around 23,000 km of roads have been damaged or destroyed, causing approximately UAH874 billion ($29.73 billion) in damage, while more than 270 road infrastructures, like bridges and overpasses, have been destroyed., Laws-of-war violations. Between 27 February and 14 March, HRW documented several cases of apparent laws-of-war violations against civilians in Chernihiv, Kharkiv and areas on the outskirts of the capital, including Bucha, Vorzel and Zabuchchia. These violations include a case of repeated rape in Kharkiv, summary executions, and unlawful violence and threats against civilians. There are also reports of looting of civilian property, including food, clothing and firewood, by the Russian Federation forces in different parts of the country. HRW says that all parties in Ukraine must abide by international law, including the Geneva Conventions, international law of occupation and international human rights law, adding that those who have committed these abuses are responsible for war crimes., In Bucha, a small town around 30 km northwest of Kyiv, the bodies of at least 20 civilian men were found on a single street following the withdrawal of the Russian Federation forces. According to Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk, more than 300 civilianswere killed – 280 are reportedly buried in mass graves – some of whom received inhumane treatment reportedly at the hands of the Russian Federation forces. UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his shock at the gruesome images coming out of Bucha, calling for an independent investigation to bring about effective accountability, a sentiment echoed by the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine and many world leaders., Northern Ukraine and capital area. Despite claims that the military offensive on Kyiv and surrounding areas is being scaled back, on 3 April, missile strikes hit Vasylkiv – a small town of 36,000 people about 32 km outside Kyiv – leaving several civilians injured. As the Russian Federation forces reportedly retreat from some of the hardest-hit areas in and around the capital, the extent of destruction and civilian casualties is becoming more apparent., According to Kyiv City Council, more than 150 residential buildings and over 70 schools have been damaged since 24 February in the capital. Still, the gravest humanitarian consequences of the ongoing military offensive are seen in towns outside Kyiv, like Bucha, Irpin and Motyzhyn, where local authorities say civilians have been purposely killed, some reportedly shot in the back of the head with their hands tied behind their backs. According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, as of 3 April, at least 410 bodies have been discovered in towns near Kyiv., In Irpin – around 25 km northwest of the capital – weeks of intense clashes have left people in desperate need of safe water, food, generators, and plastic sheets and tarpaulins to help insulate and conduct partial repairs of damaged homes., Just 3,500 of Irpin’s 60,000 pre-escalation population remains in the ravaged town, with only the most vulnerable, including older persons and people with disabilities, still there. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reports that Irpin is only accessible by land cruiser as the streets remain littered with unexploded ordnance. On 2 April, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said that more than 640 explosive devices were deactivated in Irpin, adding that the extent of unexploded ordnance contamination will prevent people from returning to what remains of their homes and communities for at least a month as authorities clear out large quantities of explosive devices., In neighbouring Chernihivska oblast, the oblast capital Chernihiv – currently home to only 130,000 people after half the preescalation population fled amid escalating tensions – authorities report that there is no centralized heating and limited electricity and gas supply in the city. URCS reports that residents in Chernihiv have been without water for more than three weeks after the city’s centralized water supply was destroyed by shelling, generating acute water needs as water supplies are running out. On 3 April, the mayor of Chernihiv Vladyslav Atroshenko said that approximately 70 per cent of the city was destroyed following weeks of relentless attacks. As the humanitarian situation worsens, the city remains cut off from areas controlled by Ukraine since the main bridge over the Desna River, leading out of the city south toward Kyiv, was destroyed on 23 March, making it difficult for much-needed aid to reach those most in need., Eastern Ukraine continues to bear the brunt of the ongoing military offensive. Fears are growing that already-violent clashes and intense shelling will only worsen as the Russian Federation forces double down on taking control of the Donbas region following a series of setbacks in their attempts to encircle Kyiv., On 2 April, active hostilities in Lozova (Kharkivska oblast) reportedly killed at least four people and damaged homes and other critical infrastructure, leaving more than 60,000 residents cut off from the water supply and another 40,000 without electricity. That same day, the Governor of Kharkivska oblast reported that a hospital in Balakliia – a small town in the Izium district (raion) – was partially destroyed.
On 3 April, intense shelling in the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv – the country’s second-largest city – left at least seven people dead and nearly three dozen injured, including three children, according to the oblast prosecutor’s office. Additionally, at least 10 homes and a trolley bus depot were damaged. Local authorities report that other areas on the outskirts of Kharkiv were also shelled on 4 April, including Derhachi, Pyatykhatky and Saltivka. In Derhachi, on 3 April, three civilians were killed and seven others injured after a residential neighbourhood was shelled., In Izium, the setting of the most intense clashes across Kharkivska oblast, Deputy Mayor Volodymyr Matsokin says that 80 per cent of residential buildings have been destroyed. The city and surrounding suburbs, like Kamianka, Sukha and Topalske, remain completely cut off. Around 15,000-20,000 people are still trapped in Izium, where they lack electricity, heat and safe water, and require immediate humanitarian assistance and safe evacuation corridors. Meanwhile, in Luhanska oblast, hostilities are intensifying in Popasna, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk (Luhanska oblast). On 3 April, two volunteers were reportedly killed while attempting to deliver aid to affected people in Novodruzhesk (Luhanska oblast)., On 3 April, signs of an impending escalation pushed the head of the Donetska Oblast State Administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, to call on residents to leave the oblast, adding that authorities will facilitate evacuations, although active hostilities in several locations may hinder the safe movement of people. In recent days, towns across the oblast have come under constant attack, including Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka, Mariinka, Svitlodarsk and Vuhledar, while the humanitarian situation in Mariupol and Volnovakha remains acute., Southern Ukraine. Attacks across the country’s southern oblasts, including Khersonska, Mykolaivska and Odeska, are becoming increasingly more frequent and devastating. Several missiles struck Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast) and Odesa (Odeska oblast) during the reporting period, hitting residential areas and civilian infrastructure. On 1 April, multiple missiles hit the Odeskyi district (raion) from the direction of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, leaving at least two dead and another 15 wounded., In Mykolaiv, airstrikes on 3 April left one person dead and more than a dozen injured. As of 4 April, the civilian death toll from the 29 March attack on the Mykolaiv Oblast State Administration building has risen to 36 as search-and-rescue crews continue to comb through the rubble in search of survivors. Attacks in Mykolaiv also damaged a children’s hospital, an orphanage and an oncology centre; and at least 14 people were injured. In neighbouring Ochakiv – a port town with some 15,000 inhabitants – at least seven people were killed and nearly 20 injured by missile strikes on 3 April., Civilian evacuations. Between 1 and 3 April, the Government of Ukraine says that nearly 13,180 people were evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, including just over 2,000 people from Mariupol, nearly 1,170 from southeastern Zaporizka oblast (Berdiansk, Melitopol, Polohu, Orikhiv and Vasylivka) and more than 5,850 from Luhanska oblast (Kreminna, Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk)., At the time of writing, evacuation processes for residents of Mariupol are underway, according to Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, with 15 buses departing from Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast) en route to Mariupol and another seven from the ICRC heading from Manhush (Donetska oblast, NGCA). In Luhanska oblast, despite agreed-upon evacuation corridors out of Lysychansk, Nyzhne, Popasna and Rubizhne today, at the time of writing, continued shelling in the Hirska community (hromada), including airstrikes in Hirske, Popasna and Zolote, will likely prevent evacuations., Meanwhile, on 3 April, the Russian Federation reported that 16,648 people, including nearly 2,442 children, were evacuated from affected areas to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that 602,106 people, including more than 119,847 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine. In addition, the Russian Federation reports that 125,616 persons were evacuated from Mariupol to date, including 1,784 persons on 3 April.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-4-april-2022

This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Irpin (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.

We echo the call of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, for an immediate ceasefire and an independent investigation leading to effective accountability., These disturbing reports and videos clearly raise questions about grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. It is essential that all reports of violence against civilians are independently verified: the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine is trying to visit these locations without delay. Anyone who has been engaged in violence against civilians must be held to account under international human rights and humanitarian law. An independent investigation is critical to determine the extent of these crimes and to ensure that the perpetrators are held to account., The protection of civilians is a bedrock of the commitments by all Member States of the United Nations to people around the world. And in times of war there are further commitments, agreed by the international community under the Geneva Conventions. We will continue to closely monitor and report on attacks on schools, hospitals, medical workers and other civilian infrastructure, on the use of heavy weapons in residential areas and on the denial of humanitarian access., Ukrainians have been enduring the living hell of war for more than a month. Thousands of civilians have died and many more children, women, elderly and people with disabilities are trapped by constant shelling, mined roads, without food, water or safe exit from besieged cities. We call for humanitarian pauses, for civilians to safely leave and so that we and our humanitarian partners can bring them life-saving relief supplies., We continue to call for a ceasefire and peace in Ukraine. We know that words alone cannot comfort the loss of loved ones or replace action. This deadly war needs to stop: that is the only way to end this pointless loss of life and suffering., Lviv, Ukraine, Monday 4 April 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-un-resident-humanitarian-coordinator-osnat-lubrani-behalf-united-nations

Protection and Human Rights",31 Mar 2022,"The World Food Programme is scaling up rapidly to expand its emergency response, 31 March 2022, WFP Staff, “When we saw bombs in our square, the place where I live, where I was born, where I work, it was the minute where I understood what has happened,” says Nina, a university professor who fled Kharkiv for Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, as she struggles to hold back tears., Nina is among 7 million people left internally displaced following the start of the war in Ukraine. A further 4 million Ukrainians, mostly women, children and elderly people, have sought refuge in neighbouring countries., ”It’s happened – war in our country,” she says. “And it's difficult, really, for all our citizens … it’s really difficult when you see the damage. It’s difficult when you haven't money because lots of people haven't work, they haven't money to buy. Because we haven’t money, we can’t buy food.”, The World Food Programme (WFP) is scaling up to support millions of people like Nina. The agency aims to reach more than 3 million people inside Ukraine with food and cash distributions, as well as 300,000 refugees and asylum seekers who have left the country. Access is a critical challenge however., “It’s an extremely concerning situation of people that are either trapped or people that are on the move and people that are displaced,” says Margot van der Velden, WFP Director of Emergencies, speaking at a WFP-supported food distribution at a church in Dnipro., “We are providing and seeking access and we need unfettered and unconditional access to the people that are trapped in the towns…humanitarian access, to be able to provide food.”, WFP has pre-positioned close to 40,000 tons of bulk food, wheat flour and food rations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries for distribution in the coming days., Despite the volatile security situation, WFP has provided food to vulnerable families in the encircled cities of Kharkiv and Sumy, through two interagency humanitarian convoys that have reached the conflict-hit areas., At the same time, it has distributed over 330,000 loaves of freshly baked bread to families in Kharkiv and is expanding the bakery initiative to other cities, aiming to deliver another 990,000 loaves in the coming weeks., WFP worked rapidly to set up its operation in Ukraine, having not been based in the country since April 2018., “Just one month ago, we had no presence on the ground, no staff, no network of suppliers or partners. To build an operation from the ground up and get food to one million people seemed a monumental challenge,” said Jakob Kern, WFP’s Emergency Coordinator for Ukraine. “Now that the structures are in place, we need the funding to keep delivering assistance, and to help 3 million people in need.”, “The first challenge was the fact that we didn’t have any office presence for an emergency operation,” says Samir Wanmali, Deputy Director of WFP’s Programme and Policy Division., “We had to set up an office from scratch, then it was trying to find partners, partners who would be able to receive WFP food assistance and then distribute target the most vulnerable and distribute at a scale that we haven't seen here in the past as WFP.”, Among people the organization is assisting in Dnipro are 4,000 members of the Roma community, a group who have always been marginalized, says Wanmali., “People are stuck in the town. We have a lot of problems to get access to the people that are left in the towns, but also people that also had to flee the towns and are living in the rural areas around the embattled towns,” says van der Velden. “And then also people that are coming to Dnipro, for example, and that are hiding, having to stay here all want to move on.”, Despite the horrors of the past month, Nina retains hope of a better future: “I hope that this war will stop in a few, maybe weeks. And I want to say, we all need to be more caring for each other., “Stop war in our world, in our country, because it's difficult. Our parents, our children haven't houses and or when we will have ability to reconstruct it? It's the only question for today.”, Interviews by Viktor Pesenti.

Ukraine: More than 20 schools attacked on average every day since escalation of war,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",4 Apr 2022,"KYIV, 4 April 2022 - An average of 22 schools a day have come under attack in Ukraine since the start of the war five weeks ago, with military operations disrupting the education of 5.5 million children remaining in the country, Save the Children said today., At least 869 education facilities – or about 6% of all schools in the country - have been damaged with 83 completely destroyed, according to the Ukraine Ministry of Education and Science., About 43% of attacks on schools have taken place in eastern Ukraine, where more than 400,000 children were living before the conflict escalated on 24 February. Shelling and bombing have destroyed 50 educational buildings in the besieged city of Kharkiv alone., So far, more than two million children have fled the war in Ukraine while an estimated 5.5 million remain inside the country, in grave risk of physical and emotional harm as bombs and shelling continue to destroy complete neighbourhoods., The conflict has exacerbated an already challenging education context in Ukraine. Before the escalation of the crisis, 30% of education facilities in eastern Ukraine reported not having enough teachers. As thousands continue to flee their homes every day, there is an increased shortage of teachers and other educational personnel inside Ukraine. Most teachers in the country are female which is increasing shortages as the majority of people fleeing the conflict are women and children., Pete Walsh, Save the Children Country Director in Ukraine, said:, *“**Education is under attack in Ukraine.*All students and teachers must be protected from the horrors of this war., “Schools should be safe places of learning for children and must be free from attacks at all times. Learning cannot and should not be put aside in times of crisis; it is crucial to children’s protection, survival and their future. Access to safe education provides children with stability and structure throughout an emergency., “This conflict has been ongoing for eight years in parts of the country, which has harmed children's education, and led to hundreds of schools being damaged or destroyed. This war is spiralling out of control. It is unbearable to see schools and nurseries attacked indiscriminately.”, Attacks on schools and other education facilities are classified as a grave violation committed against children and can constitute a war crime. Schools in eastern Ukraine have been under fire since the conflict began in 2014, with more than 750 schools destroyed, damaged, or forced to close before the recent escalation of violence., All children have the right to a safe education under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)., While fighting is ongoing, there are international legal obligations to take all necessary precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects, including schools and hospitals, which are protected under International Humanitarian Law. Parties must uphold and protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education staff - and refrain from military-related use of educational facilities. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas should also be avoided as it risks severe harm to civilians, in particular children. To date, these are the main causes for civilian harm., Save the Children has been operating in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Throughout the eight-year conflict, we have been delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families, including distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses. Our specialist support children in having access to safe, inclusive, quality education and are working with schools and community centres to help children overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their resilience and ability to cope with stresses in their daily lives., ENDS, Notes to editors:, You can donate to Save the Children’s Children Emergency Fund, which supports children affected by crises, such as the Ukraine conflict, here., For further enquiries please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-more-20-schools-attacked-average-every-day-escalation-war

"Migrants, Asylum Seekers Locked Up in Ukraine",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,4 Apr 2022,"Free Detainees; Allow Them to Seek Refuge, (Berlin) – Scores of migrants who had been arbitrarily detained in Ukraine remain locked up there and are at heightened risk amid the hostilities, including military activity in the vicinity, Human Rights Watch said today. Ukrainian authorities should immediately release migrants and asylum seekers detained due to their migration status and allow them to reach safety in Poland., “Migrants and asylum seekers are currently locked up in the middle of a war zone and justifiably terrified,” said Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “There is no excuse, over a month into this conflict, for keeping civilians in immigration detention. They should be immediately released and allowed to seek refuge and safety like all other civilians.”, In early March 2022, Human Rights Watch interviewed four men by telephone who are being held in the Zhuravychi Migrant Accommodation Center in Volyn’ oblast. The detention site is a former military barracks in a pine forest, one hour from Lutsk, a city in northwestern Ukraine. All interviewees said that they had been detained in the months prior to the Russian invasion for irregularly trying to cross the border into Poland., The men asked that their nationalities not be disclosed for security reasons but said that people of up to 15 nationalities were being held there, including people from Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria., Zhuravychi and two other migrant detention facilities in Ukraine are supported with EU funding. The Global Detention Project has confirmed that the center in Chernihiv has now been emptied but the center in Mykolaiv is operating. Human Rights Watch has been unable to verify whether anyone is still detained there. The men said that at the time of the interviews more than 100 men and an unknown number of women were detained at the Zhuravychi MAC. Some have since been able to negotiate their release, in some cases with help from their embassies. Lighthouse Reports, which is also investigating the issue, has estimated that up to 45 people remain there. It has not been possible to verify this figure or determine whether this includes men and women., Three of the men said they were in Ukraine on student visas that had expired. All four had tried to cross the border into Poland but were intercepted by Polish border guard forces and handed directly to Ukrainian border guards. The men said they were sentenced to between 6 and 18 months for crossing the border irregularly after summary court proceedings for which they were not provided legal counsel or given the right to claim asylum., Whatever the original basis for their detention, their continued detention at the center is arbitrary and places them at risk of harm from the hostilities, Human Rights Watch said., While interviewees said that conditions in the Zhuravychi detention center were difficult prior to the conflict, the situation significantly deteriorated after February 24. In the days following the Russian invasion, they said, members of the Ukrainian military moved into the center. The detention center guards moved all migrant and asylum seekers into one of the two buildings in the complex, freeing the second building for Ukrainian soldiers., A video, verified and analyzed by Human Rights Watch, shows scores of Ukrainian soldiers standing in the courtyard of the Zhuravychi MAC, corroborating the accounts that the Ukrainian military is actively using the site. Another video, also verified by Human Rights Watch, shows a military vehicle slowly driving on the road outside the detention center. Recorded from the same location, a second video shows a group of approximately 30 men in camouflage uniforms walking on the same road and turning into the compound next door., On or around the date after the full-scale invasion, the people interviewed said a group of detainees gathered in the yard of the detention center near the gate to protest the conditions and asked to be allowed leave to go to the Polish border., The guards refused to open the gate and instead forcibly quelled the protest and beat the detainees with their batons, they said. Human Rights Watch analyzed a video that appears to show the aftermath of the protest: a group of men crowd around an unconscious man lying on the ground. People interviewed said that a guard had punched him. A group of guards are also visible in the video, in black uniforms standing near the gate., “We came out to peacefully protest,” one of those interviewed said. “We want to go. We are terrified.… We tried to walk towards the gate … and after we were marching towards the gate.… They beat us. It was terrible. Some of my friends were injured.”, Interviewees said that guards said they could leave Zhuravychi if they joined the Ukrainian war effort and added they would all immediately be granted Ukrainian citizenship and documentation. They said that no one accepted the offer., On March 18, five men and one woman were released when officials from their embassy intervened and facilitated their evacuation and safe travel to the border with Poland. Ukraine should release all migrants and asylum seekers detained at the Zhuravychi detention center and facilitate their safe travel to the Polish border, Human Rights Watch said., The European Union (EU) has long funded Ukraine’s border control and migration management programs and funded the International Center for Migration Policy Development to construct the perimeter security systems at Zhuravychi MAC. The core of the EU’s strategy has been to stop the flow of migrants and asylum seekers into the EU by shifting the burden and responsibility for migrants and refugees to countries neighboring the EU, in this case Ukraine. Now that Ukraine has become a war zone, the EU should do all it can to secure the release and safe passage of people detained in Ukraine because of their migration status. United Nations agencies and other international actors should support this call to release civilians at Zhuravychi and any other operational migrant detention centers and provide assistance where relevant., “There is so much suffering in Ukraine right now and so many civilians who still need to reach safety and refuge,” Hardman said. “Efforts to help people flee Ukraine should include foreigners locked up in immigration detention centers.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/migrants-asylum-seekers-locked-ukraine

Fuel shortages and the scarcity of available drivers and trucks has made transporting food around the country increasingly difficult, and major ports, railways and airports have also been impacted by fighting., The humanitarian situation in the city of Chernihiv is rapidly deteriorating, with relentless shelling leaving as many as 130,000 people without electricity, heating and gas. Drinking water is running low across the encircled city, prompting local authorities to impose restrictions on the distribution of drinking water to prevent shortages., A number of hospitals, health facilities and residential areas in Ukraine have also been targeted, and this will have devastating impacts on some of the most vulnerable communities. It is already having dire consequences for the elderly and those living with disabilities, many of whom are trapped in their homes, with limited access to essential health care., Caritas Ukraine and other Caritas agencies in neighbouring countries are continuing to provide urgent support to displaced people on the ground.

They were hoping to take a train to Lviv in western Ukraine, but it was impossible to get a seat., Desperate to leave the city, they decided to drive to the border, but they had left their car in front of their house - six metro stations away. It was dark, public transport was not running and there was a curfew imposed across the city. So, they had to walk along the tracks of the underground metro tunnel for hours until they reached their home., It took them six days to drive to the Polish border and they had to find a new place to sleep every night. After they crossed the border, volunteers from Caritas Poland helped Illyena access a sheltered room for mothers and children, where she can access the necessities she needs to care for Bagdan., Ilyena and her baby are now safe, but they had to say goodbye to Andrej, who had to stay behind as most Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 cannot leave the country., Caritas Ukraine and Caritas agencies in neighbouring countries are on the ground supporting displaced people with emergency food, water, shelter and hygiene support.

Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the conversion of hryvnia banknotes into the currency of host Member States for the benefit of persons fleeing the war in Ukraine,Manual and Guideline,EC,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2022,"EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM, • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal, In response to the start of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the European Council, in its conclusions issued the same day, condemned the Russian Federation’s (hereafter Russia) unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms, underlining the gross violation of international law and the principles of the UN Charter and the risk to European and global security and stability., The Union has shown and will continue to show its resolute support to Ukraine and its citizens, faced with an unprecedented act of aggression by Russia. This proposal forms part of the Union’s response to people fleeing as a result of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine., Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more than 4 million people have arrived in the Union in the space of just a few weeks. Both the scale and the speed of arrivals are unprecedented.
These numbers are expected to increase., Council implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 established the existence of a mass influx into the Union of displaced persons who have had to leave Ukraine as a consequence of an armed conflict, and introduced temporary protection for displaced persons from Ukraine., Displaced persons enjoying temporary protection or adequate protection under national law, in accordance with Directive 2001/55/EC2 and Council implementing Decision (EU) 2022/382 have urgent liquidity needs to cover essential expenses. Many of them have arrived with hryvnia banknotes, but face extreme difficulties in converting such notes into the currency of the host Member State. The National Bank of Ukraine has suspended the exchange of hryvnia banknotes into foreign cash in order to protect Ukraine’s limited foreign exchange reserves. The extreme uncertainty around what a future exchange rate between the host Member State currency and hryvnia may be de facto prevents credit institutions accepting the exchange of hryvnia banknotes even at a discount., Member States have made considerable efforts to put in place humanitarian assistance to those fleeing Ukraine. A number of Member States have looked to complement such efforts via initiatives to facilitate the exchange of hryvnia banknotes into host Member State currency in order to support displaced persons from Ukraine in meeting their needs, in particular as they travel across the Union., The objective of this proposal is to promote a coordinated approach for potential national schemes with a view to offering the displaced persons from Ukraine the same conditions for converting their hryvnia banknotes into local currency independently of the Member State that hosts them.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/proposal-council-recommendation-conversion-hryvnia-banknotes-currency-host-member

Update 42 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (4 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,4 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that “the morale and the emotional state” of staff working at the country’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) were “very low” a month after Russian military forces seized the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General has repeatedly expressed grave concern about the extremely stressful and challenging work conditions for personnel operating Ukraine’s nuclear facilities during the conflict, especially at the Zaporizhzhya NPP and the Chernobyl site, which Russian forces controlled for five weeks before their withdrawal last Thursday., This unprecedented NPP staffing situation has seriously compromised one of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security stating that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., “It is unacceptable and unsustainable that staff are working under circumstances that could severely affect their wellbeing and so have a negative impact on the safe and secure operation of these nuclear facilities,” Director General Grossi said. “As I said during my visit to the South Ukraine NPP last week, the staff there and at the other Ukrainian nuclear sites deserve our deep admiration and sincere gratitude for their resilience and determination in carrying out their important work duties.”, In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine informed the IAEA yesterday evening that an unexploded ordnance spotted late last month near a nuclear research facility on closer inspection turned out to be the body of a rocket without its explosive tip and therefore did not pose a danger. The facility still has no power because of previous damage to its electrical transformer, it said, adding shelling in the area made it difficult to restore electricity. The facility was used for research and development and radioisotope production for medical and industrial applications. Its nuclear material is subcritical and the radioactive inventory is low., At the Chornobyl NPP, preparations for the next staff rotation are continuing, including the assessment of security for personnel there, Ukraine said., Out of the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine said seven were operating, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, including both units at the Khmelnytskyy NPP, or held in reserve., In relation to safeguards, the IAEA said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-42-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-4-april-2022
MSF completes first medical train transfer of trauma patients in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,3 Apr 2022,"On the morning of Friday, April 1, nine people—including children—in serious but stable condition were transferred from a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, in southeastern Ukraine, to major referral hospitals in Lviv on a dedicated two-car medical train that Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) developed together with the Ukrainian Railways., The patients, all of whom were suffering from blast injuries, were accompanied by a team of nine MSF medical staff. This first train is just the beginning, with a larger and more highly medicalized referral train being developed by the MSF team., Here, Dr. Joanne Liu, an experienced pediatrician in MSF’s Ukraine medical response team, describes her part of the process, evaluating the patients and making sure they were all stable for the journey., On Tuesday, March 29, we went on a visit to Zaphorizhzhia and met the regional health director. We said we wanted to hear from him if there was anything he needed from us. He said he’d heard a story about a train for medical transfer, and he was very interested. He said he had patients who needed to be referred., We said, “OK—let’s go and see your patients.”, Most of the patients we saw had been wounded in, or while trying to escape from, Mariupol. One patient had big open fractures, and both legs on vacuum drainage. Fairly stable, but a very sick child., Of course, it makes sense to offload hospitals that are close to the front line to enable them to have more bed capacity. But we needed to make sure we’d be transferring the patients to somewhere where they will get the same level of care, if not a higher level of care. And we just wanted to make sure this would be safe for everybody., We talked with the parents to ask if they wanted medical evacuation or not. The first mother said, “I want my child to be medevacced because I think it is the only chance for my child to keep his legs.” And the child looked at us and said, “I want to walk again.”, By then it was the end of the day and we had to leave to be able to pass checkpoints. So we said we cannot promise anything, we’ll see what’s possible. And the hospital director and many of the interns were there and they were insistent: “You need to get them out of here. They need to survive. This is our hope”., The next day, we came back, three of us, and we screened every single patient. Our key point was to consider for each patient: Could this person sustain a 20-hour transfer where we don’t have an ICU [Intensive Care Unit] level of care on this first short version of the medical referral train?, And then, Thursday morning, we came back early to do another check on all the patients before doing the referral, to make 100 percent sure they were stable., There was one patient, a three-year-old child with very severe abdominal injuries, who we thought would not be stable enough for the transfer. At one stage, the mother said, “My child is going to die during the transfer.” I’ve been a practicing pediatrician for the past 30 years, and what I told everyone is that when a mother tells you that, she’s never wrong., We evaluated this child three times, together with the directors of the hospital. When we came on Thursday morning, the doctors were about to take the child back into the operating theater, and we all came to the same conclusion: This child was not stable enough for the transfer. This decision took time, but it was a decision we all took together., I particularly recall a woman who had a blast injury in her face and had lost her right eye. We had asked her to send us a picture on Tuesday, as we wanted to assess her condition and we had to leave that evening to get back before curfew. And instead of sending us a picture with the injury, she sent us a picture of herself before the injury. And when we got back to the hospital the next day, the first thing she told us was, “I want to be beautiful again. For my husband. For my child.”, These stories from these few patients—this is the story of many thousands of people., The other thing that is amazing is the dedication I saw. For example, when we did the transfer to the train on Thursday morning, the ICU physician—not the interns but the senior boss of the ICU—came and did the transfer himself. He paid great attention to the boy with the severe leg injuries. It was he who lifted the stretcher onto the train and waited there a while to check the patient was fine. And when he was finally satisfied, he looked at me and said, “I think my job is finished now. I hand over to you.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/msf-completes-first-medical-train-transfer-trauma-patients-ukraine
Ukraine: Apparent War Crimes in Russia-Controlled Areas,Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,3 Apr 2022,"Summary Executions, Other Grave Abuses by Russian Forces, (Warsaw) – Human Rights Watch has documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine. These include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022. Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing, and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes., “The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces’ custody should be investigated as war crimes.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 people, including witnesses, victims, and local residents of Russia-occupied territories, in person or by telephone. Some people asked to be identified only by their first names or by pseudonyms for their protection., On March 4, Russian forces in Bucha, about 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. A witness told Human Rights Watch that soldiers forced the five men to kneel on the side of the road, pulled their T-shirts over their heads, and shot one of the men in the back of the head. “He fell [over],” the witness said, “and the women [present at the scene] screamed.”, Russian forces in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in Chernihiv region, rounded up at least six men on February 27, and later executed them, according to the mother of one of the men, who was nearby when her son and another man were apprehended, and who saw the dead bodies of all six., A 60-year-old man told Human Rights Watch that on March 4, a Russian soldier threatened to summarily execute him and his son in Zabuchchya, a village northwest of Kyiv, after searching their home and finding a hunting rifle and gasoline in the backyard. Another soldier intervened to prevent the other soldier from killing them, the man said. His daughter corroborated his account in a separate interview., On March 6, Russian soldiers in the village of Vorzel, about 50 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering. A man who was with her in the same basement when she died from her wounds two days later, and heard accounts of the incident from others, provided the information to Human Rights Watch. The child died immediately, he said., A woman told Human Rights Watch that a Russian soldier had repeatedly raped her in a school in the Kharkiv region where she and her family had been sheltering on March 13. She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife. The next day the woman fled to Kharkiv, where she was able to get medical treatment and other services. Human Rights Watch reviewed two photographs, which the woman shared with Human Rights Watch, showing her facial injuries., Many of the Ukrainian civilians we interviewed described Russian forces taking food, firewood, clothing, and other items such as chainsaws, axes, and gasoline., All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation. International human rights law, which is applicable at all times, also applies., The laws of war prohibit willful killing, rape and other sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Pillage and looting are also prohibited. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., “Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers,” Williamson said. “Commanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.”, For detailed findings, please see below., Kharkiv Rape, On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha [not her real name], a 31-year-old woman in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region that Russian forces controlled at the time., Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother., At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: “He broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door.” A guard opened the door., The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement., The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor., “People started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three,” Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him., The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said: “He told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more ‘motivation.’” He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair., She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear. “While I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.”, The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things, so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. “I knew my daughter would cry if she saw me,” she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face., At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left., That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. “I am lucky to be alive,” she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal complaint, which they plan to file with Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office., Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them., Summary Killings, Other Violence, On February 27, Russian forces rounded up six men in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in the Chernihiv region, and summarily executed them. Tetiana, from Novyi Bykiv, which faces Staryi Bykiv, just across the Supiy River, spoke with the relatives of four of the men who were killed. She told Human Rights Watch that on February 27, the bridge between Novyi Bykiv and Staryi Bykiv was blown up, and Russian forces shelled both villages. A column of Russian armored vehicles then entered Staryi Bykiv., “Most people were hiding in their basements because of shelling, and soldiers went door to door,” Tetiana said the families from Staryi Bykiv told her. The soldiers took six men from their homes:, They took six men from three different families. One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son … to question him. They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them., Viktoria, Bohdan’s mother, interviewed separately, told Human Rights Watch that on February 27:, They took my son, Bohdan [age 29], and my brother-in-law, Sasha [full name Olexander, age 39]. We were in the basement [due to the shelling], so we didn’t see. They went out to smoke. Then our neighbor ran up and said he saw them taking Bohdan and Sasha away, and a few other guys., Viktoria ran to the street to ask Russian soldiers at the checkpoint what had happened. “They told us not to worry, that [soldiers] would scare them a bit and then let them go,” she said. “We walked away about 50 meters … and heard gunshots. It was about 6:20 p.m.”, Viktoria said that the next day she and her sister went to the meadow and saw the bodies lying by a building there:, Three were on one side of the building, but not my son and brother-in-law. We walked around to the other side and saw [Bohdan and Sasha, and one more]. They were laying there. There were gunshots to their heads. Their hands were tied behind their backs. I looked at my son’s body, his pockets were empty, he didn’t have his phone, or keys or [identity] documents., Viktoria asked soldiers at the checkpoint for permission to collect the bodies, but they refused. Heavy shelling continued the following days., On March 7, Viktoria said, they again asked the soldiers for permission to collect the bodies: “At the checkpoint they told us to go the cemetery, that they’d bring us the bodies.… Everyone [all the neighbors] came, like 75 people.... We buried all of them on the same day, in separate graves.”, Viktoria said that the other four men buried that day were Volodymyr, 40, another Olexander, 40, and two brothers, Ihor, 31, and Oleh, 33., Tetiana said the soldiers also took all of the villagers’ wood, leaving them nothing for cooking or heating their homes., On March 4, Russian forces summarily executed a man in Bucha, 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, and threatened to execute four others, said a teacher who witnessed the killing. She said she heard shooting at about 7 a.m. and saw three Russian armored vehicles and four Kamaz [Russian brand] trucks driving down her street. She was sheltering in the cellar with her two dogs when she heard glass breaking, and then her front door being broken down. Voices outside said [in Russian]: “Come outside right now or we will throw a grenade.”, She yelled that she was alone in the cellar and came out with her hands up., “There were three men outside, two [Russian] soldiers and a commander,” she said. “They took my phone and checked it, then told me to get my [identification] documents and come with them.” As she walked down the street with the soldiers, she saw that they were also rounding up her neighbors and ordering them to walk. She said:, They took us to where the office of AgroButpostach [a rental storage company] used to be. Right next to the building, there is a parking lot and a small square. They gathered people at that square, mostly women but there were also several men among us, over 50 [years old]. There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia…. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear., She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone’s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units:, Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long. Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood., She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather:, At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: “Don’t worry. You are all normal – and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.”, She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes. The other four men remained kneeling when she left., She said that when she was able to leave the town on March 9, the young man’s body was still lying where he had been shot., Dmytro, 40, told Human Rights Watch that he and his family fled the heavily shelled city of Bucha on March 7. He said that they did not know of any safe evacuation routes, so they walked – wrapped in white sheets and waving white sheets in the air – for about five kilometers to the village of Vorzel., Once in Vorzel, they sheltered for two nights in the basement of a two-story building, with a group of local residents. Dmytro said that there was a woman with them in the basement who had chest and leg wounds. Other people in the basement told him that she had been shot the day before, when Russian soldiers stormed that same basement and threw a smoke grenade inside. Several people panicked and ran outside, where Russian soldiers fired at them. The woman was wounded, and the people in the basement told him that a 14-year-old child was shot in the head and killed. Dmytro said that the woman died the next day, on March 8. He and several local residents buried her outside the bomb shelter., On March 4, Russian forces threatened to execute a man and his son in Zabuchchya, a village outside the city of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv. A village resident said that on March 4, Russian forces entered the village, where he was sheltering with 10 other people, including a family from Irpin, in the basement of his home. In a separate interview, his daughter corroborated his account. He said that 13 soldiers entered his house to search it:, The soldiers asked about my son, 34, who is in the territorial defense. He came out to meet them. They asked who was in the house and then they searched the house and turned it upside down.… In the backyard, they found my hunting rifle and a bottle of gasoline, and they went ballistic., The commander who gave orders to others said: “Take them [me and my son] to the tree outside and shoot them.” They took us outside. One of the soldiers objected. They took us back inside and ordered my son to strip naked because they said they wanted to look for nationalist tattoos. Other soldiers also went to houses on our street, including the house of a judge – she had gone and locked the house – and the local council deputy., They broke the window in the judge’s house to get in. We saw them taking bags and bags of stuff out of the judge’s house. After that, they left.… I took my family and everyone who was in the basement, and we fled in two cars. My wife and my son and mother, 80, are now staying at my daughter’s house in Khodosivka [southwest of Kyiv].",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-russia-controlled-areas

Update 40 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (2 April 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,2 Apr 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that it was ""analyzing the possibility"" of resuming regulatory control of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), after Russian forces withdrew from the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine also said it was preparing for the rotation of Chornobyl NPP staff, including making an assessment of their safety, but no date had yet been set for this. The most recent turnover of technical personnel at the site took place on 20-21 March, which in turn was the first change of work shift since late February., Ukraine told the IAEA on Thursday that Russian forces were leaving the Chornobyl NPP after controlling the site for five weeks. The withdrawal was confirmed by senior Russian officials at a meeting with Director General Grossi in the Russian city of Kaliningrad on Friday morning. Ukraine later told the IAEA that while all Russian forces had left the NPP site, the situation in the Exclusion Zone around the plant was unclear. Many NPP staff live in the city of Slavutych outside the 30-kilometre Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident., Russian forces entered the Chornobyl NPP, where radioactive waste management facilities are located, on 24 February. On 4 March, they also took control of one of Ukraine's four operating nuclear power plants, the Zaporizhzhya NPP in the country's south., Director General Grossi intends to head an IAEA assistance and support mission to Chornobyl as soon as it is possible, the first in a series of such nuclear safety and security missions he plans to send to the country, which has 15 operational nuclear energy reactors at four sites in addition to the Chornobyl plant. IAEA experts will provide both on-site and off-site technical assessment and advice. The IAEA will also deliver safety equipment, where needed., Out of the country's operational reactors, Ukraine said seven were operating, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, including both units at the Khmelnytskyy NPP., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-40-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-2-april-2022
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 1 April 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2022,"Date: 2 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 1 April 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 3,342 civilian casualties in the country: 1,325 killed and 2,017 injured. This included:, a total of 1,325 killed (268 men, 189 women, 20 girls, and 36 boys, as well as 64 children and 748 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 2,017 injured (235 men, 177 women, 39 girls, and 35 boys, as well as 94 children and 1,437 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,487 casualties (448 killed and 1,039 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 1,174 casualties (381 killed and 793 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 313 casualties (67 killed and 246 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,855 casualties (877 killed and 978 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region),
Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Irpin (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 2 April (local time), 158 children had been killed and 254 injured., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine,
HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact:, Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org or, Lori Brumat +41 22 928 91 49 / lori.brumat@un.org, Ravina Shamdasani + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org, Tag and share, Twitter @UNHumanRights, Facebook unitednationshumanrights, Instagram @unitednationshumanrights",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-1-april-2022-enruuk

There is a long line of abandoned cars in front of the bridge in Romanivka, the main route out of the city., On Friday (1 April 2022), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) managed to visit Irpin, which normally has a population of around 60,000 people, to help the thousands of people still trapped. They are the homeless, the elderly or those with limited mobility., ICRC's Alyona Synenko said: ""We think there might be 3,500 people and the priority is to see what the situation is like for them right now.”, The city's pastor, Michail, guided the ICRC team. “Water is a huge problem,"" he said. ""People are getting water from the wells, wherever they can still find it.” The ICRC will be supporting the Water Board to restore the water supply system to the entire city., Many are trying to survive in their damaged houses. They need water, food and generators to charge their phones., In its first visit to the city since the escalation, the ICRC delivered food, and hopes to return with more essential supplies on Monday and Tuesday (4 and 5 April). This will most likely include plastic sheets and tarpaulins for quick repairs to houses. However, it is only possible to enter the town in land cruisers. Trucks are too dangerous due to the many unexploded ordnance that litter the streets., The military hospital has been heavily damaged and is empty. The only medical professional left in the area is an ophthalmologist who is now treating war-wounded patients. The ICRC medical team in Irpin provided first aid to people and the team evacuated one homeless person in a critical condition., The man had spent many days without food and has advanced gangrene on both legs. It is not a war-related injury, but because of the conflict, he had not been able to reach a doctor.

National Societies have been responding from the start thanks to their permanent presence on the ground. National Societies personnel, Rapid Response Teams and volunteers have been deployed in all countries, and assessments are being carried out while essential services are being provided to the displaced populations. In the first month of the operation, National Societies are coordinating closely with authorities leveraging their auxiliary role, supporting strained systems and providing critical assistance to people on the move. Preparedness action has started before the crisis and response activities are ongoing since the first day, providing integrated, life-saving assistance to people on the move. National Societies provide essential relied assistance including food, household and hygiene items, Restoring Family Links (RFL) services, and coordinate shelter and accommodation needs. Community Engagement and Accountability strategies are being developed including the establishment of Call Centres. National Societies are being capacitated and are ready to start the distribution of multipurpose cash support to the most vulnerable people in multiple countries simultaneously. Protection, Gender, and Inclusion (PGI) capacities are increased and are coordinated, in line with the Fundamental Principles for the adherence to confidentiality, security guidelines, child protection, and obligations to protect the humanitarian space and our communities., IFRC, through the Emergency Appeal, aims at a preliminary basis to support the National Societies of Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, Belarus, and Russia with 100 million CHF in responding to the emergency and support the early recovery of 2 million people affected with the provision of Health & Care, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Shelter and Housing and Settlements, Multi-purpose Cash (Cash and Voucher Assistance – CVA), Livelihoods, Protection, Gender and Inclusion, Community Engagement and Accountability, and Migration and Displacement. These areas will be supported and enhanced by the following enabling approaches: Coordination and partnerships, IFRC Secretariat Services, and National Society Strengthening. Since the beginning of the emergency, the IFRC has been engaged in preparedness activities, contingency and scenario planning with National Societies before the crisis, which enabled it to mobilize with speed and at scale across eight countries directly impacted by this crisis, as well as in a growing number of secondary impacted countries in Europe and beyond., Given that the affected families are moving within countries to receive assistance from family and friends, assessments are challenging as they are constantly being updated. Solid and constant coordination within the Movement is being held to ensure linkages between all response activities (including bilateral activities and activities funded domestically) and assist in leveraging the capacities of all members of the Federation in the countries, avoiding overlapping of actions. This has manifested in the deployment of rapid response personnel from the pool of member National Societies and IFRC experts on an unprecedented scale, reaching 100 people deployed in less than a month (see infographic under Secretariat Services below). Country-level operational teams have been set up in Ukraine and all impacted countries around Ukraine to support National Societies’ efforts in assisting people with shelter, basic aid items and health services, psychosocial support, and preparing for cash programming. Network coordination efforts have started on day one to consolidate and share timely information, support National Societies in developing response strategies, and strengthen their technical capacities. IFRC teams have achieved a rapid scale-up of cash and voucher programming frameworks in multiple countries simultaneously., IFRC has deployed Movement Coordination support, and it is coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Partner National Societies of the Red Cross and Crescent Movement in this multi-country crisis. A Federation Movement-wide approach is being implemented, and data collection systems are being established to reflect on the joint efforts., The current situation in Ukraine is governed by the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, its First Additional Protocol from 1977 and customary international humanitarian law. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is assigned a broad range of humanitarian functions and responsibilities under the four Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I for the purpose of protecting and assisting people affected by the conflict, including bilateral and confidential dialogue with the Parties to the armed conflict and other relevant authorities. For clarity of roles and responsibilities amongst the International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement2) components, coordination mechanisms at country, regional and global levels have been activated to ensure a collective impact of the Movement., In addition to Movement coordination between IFRC, ICRC and National Societies, we also recognise the importance of framing our response within the broader humanitarian context. IFRC is engaged in external coordination mechanisms including the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC), Humanitarian Country Teams, the NGO Forum and its Working Group on Ukraine crisis. IFRC also has teams in Brussels engaging in EU-level discussions and for the first time has a staff embedded in the EU Civil Protection Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) for information exchange and coordination, and in New York engaging with UN Security Council and UN General Assembly actors and mechanisms.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-and-impacted-countries-emergency-appeal-n-mgr65002-operation-update-01042022
Battling to protect their patients: how health workers from 3 Ukrainian hospitals have adapted to working in wartime,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,1 Apr 2022,"“We have not lost hope, we do not give up, we support each other.”, The war in Ukraine has forced Ukrainian health workers to adopt new roles and ways of working and to draw on their ingenuity and dedication to protect and treat their patients., Infectious disease specialist Olha has returned from treating patients in COVID-19 disease hot spots to a health-care facility in central Ukraine., It was the plight of a young man caught in blast shockwaves that convinced her to give up her private practice and dedicate herself to those who need her the most. “He lay in the woods for about 3 days. After he was brought in, he didn’t speak for another 3, hiding in his hospital bed with a blanket over his head. We carried out an electrocardiogram, which showed the young man had had a heart attack. The cardiologists couldn’t believe the diagnosis, repeating ‘How is this possible? He is only 22 years old’”., When Olha advertised her services as an infectious disease specialist on social media, she started receiving up to 150 messages a day for diagnosis and treatment advice for a range of diseases. Some of those contacting her have already fled their homes and moved to central Ukraine, but others are still based in places badly affected by hostilities and cut off from health-care services. She helps them, in person and remotely, interviewing them on the phone and referring them on to other specialists where possible., “We have many displaced people coming to the hospital, who have fled from places such as Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. I am trying as hard as I can to help them, whatever their condition. The most common cases I see are young children. In bomb shelters, people breathe in fungal spores and if they have chronic illnesses these often get worse. Sometimes, they arrive with protracted illnesses, such as pneumonia, kidney infections and severe allergic reactions. I accept everyone.”, Lidiya is the chief operating officer of a Kyiv hospital. In peacetime, the hospital ran 18 external clinics, but since the hostilities began, all resources have been concentrated in the hospital. Although many staff based in heavily bombarded areas around Kyiv had to evacuate, a core workforce stayed., “Mostly we’re treating people who are sick with regular illnesses, strokes and heart attacks and those needing acute surgery. They are stabilized here, and then evacuated elsewhere for intensive care and further scheduled operations. Adults and children have also been taken abroad by volunteer organizations for rehabilitation in Italy.”, The switch to emergency work means that some hospitals no longer offer routine services, and those that do have seen a fall in demand., “People now try as much as possible to go to shelters immediately when the air raid siren goes off, so attending routine consultations is extremely rare, although we have had cases over the last 2 weeks of people coming to us with children for planned vaccinations, because they are worried about their future health.”, To provide continued medical services for those with chronic conditions or new acute symptoms, a website has been created through which patients can connect to a doctor for advice. A chat group, including many long-term patients who have since relocated to other parts of Ukraine has also been set up and currently has over 35 000 members., Despite the many challenges, staff and volunteers in the hospital are working together and providing moral support to one another. “The staff continue to hold the defence and to work on. Even some of the staff who left want to return and get back to work,” says Lidiya., Another hospital in Kyiv has been treating adults and children with cardiovascular diseases and despite the Russian military offensive, the whole team has stayed to continue to provide round the clock care. They have switched from conducting planned operations to providing 1 or 2 emergency operations a day., “All of us, as a team, have gone into emergency mode to be able to provide assistance when needed,” says Andriy, an anaesthetist/resuscitator. “Because movement in the city is difficult, we decided to be here when needed — we almost live here now. At the moment we have around 80% of the number of staff we used to have and are getting by thanks to the assistance of so many organizations and volunteers.”, WHO support to doctors in Ukraine, WHO is working closely with Ukraine’s Ministry of Health and authorities to identify gaps and needs in the country’s health system and is swiftly responding to them. WHO has opened an operations hub in Poland, developed a pipeline of trauma supplies to many Ukrainian cities, and sent more than 100 metric tonnes of medical equipment over the border, to health facilities across the country. To support beleaguered health workers in Ukraine, WHO is also working with partners to organize emergency medical teams and trauma management support.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/battling-protect-their-patients-how-health-workers-3-ukrainian-hospitals-have-adapted

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, On 31 March, the third UN-organized humanitarian convoy in the last two weeks delivered life-saving supplies for thousands of people in the hard-hit city of Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east)., Between 24 February and 31 March, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have reached more than 1.4 million people with life-saving multi-sectoral assistance, primarily in eastern Kharkivska (nearly 510,000), northern Kyivska (over 245,000) and western Lvivska (over 165,000) oblasts., The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and its partners have reached more than 77,360 people with food and non-food item (NFI) assistance and around 24,400 have received targeted protection assistance. UNHCR plans to scale up its response to quickly deliver some 550,000 NFI to displacement sites and provide protection assistance to 1.1 million people., The humanitarian situation in Chernihiv (Chernihivska oblast, north) is deteriorating. Acute water shortages remain the biggest concern in the city, while a lack of consistent power supply jeopardizes the continuity of critical services, like health care, putting a greater number of lives at risk., Attacks on local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and volunteers have been reported over the past few days, with convoys delivering aid to hard-hit areas being attacked in both Chernihiv and Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast) on 31 March. This raises concerns about continued access to the most affected areas and the safety and security of humanitarian personnel operating in these areas., In just over five weeks, the ongoing military offensive claimed the equivalent of more than 60 per cent of the lives lost due to conflict in 2014 – the fiercest year of fighting in eastern Ukraine – when more than 2,080 civilians were killed., On 30 March, Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin announced that approximately 300,000 km² of Ukrainian territory had been contaminated by explosive devices since 24 February – the data cannot be verified at the moment., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. As of 31 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 3,257 civilian casualties, including 1,276 killed. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts in the east, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,130 casualties – including 358 killed and 772 injured – compared to 313 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (67 killed and 246 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 1,814 civilian casualties. In just over five weeks, the ongoing military offensive has claimed the equivalent of more than 60 per cent of the lives lost in 2014 – the fiercest year of fighting in eastern Ukraine – when more than 2,080 civilians were killed., According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Ukraine’s economy is set to shrink by 20 per cent this year. EBRD estimates that active hostilities are playing out in parts of the country that generate around 60 per cent of Ukraine’s GDP, while around 30 per cent of businesses have halted production, and electricity consumption has fallen to some 60 per cent of levels prior to 24 February. The socioeconomic ramifications of ongoing fighting will have devastating impacts on livelihoods, driving up needs and pushing many people, especially women, into informal economic activities not typically covered by social protection programmes., Explosive devices and their risks. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet says investigators are looking into at least two dozen credible reports that the Russian Federation forces have used cluster munitions in densely populated areas of Ukraine, adding that indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure may amount to war crimes. According to Human Rights Watch, banned antipersonnel mines have been used in Kharkivska oblast. Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technicians discovered extremely dangerous POM-3 mines – a newly developed landmine equipped with a seismic sensor that detects approaching people and ejects an explosive charge that may cause serious injury and death for those within a 16-meter radius of the blast., Even before the recent escalation, landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) posed significant risks to lives, livelihoods and critical infrastructure in both NGCA and GCA in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, with an estimated contamination of 7,000 km² in GCA and 14,000 km² in NGCA, equivalent to the size of Slovenia. Pre-escalation mine and ERW contamination posed a threat to the lives of around 1.8 million, a figure that is thought to have grown considerably in the past weeks., Since 24 February, the scale of mine and ERW contamination has increased not only in traditional hotspots in eastern Ukraine but also in new areas that continue to be affected by ongoing fighting, putting a greater number of lives at risk and hindering access to livelihoods and basic services even when active hostilities subside. On 30 March, Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin announced that approximately 300,000 km² of Ukrainian territory had been contaminated by explosive devices since 24 February – the data cannot be verified at the moment. Mr. Yenin added that around 14 hectares have been cleared and some 300 explosive devices have been de-mined since 24 February., Gendered impacts of ongoing fighting. The ongoing military offensive continues to affect women in distinct ways, generating gender-specific needs and exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities of women. In Ukraine, large-scale displacement – both internally and across international borders - is largely gendered, significantly increasing risks of gender-based violence (GBV) and human trafficking. Millions of women are now on the move, many of them alone, potentially displaced multiple times in search of safety and security. At the same time that women face growing risks and needs, access to critical gender-responsive health and protection services continue to be interrupted, including survivor-centered GBV case management and mental health and psychosocial support services. In this context, UN agencies and humanitarian partners must ensure the collection and analysis of sex- and age-disaggregated data, meaningful participation of women and girls in decision-making processes and the roll-out of gender-responsive programming that is informed by gender analysis and needs assessments., Eastern Ukraine. In Kharkivska oblast, clashes continue to intensify with high humanitarian costs. According to the oblast Governor, on 31 March, 46 incidents of shelling and 170 shots from multiple launch rocket systems were registered in Kharkiv – the country’s second-largest city – compared with 47 incidents of shelling and 380 shots a day before. An underground gas pipeline was reportedly damaged in one of Kharkiv’s districts, cutting off gas supplies for some 34,000 people, with relentless fighting making it virtually impossible to carry out critical repair works., On 31 March, two staff from a local implementing partner suffered minor injuries after a shell exploded close to their vehicle while on the road in Kharkiv. That same day, another NGO’s car was damaged by shelling in a different part of the city while attempting to deliver humanitarian aid, raising serious concerns about continued access to the most affected areas and the safety and security of humanitarian personnel operating in these areas., Intense shelling in the town of Derhachi (Kharkivska oblast) killed one person and injured three more persons on 30 March, while scores of homes and a town administration building suffered damage. Fierce fighting continues in and around the town of Izium (Kharkivska oblast) – home to around 46,650 people before the recent escalation. As food, water and medicine supplies dwindle amid growing needs, local authorities say that ongoing fighting continues to prevent the organization of evacuations and the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid to people in need, with the last humanitarian convoy to enter the city arriving more than two weeks ago., In Donetska oblast (GCA), on 30-31 March, 12 civilians were reportedly killed and 35 civilians were injured, including at least six children. In Donetska oblast (NGCA), two civilians were reportedly killed, and 66 civilians were injured. Hostilities also reportedly resulted in damages to at least 51 private houses and multi-storey buildings, 17 infrastructure facilities and 24 transformer substations., In neighbouring Luhanska oblast (GCA), on 30 and 31 March, active fighting reportedly damaged a school and an oil depot. Dozens of homes and other infrastructure, like schools, were set ablaze in Lysychansk, Rubizhne and Sievierodonetsk. Two civilians were reportedly killed in Sievierodonetsk, and several casualties were reported in Lysychansk and Toshkivka. Due to critical infrastructure damage, the settlements of Rubizhne, Popasna, Sievierodonetsk and partially Hirska community (hromada) and Lysychansk have no centralized water supplies. In addition, more than 139,000 users across 36 settlements of Luhanska oblast (GCA) have reportedly been completely cut off from the electrical supply, while some 73,500 users remain without gas supplies. Several houses were also reportedly damaged in Luhanska oblast (NGCA)., Northern Ukraine. In Irpin (Kyivska oblast), local authorities estimate that some 3,500-4,000 people remain in the conflict-ravaged town – some 25 km northwest of Kyiv – where an estimated 50 per cent of homes and critical infrastructure has been destroyed amid ongoing clashes. Preliminary estimates from local authorities put the civilian death toll as high as 300, a figure that is likely higher and will continue to grow as fighting rages on. According to Kyivska oblast authorities, 30 to 40 incidents of shelling have been registered in the oblast each day, with more than half of the oblast’s 69 hromadas sustaining significant damage. In Buchanskyi district (Kyivska oblast), Irpinska, Makarivska hromadas and the village of Shpytky remain under intense shelling. In the Vyshhorodskyi district (Kyivska oblast), the humanitarian situation reportedly remains critical in Dymerska, Ivankivska and Poliska hromadas, while the town of Slavutych remains isolated., Chernihiv. In the city of Chernihiv, local authorities report that more than 350 civilians have been killed by the ongoing hostilities, a figure that is likely much higher. During the reporting period, five buses entering the encircled city to help evacuate local residents came under fire, killing at least one person and injuring four others. On 31 March, at least two convoys led by local volunteers were reportedly attacked while attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to and evacuate people from Chernihiv, leaving several dead and injured, yet another example of an attack on humanitarian corridors and disruption of evacuation processes. Approximately 130,000 people left in the city – less than half of the pre-escalation population of around 290,000 – remain with little or no access to running water, electricity, heat, medical care or mobile phone and internet communications. Chernihiv remains cut off from areas under Ukrainian control since the main bridge over the Desna River, leading out of the city south toward Kyiv, was destroyed on 23 March., Acute water shortages remain the biggest concern in the city. Increasing numbers of people depend on generators to pump water from wells, while others rely on water from rivers, lakes or even melted snow in some cases. The lack of power is another grave concern as it jeopardizes the continuity of critical services, like health care, putting a greater number of lives at risk. Some hospitals in the city rely on electricity from generators, which are quickly starting to run out of fuel, forcing some health facilities to ration electricity. The lack of water and electricity could create conditions that drive the spread of communicable diseases., Civilian evacuations. According to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine, on 30 and 31 March, nearly 2,990 people arrived in Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) through humanitarian corridors in private cars, including more than 1,440 from the crisis-stricken city of Mariupol (Donetska oblast) and 1,545 residents from towns in Zaporizka oblast. At the same time, buses for evacuation from Berdiansk and Melitopol (Zaporizka oblast) and trucks with humanitarian aid continued to be blocked near the town of Vasylivka. Around 45 buses for the evacuation of locals and residents of Mariupol (Donetska oblast) transiting through Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast) were not allowed to enter Zaporizhzhia, while some 600 residents reached the buses on foot. On 1 April, 10 buses were expected to depart Mariupol for Zaporizhzhia, while more than 30 buses remain at the entrance to Berdiansk and will reportedly wait for people to evacuate them to Zaporizhzhia., According to the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister, some 75,000 people have been evacuated from Mariupol to GCA in Ukraine, while some 45,000 have been reportedly forcibly moved to the NGCA of Donetska oblast and the Russian Federation. Around 100,000 people reportedly trapped in Mariupol need to be urgently evacuated as needs reach catastrophic levels in the encircled city. Meanwhile, authorities in Iziumskyi district (Kharkivska oblast) started evacuating people, with some 2,500 evacuated so far. In Izium, relentless attacks have prevented the establishment of humanitarian corridors for some 20 days, according to the Deputy Mayor, with some 15,000-20,000 people requiring immediate evacuation to avoid a protracted accumulation of unmet needs., Meanwhile, on 31 March, the Russian Federation reported that 15,790 people, including nearly 2,769 children, were evacuated from affected areas to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that 543,397 people, including more than 110,979 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine. In addition, the Russian Federation reports that 118,765 persons were evacuated from Mariupol to date, including 3,046 persons on 31 March., Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). According to Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, the Russian Federation forces have left the plant more than five weeks after occupying the site in the early days of the ongoing military offensive. During that time, several hostilities-related hazardous incidents were reported in the vicinity of the Chornobyl NPP, including disconnection from the power supply and wildfires in the exclusion zone that scorched more than 10,000 hectares of forest, which raised serious concerns of a potential large-scale environmental health disaster. Earlier this week, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi met with Ukrainian officials on the roll-out of IAEA technical assistance to help ensure the safety and security of nuclear facilities in the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-1-april-2022
Ukraine Crisis: Week of 19-25 March 2022,Infographic,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2022,"Last week marked one month since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with fighting reported in the country’s northern, eastern, and southern regions. Russian forces continued to shell civilian infrastructure across the country. Civilians bore the burden of the ongoing siege of Mariupol in the Donetsk region, with cuts to electricity, heating, phone coverage, food, and water (Al Jazeera, 23 March 2022; Vgolos, 28 March 2022). The United Nations has indicated that there is growing evidence of mass graves in the city (Reuters, 25 March 2022)., People also continued to hold demonstrations in Ukraine against the Russian invasion. The majority of these demonstrations took place in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which have been partially occupied by Russian forces, with reports of Russian soldiers opening fire on demonstrators in Kherson (Politeka, 21 March 2022)., Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces carried out multiple successful counter attacks last week — including in the Kyiv region — forcing some occupying troops to retreat (Foreign Policy, 24 March 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-19-25-march-2022

They will try again on Saturday to facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol., For the operation to succeed, it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees., If and when the safe passage operation does happen, the ICRC's role as a neutral intermediary would be to accompany the convoy out from Mariupol to another city in Ukraine. Our presence will put a humanitarian marker on this planned movement of people, giving the convoy additional protection and reminding all sides of the civilian, humanitarian nature of the operation.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 31 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2022,"Date: 1 April 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 31 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 3,257 civilian casualties in the country: 1,276 killed and 1,981 injured. This included:, a total of 1,276 killed (260 men, 184 women, 18 girls, and 36 boys, as well as 61 children and 717 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 1,981 injured (228 men, 174 women, 38 girls, and 34 boys, as well as 88 children and 1,419 adults whose sex is yet unknown), In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,443 casualties (425 killed and 1,018 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 1,130 casualties (358 killed and 772 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 313 casualties (67 killed and 246 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,814 casualties (851 killed and 963 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Irpin (Kyiv region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 1 April (local time), 153 children had been killed and 245 injured., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 30 March 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 31 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 31 March have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available andnumbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

Thanks to our national partner the Ukrainian Red Cross, these relief supplies will be delivered to Sumy as well as hard-to-reach areas in the north-east like Trostianets and Okhtyrka. The food rations from PiN and WFP will benefit nearly 6,000 people; blankets, kettles and other basic household items from UNHCR will support 1,500 people, while the sanitation kits help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water. The WHO medical supplies and trauma kits will treat 150 patients requiring intensive care for serious injuries while the other medical supplies will support 10,000 people for three months., The humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and the Russian Federation, facilitated by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), enabled safe passage for this convoy today. But this is clearly not enough. We need to reach the most vulnerable people affected by the grave humanitarian crisis all across Ukraine. Over the past month, the United Nations and humanitarian partners have repeatedly engaged with the parties seeking access to Mariupol, Kherson and other encircled cities. For this to be successful, we need all parties to agree to the exact terms of humanitarian pauses - including the route, the start time, and the duration - for the safe delivery of assistance and the evacuation of civilians., These efforts have regrettably not yet succeeded, as we have been informed repeatedly that the safety and security of aid convoys and civilians could not be guaranteed.

Journalists who fled Belarus feel safer in Ukraine than at home,News and Press Release,RSF,Protection and Human Rights,1 Apr 2022,"""Stay or flee?"" Forced to flee Belarus by the Lukashenko regime's crackdown on independent media, Belarusian journalists who sought refuge in Ukraine are again asking this question. After interviewing four of them, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls on European countries to grant asylum to those seeking it, and calls on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure those who stay are protected., What with bureaucratic traps and blocked bank accounts, in addition to the threats and bombardments, Belarusian journalists who fled to Ukraine to escape persecution in their own country are now facing new problems linked to the sanctions that Ukraine has imposed on Belarus as a Russian ally., ""Between staying in Ukraine, where they are exposed to the full impact of the war and the economic sanctions imposed on their country of origin, and starting over again by seeking refuge in another country with no certainty of obtaining a residence permit, the situation of Belarusian journalists is extremely precarious,"" said Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF's Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. ""We call on European leaders to adopt measures so that these journalists can find a refuge in their countries without risk of being sent back to Belarus. In addition, the Ukrainian authorities must put exceptional mechanisms in place to exclude these journalists from the economic sanctions imposed on Belarusian citizens in Ukraine."", ""I have no choice but to seek asylum"", As well as the difficult working conditions inherent to the war that all journalists in Ukraine must endure, their Belarusian colleagues face obstacles linked to their status as foreign citizens from a country allied with Russia., ""The problem for people like me who come from Ukraine but do not have its nationality is that we find ourselves in a legal vacuum,"" RSF was told by Hleb Liapeika, a journalist with the Mediazona news site. He arrived in Lviv at the beginning of February after six months in Lithuania, and had planned to settle in the city until the war upset all of his plans. He is currently based in the Polish city of Krakow., ""On the day of the Russian invasion, 24 February, I didn't want to leave because the city of Lviv is far from the Russian border and I didn't have a visa to be able to leave Ukraine,"" he told RSF. ""But the next day, I changed my mind on the recommendation of colleagues. As the Polish border guards gave me a permit to enter Poland without asking me about my Belarusian nationality, I now have no choice but to apply for asylum."", However, the procedures for applying for asylum or obtaining a long-term visa for a European Union country often prove to be long and the outcome is uncertain. This is why many Belarusian journalists choose to remain in Ukraine, where Belarusian citizens do not need a visa. As a result of the war, and the suspension of air traffic between the two countries, a specific reason must be given in order to be allowed to travel. Only Georgia and Armenia are also accessible without a visa for Belarusian journalists fleeing their country., ""All the money I had left to live on is blocked"", Belarusian journalists who have fled to Ukraine are also the collateral victims of the sanctions that the Ukrainian authorities have imposed on Belarus, a Moscow ally. All four journalists contacted by RSF confirmed that the Ukrainian central bank has blocked all bank accounts and bank cards held by Belarusian citizens, as it has with those held by Russian citizens., ""For my move to Ukraine, I transferred all the money I had left to live on into Ukrainian accounts,"" said Ales Piletski, a photo-journalist who worked for Tut.by, the leading independent Belarusian media outlet. ""Now everything is blocked. When I connect to my bank's app, my account no longer even appears."", ""Cash is the only possible form of payment, even for those who have a residence permit,"" said Aliaksandr Mikruku, a photo-journalist still based in Kyiv as a correspondent for Belsat TV, a Belarusian TV news channel run by Belarusian exile journalists from a base in Poland. ""Fortunately, colleagues and friends can help me."", The journalist and blogger Sergei Prokhorov has also chosen to stay and keep working in Ukraine in order to cover the situation there, despite financial difficulties and complicated working conditions., ""The danger doesn't come from the Ukrainians, even if there's sometimes some mistrust towards Russian or Belarusian refugees like me, but from the bombardments and threats from the Russian occupation forces,"" Prokhorov told RSF. ""Although work opportunities are limited, I plan to stay in Ukraine and help as a journalist and as a civilian, maybe even participate in defence activity. I hope to be able to obtain Ukrainian citizenship after the war."", ""Despite the war, I feel safer here than in my native country"", None of the four journalists plans to return to Belarus. ""Despite the war, I feel safer in Ukraine than in my native country,"" Mikruku said. ""Here, we can report what is happening without any problem, we can tell the truth. Our TV channel has an official local branch in Ukraine [unlike in Belarus, where it is banned]. If something similar to the Russian invasion had happened in Belarus, we would have had to hide from both the occupiers and our government. Here the Russians are waging a war against Ukraine. In my country, it is the authorities who are waging a 'war' against us, the journalists."", Piletski was one of the victims of that violent and systematic crackdown. ""In Belarus, I was constantly prevented from working by the authorities, who arrested me without reason, threatened me with imprisonment, or tried to confiscate my equipment. On 24 June 2020, masked people abducted me from the street, throttled me, put me in a van and beat me up before handing me over to the police, who asked me to surrender the photos I had taken during a demonstration."", The situation of journalists in Belarus has worsened steadily ever since President Lukashenko's disputed reelection in August 2020, and independent media are persecuted relentlessly by the authorities, as RSF documented in a report published jointly with the World Organisation Against Torture last year. A total of 34 media workers are currently detained arbitrarily in Belarus, almost all independent media outlets are banned, and circulating their ""extremist"" content is punishable by imprisonment., Ukraine is ranked 97th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2021 World Press Freedom Index, while Belarus is ranked 158th.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/journalists-who-fled-belarus-feel-safer-ukraine-home

For the past eight years, the Mission has been playing crucial role by providing objective information on the security and humanitarian situation on the ground and relentlessly working to ease the effects of the conflict on the civilian population,"" Chairman Rau stressed., ""The crucial tasks the Mission has carried out, including facilitating localised ceasefires for the repair of critical infrastructure and being our eyes and ears on the ground cannot be overestimated,"" he said., ""I want to express my sincere gratitude to the brave men and women of the Mission. I had the privilege to see their work first hand during my visits to Ukraine.

Chairman Rau and Secretary General Schmid once again reiterated their call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and engaging in constructive dialogue. Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine must stop., The Special Monitoring Mission was established in March 2014, following a request by the Ukrainian government to the OSCE, and a consensus decision by all 57 participating States., With 1,291 mission members (814 international and 477 national staff), the SMM is by far the biggest mission in the OSCE., Since its deployment in March 2014, the Mission issued 2432 daily reports and 242 spot reports., In 2021 alone, the monitoring teams carried out nearly 18,000 patrols and facilitated close to 400 ""windows of silence"", enabling the repair and maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure facilities such as water, gas and electricity networks benefitting civilians on both sides of the contact line in eastern Ukraine., The OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine continues to fulfil its mandated tasks, including a focus on educational activities on significantly increased risks to civilians in Ukraine from mines, abandoned ordnance and other explosive remnants of war.

Children’s lives and their sense of safety are being uprooted by the conflict and sadly, at this point, there is no end in sight., We launched our multi-country response by rapidly providing food and NFIs at border points. Since then, World Vision has intensively scaled up its operations across four countries (Ukraine, Romania, Moldova, and Georgia), caring for the most vulnerable refugees and internally displaced people. World Vision’s operational sites are many, but so too is our range of assistance, from providing food and hygiene items to creating safe places for children and their caregivers to supporting transit centres and hosting families. The crisis, like many, requires World Vision to tailor our programs to meet urgent needs in support of national and local systems already in place., For example, Romania possesses strong government and civil society actors with child protection and other systems to support refugees. Our emergency response there seeks to strengthen these actors, building on our 30 years of experience. In Moldova, World Vision is starting our operations through partner organisations, large NGOs and faith-based organisations which are supporting affected Moldovan and Ukrainian families. In Georgia, where World Vision has a long-standing presence, the focus initially has been the provision of cash assistance and psychosocial support. Finally, inside Ukraine, we are supporting hospitals, providing food to internally displaced persons (IDP) centres and beginning cash distributions., We are committed to serving 290,000 people affected by the conflict across the four countries from the inception of our response until the end of May. Yet while World Vision is rapidly responding to this tragic crisis, we painfully recognise this conflict will not conclude in two months.

On 29 March, 15 people were reportedly killed and 35 were injured when a Mykolaivska oblast administration building was hit by an airstrike, with rescue work continuing in the following days. On 30 March, new attacks were reported on the outskirts of Kyiv and in the northern city of Chernihiv. OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 29 March, there have been 3,090 civilian casualties, including 1,189 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., As ongoing fighting continues, the most intense hostilities continue to be reported in the government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, while airstrikes increasingly target strategic fuel stocks and industrial facilities, including sites in Khmelnytska oblast (western Ukraine), where an airstrike on 29 March destroyed the fuel depot at the town’s airport. From 29-30 March, amid intense hostilities and constant explosions, the Luhansk oblast administration reported the presence of escalating forest fires across large swaths of land in Aidar,
Mykolaivka, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Tsarivka and Zolote-1. In addition to a loss of electricity experienced in the town of Sievierodonetsk due to shelling, a high-pressure gas pipeline was damaged in nearby Lysychansk, interrupting the gas supply for around 35,000 users in Bilohorivka, Lysychansk, Novodruzhesk, Pryvillia, Shypylivka and Zolotarivka.
The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 31 March, over 4.01 million refugees have fled Ukraine. On 30 March, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister reported that during negotiations with the delegation of the Russian Federation, the Ukrainian delegation put forward a proposal to open humanitarian corridors to the most affected 97 settlements in Kharkiv, Kyiv, Kherson, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zaporizhzia, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Mykoliav regions. The following day, the Deputy Prime Minister indicated that the Russian Federation had confirmed to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) its willingness to allow the opening of a potential humanitarian corridor from the city of Mariupol (south-east of the country), a primary site of concern due to the widescale destruction of infrastructure and loss of life.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-12-30-31-march-2022

Ukraine: Russia’s cruel siege warfare tactics unlawfully killing civilians – new testimony and investigation,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Apr 2022,"The Russian military’s siege warfare tactics in Ukraine, marked by relentless indiscriminate attacks on densely-populated areas, are unlawfully killing civilians in several cities, Amnesty International said today in a new on-the-ground investigation., For the first time, Amnesty International field investigators in Ukraine have independently verified physical evidence of banned cluster munitions, the use of which violates international law. They have also collected testimony that documents Russian siege tactics, including unlawful indiscriminate attacks, disruption of basic utilities, cuts to communication, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and restrictions on access to medicine and healthcare., In recent weeks, Russian forces have been using inherently indiscriminate weapons – such as cluster munitions, and inaccurate weapons with wide-area effects such as unguided ‘dumb’ bombs and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) salvos – in attacks on densely-populated civilian areas., As such, Russian forces’ assaults on towns and cities and wanton destruction of the infrastructure of daily life violates international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Launching indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians also constitute war crimes., “A defining feature of these cruel sieges is Russia’s relentless indiscriminate attacks, which cause utterly devastating harm over time,” said Joanne Mariner, Director of Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Programme., “For five weeks now, civilians across Ukraine have seen their cities razed day-by-day. Our on-the-ground research has documented how some of society’s most at-risk people are disproportionately suffering as these brutal siege tactics continue., “Civilians trapped in cities under siege must urgently have access to humanitarian corridors to enable the safe evacuation of all who wish to leave. Humanitarian supplies must also be allowed to reach those who remain behind.”, Amnesty International conducted in-person and remote interviews with people who experienced sieges in five cities, including Kharkiv and Mariupol. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed relevant satellite imagery, and verified videos and photos of the incidents described below. In the coming weeks, Amnesty International will publish further evidence gathered during on-the-ground investigations in Ukraine., Indiscriminate attacks, Russian forces reached the northern suburbs of Kharkiv in the first days of the invasion, and quickly implemented siege tactics, attempting to encircle the city and firing inaccurate weapons into populated areas., Amnesty International has documented a broad pattern of unlawful indiscriminate attacks across populated areas in Kharkiv. On 28 February, three MLRS salvos struck the northern part of the city and killed at least nine civilians, including children, and wounded at least another 18., In an attack on the morning of 4 March, Olesky Stovba, a 41-year-old father, was injured by a cluster munition while buying groceries on Zaliznychna Street in Kharkiv’s Mala-Danylivka district., He told Amnesty International: “We found some food, and we stood outside the food shop and I heard a great sound. I turned myself and I saw a lot of little fire. It was the height of my knees, 50 metres from me. I fell down, and my wife too, and I felt something hit my right leg… I pulled down my trousers and saw lots of blood.”, Surgeons later removed three fragments from his right groin, calf, and foot. Amnesty International’s Crisis Response weapons investigator examined the physical evidence in person, and confirmed the largest fragment was from either a 9N210 or 9N235 cluster munition., Kharkiv’s Saltivka district has also been repeatedly targeted during the siege of the city. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified 22 incidents in the district, showing damage to civilian areas including schools, residential blocks, food markets, and a tram depot, between 27 February and 16 March. Photos from strikes depict remnants of Smerch rockets and cluster munitions across the area., One man*, who has been running a bomb shelter in Saltivka, told Amnesty International: “It has become my new reality — shootings and bombings, helping older women out of the rubble, no gas, no water, no electricity. Once every three days, we boil ice for water. There are 300 people in the shelter. The majority are older, fragile, [they have] asthma, diabetes. There are some who haven’t left the shelter in three weeks. The biggest problem in Saltivka is that the older people die for lack of medicine, from shock, from a heart attack. It is important to get them in the ground and bury them, it will get warmer soon and they will decompose.”, Documentation of damage to residential areas of Saltivka, Kharkiv as verified by Amnesty International, In a shelter in Lviv, Amnesty International researchers interviewed a 16-year-old girl who had been evacuated alone from Kharkiv. The organization verified a photo showing the remains of a 220mm Uragan rocket that struck close to her family’s apartment complex, which is near a school., She told Amnesty International: “The missile struck at night, and I smelled the fire and felt the waves. All of my family, we all live in the corridor of the apartment building from the first day of the war.”, Amnesty International has previously confirmed that cluster munitions killed a child and two other civilians taking shelter at a preschool in Sumy Oblast, and documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv., Denial of basic services, Communication with civilians in besieged cities is extremely difficult due to disrupted mobile and internet service. Many people spend the majority of their time in underground bomb shelters with weak or no signal. Access to communications and the internet are essential for safety, and for access to vital information regarding possible evacuation routes., In the cities of Kharkiv and Izium, compounds containing TV towers were damaged by strikes. Open-source research and satellite imagery analysis by Amnesty International shows that Kharkiv's TV tower compound was likely damaged twice between 27 February and 17 March, and service outages were reported from 6 March. A building associated with Izium’s TV tower was damaged on 12 March, then further damaged by 20 March. Open-source reports again confirmed disruption to broadcasting. Many older residents rely on television for news and for emergency information from the government., Amnesty International previously documented how civilians in Izium are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster as Russian forces have bombarded the town since the invasion began., Impact on at-risk people, The conflict continues to have a significant impact on older people and people with disabilities, which siege warfare further exacerbates., Alexander Mihta, a 39-year-old in Kharkiv, is diabetic and has severe trouble walking due to the damage the disease has caused to his feet. He drove his wife and daughter to the Polish border, but then had to stay in Ukraine following the implementation of martial law. His apartment building in Kharkiv was struck by Smerch rockets, which smashed steam pipes, cutting heating and flooding the lower floors. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified 21 photos that confirmed damage to the residential building. Mihta later escaped to a shelter in Lviv with his father., He told Amnesty International: “The shelling worsened the whole time. I needed food, so I left and went to shop. I have diabetes and I ran when the shelling worsened, and I twisted my leg. I was trying to get to the bomb shelter but couldn’t. I broke six bones, and they [doctors] want to amputate.”, Amnesty International also interviewed a 61-year-old woman* who has stayed in Kharkiv to care for her mother, aged 84, who has dementia and is unable to travel., She said: “The older people, we are staying. My mother can hardly move… We are from Luhansk and had to get my mother from Luhansk… We left for my daughter’s flat in Kharkiv and we are stuck here. One in every 24 hours we spend outside., “I talk to my mother. I take her to the toilet and help her undress. I have to always explain to her why we are in Kharkiv, and why we are in the basement. She has dementia and always forgets why she is in the basement, and I have to tell her all day long. She used to have a decent life, she could walk in the garden. Not anymore.”, Older people and people with disabilities, as well as other groups who may face particular risks and challenges when fleeing, should be prioritized for evacuation, as specified in international humanitarian law. Planning and communication about evacuations and safe humanitarian corridors must also be undertaken in an inclusive way, including by ensuring that information, transportation, and services are all accessible., Note: *Some names have been omitted for security reasons., STOP THE AGGRESSION AND PROTECT CIVILIANS IN UKRAINE, Right now, people in Ukraine are facing a catastrophic human rights crisis. People are dying, including children, and many thousands of lives are at risk. Take action to demand that the Russian authorities stop this act of aggression and protect civilians now., ACT NOW",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russia-s-cruel-siege-warfare-tactics-unlawfully-killing-civilians-new

The escalation of the war in Ukraine has resulted in the destruction of civilian infrastructure, including health care facilities, denying access to essential health services for thousands of people, including pregnant women, and forcing people to flee for their lives., The new contribution will support five host countries - the Republic of Moldova, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia - to provide critical health and protection services and humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable refugees, including the many women and children who are traveling alone. With the support of the State Department, UNFPA is helping these five European countries ensure that the health, rights, and dignity of women and girls are safeguarded., Last week, UNFPA’s Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem was in Moldova and visited refugees in placement centres that are currently housing hundreds of refugees streaming out of Ukraine. She witnessed the fear and suffering of women and children who have had their lives upended and who now face an uncertain future., She also witnessed the generosity and solidarity of Ukraine’s neighbours, who are opening their arms and homes to millions seeking safety. “It’s a tragedy of huge numbers that Europe has not experienced since the Second World War”, said Dr. Kanem., UNFPA is scaling up the delivery of life-saving support to populations across Ukraine and host countries. This includes distributing essential medicines, supplies, and equipment for maternal health care and the management of obstetric emergencies, and hygiene items such as sanitary pads. UNFPA is also procuring mobile health units for the delivery of priority reproductive health services, including specialized services, such as psychosocial support, for women and girl survivors of violence. Local frontline health personnel are also receiving capacity-building training, while cash and voucher assistance is being provided to increase access to services and protection., As of 21 March, more than 355,000 people have entered Moldova alone – the country has the highest per capita population of Ukrainian refugees in the region. UNFPA is on the ground and has distributed dignity kits to meet the immediate reproductive health and hygiene needs of refugees, and is supporting women with psychological support and referrals to nearby health centres., Displacement brings new risks for women and girls, including increasing their vulnerability to violence, exploitation and abuse. UNFPA is providing women, including pregnant women, with guidance on how to protect themselves and stay safe while they are on the move., UNFPA is grateful for the generous contribution of the U.S. government, but still urgently needs flexible financing to continue scaling up its operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries to procure essential medical supplies and deploy trained personnel. To continue reaching the most vulnerable women and girls, UNFPA requires $32 million in funding for Ukraine and host countries for the next six months, of which only 17% is currently funded.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/us-contributes-34m-support-unfpa-s-response-ukrainian-refugee-crisis

Protection and Human Rights",29 Mar 2022,"The Government of Australia has announced a contribution of AUD 8 million (approximately US$6 million) to UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, to help provide for the protection of displaced Ukrainian women and girls at risk of gender-based violence., With this new contribution, the Australian Government commits to protect women and girls fleeing the war in Ukraine from gender-based violence, and to ensure access to sexual and reproductive health and protection services. Since the war broke out on 24 February, more than 10 million people have been forced to leave their homes, either for internal displacement or to neighbouring countries. According to UNHCR, the majority are women and children., Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, Marise Payne, communicated Australia’s commitment to support emergency humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, with a focus on protecting women, children, older people and people with a disability., The new $8 million contribution will help prioritize the specific needs of women and girls caught up in the Ukraine war. Many are traveling alone, which brings new risks including increased vulnerability to violence, trafficking, exploitation and abuse. UNFPA is actively supporting women and girls on the move, and offering guidance on how to protect themselves and stay safe., This funding will go to UNFPA’s Humanitarian Thematic Fund, which will allow UNFPA to respond with flexibility and efficiency to needs, which are growing by the hour. UNFPA estimates that there are 265,000 pregnant Ukrainian women, and that 80,000 will give birth in the next three months and will need medical care and assistance., UNFPA is scaling up the delivery of life-saving support across Ukraine and in host countries to people affected by the war, including by distributing essential medicines, supplies, and equipment for maternal health care and the management of obstetric emergencies, and hygiene items such as sanitary pads. UNFPA is also procuring mobile health units for the delivery of priority reproductive health services, including specialized services such as psychosocial support, for women and girl survivors of violence. Local frontline health personnel are also receiving capacity-building training, while cash and voucher assistance is being provided to increase access to services and protection., With this new contribution to UNFPA’s humanitarian operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, the Government of Australia demonstrates its absolute commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine, particularly women and girls. Australia continues its support for UNFPA’s mandate to serve the world’s most vulnerable, and ensure that the health, rights and dignity of women and girls are safeguarded.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/australia-provides-unfpa-aud-8-million-protect-ukrainian-women-and-girls-gender-based

Ukraine: Apparent POW Abuse Would Be War Crime [EN/RU],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2022,"Video Appears to Show Fighters Shooting Russian POWs, (New York) – Ukraine should ensure an effective investigation into alleged abuse by Ukrainian fighters of Russian prisoners of war (POWs), Human Rights Watch said today. If confirmed, the beating and shooting of captured combatants in their legs would constitute a war crime, and Ukraine needs to demonstrate that it is able and willing to prevent and punish serious violations of international humanitarian law., Videos posted online early on March 27, 2022 appear to show Ukrainian forces abusing captured Russian fighters or combatants, who have prisoner of war status, including shooting three of them in the leg. The incident appears to have taken place in a village near the city of Kharkiv, which Ukrainian officials had announced retaking two days earlier. A video posted on March 28 by a Ukrainian journalist shows three charred bodies at the same location but who they are and how they died remains unclear., “All the information in the videos that suggests abuse, and maybe worse, of POWs needs to be subject to an effective investigation,” said Aisling Reidy, senior legal advisor at Human Rights Watch. “It should be possible to verify if abuse took place, and from there to hold those responsible to account.”, An adviser to the Ukrainian president, Olexiy Arestovych, acknowledged that abuse of prisoners of war constitutes a war crime and said it will be punished. “I would like to once again remind all our military, civilian, and defense forces that the abuse of prisoners of war is a war crime that has no amnesty under military law and has no statute of limitations,” he posted on Telegram on the evening of March 27. “I remind everyone that we are a European army of a European country. We will treat the prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Convention, no matter what personal emotional motives you have.”, In a video posted to YouTube that day at 10 p.m., Arestovych said that Ukraine would punish those responsible if an investigation determined that there had been abuse., Two videos showing the alleged abuse were posted to Reddit and Twitter, respectively, on the morning of March 27. A longer video posted subsequently on YouTube contains the same footage from these two videos, plus an additional 1 minute and 58 seconds from the incident., The longer video shows five men in military uniform on the ground with their hands bound and two of them with bags over their heads. At least three of the captives appear to be wounded in the leg. A trauma doctor who reviewed the video for Human Rights Watch said that the upper leg injuries and blood on the ground were consistent with gunshot wounds., After 2 minutes and 40 seconds, the captors pull three other prisoners from a blue van and shoot their legs at close range. One of them then hits a prisoner in the face with a rifle butt. The trauma doctor said that the third prisoner appears to have been shot in the back of the thigh, noting that femur fractures are debilitating and susceptible to heavy bleeding., The video location was identified as a dairy farm in the village of Malaya Rohan, about 18 kilometers east of the center of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The location was first identified by an open source researcher, and then verified by various others as well as by Human Rights Watch., The captors have a mix of uniforms, weapons, and gear and no clearly identifiable insignia. Whether these individuals are part of the regular army, a territorial defense unit, or another force remains unclear., Some of the prisoners have white bands on their arms, and one of them has a red band, both of which are worn by Russian and pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine war. Many of the captors have blue armbands which are frequently worn by Ukrainian troops., A person off camera accuses the men of attacking Kharkiv, speaking in Russian with a Ukrainian accent. “Ask about the reconnaissance group, where he has seen them, I need to know exactly,” a person off camera asks. “Where is the group?”, Some of the prisoners are on the verge of passing out. “He’s out,” one captor says. “Next.”, At one point, a person is heard speaking, apparently on a military radio, in Russian without a Ukrainian accent., The first posting of the video on a Reddit thread was at 4:29 a.m. local time on March 27. As the video was filmed in daylight, it would have had to be filmed on or before March 26. By analyzing the video and checking weather reports, the BBC said that the video could have been recorded on March 26., On March 28, the Ukrainian journalist Yuri Butusov, editor of Censor.net, posted a video from the same dairy farm that he said he recorded a few hours after fighting in the area had ceased. It shows the badly burned remains of three people who were wearing what he thought were Russian uniforms., In the video, also reported on by The Intercept, some of the buildings at the farm are damaged by explosions or fire. Those buildings did not appear to be damaged in the video that seemed to show the POWs being abused. How the people were killed and the bodies were burned, and if they are the same men as in the earlier videos, is not yet known., Journalists who visited Malaya Rohan on March 28 reported that they saw the bodies of two Russian soldiers in the streets and two others who had been thrown into a well. They said that a Ukrainian soldier interviewed claimed five Russian soldiers had been captured, one of whom was killed while trying to escape., On March 27, the commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, accused Russia of producing fake videos of alleged abuse against Russian POWs to discredit Ukrainian forces. “I emphasize that service members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other legitimate military formations strictly adhere to the norms of International Humanitarian law,” he posted to Facebook., The Third Geneva Convention governs the treatment of prisoners of war, effective from the moment of capture. This includes obligations to treat them humanely at all times. It is a war crime to willfully kill, mistreat, or torture POWs, or to willfully cause great suffering, or serious injury to body or health. No torture or other form of coercion may be inflicted on POWs to obtain from them any type of information., Reprisals against prisoners of war are strictly forbidden. POWs cannot be punished for acts they have not committed or be subjected to collective punishment. Wounded or ill POWs should be provided with the same medical care that is given to the members of the armed forces of the party in whose custody they are. These standards apply equally to Russian and Ukrainian POWs. Those entitled to POW status include members of the armed forces, members of militia, or similar forces subject to certain conditions; persons, including journalists, accompanying the armed forces without belonging to them; civilians taking up arms “en masse”; and others., Ukraine is also bound by the absolute prohibition on torture and other degrading or inhuman treatment in international law as articulated in both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), to which it is a party., Earlier in March, Human Rights Watch said that Ukraine should abide by their obligation not to allow POWs become a public curiosity, which includes not publishing material that identifies individual prisoners. In particular, Ukrainian authorities should stop and prevent posting on social media and messaging apps videos of captured Russian soldiers, in particular those that show them being humiliated or intimidated. Human Rights Watch wrote to the Security Service of Ukraine and the Interior Ministry on March 10, 2022 about the issue but did not receive a reply., The International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor has opened an investigation into potential serious war crimes in the conflict in Ukraine, which would include war crimes against Russian prisoners of war. Under the principle of complementarity, the ICC can exercise its jurisdiction to prosecute crimes if the Ukrainian authorities are unable or unwilling to carry out their own effective domestic proceedings., Human Rights Watch has also reported on laws-of-war violations and apparent war crimes by Russian forces, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects with cluster munitions and other weapons, excessive destruction not militarily justified, and failing to allow civilians to flee safely from areas of fighting., “The potential abuse of POWs would be a war crime that requires effective investigation and, if proved true, prosecution and punishment by Ukraine,” Reidy said. “Protection of POWs from all parties to the conflict and by all parties to the conflict is fundamental to the laws of war.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-apparent-pow-abuse-would-be-war-crime-enru

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (19 - 25 March 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Ukraine crisis continued to dominate developments. The Russian invasion of Ukraine entered into its second month, and demonstrations in support of Ukraine also continued throughout the region. Demonstrations demanding climate action and against racism were also organized in multiple countries in Europe, and the migrant crisis continued on the Belarusian-Polish border. Meanwhile, fighting on the Azerbaijan-Artsakh Line of Contact escalated., In Ukraine, 24 March marks one month since Russia launched its large-scale invasion. Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the northern, eastern, and southern regions of Ukraine throughout last week. Russian forces continued to shell civilian infrastructure in various parts of the country. The city of Mariupol in the Donetsk region remains under siege while Russian forces continue their bombardment.Despite several successful evacuations of civilians, around 160,000 people remain in the city with no access toelectricity, heating, phone coverage, food, and water (Al Jazeera, 23 March 2022; Vgolos, 28 March 2022). Evidence of mass graves in Mariupol continues to grow, while reports also suggest that constant shelling has prevented people from burying the dead (Reuters, 25 March 2022).1 Additionally, last week, Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of forcibly deporting thousands of civilians from Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities to Russia (BBC News, 27 March 2022; RFE/RL, 25 March 2022)., While Russian troops have been on the offensive in Ukraine for the better part of the past month, Ukrainian forces carried out several successful counterattacks last week, forcing the occupying troops to retreat. In the Kyiv region, reports suggest that Ukrainian troops managed to push Russian forces that have been positioned outside the capital city for weeks as much as 15 miles further back (Foreign Policy, 24 March 2022). The ongoing invasion has driven the 189% increase in violence in Ukraine over the past month relative to the past year that is flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map (for more information, visit ACLED's Ukraine Crisis hub, which offers curated data, an interactive dashboard, the latest analysis, and more).2, Russia may also experience difficulties with supplying Russian forces in northern Ukraine due to continuous railway sabotage in Belarus. Last week, unknown groups continued to damage railways in the southern part of Belarus and near the capital, Minsk. In response, Belarusian special forces were appointed to guard railways in the regions close to the border with Ukraine (Ukrinform, 18 March 2022)., People continued to stage demonstrations in Ukraine last week against the Russian occupation of their cities and Russian military aggression in the country more largely. The majority of these demonstrations took place in the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, which have been partially occupied by Russian forces. In the city of Kherson, Russian soldiers opened fire on a protesting crowd (Politeka, 21 March 2022). Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine also took place in **Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, **and the United Kingdom. In **Russia, **anti-war activists continue to face pressure and intimidation by the state. Last week, the apartments of several anti-war activists were vandalized by unidentified pro-government groups (RFE/RL, 25 March 2022)., Environmental demonstrations and demonstrations against racial discrimination were also on the rise last week. Fridays For Future organized demonstrations to demand action against climate change as part of the International Climate Strike on 25 March. Climate demonstrations were reported in Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, **Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, **and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, demonstrations dedicated to the International Day for Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 21 March took place in **Denmark, Greece, Norway, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, **and the United Kingdom. In some instances, demonstrators drew attention to the difference in the treatment of refugees coming from the Middle East and Africa compared to those fleeing Ukraine, demanding equal treatment for all., In Spain, transport workers continued to demonstrate against rising fuel prices last week under the Platform for the Defense of the Freight Transport Sector, which began an indefinite strike on 14 March (Irish Times, 25 March 2022). Moreover, fishermen, farmers, truck drivers, and other labor groups, political activists, and citizens demonstrated over fuel and gas price hikes in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Serbia, and Moldova., Friction over increasing energy prices also prompted a notable shooting in **Italy **last week. In Sardinia, unidentified gunmen fired shots at the garage of the mother-in-law of the president of the Sardinian branch of Coldiretti, Italy's major organization representing agricultural entrepreneurs. According to a note left near the garage, the attack was in response to the president's stance against the Sardinian haulers protest movement, who have mobilized against the hike in energy prices (Casteddu Online, 25 March 2022)., On the Belarusian-Polish border, migrants' continued attempts to cross into Poland last week led to clashes with Polish police and military forces. Both Polish and Belarusian forces have been accused of human rights abuses against migrants stranded at the border (The Guardian, 8 February 2022). These events contributed to the 125% increase in violence in the Podlaskie border region last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker, which first warned of increased violence to come in Podlaskie in the past month. Enforcement of strict Polish border policies along the Belarusian-Polish border comes in stark contrast to the treatment of Ukrainian refugees. Over 2 million Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Poland since 24 February and have been allowed to stay for up to 180 days and access the labor market, health care system, and social benefits (UNHCR, 29 March 2022; DW, 20 March 2022)., Fighting escalated along the Azerbaijan-Artsakh Line of Contact last week. On 24 March, Azerbaijani forces advanced to occupy Parukh village and the strategically important Karaglukh Heights in the Askeran region of Artsakh. Clashes between Artsakh and Azerbaijani forces continued on 25 March, with Azerbaijani forces using Bayraktar drones, killing three ethnic Armenian servicemen and wounding 14 others. On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Azerbaijani troops withdrew from the village, though the Azerbaijani side has denounced this report as misinformation (Jam News, 28 March 2022). This violence contributed to the 165% increase in violence in the region over the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the region. Additionally, people continued to protest in Artsakh and Armenia, demanding that Azerbaijan restore gas supply to Artsakh. Following weeks of no heating during sub-zero temperatures in Artsakh, the gas supply was resumed on 28 March (News.am, 28 March 2022; OC-Media, 22 March 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-19-25-march-2022
Update 38 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (31 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,31 Mar 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, arrived in Kaliningrad today for talks with senior Russian officials tomorrow morning. This follows his detailed discussions yesterday with senior Ukrainian government officials at South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to review the concrete steps that need to be taken to immediately deliver urgent technical assistance for nuclear safety and security to Ukraine. Director General Grossi will return to the IAEA’s Vienna headquarters on Friday and hold a press conference later in the afternoon., Ukraine today informed the IAEA that the Russian forces that have been in control of Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) since 24 February had, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved two convoys of troops towards Belarus. A third convoy had also left the city of Slavutych, where many of the Chornobyl NPP staff live, and moved towards Belarus. In addition, Ukraine reported that there are still some Russian forces on the Chornobyl NPP site but presumed that those forces are preparing to leave., Ukraine has not reported any staff rotation at the Chornobyl NPP since 20-21 March., The IAEA is in close consultations with Ukrainian authorities on sending the Agency’s first assistance and support mission to the Chornobyl NPP in the next few days, Director General Grossi said., The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone. The IAEA is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation., Out of the country’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, the regulator said nine were operating, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, four at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, it added., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-38-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-31-march-2022
Maintaining a Coalition in Support of Ukraine at the UN,Analysis,ICG,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",31 Mar 2022,"The UN General Assembly has now passed two resolutions condemning Russia’s assault on Ukraine. But the majority is not as solid as it seems. Allies of Kyiv should pay more attention to the concerns of countries from the Global South., On 24 March, the UN General Assembly passed its second resolution on Russia’s war with Ukraine. Its first resolution, condemning Moscow’s aggression, passed with the support of 141 member states on 2 March. The second text, which again condemned Russia and focused on the humanitarian situation, was tabled by Ukraine and 89 co-sponsors and received a total of 140 positive votes. In both cases, only four countries joined with Moscow to vote no: Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria. A handful of states shifted from abstaining on the first resolution (or not voting at all) to backing the second, and vice versa, but at first glance the majority in support of Ukraine in the General Assembly looks consistent., Diplomats at the UN, however, say the task of securing such support for the more recent resolution was difficult. Since the General Assembly first voted on the situation in Ukraine, many members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the UN (which accounts for some 120 of the body’s 193 members) have started to worry about the global effects of the crisis. These include the threat of food price shocks – which are likely to hit Africa and the Middle East particularly hard, as both are major importers of grain from Russia and Ukraine – and the likelihood that the U.S. and European donors will need to divert development and humanitarian aid to help Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees, creating funding shortfalls elsewhere. Western diplomats insist that they will try to avoid this outcome – and the European Union (EU) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development say much the same– but in private they admit that it is almost inevitable. Some European representatives at the UN have annoyed their NAM counterparts by raising Ukraine in talks on other troubled areas, such as the Horn of Africa., The 24 March General Assembly resolution on the humanitarian situation threatened to become a lightning rod for this discontent. It began life in the Security Council, where France and Mexico tabled a text on the war’s humanitarian aspects at the end of February. This draft was designed to create common ground with Russia after Moscow predictably vetoed an earlier Council resolution casting it as the aggressor. The French-Mexican text deliberately omitted any reference to Russia by name, but the United Kingdom and United States, which refuse to back a resolution that does not blame Russia, blocked it., After a series of fruitless discussions in the Council, France and Mexico decided to turn to the General Assembly instead in mid-March. Diplomats from other countries supporting Ukraine were worried by this move: they predicted that NAM members would think twice about backing a text, given misgivings about the West’s alleged failure to address the war’s global consequences. A week before the vote, European diplomats speculated that the French-Mexican initiative might pick up as few as 100 votes and no more than 120. Ukraine itself took a hawkish approach to the text, insisting that it include condemnation of Russia, on top of less controversial items such as clauses providing for protection of civilians, aid workers and refugees., The diplomatic situation grew more complicated still in the week of 21 March. Russia announced that it would demand a vote on a Security Council resolution of its own on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine – including language in effect condemning the Ukrainians for putting civilians in besieged cities at risk – that it had previously floated but then shelved for lack of support. Russia’s decision to reintroduce this text was presumably designed to create confusion about the value of the General Assembly process, or to make the Western powers cast their veto to block an ostensibly humanitarian initiative. Either way, it flopped. China and Russia backed the text in a vote on 23 March, but all other Security Council members abstained, killing the text (Council resolutions need nine votes to pass)., Ukraine and its allies faced a more serious dilemma back in the General Assembly, where South Africa introduced a humanitarian resolution of its own on 21 March. Pretoria’s draft looked like an effort to split the difference between the other texts on offer, as it made no mention of Russia’s invasion but also included language reaffirming Ukraine’s territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, implicitly including Russian-controlled Crimea. It was additionally free of phrasing that could be read as blaming Ukraine for civilian casualties (humanitarian experts, however, worried that it contained a paragraph on “UN coordination” of humanitarian efforts that could open the way for Russia to interfere in UN aid operations)., South Africa’s initiative took Western diplomats by surprise, and its motivation remains a matter of debate in New York. South African officials insist that their intentions were solely humanitarian, noting that President Cyril Ramaphosa had called for a UN role in ending the war as early as February. They also say they informed Ukraine of their proposals before introducing them at the UN., Ukrainian diplomats, by contrast, claim that South Africa gave them no advance warning of the text. Western officials suspect that the text was a conscious effort to help Russia by complicating General Assembly discussions of humanitarian issues. South African officials strongly dispute this notion, saying they felt that Western diplomats took a high-handed approach to the process, refusing to engage in real negotiations. It is hard to get to the bottom of these claims and counter-claims. All involved admit that the General Assembly discussions were confused, with diplomats in New York and their superiors in capitals often struggling to keep up with each other as the debate evolved. The Russian ambassador to the UN did not help Pretoria much by telling a NAM gathering that Moscow approved of 97 per cent of the South African text, convincing some diplomats that it was indeed some sort of pro-Russian gambit., By the end of the week, the EU had led a concerted lobbying campaign on behalf of the Ukrainian text that ensured it had a total of 90 co-sponsors, including Ukraine itself. The EU delegation in New York played a significant part in both keeping the Union’s members – who had differing views on how hard to push back against South Africa – together, while also coordinating lobbying around the UN and in capitals to get the most votes possible. By contrast, South Africa could muster fewer than ten co-sponsors for its draft. The latter group did include China, but there is no evidence that Beijing worked especially hard to build a coalition behind the text. On 25 March, the Ukrainian resolution sailed through the General Assembly (China abstained). Immediately thereafter, Ukraine called a procedural vote on whether to hold a full vote on South Africa’s draft at all., Only 50 countries (including China and Russia) backed voting on the South African text, while 67 (including all EU members and the U.S.) opposed it (see map below). The initiative died. But it was a close-run thing. A significant number of EU members had wanted to abstain on the South African proposal, and had this bloc done so, the South African draft would have at least gone to a full vote – and most probably passed, although not by a great margin. UN officials would have been left trying to interpret two competing resolutions on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, leaving the General Assembly looking seriously divided., As the General Assembly in fact emerged from this messy process looking surprisingly firm in support of Ukraine, Western diplomats are now wondering what more they can do in the forum to penalise Russia. One option is to try suspending Moscow from its seat on the Human Rights Council in Geneva, which requires two-thirds majorities in support in both the Council itself and the General Assembly. On paper this option looks feasible given the numbers in the late March voting, especially as abstentions and no-shows at the Assembly would not count toward the result. But the numbers may be misleading. Many NAM members dislike on principle the idea that the General Assembly would pass resolutions on an individual country’s human rights performance. Those that have been willing to vote against Russia on largely symbolic resolutions to date might baulk at supporting more concrete penalties, like Human Rights Council suspension, for Moscow., Ukraine and its supporters should now tread carefully at the UN. They have secured two impressive majorities against Russia in the General Assembly, both meaningful for signalling the world’s support for Ukraine, even if not for concrete policy measures. But had they made just one or two diplomatic missteps, the second push could have ended badly. At the very least, Ukraine, European states and the U.S. should pause to listen to their African, Asian and Latin American counterparts’ concerns about the future of food prices and development aid. There are positive signs in this direction. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has already put together a team of UN senior officials to address these issues, and the UN Secretariat has done studies of the consequences of the Ukrainian war for some 100 countries. On 28 March, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke at the Security Council on the humanitarian situation Ukraine and – along with other friends of Kyiv in the Council – referred to the global food security situation, blaming supply shortages on Moscow., Lebanon, which imports 80 per cent of its wheat from Ukraine and Russia, has now also floated the idea of a General Assembly debate devoted to global food security, calling for “a resolution drawing attention for the need for coordinated, cohesive global action to deal with this challenge of our times”. Some European diplomats see this opening as promising, but others worry about losing focus on the crisis in Ukraine itself. Ukraine’s supporters, and the government in Kyiv, should engage seriously with the Lebanese proposal. If they want to maintain a high level of support among non-Western countries for future votes concerning Ukraine and Russia in UN forums, they should look closely at how to mitigate the effects of the war on countries outside Europe as well.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/maintaining-coalition-support-ukraine-un
"UN High Commissioner for Refugees calls for immediate end to Ukraine war, which has uprooted over 10 million people",News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2022,"Lviv, Ukraine -- Visiting Ukraine for the first time since the Russian military offensive, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi appealed today in the strongest terms for an end to the war, while calling on the international community to provide sustained support to the millions of civilians impacted by the fighting., ""The speed of the displacement, coupled with the huge numbers of people affected, is unprecedented in Europe in recent memory,"" Grandi said, concluding the visit., Civilians are suffering and more than 10.5 million people have been displaced either within Ukraine or abroad as refugees, around a quarter of the population. In total, 13 million people are estimated to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across the country., ""I have spoken with women, with children, who have been gravely affected by this war,"" he added. ""Forced to flee extraordinary levels of violence, they have left behind their homes and often their families, leaving them shocked and traumatized. The protection and humanitarian needs are enormous, and continue to grow. And while critically urgent, humanitarian aid alone cannot give them what they really need -- and that is peace."", Following meetings with Ukrainian Government officials, Grandi added, ""I am deeply impressed by the humanitarian leadership and response from all levels of government in the country, as well as the selflessness and resilience of the Ukrainian people, who are hosting millions of their displaced compatriots."", Grandi reiterated UNHCR's commitment to stay and deliver for the people of Ukraine: in neighbouring countries, and inside their country. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has been operating in Ukraine for 28 years, and is focusing its response on protection, emergency shelter, cash and in-kind support, under the overall leadership of the government and in coordination with the entire United Nations system., With local authorities and community representatives, Grandi visited a reception centre for internally displaced people that was established and run by the authorities with UNHCR support. It is one of 70 centres that have already been assessed and equipped while others are being identified for refurbishment. UNHCR is expanding the capacity and improving the living conditions of reception centres so that they may host more internally displaced Ukrainians in need of shelter., At the centre, Grandi witnessed people enrolling for cash assistance, a UNHCR programme launched to help particularly vulnerable displaced people - such as those with disabilities and elderly -- to cover the costs of basic needs like accommodation, food, clothes and hygiene items. UNHCR's program, which is being rolled out in multiple oblasts, aims to reach 360,000 people with US$80 million worth of support over an initial three months to complement the Government's own social assistance programme., But to respond at the scale needed, Grandi said, humanitarians must be able to deliver assistance safely to Ukrainians in need wherever they are., ""The entire humanitarian system is doing everything it can to reach people in need throughout the country, but the safety of aid workers and civilians receiving assistance must be guaranteed. This is a fundamental principle of International Humanitarian Law which must be respected. Lives are depending on it,"" he said., Grandi also appealed to the international community to provide even greater resources to the humanitarian response. ""The support and solidarity shown so far by donors, neighbouring countries, and private individuals from around the world has been remarkable,"" he said. ""But the needs here in Ukraine are growing and the international community must continue to stand with Ukrainians in need."", BROLL: https://media.unhcr.org/Share/r2816y07q175ykv48ft1t586vu11ld4p, Media contacts:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-high-commissioner-refugees-calls-immediate-end-ukraine-war-which-has-uprooted-over

Germany is now making 370 million euro available to help in this situation., Since the start of the war of aggression against Ukraine, 18 million people have been in need of humanitarian assistance; hundreds of thousands have no access to water, food or electricity. The war has thus triggered a humanitarian crisis on a scale unseen in Europe since the Second World War., Germany has acted quickly since the start of the war and has provided humanitarian assistance. In order to continue this work, the Federal Government has now launched a major humanitarian support package amounting to a total of 370 million euro., Direct help for the people on the ground, The assistance is intended to benefit both the people in Ukraine and the refugees in neighbouring states. Specifically, the aim is to supply them with food, medicine, drinking water and electricity, but also to provide care for the sick and war wounded, secure emergency shelters, special assistance for children and psychological support., In these efforts, a crucial role is played by our partners, including the World Food Programme, the International Organization for Migration, UNHCR, UNICEF and the World Health Organization, but also many smaller NGOs and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund for Ukraine. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is doing vital work to negotiate humanitarian corridors, also plays a major part., World’s second-largest humanitarian donor, The money for Ukraine is not taking away from the Federal Government’s commitments in other crises.

In about five weeks, more than 4 million Ukrainians have fled to surrounding countries in search of safety., As of March 28, more than 360,000 Ukrainians had entered neighboring Moldova as a result of the invasion. Nearly two-thirds have already left Moldova to enter Romania, which is part of the European Union. Roughly 30,000 (8%) have returned to Ukraine. Finally, a little more than a quarter (about 98,000) remain in Moldova. About half of the Ukrainians who have entered Moldova are children., Several thousand of the Ukrainian refugees in Moldova are living in Refugee Accommodation Centers that have registered with the Moldovan government. However, the overwhelming majority are in rented apartments, hotels and in private homes., CWS RESPONSE, The most significant emerging needs are in supporting host communities. The majority of Ukrainian refugees are being hosted by families in private homes. A large part of the CWS response planning in Moldova is focused on supporting these households to meet immediate needs., CWS has identified two local organizations that are already operational in Moldova and is planning to support and enhance their responses. One of these organizations is a former CWS local partner called Diaconia, which has been operating nationwide in Moldova since 2003. As CWS and our partners continue to build longer-term programs, we will be supporting a few immediate needs over the next few days.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Mar 2022,"PAX has been monitoring the impact on civilians and their environment from the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We monitor media and social media reports through Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, use and contribute to monitoring efforts by other collectives such as Bellingcat, and geolocate for verification. In this publication we highlight one aspect of civilian harm from the bombing and shelling of Ukranian towns, which is the impact on healthcare. This publication only lists a limited number of locations. Undoubtedly more information will surface that will add to this non-exhaustive list. We welcome any input, feedback and collaboration on this topic., Introduction, In 2017 PAX and Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic co-published a study on the impact from explosive weapon use on healthcare in government-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.
We visited hospitals, clinics, ambulance stations and other medical posts, and interviewed 55 people, including local residents, health care workers, UN representatives and local NGO staff. We documented the devastating impact, both direct as indirect, on healthcare from the use of explosive weapons in towns and cities. The health care system in eastern Ukraine, which already fell below the standards of other parts of Europe, has suffered as a result of the conflict already since 2014. Damage to hospital buildings and equipment, personnel fleeing or unable to visit their patients because of the violence, but also damage to infrastructure like water facilities, electricity and communication networks all had a deep impact on the healthcare system and the conditions under which medical personnel had to operate., The current widespread damage to healthcare throughout Ukraine is deeply worrying and should inform both political action and humanitarian responses. PAX firmly condemns the invasion and calls for an immediate return of all Russian troops to outside Ukraine’s sovereign territory., A pattern of harm, Both the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) attribute most of the civilian harm caused during the Russian invasion of explosive weapons with wide area effects. These weapons are generally considered to include weapons that are inaccurate (such as unguided artillery), weapons that launch multiple munitions (such as multi-barrel rocket launchers, also referred to as multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS)) or weapons that have a big blast and fragmentation radius (such as heavy aircraft bombs).
We see all of these explosive weapons being used now in towns and cities in Ukraine, and the harm it causes is devastating., Research indicates that worldwide 9 out of 10 casualties from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas are civilians. The ICRC warns that the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas should be avoided, because of the high likelihood of indiscriminate effects. Internationally states are working towards a political declaration to prevent further civilian harm from the use of these weapons in populated areas., As of 24 March, one month after the start of the invasion, the World Health Organization (WHO) had verified 64 attacks on health care. The WHO notes that this is more than 2-3 attacks per day, stressing that “Attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” according to Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine. On 26 March, in an interview with the BBC, Habicht expressed concerns that the number of attacks on healthcare is increasing daily”., OCHA has reported many civilians to be left without access to water and electricity because of damage to water and electricity facilities. This also has a profound impact on the provision of healthcare: medical equipment needs electricity, medicines may need to be kept in a fridge, patients can not be washed, medical instruments can not be sanitized, light that is needed in operating rooms doesn’t work, and so on. It also impacts heating systems, leaving patients in the cold., One month after the invasion, the WHO reports that close to 7 million people are internally displaced, and the number of people that have fled to neighboring countries is fast approaching 4 million. This brings the total of displaced to 11 million – nearly a quarter of the population of Ukraine. Among these people, there will undoubtedly also be medical personnel that have been forced to flee., Parties to conflict have an obligation to uphold international law and to protect the civilian population, including from harm caused by damage to and destruction of vital civilian infrastructure and services. PAX therefore calls on all parties to the conflict to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and protect civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/impact-healthcare-bombing-and-shelling-ukraine

Damage to ICRC warehouse in Mariupol,News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2022,"We can confirm that an image being circulated online shows damage to the ICRC warehouse in Mariupol. We do not have a team on the ground there, so have no other information on potential casualties or the extent of the damage., We distributed all of the supplies from the warehouse earlier in March. This included medical supplies to hospitals and relief supplies to people living in shelters. No ICRC staff have been at the warehouse since 15 March, and we don't know how it's been used since. Despite the massive humanitarian needs in the city, we have been unable to bring in more supplies due to the intensity of the fighting and the absence of a functional agreement between the parties to allow for the safe passage of humanitarian assistance., Under international humanitarian law, objects used for humanitarian relief operations must be respected and protected at all times. We are concerned that even a building with a red cross on it can be seriously damaged. Civilian infrastructure, hospitals and medical personnel cannot be targeted. The parties must do everything in their power to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and protect civilians against the effects of attacks., But what we are most outraged by is the overall humanitarian situation in Mariupol and the relentless suffering inflicted on civilians living there. People are trapped with no safe way out of the city, and they are running out of the very basics needed for their survival.

Reports of some of these risks already becoming reality have begun to surface. This demands an urgent gender-intentional response to ensure the specific rights and needs of women and girls are prioritized., Women’s civil society organizations inside Ukraine and in neighboring countries are uniquely qualified to help meet these needs. The majority of these organizations remain operational, committed to supporting Ukraine’s women and girls, increasingly at the risk of their own lives., They are providing food and shelter, legal assistance, mental health support, and help for those evacuated and on the move. Supporting these organizations must be a priority. Ensuring safe humanitarian corridors for this work, and for the work of humanitarian agencies is imperative. We echo the UN Secretary-General’s call for a humanitarian ceasefire., Women’s organizations lie at the heart of UN Women’s response in Ukraine. We have directly allocated immediate funds to women’s civil society organisations, with more to follow, alongside additional funds coming through the United Nations Women, Peace and Humanitarian Fund for which UN Women is the Secretariat., We are making efforts to ensure that women’s priority needs are addressed, specifically, safety; access to shelters; necessities such as food, medicine, and hygiene products, accommodation, water and access to power and connectivity; and access to livelihoods, including the ability to work and earn an income., We are conducting rapid gender assessments to ensure that up-to-date data and analysis on the gender dynamics of the war and its impacts are available to all those working on the response. And we are providing experts to the United Nations Commission of Inquiry established by the Human Rights Council. Our experts are equipped with the skills and experience to investigate sexual violence, abuse and exploitation of women and girls in the context of war. We invest in this work because our experience has shown that to prevent sexual and gender-based violence, it is imperative to investigate these crimes and hold perpetrators to account against these fundamental abuses of the rights of women and girls., UN Women remains determined to give all we can of our energies, expertise and resources, alongside our partners within and outside the United Nations family. We use our voice in international political fora to ensure that women’s rights, interest, voices and leadership are fully built into the global response to the war in Ukraine., UN Women is committed to playing our part to ensure that all women and girls everywhere are protected from the consequences of war, and will take every opportunity to support their resilience and leadership.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-un-women-executive-director-sima-bahous-ukraine-30-march-2022

The number displaced by the conflict could reach 10 million according to some estimates., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Heavy fighting continued across Ukraine during the reporting period. Notably, severe bombardment took place in the country’s north despite Russian’s March 29 pledge to” drastically reduce” hostilities in that part of the country while peace talks in Turkey ensue., Instead, intensified attacks were recently carried out in several northern cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and its suburbs. The northern city of Chernihiv also saw an uptick in aerial assaults during this time. The city’s mayor reported that the escalation has trapped over 100,000 people. He said food and medical supplies could run out in a week’s time if the situation does not improve., Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces appeared to be making significant territory gains in strategic parts of the country, including northern districts of Kyiv. iii On Wednesday, the Russian defense ministry suggested it would be diverting troops from the north to carry out objectives in the east., On a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded the southeastern port city of Mariupol surrender to his troops. The city has been completely surrounded by Russian forces for over a month. As a result, more than 100,000 people are believed to be trapped with little to no access to food, water, electricity, and other essentials., Echoing statements made by international relief organizations and the U.S. government in recent weeks, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern that Russia may have committed war crimes by carrying out",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-11-31-march-2022

Ukraine: Civilians in Besieged Chernihiv Need Access to Essentials,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2022,"Facilitate Humanitarian Aid, Safe Evacuations, and Access to Water, Electricity, Civilians in Ukraine’s northern city of Chernihiv have had limited access to running water, electricity, or heat since early March 2022, when Russian forces escalated their assault on the city, Human Rights Watch said today., Since at least March 24, Russian forces have effectively laid siege to the city, controlling almost all access to the city and attacking the bridge that provided the last remaining access route in and out of the city to Ukraine-held territory. This has prevented the evacuation of the wounded, including children, and use of the route for the delivery and distribution of humanitarian goods, including critical medical supplies, to the civilian population., “Civilians in Chernihiv have been trapped for days, in a cascading crisis without access to basic services and with no means of escape, all while living under the constant threat of Russian attacks,” said Richard Weir, crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Russian along with Ukrainian forces need to take the necessary steps to allow civilians who want to, to safely leave the city and to ensure the basic needs are met for civilians who remain.”, The conditions in Chernihiv bear resemblance to those in the southeastern port city of Mariupol, where the situation dramatically deteriorated as residents sheltered in basements with little to no access to running water, power, heat, medical care, or mobile phone service as Russian forces laid siege to the city., On March 29, a deputy Russian defense minister said that Russia would “reduce military activity” near Kyiv, the capital, and Chernihiv. However, as of March 30, there does not appear to have been any significant reduction in military activities in and around the two cities. Military activity by any party should not arbitrarily prevent the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to residents nor the safe evacuation of civilians who choose to leave., Human Rights Watch spoke with a city official, a doctor in Chernihiv, and a resident who recently fled the city. They described a deteriorating situation, in which access to water, electricity, heating, and phone and internet communications has almost completely disappeared in most parts of the city over the past few days. Acute water shortages pose a particularly grave risk to the approximately 130,000 residents who remain in the city, out of the pre-war population of almost 300,000 people. The lack of electricity also severely limits access to health care. The full extent of civilian casualties and damage to the city’s infrastructure cannot be assessed due to the continued hostilities and limited communications., Olexander Lomako, secretary of the city council of Chernihiv, estimates that more than 350 civilians have been killed during the attacks on the city. “But these are very rough figures,” he told Human Rights Watch on March 30. “Lots of people remain under the destroyed houses. People are often forced to bury their neighbors and relatives in the yards of their houses. So we can’t even count the exact number of victims. Moreover, there are injured people coming to hospitals every day.… Some will not survive the wounds and lots of them will remain with disabilities for life. Some lost a leg, an eye, or an arm.”, Russian military attacks on Chernihiv began on February 24, the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Human Rights Watch previously documented a Russian airstrike on a residential neighborhood in the city on March 3 that damaged multiple buildings, including a hospital, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, according to witnesses and doctors Human Rights Watch spoke with as well as local officials. Since then, attacks on Chernihiv escalated as Russian forces moved to encircle the city., On the evening of March 23, the main bridge over the Desna River, on the road leading out of Chernihiv south toward Kyiv, was destroyed. This effectively cut off vehicle traffic to and from areas under Ukrainian control, as Russian forces control the other main roads in and out of the city. On March 26, several Ukrainian and international journalists who were reporting from the destroyed bridge said the area came under sustained heavy shelling while they were there, injuring one of them., “This bridge let us receive humanitarian aid and evacuate injured and peaceful civilians – women and children,” Lomako said. “Now there is only [a] pedestrian bridge left. And [when] somebody dares to cross it, Russians shell the bridge.” Human Rights Watch has no information on specific efforts to deliver impartial humanitarian assistance via access routes under Russian control and whether Russian forces have denied access., Lomako said that the biggest problem for residents remaining in Chernihiv is the absence of a water supply. They have had to use generators to pump water from wells, he said, but there is not enough to supply water to everyone, and some have had to rely on water from rivers and lakes, or melted snow., Vladyslav Atroshenko, Chernihiv’s mayor, said at a media briefing on March 26 that the city was “blown to smithereens” and that officials were trying to evacuate by “any means” 44 people with severe injuries, military, and civilians, including three children., A doctor Human Rights Watch spoke with on March 26 said that his hospital in Chernihiv only had electricity from its generators and the generators were starting to run out of fuel. Under the current situation, the generators are scheduled to be turned on for four hours each day. “We use that time to cook baby formula for the babies,” he said. Surgery requires a lot of generator fuel, he said, and the generators do not provide enough power for hospital staff to properly operate medical equipment like their advanced X-ray machine, which helps them assess injuries. The water shortages have also created problems. “Since we don’t have power and water, we can’t sterilize our medical tools, so we’ve had to use disposable kits,” he said., Ensuring access to electricity and potable water will be crucial to help prevent the spread of communicable waterborne disease from ingesting contaminated water, Human Rights Watch said. Severe dehydration can lead to hypothermia, leg cramps, delirium, blood pressure loss, organ failure, and death. Children, pregnant women, and older people are more prone to the effects of dehydration., International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, prohibits attacks directed at and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects as well as attacks that cause anticipated harm to civilians disproportionate to the expected military benefit. The laws of war do not prohibit sieges by land and blockades by sea of enemy forces, but sieges cannot include tactics that prevent civilians’ access to items essential for their survival such as water, food, and medicine. Parties to the conflict must allow and facilitate the rapid passage of impartial humanitarian aid for all civilians in need and not arbitrarily interfere with it., Furthermore, all parties to an armed conflict must protect objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, including those necessary for water distribution and sanitation. Starvation as a method of warfare is prohibited., Under international human rights law, states must respect the right to water which includes refraining from limiting access to, or destroying, water services and infrastructure as a punitive measure during armed conflicts as well as respecting the obligations to protect objects indispensable for survival of the civilian population set out above. Parties to the conflict urgently need to ensure that the civilian population in Chernihiv and other areas affected by the hostilities have access to water and electricity without discrimination or unlawful restrictions., “Civilians trapped in Chernihiv are experiencing echoes of the horrors experienced by those in Mariupol over recent weeks,” Weir said. “Civilians should not have to or be allowed to suffer like this. Parties to the conflict need to abide by their international responsibilities and protect all those who remain in Chernihiv.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilians-besieged-chernihiv-need-access-essentials
High Commissioner for Human Rights Calls on the Russian Federation to Immediately Withdraw All Troops from Ukraine as the Human Rights Council Hears an Update on the Situation in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2022,"Human Rights Council Concludes Interactive Dialogue on the Report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, Hears Presentation of Reports on Technical Assistance and Capacity Building and Starts General Debate, The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights this afternoon presented an oral update to the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in Ukraine, calling for the hostilities to stop, without delay, and urging the Russian Federation to heed the clear and strong calls of the General Assembly and of the Council and immediately act to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory., Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting an oral update on the findings of the Office of the High Commissioner in its periodic report on the situation of human rights in Ukraine, said that for more than one month now, the entire population of Ukraine had been enduring a living nightmare. The lives of millions of people were in upheaval as they were forced to flee their homes or hide in basements and bomb shelters as their cities were pummelled and destroyed. The hostilities must stop, without delay. The Russian Federation should heed the clear and strong calls of the General Assembly and of this Council, and immediately act to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory. In the five weeks since the conflict began, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had recorded at least 1,189 deaths of civilian men, women and children and at least 1,901 injuries. The actual figures were likely to be far higher., Ukraine, speaking as a country concerned, said the update described in appalling details the horrors of Russia’s assault on Ukraine and the war crimes committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people. In only one month, the Russian aggression had already had a devastating toll on the human rights of the Ukrainian people. Acting on orders from the leadership, the Russian army used the most vicious methods with disregard for human life, launching hundreds of missiles on residential areas, killings thousands of innocent civilians, bombing hospitals and maternity wards, and targeting civilian infrastructure to deliberately deprive thousands to access basic needs. Russia had failed to respect any of the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council resolutions urging them to cease their invasion, put an end to human rights violations, and stop human suffering on the ground., In the discussion on Ukraine, many speakers said they stood united with Ukraine, which was facing a large-scale unprovoked, unlawful and unjustified aggression by Russia, enabled by Belarus. Russia should immediately cease the attacks and deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, especially using explosive weapons, such as cluster munitions, in residential areas, which were grave violations of international humanitarian law. One speaker pointed out that the Council should not be used for different purposes than those for which it was established, as genuine dialogue and cooperation were the pillars of the work of the Council, and yet, such issues were being dealt with under inappropriate agenda items, fuelling the politicisation of the work of the body, thus not contributing in any way to the protection and promotion of human rights in the world, but instead reinforcing the bias, selectivity, politicisation and double standards that threatened the body. Another speaker was concerned by the massive violation of the Ukrainian military of human rights, as refugees trying to leave for Russia were targeted, and civilians were used as human shields., Speaking on the situation in Ukraine were Lithuania (on behalf of a group of countries), European Union, Croatia (on behalf of a group of countries), Liechtenstein, Finland, Germany, Sovereign Order of Malta, Montenegro, Estonia, Japan, France, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Lithuania, Austria, Russian Federation, Sweden, Ireland, Belarus, Denmark, Slovakia, United States, Belgium, Romania, United Kingdom, Ireland, Turkey, Albania, Croatia, Poland, Latvia, Georgia, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Bulgaria, Slovenia, North Macedonia, UN Women, New Zealand, Colombia, Canada, Iceland, Republic of Korea, Cyprus, Portugal Italy, and Greece., Also speaking were Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, Baptist World Alliance, Swedish Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights - RFSL, Caritas Internationalis, World Federation of Ukrainian Women's Organizations, International Fellowship of Reconciliation, Human Rights House Foundation, Dignity - Danish Institute Against Torture, All Win Network, Minority Rights Group International, and International Commission of Jurists., The Council then heard the presentation of reports under its agenda item 10 on technical assistance and capacity building., Christian Salazar Volkmann, Director of the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting the report of the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, said the report provided an overview of the technical assistance conducted by the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner. Since August 2021, technical cooperation activities had paused while the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner had focused on restoring systems for monitoring and reporting on human rights, including to this Council. Today, one in three Afghans faced emergency or crisis levels of food insecurity., Afghanistan, speaking as a country concerned, said that as the report indicated, it was clear that there were two Afghanistans: an Afghanistan before the 15 August takeover by the Taliban, and an Afghanistan after. Prior to 15 August, the country was by no means perfect, but it had taken significant steps towards the protection and promotion of human rights held by all its citizens. The Taliban had since completely reversed this progress, but it had not destroyed the hope and aspiration of the people. What the people of Afghanistan needed from the international community and from the Human Rights Council was a coordinated, coherent and focused support of the entire human rights system to organise and rally all available and potential resources to stop the deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan., Mr. Volkmann then presented the High Commissioner’s report on the overview of successes, best practices and challenges in technical assistance and capacity-building efforts. The overall aim of the Office’s technical cooperation was to support Governments and other partners to effectively protect and promote human rights. The activities of the 102 field presences worldwide were geared towards this goal, with support from the Trust Fund on Universal Periodic Review implementation, the Treaty-body Capacity Building Programme and the Regular Budget for Technical Cooperation. He also introduced the Report of the Office on Operations of the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the Work of the Human Rights Council., Azita Berar-Awad, member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, said that in 2021, the Voluntary Fund had continued providing increased financial support for technical cooperation in implementation of international human rights standards at the national level. Technical support for the realisation of human rights was more relevant than ever, as countries moved ahead with pandemic recovery plans and efforts to bring back on track, investments towards the realisation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The current world situation called for strengthening predictable and sustained financial support to the Office of the High Commission and the programmes it supported at national and regional levels., The Council then began the general debate on technical assistance and capacity building, hearing from the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries., At the beginning of the meeting, the Council concluded the interactive dialogue on the report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya., Tracy Robinson, Member of the Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, in concluding remarks, pointed out many recommendations towards accountability and reconciliation, and others on the need for institutional building to address violations of international law and international humanitarian law. The stack of violations in Libya was growing, and the absence of institutions to respond to them was allowing for the scourge of impunity., Chaloka Beyani, Member of the Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, in concluding remarks, said it was important to support the Mission to complete the fulfilment of its mandate. There was a need to support accountability mechanisms and he called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction to bring perpetrators to account. He called for continuing support for the Mission., In the discussion on Libya, speakers said there was a need to fight wide-spread impunity, and urged the further extension of the mandate of the Mission. The international community should provide technical assistance and greater capacity building in order to strengthen all branches of the Government, particularly the judiciary. The efforts made by Libya to strengthen the protection and promotion of human rights were appreciated, as was the adoption of social programmes to protect the most vulnerable. The right of Libyans to self-determination and to free and fair elections were basic rights that must be defended., Speaking on Libya were Senegal, France, United Nations Children’s Fund, Venezuela, Luxembourg, China, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Netherland, Switzerland, Russian Federation, Kuwait, Morocco, Algeria, Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, United States, Belgium, Bahrain, United Kingdom, Greece, Turkey, Ireland, Malta, Mauritania, South Sudan, Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Cameroun., Also speaking were Aman against discrimination, Amnesty International, Human Right Watch, International Commission of Jurists, World Organisation Against Torture, Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, Human Rights Solidarity Organization, Maat for Peace, Development and Human Rights Association, and Meezaan Center for Human Rights., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The Council will continue its general debate on technical assistance and capacity building at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 31 March., Interactive Dialogue on the Report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, The interactive dialogue on the report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission on Libya started in the morning meeting and a summary can be found here., Discussion, In the discussion on Libya, some speakers said there was a need to fight wide-spread impunity in the country, and urged the further extension of the mandate of the Mission beyond the already-extant extension of nine months. There was concern for the situation of migrants and refugees, in particular where they were victims of trafficking and cruel and unusual treatment, which should be fully investigated. All parties should cooperate with the Mission to ensure that the perpetrators were brought to justice. The international community should provide technical assistance and greater capacity building in order to strengthen all branches of the Libyan Government, particularly the judiciary. Respect for the letter and spirit of the peace agreement was paramount. Credible elections were vital, and they should be free, which was crucial for the stability in the country. Serious violations of international humanitarian law continued, including by armed groups, including against refugees and members of civil society who were targeted for their political or religious views, or because of their sexual orientation. Restrictions on media freedom were also an issue of concern., Genuine dialogue and cooperation were the basic pillars of the work of the Human Rights Council, and without them it would be impossible to move forward to promote and protect human rights. The conflict in Libya was due to hegemonistic policies by other countries. The efforts made by Libya to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights were appreciated, as was the adoption of social programmes to protect the most vulnerable. All cooperation and technical assistance requested by Libya must be provided. The right of Libyans to self-determination and to free and fair elections were basic rights that must be defended. Attacks and intimidation against the judiciary were very worrying in this regard. The situation could only be solved through political means, leading Libya towards a stable and peaceful future. The full participation by women in the process of national reconciliation was a basic requirement for this to take place. One speaker said there was no alternative to resolving the crisis comprehensively under United Nations auspices, through targeted work with the Libyan authorities and through multilateral support., Concluding Remarks, TRACY ROBINSON, Member of the Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, noted the wide support for the mandate and acknowledged the statement made by the Permanent Mission of Libya. This was an interim report and it reflected only a fraction of the ongoing investigation on Libya. She nevertheless pointed out many recommendations towards accountability and reconciliation, and others to the need for institutional building to address violations of international law and international humanitarian law. Regarding the questions on technical assistance, Ms. Robinson explained that the June report would be the final report. The current report outlined serious violations that were continuing. The stack of violations was growing, and the absence of institutions to respond to them was allowing for the scourge of impunity. The narrowing of the civic space had impacted the work of the Fact-Finding Mission, principally when it came to its access to witnesses and victims. To respond to the narrowing of the civic space, she suggested the immediate release of the detainees whose freedom of speech had been violated. On women’s participation, she noted with concern the reduced number of women in all spaces. The Mission continued to work towards the transition to democracy and peace., CHALOKA BEYANI, Member of the Fact-Finding Mission on Libya, expressed his deep appreciation to the Permanent Mission of Libya for the constructive statement at the beginning of the dialogue. Now was not the time to throw the baby out with the bath water; it was important to support the Mission to complete the fulfilment of its mandate. The international community could help support the law enforcement institutions in Libya; strengthen the judiciary; and support accountability mechanisms for international crimes. The Mission called for the exercise of universal jurisdiction to bring perpetrators to account by independent countries, especially in the context of mercenaries. He called for continuing support of the Mission so that it could complete both its thematic and geographic mandate. The Mission had covered eastern and western Libya but not southern Libya so far. It still needed to look at mass graves with forensic expertise. The Mission had identified ways in which the internal security forces arrested people arbitrarily, giving them no contact with the outside world. On technical assistance, Mr. Beyani explained that the mandate of the Mission had been issued under the technical assistance and capacity building item of the Council’s agenda. He commended the areas identified by the Permanent Mission of Libya such as an independent judiciary and transitional justice, among others. On the right of Libya to control its own bord er, he pointed out to the important studies of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and stated that the need to respect human rights at borders required technical support., Interactive Dialogue on the Oral Update of the High Commissioner on the Findings of the Periodic Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in Ukraine, Documentation, The Council has before it an oral update of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the findings of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in its periodic report (A/HRC/49/CRP.5) on the situation of human rights in Ukraine., Presentation of Report, MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, introducing the report, said the Council had received the report on Ukraine covering the period from 1 August 2021 to 31 January 2022 pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 47/22. As the context had dramatically shifted since then, her statement would focus on the human rights and humanitarian crisis that had unfolded since the Russian armed attack began on 24 February. For more than one month now, the entire population of Ukraine had been enduring a living nightmare. The lives of millions of people were in upheaval as they were forced to flee their homes or hide in basements and bomb shelters as their cities were pummelled and destroyed. The hostilities must stop, without delay. The Russian Federation should heed the clear and strong calls of the General Assembly and of this Council, and immediately act to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory., In the five weeks since the conflict began, the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine had recorded at least 1,189 deaths of civilian men, women and children and at least 1,901 injuries. The actual figures were likely to be far higher. The persistent use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas was of immense concern. These weapons included missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, and airstrikes, causing massive destruction of and damage to civilian objects. Homes and administrative buildings, hospitals and schools, water stations and electricity systems had not been spared., Indiscriminate attacks were prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes. The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicated that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution had not been sufficiently adhered to. Civilians were enduring immeasurable suffering, and the humanitarian crisis was critical. In many areas across the country, people urgently needed medical supplies, food, water, shelter and basic household items. Above all, they needed the bombs to cease, and the weapons to fall silent., Since the beginning of the invasion, Russian armed forces had carried out attacks and military strikes on and near large cities, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Sievierodonetsk, Sumy, and Mariupol, and the capital, Kyiv. Across Ukraine, the rights to life, liberty and security were under attack. Detention of civilians who were vocal about their pro-Ukrainian views in territories under control of Russian forces had become widespread. The Office had also received allegations of killings of two civilians considered to be affiliated with Russian armed forces or supporting pro-Russian views. There were reports of up to 350 conflict-related detentions by Ukrainian law enforcement officers, including four cases where the individuals’ relatives received no information regarding their formal arrest, place of detention or their fate. Freedom of expression was under threat. Independent, objective reporting of the facts on the ground was absolutely vital to counter the harmful spread of misinformation and propaganda. The devastating consequences of this war were being felt far outside Ukraine’s borders. Nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s population had been forced to flee - over 4 million people had fled the country since the attack began, and an estimated 6.5 million were internally displaced. It was encouraging to see the outpouring of support offered to refugees by Ukraine’s neighbours and other countries around the world. It was essential to extend such welcome to all who fled, without discrimination., Additionally, a rise in Russophobia had been observed in a number of countries.
As the war approached its sixth week, Ms. Bachelet reiterated her calls for States to respect and uphold international humanitarian and human rights law, and urged that humanitarian assistance be delivered safely and effectively. All civilians must be protected and those who wished to leave must be provided safe passage in the direction they chose. Prisoners of war must be treated with dignity and full respect for their rights. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine would continue its vital monitoring role. The terror and agony of the Ukrainian people was palpable and was being felt around the world. They wanted the war to stop, and to return to peace, safety and human dignity. It was long past time to heed their call, Ms. Bachelet concluded., Statement by the Country Concerned, Ukraine, speaking as the country concerned, said the update described in appalling details the horrors of Russia’s assault on Ukraine and the war crimes committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people. In only one month, the Russian aggression had already had a devastating toll on the human rights of the Ukrainian people. Acting on orders from the leadership, the Russian army used the most vicious methods with disregard for human life, launching hundreds of missiles on residential areas, killings thousands of innocent civilians, bombing hospitals and maternity wards, and targeting civilian infrastructure to deliberately deprive thousands to access basic needs. The besieged town of Mariupol had been levelled to the ground by Russian rockets and missiles, and nearly 160,000 civilians remained in blockade without water, heat, electricity or communications. The local authorities estimated that at least 5,000 had been killed there. Russian forces shelled cities and humanitarian corridors, forcing civilians to flee only to east territory or to Belarus, which could be considered forcible deportation. An estimated 40,000 Ukrainian citizens had been trafficked in this way., At least 144 Ukrainian children had been killed, and 220 injured, while 4.3 million children, more than half of the children of the country, had been displaced. In the last four weeks of the Human Rights Council session, the Russian Federation had been urged to immediately cease their attacks. Unfortunately, in blatant disregard and disrespect of the United Nations and the Human Rights Council, Russia had failed to implement any of the General Assembly or the Human Rights Council resolutions urging them to cease their aggression, put an end to human rights violations, and stop human suffering on the ground. The magnitude and viciousness of Russia’s crimes called for unified action of the international community to ensure accountability and bring the perpetrators to justice. It was hoped that the work of the Commission of Inquiry established by the Council would become an important element to ensure there was no impunity for Russia’s war criminals. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and its mission in Ukraine remained crucial to monitor the developments on the ground, providing regular and objective information on the human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, which was an attack on the norms and principles that formed the basis of international order with human rights as its key element. A State engaging in such gross and systematic violations of international law was not worthy of a seat on the Council. It was the duty of all to stand up against the aggression and ensure that such atrocities did not occur again anywhere in the world., Discussion, Speaking in the discussion on Ukraine, many speakers said they stood united with Ukraine, which was facing a large-scale unprovoked, unlawful and unjustified aggression by Russia, and enabled by Belarus. They admired the courage of the Ukrainian people defending their country. Russia should immediately cease the attacks and deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, especially using explosive weapons, such as cluster munitions, in residential areas, which were grave violations of international humanitarian law. Russia should immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its troops from the entire territory of Ukraine. The aggression was a gross violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter, and seriously undermined global peace, security and stability. Some speakers strongly condemned the involvement of Belarus in this aggression., Some speakers said Russia should fully abide by its obligations under international law, including the United Nations Charter, cease its aggression, withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine immediately and unconditionally, and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters. The level of destruction and the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine was devastating, as reported by the High Commissioner. There was no justification nor strategic or military significance of targeting civilians, including children. In this regard, it was important to compile comprehensive, verifiable and transparent records of all casualties. The attacks on civilians constituted war crimes and must stop., The issue of false information was also raised, with some speakers pointing out that there was no evidence of massacres of Russians in Ukraine, and it was not Ukraine shelling its own civilians. Speakers repeatedly asked the High Commissioner how the international community could help ensure accountability for the aggression. The brutal war of aggression was grossly violating the most fundamental tenets of international law and the core principles that underpinned the rules-based international order, and the United Nations Charter. It was, speakers said, the gravest assault on the very foundation of European and global stability and security in decades., The Council should not be used for different purposes than those for which it was established, a speaker said, pointing out that genuine dialogue and cooperation were the pillars of the work of the Council, and yet, such issues were being dealt with under inappropriate agenda items, fuelling the politicisation of the work of the body, thus not contributing in any way to the protection and promotion of human rights in the world, but instead reinforcing the bias, selectivity, politicisation and double standards that threatened the body. Another speaker was concerned by the massive violation of the Ukrainian military of human rights, as refugees trying to leave for Russia were targeted, and civilians were used as human shields. Atrocities against civilians were carried out by Ukrainians thanks to weaponry supplied by Western countries, and the Office of the High Commissioner should report and assess these events. The children of Ukraine demanded that the adults put an end to this war- and the adults should listen., Some speakers said that for long years the discussions on the situation in Ukraine had been politicised, and current events in Ukraine had resulted in the Council’s indifference to the issues reported by the Monitoring Mission of the Office of the High Commissioner. What was required now was a swift political settlement to the situation. Civilians were being held against their will in the combat zones, and the international community had hushed up these facts. The Ukrainian authorities refused to open a humanitarian corridor to Belarus to allow its citizens to return, and were discriminating against Belarussian truck drivers, among other Belarussian civilians in the country. Ukraine should live up to its commitments under the Hague Conventions. The responsibility of Western countries for moving lethal weapons and mercenaries to the conflict zone had to be recognised, as it would do nothing to bring peace. The struggle against Russophobia should begin right here in this room., Concluding Remarks, MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that Member States needed to continue to speak with one voice for a safe humanitarian corridor to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the evacuation of civilians. She noted that the United Nations was working with the parties on a cease fire and on delivering supplies. She recalled the appeal of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to support humanitarian partners to help the people in need. More support was needed. On the safety of human rights defenders and journalists, she referred to the figures highlighted in her report and explained that there were more details in the update on the human rights situation in Ukraine published by her office mission in Ukraine. The international community could strengthen the advocacy on the need to protect journalists and human rights defenders. The international community could also fund specialised protective equipment. Human rights defenders and the local civil society were at the forefront of supporting people in need and at risk of being left behind. Many had started providing assistance to vulnerable groups, as a result, there was a need for flexible fundings to help groups affected by the hostilities. The international community could further provide support for the evacuation of people with disability and in conflict affected areas., Ms. Bachelet noted the heightened risk of sexual violence and the difficulty for victims to report gender-based violence due to fear for retaliation and stigma. She remained committed to document human rights violations in Ukraine. It was critical to ensure awareness and the recollection of facts, which was why her Office was constantly assessing and adjusting to the evolving situation. Civil society was an important counterpart and source of information about human rights violations but she acknowledged they were operating under very difficult conditions to document violations. There was a need to support civil society actors. The High Commissioner encouraged Ukrainian grassroot defenders to coordinate with accountability mechanisms. Other organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation in Europe also had an important role to play. The conflict had repercussions for every region of the world with food, fuel, fertilizer prices skyrocketing and serious risk of instability. The suffering that was being witnessed in Ukraine was immense., Presentation of Reports under Agenda Item 10 on Technical Assistance and Capacity Building, Documentation, The Council also has before it the report (A/HRC/49/93) on the work of the Board of Trustees of the UN Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, The Council also has before it the report (A/HRC/49/92) of the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the Work of the Human Rights Council
Also before the Council is the report (A/HRC/49/99) of the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan and on the achievements of technical assistance in the field of human rights., Presentation of Reports, CHRISTIAN SALAZAR VOLKMANN, Director of the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting the report of the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, said the report provided an overview of the technical assistance conducted by the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner. The Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021 represented a watershed moment for Afghanistan and for the United Nations’ human rights work in the country. Before this date, the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan was engaged in several substantive areas of work, namely the protection of civilians in armed conflict; children and armed conflict; the elimination of violence against women and girls and the promotion of their rights; the prevention of torture and respect for procedural safeguards; and civic space and the integration of human rights into peace and reconciliation. Much of this cooperation was undertaken in partnership with the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. This Commission played a pivotal role for the human rights agenda of the country but was no longer functional., Since August 2021, technical cooperation activities had paused while the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner had focused on restoring systems for monitoring and reporting on human rights, including to this Council. Monitoring had shown a sharp reduction of conflict-related casualties although civilians remained at risk of attacks by the Islamic State Khorasan Province and others, as well as by unexploded ordonnance. At the same time, there was a large economic and humanitarian crisis unfolding with a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular, on economic and social rights. Today, one in three Afghans faced emergency or crisis levels of food insecurity. In this new context, the Human Rights Service of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner had sought to open lines of dialogue and engagement with the de facto authorities., This month, the High Commissioner had made a short visit to Kabul, where she met with the de facto Deputy Prime Minister and the de facto Minister of Interior. Based on this, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan would continue to engage with all stakeholders in the protection and promotion of human rights; monitoring, reporting and advocating for human rights; and providing technical advice to duty bearers on international human rights standards. Consequently, the Office of the High Commissioner’s technical cooperation in Afghanistan would now be reoriented according to the new mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the new situation in the country., CHRISTIAN SALAZAR VOLKMANN, Director of the Field Operations and Technical ooperation Division of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, presented an overview of the technical assistance and capacity building programme of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The overall aim of the Office’s technical cooperation was to support Governments and other partners to effectively protect and promote human rights. The activities of the 102 field presences worldwide were geared towards this goal, with support from the Trust Fund on Universal Periodic Review implementation, the Treaty-body Capacity Building Programme and the Regular Budget for Technical Cooperation. The Office contributed to the effectiveness of 54 national human rights institutions worldwide, in line with the Paris Principles. Young people should be at the centre of sustainable solutions for development and peace. Technical assistance on human rights was also instrumental in preventing crises., Mr. Volkmann listed the contributions of the Office’s technical cooperation to help governments and civil society address the impact of COVID-19. Last but not least, he introduced the Report of the Office on Operations of the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States in the Work of the Human Rights Council submitted pursuant to the Council resolution 34/40. The Trust Fund was allowed to provide numerous online induction courses on the rules and procedures of the Council prior to its regular sessions. To date, more than 6,300 persons had enrolled in the e-learning courses, including almost 2,500 women., AZITA BERAR-AWAD, Member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, presenting the report of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, said in 2021, the Fund - the second largest trust fund administered by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights – had continued providing increased financial support for technical cooperation in implementation of international human rights standards at the national level. The Board, which also constituted the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the implementation of the Universal Periodic Review, provided advice and guidance throughout the year, in regards to the use of these two Funds. During the fifty-second session, the Board provided advice in the context of the extension of the Office of the High Commissioner’s Organizational Management Plan 2022–2023. The Board discussed in particular, the unfolding implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the Office’s programmes and the adjustments needed., At its fifty-third session, the Board particularly welcomed the opportunity to assess on the ground the challenging political transition process in Chad and the
unprecedented opportunities for change that this process was unleashing. Debates in the Council under item 10 demonstrated every year the increased willingness from States to share challenges and positive experiences in overturning human rights issues. The Board was very pleased to observe how its principles for effective technical cooperation facilitated this. The Board welcomed the increase in voluntary contributions and in the expansion of requests from Member States. Technical support for the realisation of human rights was more relevant than ever, as countries moved ahead with pandemic recovery plans and efforts to bring back on track, investments towards the realisation of the 2030 Agenda. The current world situation called for strengthening predictable and sustained financial support to the Office of the High Commission and the programmes it supported at national and regional levels., Statement by Country Concerned, Afghanistan, speaking as a country concerned, said that when one read this report, which by all means was a careful and conservative portrayal of the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, one could not help but be dejected, heartbroken and enraged. Repressive measures included extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, crackdown on the media, and the recent indefinite ban announced by Taliban leaders preventing young girls’ access to education; they had turned life into an unbearable misery for the Afghan people. As the report indicated, it was clear that there were two Afghanistans: an Afghanistan before the 15 August takeover by the Taliban, and an Afghanistan after. Prior to 15 August, the country was by no means perfect, but it had been taking significant steps towards the promotion and protection of human rights held by all its citizens. Afghanistan had made significant improvements in mitigating civilian casualties, curbing torture, preventing the recruitment and use of children in armed services, and in ensuring women and girls could fully enjoy their civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. This progress and the aspiration of the people of Afghanistan for a better future had been a reality prior to 15 August., The Taliban had since completely reversed this progress, but this had not destroyed the hope and aspiration of the people. What the people of Afghanistan needed from the international community and from the Human Rights Council was a coordinated, coherent and focused support of the entire human rights system to organise and rally all available and potential resources to stop the deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan. In the face of empty words and broken promises given by the Doha-based Taliban leaders to the international community, the scope and speed of deterioration of the human rights situation in Afghanistan was much larger and faster than what was reported. Therefore, given the gravity of the situation, Afghanistan called the Council’s attention to its human rights community, which needed more attention and technical assistance and capacity building. Afghanistan’s human rights community included the human rights organizations and civil society institutions inside and outside the country working to promote and protect human rights despite all odds. These organizations needed targeted attention and support, especially until Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission was restored and a representative and inclusive government was formed., General Debate on Technical Assistance and Capacity Building, Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries said human rights were one of the raison d’être of the Community. The environmental crisis which was assailing all could not be ignored. The Community continued to encourage the implementation of various training and technical assistance activities with its Member States, and would continue cooperation with the United Nations through training and technical assistance activities. The Community helped its Member States to establish human rights institutions., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/03/conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-mme-bachelet-appelle-la-federation, Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, The Russian Federation launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In 5 weeks, a quarter of the population of Ukraine have been forced to flee their homes. As of today, more than 4 million refugees have fled Ukraine, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II. A further 6.5 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine., Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., Many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of lifesaving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. We continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with lifesaving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys., UNHCR continues to call for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, respect for international humanitarian law, and for neighbouring countries to continue keeping their borders open to those fleeing., Key figures - UKRAINE, 65,500 people reached with essential food and non-food items, 22,500 people received protection assistance at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 11,862 families with damaged homes received emergency shelter assistance, 8,913 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance and first payments initiated, 8,100 people received assistance through three convoys to hardest-hit areas, 73 reception and collective centres equipped with essential items to increase capacity, UKRAINE SITUATION UPDATE, As of March 26, the number of civilian casualties recorded by OHCHR had reached 2,909, including 1,119 persons killed and 1,709 injured. The number of those killed includes at least 99 children. Hundreds of thousands more people remain trapped in areas which are heavily impacted by fighting and shelling., The situation in both Mariupol and Chernihiv remains dire.Efforts are ongoing to establish humanitarian access, but these efforts have been unsuccessful to date. Some 90 per cent of Mariupol’s residential buildings have been affected by active fighting, with some 40 per cent completely destroyed. Authorities in Mariupol estimate that 300 people were killed in the 16 March shelling of a theatre in the city., Chernihiv remains under heavy bombardment and is effectively encircled, impeding the evacuation of civilians, including those with severe injuries, as well as the delivery of aid. An estimated 130,000 people remain trapped in the citywithout access to electricity, heating or water., Avdiivka, Marinka, Mariupol, Lysychansk, Popasna, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk and Zolote remain among the areas most heavily impacted by shelling, including of civilian infrastructure, in eastern Ukraine. Despite this, some evacuations continue. More than 1,400 people were evacuated from Luhansk Oblast from 24-27 March. However, more than 100,000 families remain without electricity, with 40,000 families without a gas supply in the region., Indiscriminate airstrikes hitting civilians and civilian infrastructure continue. As of last week the World Health Organisation reported some 65 attacks on health care facilities resulting in injuries and fatalities. The Ukraine Ministry for Education and Science reported that some 550 education facilities had been damaged or destroyed., The latest Global Protection Cluster ‘Protection Snapshot’ (17 - 26 March) is available here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-6-30-march-2022

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, In Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), local authorities say more than 90 per cent of all hospitals and schools in the city have been damaged, while 40 per cent of them have been completely destroyed., On 29 March, an airstrike demolished half of the Mykolaivska oblast administration building (Mykolaiv, Mykolaivska oblast, south), reportedly leaving at least 15 people dead and more than 35 others injured, figures likely to rise as search-and-rescue efforts are still ongoing., The World Food Programme (WFP) and its implementing partners have reached one million people with cash and food assistance in Ukraine and plan to reach around 2.5 million people in April 2022, aiming to further scale up its response to reach 6 million by the end of June., The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) delivered 13 metric tons of reproductive health supplies, medicines and equipment to health facilities in Dnipro (Dnipropetrovska oblast, centre), Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast, east), Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north) and Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east) to help health service providers meet the differentiated needs of women., Health partners have already delivered more than 180 tons of medical supplies to Ukraine, with another 470 tons on the way. The Health Cluster continues to scale up operations, coordinating with more than 80 international and national partners already on the ground or planning activities to address the health needs of around 6 million people., SITUATION OVERVIEW, General humanitarian situation. As of 29 March, the civilian toll of the ongoing military offensive stands at 3,090 – including 1,189 killed – according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts in the east, civilian casualties are highest in Government-controlled areas (GCA), with OHCHR reporting 1,055 casualties – including 328 killed and 727 injured – compared to 308 civilian casualties in the nonGovernment-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (65 killed and 243 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 1,727 civilian casualties., As of 30 March, around 10.5 million people – more than a quarter of the Ukrainian population – have been forcibly displaced by the ongoing military offensive, including nearly 6.5 million internally displaced and more than 4 million displaced across international borders – including 204,000 third-country nationals. Over 2.3 million people are seeking refuge in Poland alone. In a context of increasing displacement, people on the move (a majority being women and children) face growing risks of sexual exploitation and abuse, gender-based violence (GBV) and human trafficking. Between 24 February and 16 March, International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that out of more than 2,435 calls received through the Migrant Advice and Anti-Trafficking hotline, nearly 60 per cent of callers (61 per cent of whom were women) sought information on safe travel routes and anti-human trafficking measures., As of 30 March, World Health Organization (WHO) registered 82 confirmed attacks2 on health care that have led to 72 deaths and 43 injuries. According to WHO, so far in 2022 more than 62 per cent of all attacks on health care worldwide have occurred in Ukraine, including more than 86 per cent of all health attack-related deaths across the globe. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science says that 698 educational institutions have been damaged and another 75 completely destroyed to date. According to the Energy Ministry of Ukraine, as of 29 March, more than 831,000 users in over 1,490 settlements across Ukraine remain without electricity, while supply has been restored to more than 150,400 in Kyiv (82,000) and Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska (south), Kyivska, Mykolaivska, Sumska (north-east), Zaporizka and Zhytomyrska (north) oblasts., As ongoing fighting approaches its fifth week, the most intense hostilities continue to be reported in GCA of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, while airstrikes increasingly target strategic fuel stocks and industrial facilities, including for the first time in Khmelnytska oblast (west) on 29 March, when an airstrike destroyed the fuel depot at the town’s airport., Eastern Ukraine remains the biggest concern as growing levels of needs become increasingly more difficult to address amid persistent access, logistics and security constraints. In Donetska oblast (NGCA), two civilians were reportedly killed in Donetsk and Staromykhailivka, while 33 others, including two children, were injured in Donetsk, Manhus and Nikolske, as well as in the city of Mariupol on 28 March. According to local sources, nearly 30 homes and multi-storey buildings were damaged, mainly in Donetsk and Horlivka. The next day, on 29 March, one civilian was reportedly killed in Horlivka and 16 civilians, including one child, were injured in Donetsk, Horlivka, Pavlivka and Staryi Krym (NGCA), as well as in the city of Mariupol. In addition, in Donetska oblast (GCA), two civilian casualties were reported in Kurdiumivka and Novoselivka.
Considering that Mariupol remains encircled, and civilians have been evacuating towards both GCA and NGCA, some earlier reports on the number of civilian casualties have been confirmed, while the opportunities to confirm casualties reported most recently are limited., In neighbouring Luhanska oblast (GCA), two civilians were reportedly killed and 14 injured, including a family of four with two children, amid relentless shelling in Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk and Shchedryshcheve on 28-29 March.
On 29 March, shelling reportedly left the town of Sievierodonetsk – home to more than 106,500 people – without electricity as the 110kV transmission feeding the city was damaged, which, in turn, shut down pumping stations and the centralized water supply. According to oblast authorities, the damage interrupted power supplies for more than 30,430 users in Sievierodonetsk, adding that nearly 121,020 users have no electricity across the oblast. A high-pressure gas pipeline was damaged in nearby Lysychansk, interrupting the gas supply for around 35,000 users in Bilohorivka, Lysychansk,
Novodruzhesk, Pryvillia, Shypylivka and Zolotarivka. On 29-30 March, amid intense hostilities and constant explosions, the oblast administration reported that forest fires are scorching large swaths of land in Aidar, Mykolaivka, Kreminna,
Lysychansk, Tsarivka and Zolote-1., Mariupol. The humanitarian situation in Mariupol remains dire. Needs continue to accumulate and safe corridors for aid to be delivered and people to be safely evacuated from the encircled city are needed. The approximately 160,000 people that remain in the conflict-ravaged city have been left without water, food, electricity, gas, heat and communications. On 28 March, the Mayor of Mariupol Vadym Boychenko says that all remaining inhabitants of Mariupol must be immediately evacuated to prevent further human suffering and the preventable loss of life as the city’s humanitarian crisis deepens. On 29 March, the Ukrainian Ombudsperson reported that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) facility in Mariupol was hit by airstrikes and artillery fire despite being marked with a red cross on a white background easily visible on the roof of the building. At the time of writing, however, this has yet to be confirmed by ICRC., The level of destruction to civilian infrastructure in Mariupol is rising, leaving a long and extremely costly road to reconstruction that will likely prevent displaced people from returning to their communities. According to local authorities, around 2,340 homes have been damaged, of which 1,040 have been completely destroyed, leaving scores of people in desperate need of immediate relocation and durable shelter solutions in safe places. Along with the housing sector, education and health have borne the brunt of relentless fighting in Mariupol. More than 90 per cent of all hospitals and schools in the city have been damaged, while 40 per cent of them have been completely destroyed, severely restricting access to education and health care. In the latter case, limited access will prevent people with trauma-related injuries from getting the life-saving assistance they desperately need and put people with chronic illnesses at greater risk of experiencing a significant deterioration in their condition., Southern Ukraine. Early on 29 March, authorities in Mykolaivska oblast reported that an airstrike hit the oblast administration building in Mykolaiv – a strategic port city under heavy attack for weeks – destroying half of the nine-storey building, according to local authorities. At least 15 people were reportedly killed and more than 35 others injured, figures likely to rise in the coming hours as search-and-rescue crews pull people from the rubble., In Zhytomyrska oblast, authorities say the oblast has quickly become a transitional hub for displaced people fleeing surrounding areas devastated by ongoing fighting, like Mariupol, currently hosting almost 35,000 displaced people. The oblast continues to receive and deliver humanitarian aid to the hardest-hit communities within the oblast and others in northern Ukraine, like Kyivska and Zhytomyrska. Still, the growing number of displaced people moving through the oblast continues to put increasing pressure on already-stretched response capacities., Civilian evacuations. On 28 March, despite no official evacuation corridors being agreed to by both sides, the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine reports that around 900 people were evacuated from some of the hardest-hit areas, including approximately 880 people from Mariupol, who fled the encircled city for neighbouring Berdiansk (Zaporizka oblast). The following day, on 29 March, around 1,665 people were evacuated through three agreed-upon humanitarian corridors, including 936 people from Mariupol and 729 residents of Zaporizka oblast, who reached the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to the Ministry for Reintegration of Ukraine. In addition to recognized evacuation corridors, Luhanska oblast authorities report that around 500 people evacuated from various locations, including from Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk. Meanwhile, on 29 March, the Russian Federation reported that around 20,495 people, including nearly 3,385 children, were evacuated from affected areas to the Russian Federation. In total, the Russian Federation reports that 509,425 people, including more than 104,805 children, have crossed into the Russian Federation from Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-30-march-2022
Aid valuing 10m EUR has already been sent to victims of war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,PIN,"Food and Nutrition

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Mar 2022,"To date, donors have sent 63 million EUR to People in Need’s Ukraine emergency appeal fund, 10 million of which has already been spent on aid to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the invasion in February, we have managed to send 10 trains and 20 trucks to Ukraine, providing over 5,300 pallets full of humanitarian aid. We were one of the first organizations to begin delivering regular humanitarian aid to the eastern part of the country, where fierce fighting continues to this day. We’ve also managed to deliver 40 tons of humanitarian aid to victims in the besieged town of Sumy in the first UN convoy and last month. Today, we have over 100 staff on the ground in affected areas., We are sending aid by car and by train, AID WORTH 6 MILLION EURO, Thanks to the generosity of ordinary Czech citizens and companies who have graciously donated to the Ukraine emergency appeal, all the trains we send are full of humanitarian material totaling 6 million EUR. Despite the ongoing fighting, we manage to deliver humanitarian aid from the Czech Republic both by car and by train. As of March 29th, 10 trains have arrived in Ukraine containing hygiene supplies, non-perishable nourishment, baby food, mattresses, disinfectant sprays, sleeping bags and other essential items. Trains with material aid either head to Kyiv or to Dnipro, from where they continue on to other affected areas., ""We have a huge sense of responsibility now. Not only to our donors, but to other organizations because we feel that we are paving the way for how things should be handled in Ukraine, for example, in terms of the transportation of humanitarian aid,"" says Šimon Pánek, director of People in Need., From Dnipro, humanitarian aid is then distributed by local partner organizations, such as R2P. People from these organization load the aid into vans that then transport it even further to other towns and cities, like Kharkiv or Zaporozhye, or entire regions like Donetsk and Luhansk. We also support deliveries made by smaller local volunteers to even more remote villages or parts of the country., Due to the ongoing fighting, water storage has been a major challenge for those in the east of Ukraine. For this reason, we have already transported 20 trucks full of aid (largely consisting of 50,000+ jerry cans and water containers, totaling approximately 600,000 EUR) to Lviv and cities further east., We distribute material and financial aid to equip collective centers, AID WORTH 1.44 MILLION EURO, We support collective centers in the west which house people seeking refuge and fleeing the fighting in other parts of the country. These centers need a lot of support because they have often been neglected for several years prior to the invasion and are not fully equipped to accommodate such large numbers of people. According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), more than 2.5 million IDPs have fled to western Ukraine because of the invasion. For this reason, it is no wonder that these collective centers are under enormous strain and require large amounts of material aid. As a result, we are working hard to get these internal refugee centers ready with basic accommodation items, such as kitchen appliances, bedding, and mattresses. Last week, we helped equip two more collective centers in the country and this week five more IDP centers will open and need to receive materials., In the eastern part of the country, we focus on the distribution of food, water, and other hygiene supplies. In areas where the water infrastructure has been almost entirely destroyed, we deliver fresh water. We distribute this water in six-liter bottles to local people on the ground and we recently delivered two trucks full of potable water to war-affected areas in the Donetsk region. We regularly bring clean water in cisterns to various villages around the country and when we can, we also equip those areas with their own water tanks so that people have a place to store it., In the Donetsk region, we also distribute cash to 981 of the most vulnerable people who require help purchasing necessary items. Each person can receive up to 2,200 UAH (68 euros) over three months. We will continue to offer this kind support in the coming months, as well., Supporting local organizations in Ukraine, Since the invasion in February, we have financially supported 90 smaller NGOs inside Ukraine that are helping local people on the ground. We have provided 1 million EUR to these organizations, so far. They buy and distributing food kits, water, baby food and equipment for bomb shelters. We are also financially supporting organizations that equip collective centers for IDPs., PIN works to support Ukrainian civil society and an independent media that focuses on human rights violations, physical protection, online safety, and accurate reporting of the events occurring in Ukraine. We also support our long-term partners who are operating in other countries and who, like us, are helping Ukrainian activists and refugees.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/aid-valuing-10m-eur-has-already-been-sent-victims-war-ukraine
Safeguarding inclusivity in times of war: Mykola’s story,News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2022,"Mykola Nadulichnyi, the founder of the NGO Luhansk Association of Organizations of People with Disabilities, was already a committed advocate for inclusivity in Ukraine society when war came to his country., In February, with the armed attacks escalating, Mykola and many of his colleagues abandoned their homes in Sievierodonetsk, in the eastern Luhansk Oblast, and made the 1,300-kilometre trek to the western city of Lviv, close to the Polish border., “We stopped in Lviv district and understood we could not sit on our hands, that people in the east were starving”, says Mykola. “They needed support. So, we decided to shift to humanitarian help.”, “Every day we send trucks of food and essential materials people need,” Mykola said. “In the past three weeks, our Association delivered 60 tonnes of humanitarian assistance to Kharkiv, Sievierodonetsk and Kramatorsk – much of it done with UNDP support in partnership with the European Union.”, See more on Exposure",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/safeguarding-inclusivity-times-war-mykola-s-story

Medical Teams International Expands Ukraine Response to Provide Medical Care to Refugees and the Internally Displaced,News and Press Release,MTI,Health,22 Mar 2022,"(PORTLAND, OR) March 22, 2022 – As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to cause mass migration, loss of life, and destruction, Medical Teams International is expanding its response to provide needed supplies and medical care to refugees crossing into Moldova and to the injured and ill within Ukraine., The global health and humanitarian organization has developed a three-part strategy to drive its growing response, based on needs identified by its assessment team in the region.

As the context has dramatically shifted since then, my statement today will focus on the human rights and humanitarian crisis that has unfolded since the Russian armed attack began on 24 February., For more than one month now, the entire population of Ukraine has been enduring a living nightmare. The lives of millions of people are in upheaval as they are forced to flee their homes or hide in basements and bomb shelters as their cities are pummeled and destroyed., I echo the Secretary-General’s words that “continuing the war in Ukraine is morally unacceptable, politically indefensible and militarily nonsensical.”, The hostilities must stop, without delay. Today, I call on the Russian Federation to heed the clear and strong calls of the General Assembly and of this Council, and immediately act to withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory., Excellencies,, In the five weeks since the conflict began, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has recorded at least 1,189 deaths of civilian men, women and children and at least 1,901 injuries. We know the actual figures are likely far higher. In many places of intensive hostilities, such as Mariupol and Volnovakha, it is very challenging to obtain a comprehensive picture., The persistent use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas is of immense concern. These weapons include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, and airstrikes, causing massive destruction of and damage to civilian objects. In addition, my Office has received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. We are also investigating allegations that Ukrainian armed forces have used such weapons., Homes and administrative buildings, hospitals and schools, water stations and electricity systems have not been spared. To date we have verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities were damaged to various degrees, including 50 hospitals, 7 psycho-neurological facilities and 20 other medical facilities. Overall, 55 medical establishments were damaged, 10 destroyed, and two were looted. Actual numbers are again likely to be considerably higher, and reports of additional incidents are being corroborated by the Human Rights Monitoring Mission., Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes. The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to., Civilians are enduring immeasurable suffering, and the humanitarian crisis is critical. In many areas across the country, people urgently need medical supplies, food, water, shelter and basic household items., Above all, they need the bombs to cease, and the weapons to fall silent., In several besieged cities, my Office has noted a significant increase in mortality rates among civilians that can be attributed to disrupted medical care coupled with conflict-related deprivation and stress., As one woman from Kyiv told my colleagues: “I cannot imagine the situation of people with diabetes, or those undergoing cancer treatment, for whom it is critical to regularly take medications.”, People with disabilities and older people face a particularly appalling humanitarian situation. Long-term care facilities are suffering a lack of food, heating, electricity, water and medication. Many residents who have chronic health conditions rely on others for care and are struggling to access bomb shelters or safe areas. At least one facility for bedridden patients and other people with disabilities, mostly older people, came under fire while its residents were inside, with dozens of alleged casualties. My colleagues in Ukraine are working to establish the fate and whereabouts of survivors. Moreover, displaced people with disabilities, now staying at poorly equipped temporary facilities, often lack access to health care and rehabilitation services., Excellencies,, Since the beginning of the invasion, Russian armed forces have carried out attacks and military strikes on and near large cities, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Sievierodonetsk, Sumy, and Mariupol, and the capital, Kyiv., In the besieged city of Mariupol, people are living in sheer terror. The situation is worsening by the day, with constant shelling, fighting in the streets and people struggling to survive with the bare minimum of life’s necessities including food, water and medical supplies., We are looking into allegations that some Mariupol residents have been forcibly evacuated, either to territory controlled by Russian-affiliated armed groups or to the Russian Federation., Across Ukraine, the rights to life, liberty and security are under attack. Detention of civilians who are vocal about their pro-Ukrainian views in territories under control of Russian forces has become widespread. My Office has also received allegations of killings of two civilians considered to be affiliated with Russian armed forces or supporting pro-Russian views. There are reports of up to 350 conflict-related detentions by Ukrainian law enforcement officers including four cases where the individuals’ relatives received no information regarding their formal arrest, place of detention or their fate. Furthermore, I am very concerned by the abundance of videos available through open sources depicting interrogations of prisoners of war that have been taken by both Ukrainian and Russian forces., We have also received some allegations of conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, and have been working to corroborate them., Additionally, freedom of expression is under threat. Every day, many journalists are courageously fighting a crucial battle against mounting misinformation and propaganda, often putting their own lives at great risk. Seven journalists and media workers have been killed since hostilities began, and another 15 have come under armed attack, nine of whom were injured. We have also documented the arbitrary detention and the possible enforced disappearance of 22 journalists and civil society activists who have been vocal against the invasion in Kyiv, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions., I underscore that independent, objective reporting of the facts on the ground is absolutely vital to counter the harmful spread of misinformation and propaganda., Excellencies,, The devastating consequences of this war are being felt far outside Ukraine’s borders., Nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s population have been forced to flee - over 4 million people have fled the country since the attack began, and an estimated 6.5 million are internally displaced., It is encouraging to see the outpouring of support offered to refugees by Ukraine’s neighbours and other countries around the world. I reiterate that it is essential to extend such welcome to all who have fled, without discrimination. I also urge destination countries to provide particular protection to women and children, many of whom face risks of human trafficking, including sexual and labour exploitation., Additionally, a rise in Russophobia has been observed in a number of countries. My Office continues to monitor this closely., As the war approaches its sixth week, I reiterate my calls for States to respect and uphold international humanitarian and human rights law. I urge humanitarian assistance to be delivered safely and effectively. All civilians must be protected and those who wish to leave must be provided safe passage in the direction they choose. And prisoners of war must be treated with dignity and full respect for their rights., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine will continue its vital monitoring role. Despite the very difficult security context, staff in various parts of the country continue to document civilian casualties, the impact of hostilities and violations of human rights. I take this opportunity to thank all who are working to assist the people of Ukraine., Every day, my colleagues are listening to the heartbreaking stories of Ukrainians whose lives have been shattered by these brutal attacks. Just last week, they asked a simple question to a displaced man from a town in eastern Ukraine – “where are you from?” His reply: “I am from Izium, a city that no longer exists.”, The terror and agony of the Ukrainian people is palpable and is being felt around the world. They want the war to stop, and to return to peace, safety and human dignity., It is long past time to heed their call., Thank you",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-human-rights-council-ukraine-49th-session-human-rights-council-item-10-oral

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 29 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,30 Mar 2022,"Date: 30 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 29 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 3,090 civilian casualties in the country: 1,189 killed and 1,901 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 30 March (local time), 145 children had been killed and 222 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-29-march-2022-enruuk

WFP reaches one million people with life-saving food support in conflict-stricken Ukraine,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,30 Mar 2022,"LVIV – One month into the conflict in Ukraine, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is providing emergency food assistance to one million people in the country and has built systems able to deliver food at scale to communities in need. Trucks, trains and mini vans are today delivering food supplies to the most vulnerable people across the country and more convoys are expected in coming days., Following a massive scale-up of operations, WFP has provided 330,000 loaves of freshly baked bread to families in the city of Kharkiv, cash assistance to displaced people in Lviv and ready-to-eat food in various parts of the country; WFP emergency food supplies have also made it to the conflict areas of Sumy and Kharkiv through two interagency humanitarian convoys. These achievements come despite a volatile security situation, difficulties finding partners on the ground and the challenges of serving a population on the move., “Just one month ago, we had no presence on the ground, no staff, no network of suppliers or partners. To build an operation from the ground up and get food to one million people seemed a monumental challenge,” said Jakob Kern, WFP’s emergency coordinator for Ukraine. “Now that the structures are in place, we need the funding to keep delivering assistance, and to help 3 million people in need.”, Over 6.5 million people are displaced inside Ukraine and the pre-conflict supply chain systems for feeding the country’s population have broken down. According to the preliminary findings of a remote assessment by WFP, food is among the top three concerns for people inside Ukraine, along with safety and fuel for transportation., WFP estimates that 45 percent of the population are worried about finding enough to eat. In a country which used to grow food for 400 million people around the world, one person in five now reports having to reduce the size and number of their meals while adults skip meals so their children can eat. Close to 4 million people -- mainly women and children – have fled the conflict and become refugees in neighbouring countries., “We’re talking about a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe, WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the United Nations Security Council in a briefing on Tuesday. “We would have never dreamed anything like this would be possible. And it’s not just decimating Ukraine and the region. It will have a global impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War II.”, The conflict in Ukraine is triggering a wave of collateral hunger elsewhere in the world. Global food prices have increased sharply since the onset of the conflict – reaching an all-time high in February 2022.These hikes will affect local food prices and further limit access to food for millions of people who are already under stress because of food inflation in their countries., “The consequences of the conflict are radiating outwards,” said WFP Regional Director Corinne Fleischer. “Higher prices mean more people around the world will fall into hunger. At the same time, we at WFP also have to pay more for the food we buy, so our operations to help those people also take a hit. We need the world to step up at this critical time.”, WFP requires $590 million to assist 3.1 million crisis-affected people and IDPs on the move inside Ukraine with in-kind and cash distributions, as well as refugees and asylum seekers from Ukraine in neighbouring countries for the next three months., For more information please contact (email address: firstname.lastname@wfp.org):, Ljubica Vujadinovic, Krakow,

A mine action response to Ukraine,News and Press Release,MAG,Mine Action,30 Mar 2022,"Greg Crowther, Director of Programmes, MAG - March 30, 2022, The war in Ukraine has seen the use of ground and aerial weapons on a scale not seen in Europe for decades, causing immense devastation and human suffering.

Kherson, Zhytomyr regions. On 26 March, two powerful explosions were reported in Lviv after missiles hit a fuel depot and a power plant. In Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk oblast), shelling reportedly set fire to two food warehouses, three multi-story residential buildings, and several homes. OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 28 March, there have been 2,975 civilian casualties, including 1,151 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source:
OCHA)., Over the past few days, several fires have been reported in the areas surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exclusion zone. According to Ukrainian Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova, the fires have affected over 10,000 hectares of forests and resulted in increased levels of radioactive air pollution. The presence of Russian Federation forces may limit the ability of local emergency crews to contain future fires.
The unfolding situation in Mariupol (Donetsk oblast) is dire., Unlike other severely impacted cities, which can be reached through commercial transport routes, humanitarian actors have been unable to move life-saving humanitarian aid into Mariupol, as access and security constraints have prevented aid convoys from entering the city for over a month. Local authorities predict that approximately 160,000 people remain largely without access to basic goods and services, such as adequate food, drinking water, and electricity, while about 90 per cent of the city’s residential homes have been impacted by continued shelling. City officials have also reported cases of forced evacuation of residents to Russian Federation territories., The increasing intensity of the war has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 28 March, over 3.82 million refugees have fled Ukraine, while nearly 13,640 people were evacuated through agreed-upon humanitarian corridors between 25 and 27 March. While there were no corridors operating on 28 March, on 29 March,
Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister announced that there would be three humanitarian corridors operating, including one from Mariupol.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-11-25-29-march-2022

Humanitarian assistance to six million Ukrainians,News and Press Release,Govt. Finland,"Contributions
Health",30 Mar 2022,"The humanitarian situation in Ukraine worsens day by day. According to UN estimates, more than six million people are now in need of humanitarian assistance. Riikka Mikkola, Senior Adviser at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, answers questions on Finland’s assistance., How is the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, Riikka Mikkola, Senior Adviser for Humanitarian Assistance?, “The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ,UNCHR estimates that some 10 million people have been forced to leave their homes since the war started, and about 4 million of them have sought asylum outside Ukraine. Around 4.3 million children have been displaced, accounting for more than half of all children in Ukraine., “It is estimated that as many as twelve million people will need humanitarian assistance in the near future., “Civilians caught up in the midst of fighting are in the most vulnerable situation. With limited access to basic goods and services, one particular cause for concern is the approximately 80,000 women due to give birth within the next three months., “As the situation becomes protracted, people fleeing will be in greater distress and more heavily reliant on external assistance. In addition, the risk of exploitation and human trafficking increases. It is unfortunately very likely that the number of such cases will rise.”, What kind of humanitarian assistance does Finland give?, “Finland channels its funds through UN agencies and the International Red Cross movement. We do not have any assistance projects of our own. The Finnish Red Cross has a reserve of emergency supplies, and it receives funding from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs so that it can use and replenish its supplies when and where required., “So far, Finland has directed EUR 8.2 million of humanitarian funding to Ukraine via the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)., “In addition, Finland grants annual core funding to other organisations operating in Ukraine. For example, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), has disbursed funding to Ukraine. Finland is among its ten largest donors. Flexible core funding has enabled organisations to react quickly to the situation.”, What has been done with Finland’s humanitarian funding?, “Those who have fled their homes receive help from the UNCHR both in Ukraine and in its neighbouring countries. Finland’s funding has been used to support internally displaced people in Ukraine with cash assistance and relief items. It has also been used to provide child protection services and psychosocial support., “ICRC has delivered medicines and other supplies to hospitals in Mariupol, Odessa and Kyiv and to mobile clinics operating across Ukraine. It has also provided children with mental health services and psychosocial services. Explosive remnants of war are a major problem and a security threat in Ukraine. ICRC has sent in experts to clear contaminated areas and secure evacuation routes., “The premises for the provision of assistance is that persons in the most vulnerable situation and to those who need support the most are prioritised. Finland emphasises the importance of respecting the rights of women, girls and persons with disabilities also in humanitarian crises. We have reminded actors that the potential specific needs of persons with disabilities must be taken into account in Ukraine’s case, too.”, Is aid reaching its destination?, “Fighting means that it is difficult to get assistance to and people out of certain areas in Ukraine. Sporadic fighting and attacks on infrastructure hinder deliveries of humanitarian assistance even outside the worst war zones, and in practise problems are encountered almost everywhere in Ukraine. Advocating for the safe and impartial delivery of humanitarian assistance and on respect for the principles of international humanitarian law has been challenging but the negotiations with the parties to the conflict remains active. In addition, sanctions make it more difficult to deliver aid to Eastern Ukraine., “The difficulties in delivering aid aggravate humanitarian needs. Organisations must be able to trust that all parties to the conflict respect international humanitarian law and that their actions do not prevent humanitarian access. At the moment, safe delivery of aid is not possible everywhere in Ukraine. Organisations are responsible for their employees, and they cannot take excessive risks.”, Ukrainians are seeking asylum in neighbouring countries. Are these countries receiving any support to help those who have fled Ukraine?, “Nearly all of Ukraine’s neighbouring countries have requested assistance to be better able to address the needs of Ukrainian refugees. Many UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations have started or are in the process of starting their activities in Ukraine’s neighbouring areas., As many of Ukraine’s neighbours are Member States of the European Union, the support they receive is different from many other crises. The European Commission has a Solidarity Platform for examining support needs in Member States following the crisis and for seeking solutions to them. One potential option is to facilitate the movement of persons enjoying temporary protection from one Member State to another. Moreover, the European Commission has the opportunity to help EU Member States financially in their response to the crisis., Of Ukraine’s neighbours, Moldova is on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) list of countries that may be granted humanitarian assistance from development cooperation funds. The European Commission granted Moldova EUR 5 million in humanitarian funding already in the early stages of the crisis., There is a broader discussion going on about other ways to help Ukraine’s neighbouring countries in the current situation besides through humanitarian action.”, Milma Kettunen, Unit for Communications on Sustainable Development and Trade",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-assistance-six-million-ukrainians
Humanitarian assistance to Ukraine – how will it be used?,News and Press Release,Govt. Norway,"Contributions
Health",24 Mar 2022,"Norway has allocated NOK 2 billion to humanitarian efforts and assistance to refugees in connection with the crisis in Ukraine. Approximately NOK 1 billion has already been disbursed., ‘Russia’s attack is having a severe impact on Ukraine’s people and neighbouring countries. The war has led to the largest refugee flows in Europe since the Second World War. People’s hopes for the future have been shattered and vast urban areas have been reduced to rubble. We stand in solidarity and will do what we can to help,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt., Over 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring countries, and the UN estimates that more than 6.5 million people are internally displaced in Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities, the UN and humanitarian organisations report that there is a huge need for basic emergency relief such as food, water and medicines, in addition to protection., The Government quickly decided to provide NOK 2 billion in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. So far, approximately NOK 1 billion has been disbursed. Support is being channelled through established humanitarian organisations that have the capacity to respond rapidly. It will help to save lives and alleviate suffering. The humanitarian organisations are working under extremely difficult conditions and at great risk to themselves. It is proving difficult to assess where the needs are most acute and reach those who are most in need of help., So far, disbursements include NOK 350 million to support the work of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NOK 250 million to support the UN Refugee Agency’s efforts to help refugees in neighbouring countries. NOK 144 million has been channelled through Norwegian humanitarian organisations. Norway is also providing support to UN emergency relief efforts in Ukraine. To date, Norway has contributed material assistance and medical supplies worth NOK 100 million through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM)., Enormous need in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, At a meeting on Wednesday 23 March, representatives of Norwegian humanitarian organisations informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about their efforts in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The organisations all expressed their concern for the people who remain in Ukraine. At the same time, it is clear that there will be a significant increase in the number of people fleeing the country if the hostilities continue. The need for humanitarian assistance is enormous and continues to grow., A number of Norwegian organisations have been working in Ukraine for a long time and already had operations in place in eastern Ukraine. With support from Norway, these organisations are expanding their operations to other parts of the country under extremely difficult working conditions., ‘The humanitarian organisations have reported that there is a huge need for basic emergency relief, such as food, water and shelter. There is also a widespread need for medical help. I am very concerned by reports of inadequate humanitarian access to areas under Russian control. I greatly appreciate the outstanding efforts being carried out by the humanitarian organisations,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., Norway has provided support for large deliveries of medical supplies and equipment to Ukraine, both from the national stockpile and through humanitarian partner organisations. Help is getting through. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has delivered 200 tonnes of emergency supplies, including medicines. Both the Norwegian Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières are providing lifesaving medical assistance to people in need., In parts of Ukraine and its neighbouring countries, where the economy is less disrupted and there is adequate access to basic goods, cash assistance is an effective means of providing humanitarian aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, along with the UN, are providing cash support in these areas. This enables the recipients to decide for themselves what they need the most, and at the same time increases demand in local markets., Helping vulnerable people, Ten million people have been displaced, including many children and other vulnerable people. The situation is unpredictable, with many different actors involved in the relief efforts. This heightens the risk of exploitation and human trafficking. Save the Children Norway, Norwegian Church Aid and Caritas are among the organisations that are focusing greater attention on preventing exploitation of displaced people., Humanitarian assistance is provided on the basis of the humanitarian principles, with the aim of saving lives and alleviating suffering. Assistance is to be provided on the basis of need alone. It is vital to ensure compliance with these principles, especially in an ongoing conflict, to enable organisations to uphold their neutrality and impartiality. A number of organisations have pointed out that the humanitarian principles are under increasing pressure., Norway provides substantial support for UN efforts in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The UN system plays an important role in coordinating efforts between humanitarian organisations. According to the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, humanitarian organisations have so far provided food and cash assistance to 1.3 million displaced people. Since the start of the conflict, the World Food Programme has provided food and cash assistance to more than half a million people in Ukraine., In addition to providing financial support to Norwegian humanitarian organisations and the UN, Norway has contributed material assistance and medical supplies worth NOK 100 million through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). Ukraine and its neighbours can submit requests for material, technical and medical assistance via this mechanism, in which Norway participates., The EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), The NOK 1 billion in humanitarian assistance already disbursed by Norway includes approximately NOK 100 million channelled through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). Ukraine and its neighbours can submit requests for material, technical and medical assistance via this mechanism. So far, Norway has provided surgical and medical supplies and medicines to Ukraine. Norway will also be sending ambulances and personal protective equipment. The scheme for medical evacuation of patients from Ukraine is up and running, and the first patients have arrived in Norway. The Norwegian Emergency Medical Team (Nor Emt) is on standby and can be deployed at short notice. Norway will also send tents and camp beds to Moldova in connection with the refugee response there. Further requests from Ukraine and the neighbouring countries will be assessed on an ongoing basis., Norway is maintaining a close dialogue with its humanitarian partners on the evolving needs. The UN, Norwegian humanitarian partner organisations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are operating in Ukraine and also providing support to neighbouring countries that are receiving refugees. The Ukrainian authorities and neighbouring countries can also submit their requests for equipment, medical supplies and expertise through the UCPM, which Norway will continue to participate in., Facts about Norway’s support to Ukraine, Norway’s allocation of NOK 2 billion includes the following:, The remainder will primarily be disbursed to UN organisations for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine., Norway’s core support to the UN Refugee Agency, the World Food Programme, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund comes in addition to this.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-assistance-ukraine-how-will-it-be-used

Ukraine: UNESCO mobilizes support for learning continuity [EN/AR/RU],News and Press Release,UNESCO,Education,29 Mar 2022,"UNESCO is mobilizing support to maintain continuity of education and to help teachers and learners in Ukraine. Through its Global Education Coalition, the Organization will provide computer hardware and digital learning contents., March 29, 2022, Since the start of the war in Ukraine, on 24 February, UNESCO has repeatedly called for respect for international humanitarian law to protect education., Education is a fundamental right that must be protected in every way possible. UNESCO demands the immediate cessation of all attacks against educational institutions, teachers and students. The Organization is also committed to finding solutions so that every child can continue their studies. - Audrey AzoulayUNESCO Director-General, After one month of war, local authorities have reported that more than 733 educational institutions were damaged or destroyed. Furthermore, estimates suggest that more than half of the country’s estimated child population has been displaced., Strengthening distance learning tools, In order to respond to the needs on the ground, UNESCO is in permanent contact with the local authorities and all relevant partners to protect and restore education in the country, with a focus on distance learning., In line with UNESCO recommendations, Ukraine had an effective system in place in response to school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the All-Ukrainian School platform. We are working with the authorities to adapt it to new needs. - Stefania GianniniUNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Education, With the strong support of the Global Education Coalition – created by UNESCO in 2020 to facilitate distance learning solutions during the pandemic – UNESCO will provide with its partners computer hardware for teachers to support online teaching and learning. The Organization will coordinate the production of new digital learning contents, focusing on the early grades, psycho-social support and teacher training., UNESCO will also support the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine through the creation of a reliable and secure system that will facilitate the provision of online exams for the admission of students to universities, vocational and training institutions., Enabling refugee students to continue their studies, UNESCO welcomes the initiatives taken by some of its Member States to host and integrate Ukrainian student refugees and international students formerly studying in Ukraine., The Organization is mapping these initiatives and features them through a dedicated webpage on the UNESCO website. This is a tool to share best practices and to inspire all countries that want to support learners and teachers fleeing the war., For example, in Poland, authorities are planning to create new educational and childcare centres for incoming Ukrainian children. The country also plans to facilitate the employment of Ukrainian citizens as teacher assistants. In Romania, some schools offer instruction in Ukrainian. In Latvia, according to a new law, Ukrainians have a right to work as teachers to teach refugee students under the age of 18., Education data in Ukraine, According to UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics data, Ukraine’s total school-age population from pre-primary to tertiary education is over 6.84 million. This represents 1.05 million in pre-primary, 1.72 million and 2.54 million respectively at primary and secondary levels, and 1.53 million in tertiary education., The country counts 15,500 preschool institutions; 14,000 primary and basic secondary schools; 695 vocational education institutions; and 336 higher education institutions., Ukraine is also a hub for students from abroad at tertiary level, with a five-fold increase between 2001 and 2020 to 61,000 foreign students.

Ukraine: Russia Uses Banned Antipersonnel Landmines,News and Press Release,HRW,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",29 Mar 2022,"Landmines Threaten Civilian Lives, Prolong Recovery, (Berlin, March 29, 2022) – Russian forces fighting in Ukraine have used banned antipersonnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region, Human Rights Watch said today., The antipersonnel mines were located by Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technicians on March 28, 2022. Russia is known to possess these newly deployed landmines, which can indiscriminately kill and maim people within an apparent 16-meter range. Ukraine does not possess this type of landmine or its delivery system., “Countries around the world should forcefully condemn Russia’s use of banned antipersonnel landmines in Ukraine,” said Steve Goose, the arms director of Human Rights Watch. “These weapons do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and leave a deadly legacy for years to come.”, The 1997 international Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of antipersonnel mines. Russia is not among the 164 countries that have joined the treaty., This new use of antipersonnel mines marks a rare circumstance, though, in which a country not party to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty uses the weapon on the territory of a party to the treaty. Ukraine signed the ban treaty on February 24, 1999, and became a state party on June 1, 2006., The mine used by Russia is a newly developed type called POM-3, also known as “Medallion,” that is equipped with a seismic sensor to detect an approaching person and eject an explosive charge into the air. The subsequent detonation of the charge and metal fragments it projects can cause death and injury within a 16-meter radius, according to the limited information available publicly on this landmine., The POM-3 is reportedly equipped with a self-destruct device that destroys the mine after a certain amount of time, such as hours or days after deployment., The mines were apparently delivered by rockets fired from specially designed ground launchers that were recorded on video on an unknown date and posted to social media on March 26. The markings on a delivery canister remnant pictured with POM-3 mines that failed to deploy properly indicate it was produced in 2021., The dedicated ISDM Zemledelie-I mine-laying rocket launcher, which delivers the POM-3 mines from 5 to 15 kilometers away, first appeared during the annual Russian military exercises in 2021, according to the Landmine Monitor 2021 report. Anti-vehicle mines can also be deployed by the ISDM launcher. The POM-3 can also be scattered at short range by other types of truck-mounted launchers., In November 2020, Russia told the United Nations General Assembly that it “shares the goals of the treaty and supports a world free of mines,” but views antipersonnel mines “as an effective way of ensuring the security of Russia’s borders.”, Human Rights Watch has documented the use of Soviet/Russian-origin antipersonnel mines in more than 30 countries, including in Syria (2011-2019), Ukraine (2014-2015), and Libya (2020), often coinciding with Russian military presence as a party in those conflicts., “Russia’s use of antipersonnel mines in Ukraine deliberately flouts the international norm against use of these horrid weapons,” Goose said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russia-uses-banned-antipersonnel-landmines

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Mar 2022,"(Hong Kong, 29 March 2022) Ukraine is facing a humanitarian crisis that continues to develop every day and the situation is increasingly desperate. An estimated 18 million people is expected to be affected. Humanitarian assistance like food, water, shelter, sanitation and access to medical services are in dire need., Since 24 February 2022, the war in Ukraine has seriously escalated, an estimated 10 million people have been displaced due to the war, including almost 6.5 million who are still in Ukraine and over 3.7 million who have left Ukraine, to seek shelter in neighboring countries such as Poland, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Belarus. HKRC appeals for donations to support the people affected by the Ukraine humanitarian crisis through our humanitarian actions., One month since the start of the war, the Red Cross has reached more than 750,000 people with life-saving aid, both within Ukraine and in neighboring countries, providing food, water, hygiene items, blankets, clothing, first aid and psychosocial support. In Ukraine, the Red Cross will continue the work to repair vital infrastructure, support health facilities with medicines and equipment, and support families with food and hygiene items., “It’s me and my family: my daughter-in-law, my son, my daughter and my grandmother. We fled from ‘Artana’ under bomb explosions. Shells fell directly on our heads, so we ran away in what we were wearing to the basement. We need everything now. We are wearing what kind people and the Red Cross gave us. Right now, we are in dire need of medicine and hygiene products.”, Inna, a woman who is in a shelter for 100 people in Mariupol of Ukraine, No one in Ukraine is left unscathed by the ongoing war. In Ukraine, many cannot reach vital services and goods as crucial supply chains are impacted. Millions of people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas and are unable to leave due to damaged infrastructure, security risks, or a lack of information. For those on the move, many are unable to access their essential needs including food, water, shelter and sanitation. On the other hand, those in neighboring countries and beyond are predominately women, children and older people living with disabilities, not only facing short-term difficulties in getting essential assistance, as well as medium and long-term socioeconomic risks and recovery needs., In additional to the trauma and injuries people suffering now, at the same time, there is a much greater health crisis emerging due to lack of access to health care services, safe water and sanitation facilities. Outbreaks of respiratory and water-borne diseases are highly likely and would lead to drastic deterioration of the situation. The Red Cross will continue to provide humanitarian actions for those affected by the war., HKRC Actions, The HKRC has mobilized approximately HK$350,000 to procure and distribute over 3,500 hygiene kits for communities affected by war in Ukraine.

9008TH MEETING (PM)
SC/14846, Country Has Gone from Breadbasket to Bread Line, Says World Food Programme Head; Local Pauses, Wider Ceasefires Key for Saving Lives, Relief Coordinator Stresses, The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has created not only an immediate humanitarian crisis, but also a threat to future global food security in the form of rising prices and decreased production capabilities, speakers told the Security Council today, underscoring the need to urgently address these issues against the backdrop of Russian and Ukrainian delegations meeting for negotiations in Istanbul., Joyce Msuya, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, briefed the 15-member organ that, just over a month after the war in Ukraine started, “it shows no signs of abating”. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 1,119 people have died — including 99 children — though the numbers are likely far greater. Civilians are trapped, desperate and afraid in besieged Ukrainian cities, lacking access to food, water and essential services. “In some neighbourhoods”, she pointed out, “it’s not even safe to bury the dead.” And more than 10 million people — including more than half of Ukraine’s children — have fled their homes., “The global impacts of this war are becoming clearer as each day of this conflict continues,” she said, after detailing efforts by the United Nations and humanitarian organizations to respond to the crisis in Ukraine. The conflict threatens to exacerbate other crises – such as those in Afghanistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa – as those countries and regions are already grappling with food insecurity and economic fragility. The rising prices of food, fuel and fertilizer will hit hard now and in the coming seasons. Urging that measures be found to save lives – from local pauses to wider ceasefires – she said that civilians are running out of food, energy and hope. Against that backdrop, she said that “our aim is simple: silence the guns and save lives”., Also briefing the Council was David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), who warned that Ukraine has turned “from a breadbasket to a bread line”. The food-chain system must be stabilized, as Ukraine and the Russian Federation account for 30 per cent of the global wheat supply, 20 per cent of the corn supply and 70 to 80 per cent of the sunflower-oil supply. Yemen, Egypt and Lebanon depend on Ukrainian grain, and he expressed concern over food pricing and availability if the loss of fertilizer-based products coming from the Russian Federation and Belarus cannot be offset. “The last thing the WFP wants to do is take food from hungry children to give to starving children,” he said, adding: “Please, let’s make sure we can reach them all”., In the ensuing discussion, many Council members underscored the need to ensure safe, unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations in Ukraine so they can deliver assistance to those who need it most. They also spotlighted the conflict’s negative effects on global food security and called for a cessation of hostilities to alleviate both current and future suffering. Others highlighted the harm that economic sanctions pose to all countries, regardless of whether they are party to the war in Ukraine. Still others drew attention to the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing combat areas, noting that conditions are optimal for human trafficking and sexual and gender-based violence., The representative of France, pointing out that the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world, said that the former country will “no doubt try to make us believe” that sanctions adopted against it are creating an imbalance in global food security. However, the Russian Federation is solely responsible, and the unjustified war it unleashed has prevented Ukraine from exporting grain, disrupted global food supply chains, raised prices and jeopardized access to foodstuffs for the most vulnerable. The European Union’s sanctions against the Russian Federation do not target agricultural activity in that country, he added., The Russian Federation’s delegate, noting Western statements that his country’s activities in Ukraine have caused a global food crisis, said that the real reason for this crisis is the “unbridled sanctions hysteria” unleashed against the Russian Federation. Further, it is “hard not to marvel” at the inconsistency of today’s calls for humanitarian truces, access and pauses as, on 23 March, a majority of Council members rejected a draft resolution put forward by the Russian Federation that contained specific steps to facilitate humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. While Western States did not support this resolution, the Russian Federation is one-sidedly implementing humanitarian obligations it has taken upon itself., China’s representative also expressed concern over the impacts of sweeping sanctions being felt in developing countries, which are not party to the conflict. Such sanctions negatively affect global food security, and he called for measures to keep the food market working. United Nations entities — including the WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) — should actively help developing countries to survive these shocks., The representative of Ghana echoed that point, expressing concern over the “transmission of the shocks of the war” to the global economy and their disproportionate impact on developing countries and small economies. To ameliorate this situation, she called for urgent international solidarity on the issues of sovereign release of excess food stocks and calibrated intervention in the oil market, along with new debt initiatives and financial-access mechanisms to help maintain global stability., “There is a clear nexus between hard security, the humanitarian situation and food security with regard to the Russian war against Ukraine,” stressed Ukraine’s delegate. The Russian Federation envisages destroying Ukraine’s agricultural potential to cow its leadership and people into surrender. While humanitarian assistance is urgently needed, the international community should bear in mind that the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine is an element of the Russian war strategy. “Putin is not the first dictator to weaponize food against the Ukrainian nation,” he pointed out, recalling that Joseph Stalin killed millions of Ukrainians 90 years ago in the artificially organized Great Famine., Also speaking were representatives of Mexico, United States, Kenya, Ireland, Norway, India, United Kingdom, Albania, Gabon, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates., The representatives of the United States and the Russian Federation took the floor a second time., The meeting began at 3:04 p.m. and ended at 5:20 p.m., Briefings, JOYCE MSUYA, Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, briefed the Council that, just over a month after the war in Ukraine started, “it shows no signs of abating”. Children, women and men are being killed, injured, displaced and traumatized, while hospitals, homes and schools are being destroyed. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 1,119 people have died — including 99 children — and “we know these numbers are conservative and the tolls are far greater”. People are trapped, desperate and afraid in encircled, bombarded Ukrainian cities like Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv, lacking food, water, medicine, electricity and heating. “In some neighbourhoods, it’s not even safe to bury the dead,” she said. And more than 10 million people — including more than half of Ukraine’s children — have fled their homes., “Our work is to save lives,” she underscored against that backdrop. Since 24 February, humanitarian organizations have reached around 890,000 people across Ukraine — mostly in the eastern part of that country — providing food, shelter, blankets, medicine, bottled water and hygiene supplies. While humanitarian logistics and supply chains are scaling up every day, security risks and access challenges are hindering these efforts, as many routes are disrupted due to shelling, fighting and landmines. Noting that there are now more than 1,230 United Nations personnel in Ukraine and over 100 humanitarian organizations implementing or planning activities across that country, she said that “Ukraine is a humanitarian paradox: side by side with extreme violence we see extreme kindness, profound solidarity and the gentlest of care”., She went on to say that civilians in Ukraine desperately need this humanitarian assistance and protection. All parties must ensure safe, unhindered humanitarian access to help civilians in their homes and on the road and must allow those who want to leave to do so. Further, detailed, realistic agreements are needed on humanitarian ceasefires and pauses to allow aid in and people out. Also pointing out that the war in Ukraine is an opportunity for predators and human traffickers, she said that protection services are being scaled up not only at the borders, but also in country to ensure that people have information on safe options and routes, along with access to helplines and safe shelter., “The global impacts of this war are becoming clearer as each day of this conflict continues,” she pointed out, noting that the conflict threatens to exacerbate other crises, such as those in Afghanistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. Such countries and regions are already grappling with food insecurity and economic fragility, and rising prices for food, fuel and fertilizer will hit hard now and in the coming seasons. “We will all be affected,” she stressed. Urging that measures be found to save lives — from local pauses to wider ceasefires — she said that civilians are running out of food, energy and hope. In the light of that, she said: “our aim is simple: silence the guns and save lives”., DAVID BEASLEY, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), said that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is a “catastrophe on top of a catastrophe” and warned that Ukraine has turned “from a breadbasket to a bread line”. WFP is currently reaching 1 million people and hopes to reach 6 million by the end of June. The situations in the Sahel, northern Africa, and the Middle East cannot be ignored, or there will be massive migration on all sides of Europe, he cautioned., The food chain system must be stabilized, he said, noting that the farmers of Ukraine are on the front line fighting. It is planting season for maize right now, while June and July are the harvest season for wheat. Ukraine and the Russian Federation account for 30 per cent of the global supply for wheat, 20 per cent of the supply of corn, and 70 or 80 per cent of the supply of sunflower oil. Yemen, Egypt and Lebanon are dependent on Ukrainian grain, he said, stressing that the problem will be compounded with the lack of fertilizer-based products coming out of the Russian Federation and Belarus, which will result in a 50 per cent drop in yields. He expressed his concern over food pricing and availability if these losses cannot be offset. “There will be difficult months ahead,” he said. The famine destabilization of nations and mass migration must be avoided. “The last thing the WFP wants to do is taking food from hungry children to give to starving children,” he said, adding: “Please, let’s make sure we can reach them all.”, Statements, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), noting that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is worsening by the day, recalled that the General Assembly recently demanded — “with a crushing majority” — the immediate cessation of Russian hostilities against Ukraine. He stressed that the Council must also assume its responsibilities “given the humanitarian drama unfolding before our eyes”. Civilian populations and infrastructure, along with medical and humanitarian personnel, must be protected. Further, full humanitarian access must be guaranteed, and those civilians in cities under attack should be able to leave the combat area safely and freely, should they wish to do so. Pointing out that the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world, he said that the former country will “no doubt try to make us believe” that sanctions adopted against it are creating an imbalance in global food security. However, the Russian Federation is solely responsible, and the unjustified war that it unleashed has prevented Ukraine from exporting grain, disrupted global food supply chains, led to an increase in prices and jeopardized access to foodstuffs for the most vulnerable. The European Union’s sanctions against the Russian Federation do not target agricultural activity in that country, he added., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMIREZ (Mexico) expressing particular concern over the fact that 90 per cent of the refugees and internally displaced persons from and in Ukraine are women and children, said that these individuals risk becoming victims of trafficking, exploitation and sexual or gender-based violence. The war in Ukraine also has significant consequences for global food security, which will manifest in serious immediate and medium- to long-term effects. Noting that 1 million people in Ukraine have benefitted from transfers of funds and distribution of food, he said that these measures — though necessary — only constitute temporary relief. Many logistical difficulties hinder the delivery of humanitarian assistance to where it is most needed — including limits on fuel, transportation and drivers — and now, with the closing of major ports, the situation has become even more onerous. The situation in some cities — like Mariupol — is acute, and he called for secure, unimpeded access for humanitarian personnel. He also expressed concern over the proliferation of weapons in Ukraine and stressed the need to examine to what extent such weapons will exacerbate the humanitarian situation in that country., WENDY SHERMAN (United States) said that it has been five weeks — though it feels like a lifetime — since President Vladimir Putin launched his unjustified and brutal invasion of Ukraine. In just five weeks, nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s population has been displaced, including nearly half of the nation’s children. WFP is warning that 45 per cent of the people of Ukraine are concerned about having enough to eat. The Russian Federation’s bombardment of Ukraine’s cities and infrastructure has created one of the fastest-growing humanitarian crises in decades. In Mariupol, in the depths of winter, people are without food, heat and drinking water. One mother said that she could only feed her three daughters a spoonful of honey a day. City officials are saying that city inhabitants are beginning to die of starvation. “Its residents are dying because of President Putin’s war of choice,” she said. The impact is felt beyond the borders of Ukraine, with dangerous implications for the world’s food security. Food prices are skyrocketing in low- and middle-income countries as the Russian Federation chokes off Ukrainian exports. Lebanon, Pakistan, Yemen and Morocco are among the countries that rely heavily on Ukrainian imports to feed their populations. The world was already facing a food security crisis well before the invasion, she said, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis has pushed families into poverty. Countries around the world are experiencing drought and the impact of climate change. The Russian Government blames sanctions for increasing food prices around the world, but sanctions are not preventing grain from leaving Ukraine’s ports — Putin’s war is, she said, stressing that the international community must come together to provide food, water and shelter for the people of Ukraine., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) said that the war in Ukraine is a humanitarian catastrophe. The speed with which the situation has deteriorated, the shockingly high number of fatalities on both sides is a reminder of the carnage that the world has only read about in history books. It is not only Ukrainians who have fled from the bombings. Thousands of Africans who travelled long distances to seek their education in Ukraine are now fleeing before the tanks and bomber planes sent into Ukraine. “They have turned from hopeful students to fearful refugees,” he said. All actors must prioritize the protection of civilians and objects indispensable to their survival, in accordance with international law, he said, calling for the urgent activation of safe passages with no restrictions. The response to the crisis has shown how the world can react with solidarity. He urged the European Union and its members to offer every support to the African students who have fled Ukraine. They should be able to further their education in other countries, as well as getting the material and mental health support that they need, he said., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) expressed concern over the increasing vulnerability of refugees and internally displaced persons as the war in Ukraine continues. Reported deportations — “or, quite frankly, abductions” — of Ukrainian citizens taken forcibly across the border into the Russian Federation are horrifying, she said, and the war has also offered optimal conditions for human traffickers to prey on fleeing women and children. Only the Russian Federation can prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation it has caused, she stressed. She also spotlighted the war’s multiplier effect on food insecurity, compounding existing challenges such as droughts, floods and conflict elsewhere that were already increasing prices and squeezing supply chains. Lives are being lost due to the food insecurity caused by this war and, even if it were to end immediately, it will result in lives lost from hunger in the future. Stressing that the international community and the Council “must not be numbed to the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine”, she said that this war can end “if the Russian Federation has the will to end it”. “It is never too late to do the right thing,” she added., VASSILY NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), noting the many calls today for humanitarian truces, access and pauses, said that it is “hard not to marvel at your inconsistency”. On 23 March, a majority of Council members rejected a draft resolution put forward by the Russian Federation that contained specific steps to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations in Ukraine. It would have saved lives, mandating that heavy weapons not be used in residential areas, that civilians not be used as human shields and that prisoners be treated humanely. He said that “Ukrainian Nazis and radicals” are using civilians as human shields and mistreating Russian soldiers held prisoner; however, the Russian Federation is strictly complying with its international obligations and there is “no threat to Ukrainians who put down their arms”. Although Western States did not support the draft resolution in the Council, the Russian Federation is one-sidedly implementing humanitarian obligations it has taken upon itself, establishing humanitarian corridors, delivering essential goods to those in need, hosting refugees and coordinating with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to facilitate prisoner exchanges. Turning to Western statements that a global food crisis is being caused by the Russian Federation’s activities in Ukraine, he said that the real reason for this crisis is the “unbridled sanctions hysteria” unleashed against his country. Western States are themselves capable of preventing hunger and food shortages, he stressed, “no matter how much they try to shift blame” to the Russian Federation., MONA JUUL (Norway) called for a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine, welcoming the Secretary-General’s initiative to request Mr. Griffiths to work directly with the parties on a possible agreement. She also welcomed the renewed dialogue today between the parties and hope this will establish the trust needed for an early agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Her delegation is concerned by the increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence. Moreover, immediate action must be taken to shield children in Ukraine from the harms of conflict. The massive displacement and refugee flows have led to reports of a significant increase in human trafficking. Ukraine has been set back decades in its economic development, with over 60 per cent of its citizens at risk of falling below the poverty line within 12 months. The ripple effects will be particularly felt in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and South Sudan, she said, welcoming the Secretary-General’s initiative to establish a “Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance”. Russian Federation’s aggression undermines global economic development, peace and security., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) said amid the dire humanitarian situation, his country has already sent over 90 tons of humanitarian supplies to Ukraine and its neighbours, including medicines, tents, medical equipment and other essential relief material for refugees. India will provide more humanitarian assistance in the coming days, especially through supply of essential medicines. Humanitarian action must always be guided by the principles of humanitarian assistance, namely humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. These measures should not be politicized, he stressed, reiterating calls for immediate cessation of hostilities across Ukraine. The global order must be anchored on international law, the United Nations Charter and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States, he said, calling for purposeful engagement by both sides in the ongoing talks., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) expressed her concern over the continuing military bombardment of cities and civilian populated areas of Ukraine. Never has it been more necessary than now for the parties to the conflict to urgently commit to a humanitarian pause to enable the evacuation and safe passage of civilians and to facilitate the delivery of food, medicine and other essential services to those in critical need who have been caught up in cities under siege. She expressed her concern over the “transmission of the shocks of the war” to the global economy and the disproportionate impact that developing countries and small economies are having to bear on account of the war. She called for urgent international solidarity on the issues of sovereign release of excess food stocks and calibrated intervention in the oil market, as well as new debt initiatives and financial access mechanisms to help maintain global cohesion and stability., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that 10.3 million people have been displaced in Ukraine. There have been 73 confirmed attacks on hospitals and medical centres and 659 schools and kindergartens damaged. “The situation in Mariupol is almost beyond description,” she said, stressing that civilians there do not have enough food or water. She also noted credible reports of mass graves and forced deportations of residents to the Russian Federation, as well as incidents of sexual violence. “There will be accountability for these crimes,” she said. There is an urgent need to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the United Kingdom will continue to play its part. It has provided £400 million to support Ukraine, including £220 million in humanitarian aid. Global commodity prices were already on the rise before the invasion, she said, underscoring that global food insecurity will hit the most vulnerable the hardest. “Russia’s appetite for war is taking food off the table,” she said. For the suffering to end, the bullets and bombs of the Russian Federation must stop., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that Mariupol, savagely battered into rubble and reduced to ashes, symbolizes the extreme brutality of the Russian invasion. In the words of the city’s mayor, the Russian Federation’s aim is to wipe the city off the face of the Earth along with its inhabitants. “There is a legal definition for this practice,” he said. The invasion of Ukraine has caused major implications for food security across the world. It has plunged global food and energy markets into turmoil, raising food prices and inflicting severe difficulties on developing countries. Troubling facts confirm that the Russian Federation has replaced the right to information with the freedom of disinformation. Novaya Gazeta, one of the largest independent investigative newspapers in the Russian Federation, announced that it was forced to halt publication after being issued a warning from the Government. “You cannot tell the truth, they were told, you cannot speak of war,” he said. Everything must be done to ensure accountability of every war crime committed in Ukraine. “Russia wanted all Ukraine,” he said. “It learned the hard way it will not get it. Now it wants to divide it and grab a part”., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that the war in Ukraine is entering its second month. Beyond the words and condemnations heard, it is urgent to respond to the distress of the Ukrainian people and all those who suffer alongside them. The humanitarian issue should not be considered in isolation and it should not be politicized, which would only serve to distance the Council from its goal. Appealing to the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, he asked that they grant the same welcome to all people in distress without distinction of origin or race, including African nationals and students. Gabon is attentive to the negotiations currently under way between the parties, especially in Istanbul, he said, expressing hope that they will lead to an immediate ceasefire and create a climate of trust. He then called on the warring parties and all stakeholders to engage resolutely on the path towards a political resolution., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said unilateral sanctions are not only illegal under international law but jeopardize access to products essential to the survival of a large portion of the world’s population. In the end, they tend to be heavily detrimental to developing countries, while some developed countries can guarantee the well-being of their own populations through sustained funds during the next years. The General Assembly has recently adopted a resolution about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, with the support of Brazil. In the explanation of vote, his delegation highlighted that the 193-member organ could not become a bystander of the shocking images from the conflict and the desperation of civilians trapped in the battlefield. “Neither can the Security Council,” he said, adding that as the main United Nations organ tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security, the Council has the mandate and the responsibility to address this situation in an effective manner., DAI BING (China), urging respect for international humanitarian law and avoidance of civilian casualties, called for action to ensure supplies of food, medicines and other basic needs, based on the principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality. His country is cognizant of the impacts of sweeping sanctions felt in developing countries, which are not party to the conflict. Noting the sanctions’ negative impacts on global food security, he called for measures to keep the food market working. The United Nations entities, including WFP, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), should actively help the developing countries survive the shocks. Dialogue and negotiations are the only way to resolve the conflict, he said, encouraging direct talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The United States, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union should engage with Moscow on discussing a balanced security architecture in the region., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates), Council President for March, speaking in her national capacity, expressed support for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ efforts to create a humanitarian notification mechanism for the safe delivery of aid. Her country reiterates the importance of all parties complying with international humanitarian law, especially to protect civilians, limit military operations to exclusively military objectives and take all precautionary measures. She then called for intensifying diplomatic contacts between the two parties to find a peaceful solution, noting the positive reports from the talks in Turkey today, as well as other ongoing mediation efforts. In this context, she stressed the important role of women in conflict resolution and peace negotiations. Ukraine and the Russian Federation together are a critical breadbasket for the world. The rising food insecurity is wreaking havoc on pandemic recovery, particularly for developing, least developed, and small island developing States. In the Middle East and Africa, the conflict jeopardizes significant sources of wheat, including for many countries on the Council’s agenda. This could lead to further unrest and instability around the world, she warned., Ms SHERMAN (United States), taking the floor for a second time, said that the conflict is not about the Russian Federation versus the West. Some 140 countries spoke last week in support of ending the crisis, while 141 supported the first resolution in the General Assembly to say that the invasion by the Russian Federation should stop. She said that, as a Jewish-American, it was not about Nazis in Ukraine. Last week, the former United States Secretary of State and former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, died. Later in her life, Ms. Albright learned that her parents raised her as a Catholic to protect her from the Nazis, because her family was Jewish, and that three of her grandparents died in concentration camps. She knew that the Jewish President of Ukraine was certainly not a Nazi and that the citizens of Ukraine being slaughtered and starved are not — and never were — Nazis. There is an easy choice today, she said. It is a choice that can be made today by President Putin in Istanbul and that is to stop the war., DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said he wished to respond to the comments made by the representative of the United States. “On Nazism in Ukraine, it has already become a common excuse when people say that the Ukrainian president is Jewish, so he can’t be a Nazi,” he said, adding: “I won’t try to convince you of the opposite. I will just say it’s a fact”. He said that the United States representative knew who Stephan Bandera was and how many bad things people did who collaborated with Nazis. Mr. Bandera is a national hero of Ukraine and the national battalions have Nazi symbols in their insignia, he said., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that today’s negotiations in Istanbul have demonstrated that the Russian Federation may be ready to make steps forward, although it is still a long way to a sustainable ceasefire and comprehensive de-escalation. As of now, that country has demonstrated no willingness to give up its strategy of deliberate aggravation of the humanitarian situation on the ground. “There is a clear nexus between hard security, the humanitarian situation and food security with regard to the Russian war against Ukraine,” he stressed, and the Russian Federation envisages destroying Ukraine’s agricultural potential to intimidate its political leadership and people to surrender. “The toolbox is broad and extremely cruel,” he noted, and includes the deliberate destruction of residential areas and critical infrastructure, missile shelling throughout the country, the siege of cities, violation of humanitarian-corridor arrangements and terror against civilians. While humanitarian action is urgently needed, the international community should bear in mind that the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine is an element of the Russian war strategy. Any initiatives should focus on changing this approach, rather than “idle attempts to engage the aggressor as a partner on the humanitarian track”, he stressed. “Putin is not the first dictator to weaponize food against the Ukrainian nation,” he added, recalling that Joseph Stalin killed millions of Ukrainians 90 years ago in the artificially organized Great Famine., For information media.

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Mar 2022,"As delivered, Madam President,, Just over a month ago the war in Ukraine started, and it shows no signs of abating. Children, women and men are being killed, injured, displaced and traumatized. Hospitals, homes and schools are being destroyed. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as of 27 March, 1,119 people have died, including 99 innocent children. We know these numbers are conservative and the tolls are far greater. Cities like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and many others - bustling and full of life just one month ago - are encircled, bombarded, and blockaded., People in these towns lack food, water, medicine, electricity and heating. They are trapped. Desperate. Afraid., In some neighborhoods, it’s not even safe to bury the dead., More than ten million people – including more than half of Ukraine’s children - have fled their homes. This includes an estimated 6.5 million people who are internally displaced in the country, according to the International Organization for Migration. The UN refugee agency reports that more than 3.9 million refugees have crossed the borders to neighbouring countries in the past month., Madam President,, Our work is to save lives., The humanitarian system has scaled up to deliver despite the spreading conflict. Since February 24, humanitarian organizations have reached around 890,000 people across, Ukraine, mostly in the east, with multi-sectoral assistance. People have received food, shelter, blankets, medicine, bottled water, and hygiene supplies., We are working around the clock to reach more and more people in need. The UN and our humanitarian partners are working impartially and relentlessly to uphold humanitarian principles, negotiate safe passage in and out of encircled areas for one cause alone: to provide life-saving assistance., Humanitarian logistics and supply chains are scaling up every day. But treacherous security risks and access challenges are hampering our efforts. Many routes are disrupted, and humanitarian convoys and workers are frequently unable to pass due to shelling, fighting and landmines., Humanitarians of all stripes are putting their lives at risk to help those in need. There are now more than 1,230 United Nations personnel in the country, working via humanitarian hubs across the country. And there are more than 100 humanitarian organizations implementing or planning activities in every oblast in Ukraine, in all sectors., The brave work of the Ukrainian Red Cross and other civil society organizations who are working shoulder-to-shoulder with volunteers and communities is astounding., Ukraine is a humanitarian paradox: side by side with extreme violence we see extreme kindness, profound solidarity and the gentlest of care., I am humbled and inspired by the tireless commitment of these people and we must continue to support their work., Where security allows, humanitarian convoys are unloading much-needed supplies and delivering equipment to repair damaged infrastructure., On 18 March – after delays due to ongoing hostilities - the first UN-organized convoy reached Sumy in the north-east. The convoy delivered 130 tons of much-needed medical supplies, water, ready-to-eat meals and canned food for 35,000 people as well as essential equipment for the repair of water systems that will help improve access to water for some 50,000 people., Yesterday – again after delays due to ongoing fighting – the second UN-organized convoy reached Kharkiv where supplies of food, other essential relief items, and emergency health kits and medicines were unloaded for distribution by the Ukrainian Red Cross society., Countrywide, more than 180 metric tons of medical supplies have been delivered, and more than 470 metric tons are on the way. Where we can, we buy supplies from the local market and work alongside local efforts., But we need to move to scale. More convoys are planned for the days and weeks ahead to reach many more people with desperately needed aid., I am sure David [Beasley] will tell us more about the World Food Programme and its work over the past month and expansion of its operations in Ukraine., Madam President,, Civilians in Ukraine desperately need this assistance and protection., But to do that, all parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law. To ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to help civilians in their homes and those on the road in Ukraine, and to allow those civilians who want to leave to get out. We need detailed, realistic agreements on humanitarian ceasefires and pauses to allow aid in, and people out., For predators and human traffickers, the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy. It’s an opportunity., Humanitarian organizations are worried about the risk of trafficking, as well as sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and the region. Children fleeing the war are at especially heightened risk of human trafficking and exploitation. Predators are luring single parents on the road with promises of transport and accommodation., We are scaling up our protection services at the borders but also in the country to make sure people have information available on safe options and routes, access to helplines and safe shelter. Humanitarian partners are coordinating closely to not only monitor risks of sexual violence, trafficking and abuse but provide swift and specialized services to survivors., Madam President,, Humanitarian partners agree our worst-case scenario has been reached and, in some areas, surpassed., This is why last week the Principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee agreed to revise the Flash Appeal that has rallied US$506 million of the $1.1 billion needed to support the response. The Refugee Response Plan, coordinated by the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, will also be revised. The generosity and welcome of Ukraine’s neighbours remain a bright spot in a darkening landscape., Madam President,, The global impacts of this war are becoming clearer as each day of this conflict continues., It threatens to make things even worse in the world’s biggest humanitarian crises such as Afghanistan, Yemen and in the Horn of Africa., These countries are already grappling with food insecurity and economic fragility.

Update 36 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (29 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,29 Mar 2022,"The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, is in Ukraine for talks with senior government officials on the IAEA’s planned delivery of urgent technical assistance to ensure the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities and help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment., The aim of the Director General’s visit is to initiate prompt safety and security support to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. It will include sending IAEA experts to prioritized facilities and the shipment of vital safety and security supplies including monitoring and emergency equipment. Please see here for more details., In today’s regular update about the situation regarding safety and security at the country’s nuclear facilities, Ukraine said there had been no change in staffing at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), which is controlled by Russian forces since 24 February. There has been no staff rotation there since 20-21 March, when technical personnel who had worked at the facility for nearly four weeks were replaced by colleagues from the nearby city of Slavutych., Ukraine reported no new developments also regarding a nuclear research facility in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, a day after it said the facility had suffered additional damage when it came under renewed fire a few days ago. The facility’s nuclear material is subcritical – there can be no nuclear chain reaction – and the radioactive inventory is low., Out of the country’s 15 operational reactors at four sites, the regulator said eight were continuing to operate, including two at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. The other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance, it added., In relation to safeguards, the Agency said that the situation remained unchanged from that reported previously. The Agency was still not receiving remote data transmission from its monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP, but such data was being transferred to IAEA headquarters from the other NPPs in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-36-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-29-march-2022
Zakarpatska Oblast: Estimated number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) per Hromada | Data as of March 25th 2022,Map,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,29 Mar 2022,"Starting on 24 February 2022, a large scale armed conflict triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across all regions of Ukraine. Between March 9 and 16, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather initial insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. While Displacement Tracking Matrix tools are being established, this general population assessment will serve as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the conflict-affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The probabilistic sample, representative at macro-region level, was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,000 respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) method. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. Population estimates assume that children travel together with their adult guardians. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community.",https://reliefweb.int/map/ukraine/zakarpatska-oblast-estimated-number-internally-displaced-persons-idps-hromada-data-march
"Ukraine: Robert Mardini addresses deliberate, targeted attacks that use false narratives and disinformation to discredit the ICRC",News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,29 Mar 2022,"As humanitarian needs in Ukraine increase by the hour, the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance is today being jeopardised by a surge of misinformation and disinformation. Robert Mardini, ICRC's Director-General, addresses these deliberate, targeted attacks that use false narratives and disinformation to discredit the ICRC., “False allegations and accusations are circulating about the International Committee of the Red Cross. They have a huge potential to cause harm to the people we serve and to our Red Cross teams on the ground,” Mr Mardini said., Neutral and impartial humanitarian action must be respected, both ICRC’s and others. ICRC’s sole mandate is to assist and protect victims of armed conflict and violence wherever they are., “The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine is nothing short of catastrophic. People are being killed, injured, maimed on the move, leaving everything behind, living in constant fear of violence, death and running out of basic supplies, water, sanitation, food supplies, medicines. It is untenable. It is unbearable and parties to the conflict must ensure that civilians have a respite,” Mr Mardini said., Note to editors:, The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014, supporting people affected by conflict. Since the recent escalation of the crisis, we have brought over 500 tons of medical supplies, food and relief items into the country to respond to skyrocketing humanitarian needs. We will continue to scale up our work and now have teams in 10 locations across the country., Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries.

People are being killed, injured, maimed on the move, leaving everything behind, living in constant fear of violence, death and running out of basic supplies, water, sanitation, food supplies, medicines. It is untenable. It is unbearable and parties to the conflict must ensure that civilians have a respite., 00:31 False allegations and accusations are circulating about the International Committee of the Red Cross. They have a huge potential to cause harm to the people we serve and to our Red Cross teams on the ground., 00:45 The first terrible allegation is the fact that the ICRC is facilitating forced evacuation of civilians. This is absolutely wrong. The ICRC will never facilitate any evacuation of civilians against their will. A second accusation is about setting up a refugee camp in Southern Russia. This is not happening. The ICRC does not run or open or set up any refugee camps, not in southern Russia and everywhere else., 01:20 Neutrality and impartiality and the perception of neutrality and impartiality is at the heart of our license to operate. This is how we build acceptance by parties to the conflict. This is how we can really cross front lines to help people in need of our support. And this is why it is so important that this is preserved at any time. And of course, misinformation disinformation is a massive harm to the public good of the Red Cross being able to operate in the worst of circumstances., 01:59 ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-robert-mardini-addresses-deliberate-targeted-attacks-use-false-narratives-and

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Mar 2022,"Situation overview, 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine to date, but reliable disaggregated data on refugee ages is difficult to find. Even still, one in five Ukrainian children has become a refugee in less than a month., Hidden beneath this refugee crisis is another looming crisis – that of children travelling alone and the potential for abuse and trafficking. More than 500 unaccompanied children were identified crossing from Ukraine into Romania from 24 February to 17 March. In Moldova, 80% of refugees are women and girls, and 89% are women and children., World Vision participated in a high-level virtual briefing on 18 March organized by OCHA for UN Member States and partners on the current humanitarian situation. We highlighted our concerns for the protection of children trapped in Ukraine, on the move, and arriving in neighbouring countries. We called on Member States and the humanitarian community to urgently establish mechanisms to identify and register vulnerable girls and boys in order to reduce the risks they face and begin to respond to their needs., At least one-third of refugees in Moldova are intending to stay in the country. These populations are at heightened risk of violence, exploitation and abuse, including trafficking. Mental health tops the WHO’s “risk list” for children and families affected by the conflict. They are at high risk of adverse mental health outcomes and there is urgent need for continued mental health and psychosocial support services., There has already been more than $100 billion in infrastructure damage due to conflict in Ukraine. 90% of families in Ukraine may experience a “freefall into poverty” and extreme vulnerability as a result. Children are also being caught in the crossfire, the Ukrainian government has reported four children a day have been killed since the beginning of the conflict., There is growing concern among the international community that the military and humanitarian corridors into Ukraine from Poland are largely the same. World Vision remains engaged in collective efforts to negotiate separate humanitarian corridors in order to maintain a principled humanitarian response., Humanitarian coordination systems are beginning to be established in Romania and Moldova, though clusters are not yet in place at scale. World Vision participated in the first response-wide UNHCR briefing in Romania on 17 March. We are also regular participants at the daily coordination meetings hosted by OCHA in Rzeszow, Poland.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-response-situation-report-3-23-march-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Mar 2022,"People in Need was one of the first organisations to respond immediately to the outbreak of war. We began immediately to organise urgent material aid. In addition to assistance at the borders and in the Czech Republic, we identified a need to respond quickly to the sharp increase in internally displaced people and identify what specific areas within Ukraine lacked basic necessities such as water and food. PIN established cooperation with local organisations in contact with the Ukrainian government and has efficiently transported aid to the most vulnerable people—and we will continue to do this as long as necessary. At present, it isn't easy to get certain goods, such as power banks, sleeping bags, fuel, etc., directly in Ukraine. Due to the paucity of urgently needed aid material, international support is crucial for local organisations., What does direct financial support look like in Ukraine?, To receive financial support from PIN, local organisations must meet specific criteria, such as logistics and staff capacity, and whether the assistance provided agrees with PIN's principles. The amount of the donation depends on the needs of a particular locality and the organisation's capacity to ensure the transport and distribution of aid., Supporting local people is an integral part of our work. In the long term, PIN works to contribute to building an active civil society and mutual support of local people through local associations. PIN financially supports organisations that provide material assistance in regions where fighting is ongoing. Food parcels, water, baby food, and hygiene supplies are mainly distributed here. However, we often aid local organisations in procuring shelter facilities and the equipment necessary to run these shelters. Additionally, local Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) that procured collective centres for internally displaced people in Ukraine after the invasion are being funded. These shelters provide much needed safe places where people can stay for several days, get rest, and seek psychological help., They used to have to leave their home alone, but now they help others in need DOM4824 is one of the organisations financially supported by PIN. It is an association of people who fled Donetsk in 2014. Until recently, DOM4824 has supported social entrepreneurship, promoted women's rights, and fostered art initiatives in the space they rent from a local business. Following the invasion, their activities have changed dramatically, and now, they offer their space to internally displaced persons from regions where fighting is still ongoing. People in Need has provided the organisation with funding to cover its operations and rent for two months. We have equipped the centre's facilities with washing and dryer machines, fire extinguishers, microwaves., The STAN organisation also operated initially in eastern Ukraine. In 2014, it moved from Luhansk to the west and began to organise development programs for local people in addition to artistic activities. Nowadays, staff members and volunteers help directly at the railway station – assisting with finding temporary housing, arranging administration, offering food and water. STAN has used PIN funding to support five community centres for internally displaced people in the Carpathian region.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/locals-locals-people-need-supports-local-non-profit-organisations-directly-ukraine
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 28 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,29 Mar 2022,"From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 28 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 3,039 civilian casualties in the country: 1,179 killed and 1,860 injured. This included:, a total of 1,179 killed (236 men, 172 women, 15 girls, and 34 boys, as well as 55 children and 667 adults whose sex is yet unknown) a total of 1,860 injured (209 men, 157 women, 34 girls, and 26 boys, as well as 74 children and 1,360 adults whose sex is yet unknown) In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 1,337 casualties (388 killed and 949 injured) On Government-controlled territory: 1,042 casualties (326 killed and 716 injured) On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 295 casualties (62 killed and 233 injured) In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 1,702 casualties (791 killed and 911 injured) Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Popasna (Luhansk region), and Trostianets (Sumy region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine, according to which as of 8 a.m. 29 March (local time), 144 children had been killed and at least 220 injured., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 27 March 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 28 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 28 March have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-28-march-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Mar 2022,"After more than one month, the Russian military offensive against Ukraine has displaced almost a quarter of the country’s estimated population of 44.13 million. Around 3.72 million have had to flee the country, while around 6.47 million are estimated to be internally displaced (UNHCR accessed 25/03/2022; IOM 16/03/2022; WB accessed 25/03/2022). As at 10 March 2022, around 12.65 million people were unable or unwilling to leave conflict-affected areas (Protection Cluster 11/03/2022). Figures on the movement of people are likely to change, with areas of active conflict especially in its eastern, northern, and southern regions and Kyiv.
Attacks on civilian infrastructure continue to endanger civilian lives. As at 23 March, there were at least 2,865 civilian casualties, including 1,035 killed and 1,650 injured (OHCHR 24/03/2022). Actual figures are likely considerably higher and will continue to rise. As at 22 March, there were 64 verified incidents of attacks on healthcare facilities (WHO 24/03/2022).
According the Ministry of Education and Science, the conflict has also damaged almost 500 educational facilities (MoES 21/03/2022).
Overall needs for the population include safe shelter, food, water, access to information, psychosocial support, and medicine (especially for chronic diseases, such as insulin) (KII 22/03/2022 a). The conflict has disrupted access to essential services, such as water, gas, and electricity. As at 24 March, more than 865,000 people were without electricity across the country (MOE 24/03/2022). There are more specific needs and risks identified for those displaced and in transit (especially towards western and central cities, such as Lviv and Vinnytsia) and those unable or unwilling to leave affected areas, such as in Mariupol.
Although needs are growing, there are constraints in humanitarian access (OCHA 01/03/2022;
UN 18/03/2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-ukraine-pattern-movement-people-s-needs-and-response-27-march
