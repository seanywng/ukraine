World Vision’s 90 day Ukraine Crisis Response Plan (UCR), published in March, set out an initial strategic focus and plan. Now we look ahead, combining insights from our immediate experience on the ground with our decades of emergency response. As the situation evolves, we have adapted our response to seek greater stability, less risk, and an intentional focus inside Ukraine. This is driven by the ongoing volatility within Ukraine and the high numbers of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine and neighbouring countries., The shifts outlined in this new response plan strengthen our response and allow us to better meet the historically unprecedented needs caused by this senseless war. It also aligns with World Vision’s promise to deepen our commitment to the most vulnerable girls and boys. This 180 Day Plan extends through August 2022. A longer-term response plan will be published in September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-vision-ukraine-crisis-response-180-day-plan

Protection and Human Rights",16 Jun 2022,"Lyon, le 16 juin 2022. La guerre en Ukraine dure depuis maintenant 4 mois et on estime à plus de 24 millions le nombre de personnes aujourd’hui dans le besoin. Handicap International se mobilise pour aider les populations civiles qui subissent, en première ligne, les conséquences de cette guerre. Près de 70 personnes sont présentes en Ukraine pour apporter leur expertise en matière de réadaptation et de soutien psychologique, et garantir un accès à des articles de première nécessité., Apporter des soins de réadaptation et du soutien psychologique, Depuis le début du conflit, plus de 8 000 pertes civiles ont été dénombrées, dont plus de 4 200 blessés. Ces chiffres sont probablement très loin de la réalité. Face à ces estimations alarmantes, Handicap International déploie de l’aide dans le secteur médical : des équipes qualifiées réalisent des soins dans le domaine de la réadaptation physique et fonctionnelle à Tchernivtsi dans diverses structures (centres collectifs, orphelinats, etc.) et dans des établissements de santé, à Lviv et Dnipro. L’organisation a également formé une cinquantaine de soignants à la rééducation spécialisée (brûlures et amputations) pour renforcer les capacités hospitalières et pouvoir répondre à l’augmentation croissante des besoins en termes de soins d’urgence., Le soutien psychologique et l’assistance psychosociale font aussi partie des domaines d’interventions prioritaires des équipes de Handicap International, qui interviennent dans plusieurs structures hébergeant des personnes déplacées. Une hotline est, en outre, assurée 24 heures sur 24 pour fournir un soutien psychologique dans tout le pays, en collaboration avec l’Université de psychologie médicale de Tchernivtsi et un organisme d’aide psychologique local., Contribuer à assurer une aide humanitaire rapide et accessible, Une partie de la population ukrainienne a été contrainte de quitter son logement et vit maintenant dans des centres collectifs ou est hébergée par la population locale. Handicap International œuvre pour leur garantir l’accès à des articles d’hygiène et du matériels, spécialisés (savon, chaises percées, literie adéquate, etc.) en prenant en compte les besoins des populations les plus vulnérables comme les personnes âgées et les personnes handicapées. Un soutien financier est aussi fourni à des institutions qui travaillent à répondre aux besoins fondamentaux des populations (nourriture, eau et médicaments). La plateforme logistique de l’organisation prend en charge entre 7 et 10 convois d’articles de première nécessité par semaine et permet l’acheminement rapide d’articles humanitaires à destination des populations touchées par le conflit. Deux centres logistiques opérationnels ont déjà été mis en place à Vinnytsia et à Dnipro. Handicap International a ainsi pu assurer la fourniture de près de 40 convois depuis Dnipro, jusqu’à une distance proche du front (Kharkiv, Kramatorsk)., Préparer les populations à faire face aux risques des engins non explosés, Ravagée par les bombardements et l'utilisation illégale de mines terrestres, l'Ukraine est fortement contaminée par les restes explosifs de guerre et les mines terrestres. Les populations courent un risque accru de se retrouver face à des engins explosifs laissés sur place, ou d’être exposées à des bombardements et à des tirs d’artillerie., HI prévoit de lancer une campagne de sensibilisation aux risques liés aux munitions explosives dans quelques semaines à Tchernivtsi et à Dnipro à destination des populations., « Nous voulons leur apprendre à reconnaître, à adopter le bon comportement et à signaler ces menaces. » Celine Cheng, spécialiste de l'éducation aux risques liés aux munitions explosives HI, A propos de Handicap International, Handicap International est une association de solidarité internationale indépendante, qui intervient depuis près de 40 ans dans les situations de pauvreté et d'exclusion, de conflits et de catastrophes.

Ukraine highlights efforts to close digital divide for people with disabilities during New York conference,News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,17 Jun 2022,"UNDP project showcased at conference champions improved access to online services, crucial during war., Kyiv, 17 June 2022 – Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation presented the country’s achievements in the field of digital accessibility during the 15th Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in New York this week., Yurii Matsyk, Head of the MDT’s Directorate of Fixed and Mobile Broadband, shared how people with disabilities are able to access online services as a result on the steps taken by the MDT with help from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to increase the digital accessibility of web resources of government authorities and eliminate the digital divide in Ukraine., The MDT is working to expand citizens' access to the Internet throughout the country, despite the war, and is implementing projects aimed at increasing the digital skills of Ukrainian men and women, Mr. Matsyk said., In addition, the Ministry initiated the testing of web accessibility of public web resources, including that of Diia – the unified portal for online public services in Ukraine – as well as the development of a new state standard on web accessibility. Some of these initiatives have been implemented with the assistance of UNDP in Ukraine with financial support from Sweden., “Digital accessibility is one of the priorities of Ukraine's public policy. Therefore, our work aims to increase web accessibility in the country, not only for people with disabilities, but for all citizens,” Mr. Matsyk said. “Our main goal is that the digital country should be accessible to all, and everyone should be able to receive access to the public services they need, and enjoy all of the benefits of the country's digital transformation.” In this regard he thanked Ukraine’s international partners for their support for the ministry's initiatives, and noted the expert and financial support given by both the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine and by Sweden in the area of digital accessibility., Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Sweden to Ukraine Tobias Thyberg emphasized that Sweden consistently supports Ukraine in bridging the digital divide in the country, and in increasing the digital literacy of its citizens. “Developing the digital skills of Ukrainians and ensuring web accessibility when creating new web products is a guarantee that as many people as possible will be able to use public services,” he said. “Sweden is committed to supporting Ukraine on this path, so that the digital transformation will benefit all Ukrainian men and women”., An integrated approach taken by the Government of Ukraine to improve people’s digital skills while increasing the web accessibility to all will help reduce the digital divide in Ukraine, said UNDP Ukraine Resident Representative, a.i. Manal Fouani. “In the last three years, the Government has taken unprecedented steps to increase the web accessibility of public resources and digital literacy,” Ms. Fouani said. “Progress in this direction is not stopping, even during the war. All these solutions and tools will certainly reduce and eliminate digital barriers in Ukraine. UNDP strongly believes that the digitalisation of public administration should be accessible to all people in the country, including people with disabilities, so that no one is left behind, especially during the war, and Ukraine’s progress is the best demonstration of this process.”, UNDP Ukraine, with the support of Sweden, has been working closely with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine in the field of web accessibility in recent years. Among their recent achievements is the creation of a digital accessibility standard. The Ukrainian version of the EN 301 549 standard aims to ensure the web accessibility requirements for government websites match the ones that are mandatory in EU states. UNDP in Ukraine and Sweden also supported the participation of the Ministry of Digital Transformation in this year's Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities., Background, In late 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the text of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Its purpose was to encourage, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. The Convention stipulates that States parties shall meet regularly in a Conference in order to consider any matter with regard to the implementation of the Convention, and since 2008 there have been 15 sessions of the Conference of the States Parties at United Nations Headquarters., The above-mentioned initiatives on web accessibility were conducted within the project “Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine Project” (DIA Support Project), which UNDP implements in Ukraine with the financial support of Sweden. The DIA Support Project was launched in 2021 and aims to bridge the digital divide between different generations and different social groups. Its main goal is to increase the accessibility of new digital solutions so that every man and woman in the country can use public electronic services and no one is left behind., Media inquiries:, Yuliia Samus, Communications Team Leader, UNDP in Ukraine, Yuliia.Samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-highlights-efforts-close-digital-divide-people-disabilities-during-new-york-conference

Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Jun 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, ANALYSIS (16 Jun 2022), Situation Overview, General security and humanitarian situation, Nearly four months since the start of the war in Ukraine, the humanitarian situation across the country—particularly in the eastern Donbas region—is extremely alarming and continues to deteriorate rapidly. The lack of humanitarian access due to ongoing conflict has prevented aid workers from providing life-saving assistance to people affected in several parts of Ukraine. Over the last week, active hostilities continued to escalate, especially in Luhanska and Donetska oblasts in eastern Ukraine, taking an enormous toll on civilians, including aid workers. In both Government- and non-Government-controlled areas of the two oblasts, there have been reports of dozens of civilians killed, hundreds injured, while many more are caught up in places without adequate access to vital services and supplies, including water, food, healthcare or electricity., The UN has received reliable reports of widespread shelling of residential areas and critical infrastructure—including several bridges—in the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, and surrounding villages across Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Luhanska oblast, severely disrupting essential services and access to the region. Although insecurity has made it impossible to determine or verify exact numbers, humanitarian partners who have been in Sievierodonetsk until recently informed that thousands of people are still in the city, including hundreds who are taking shelter in the bunkers of the Azot plant. Civilians in the city are struggling to have access to piped water, sanitation, health services or electricity. They are experiencing constant clashes and bombardments, with no guarantees to safely evacuate the area. In addition, another 30,000 people reportedly remain in Lysychansk (15,000) and neighbouring villages (15,000)—estimates from the local authorities—enduring intense hostilities. The disruption of essential services is particularly affecting health care, according to information gathered by UN agencies and NGOs. Reportedly, 19 health facilities have been hit in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, causing the total interruption of medical services in the former and leaving the latter with only one functional medical facility, when people need it the most. To date, the parties to the conflict have not reached an agreement to either facilitate safe evacuations of civilians or enable access to humanitarians to provide urgent assistance in the city., The situation is also dire in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Donetsk oblast, where daily shelling and bombardments are further impacting civilian areas and leading to civilian casualties, affecting areas dangerously close to UN facilities and to the homes of humanitarian staff in Donetsk city. The week-long shelling in Donetsk city intensified in recent days, and on 13 June a market and apartment building were struck in the city centre, not far from the UN compound. On the same day, at least five health facilities were hit by shelling, including a maternity ward. Humanitarians on the ground informed that no one was killed or injured, but some pregnant women had to be transferred to other hospitals.Overall, over the last week, dozens of people were reportedly killed or injured, hundreds of critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, hospitals, markets, were reportedly hit across the oblast. This is making life nearly unbearable for people who are also facing severe water shortages and, sometimes, unable to leave their homes for days due to insecurity. Insecurity prevented the UN from verifying the exact figures., Elsewhere, sustained shelling was reported in the eastern Kharkivska oblast and fighting and hostilities continued in the south of the country throughout the week. This is along with daily reports of airstrikes right across the country, including in Zaporizka oblast in the south-east, Dnipropetrovska in the centre and Sumska in the north, as well as Lvivska and Ternopilska in the west., Destruction of civilian infrastructure, Over 3.5 million Ukrainians reportedly had their houses destroyed or damaged since 24 February, according to estimations shared by the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine. Some 116,000 residential buildings, which have been home for about 3.5 million Ukrainians, have been damaged across the country in nearly three months of war, according to the Government. The figure includes 12,300 multi-story apartment buildings and over 104,000 private houses., Human rights violations, including civilian casualties, Allegations of human rights violations continued across Ukraine and the total number of civilians killed and injured since 24 February is now approaching 10,000 people. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had verified, as of 15 June, more than 9,983 civilian causalities in the country, including 4,452 killed and 5,531 injured, although the actual number is likely considerably higher. Donetska and Luhanska oblasts are bearing the brunt with the highest number of civilian casualties. New allegations of violations against civilians have been shared by Human Rights Watch (HRW), in a new report published on 10 June. The rights groups informed that at least four out of eight attacks reported in early March in Chernihiv, northern Chernihivska oblast—which killed and injured numerous civilians— “were in clear violation of the laws of war.”HRW says they included the bombing of an apartment complex that killed 47 civilians, an attack that killed at least 17 people in a bread line outside a supermarket, and two separate attacks, including one that damaged two hospitals with cluster munitions, which are prohibited under multiple international conventions., Humanitarian access and safe passage, Ongoing fighting and denial from authorities have continued to severely restrict humanitarian access to people in need across Ukraine. While people in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts have life-threatening needs, insecurity and restricted access have largely prevented the UN and NGOs from providing regular assistance in both regions. The situation has been similar in NGCA of southern Ukraine, where freedom of movement and humanitarian access have been severely limited., The UN continues to engage with the parties to negotiate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief to people who desperately need it., Safe passage is required for people who decide to evacuate from areas experiencing active fighting. Over the last week, there continued to be efforts to evacuate civilians from some of the areas currently most impacted by the hostilities. Ukraine’s Joint Forces Task Force reported on 9 June, for example, that more than 600 people had been evacuated in eastern Ukraine in the previous 24 hours. And while the Luhanska oblast authorities reported on 14 June that more than 50 people had been evacuated from communities, including Lysychansk, they said the fighting made evacuations from Sievierodonetsk impossible in recent days. Separately, the Russian Federation reported that, by 14 June, over 1.84 million people, including nearly 295,000 children, had crossed into the Russian Federation from the territory of Ukraine after 24 February. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that, as of 9 June, just over 1.13 million people had crossed into the Russian Federation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-15-jun-2022-enukru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 Jun 2022,"Data and analysis on nearly 5000 incidents of war-related damages in Ukraine show that 92 industrial facilities in the high or very high environmental risk category were affected., The data stems from a recently created online map-based platform, Ecodozor, developed by Zoï Environment Network and supported by the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine., Presented today at the Ukraine Media Centre in Lviv, the platform draws on OSCE’s experience in assessing environmental damage in the eastern regions of Ukraine, affected by armed conflict since 2014., The damages and disruptions were gathered from across the whole of Ukraine and included infrastructure damage due to bombing and shelling, interrupted water, gas and electricity supplies, and disrupted industrial operations. The effects of these environmental threats are yet to be investigated., “Of course, in these tragic times of war, we think first of all about people whose lives are in immediate danger from ongoing hostilities. Yet, we shouldn’t forget that environmental damage can have long-term effects on health and lives of everyone in the affected areas and beyond,” said Henrik Villadsen, the OSCE Project Co-ordinator during the event., “This needs to be taken into account already in planning and accumulation of resources for assistance in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine,” he added., The Ecodozor platform will be continuously updated, to assist researchers and policy makers in developing a comprehensive response to environmental threats., The OSCE Project Co-ordinator has been helping Ukrainian authorities to enhance their system of emergency response especially in the sphere of chemical safety and security. This includes several approaches, such as harmonizing regulatory systems with internationally accepted standards, reforming first responders trainings and enhancing capacities in identification of toxic chemicals., The Co-ordinator has also supported the country in enhancing monitoring of its water resources in the Siverskyi Donets river basin.

Battered Mariupol Faces Attack on a New Front,News and Press Release,TOL,Health,16 Jun 2022,"Exiled authorities say cholera has broken out, but can information from the Russian-occupied city be trusted? From Rubryka., In recent days, the Ukrainian news has been buzzing with headlines about tens of thousands of deaths should an epidemic hit in Mariupol and about a decision to put the Russian-held city into quarantine. Some media have painted a horrifying medieval picture and write that “corpse poison” is spreading in the town., An adviser to the Mariupol mayor, Petro Andriushchenko, last week said, “There is information that Russia has already prepared infectious disease units in Rostov-on-Don. … The word ‘cholera’ is heard not only in the WHO [World Health Organization] but also inside the city, among the occupation authorities.” He stated that simply closing the city was “the most cynical way to fight the epidemic: just shut the people in the city, leave everything as it is, whoever survives, survives.”, What Is ‘Corpse Poison’?, According to environmental security expert Maksym Soroka, the war has wreaked both physical and environmental catastrophe., “Unfortunately, this war has created all the environmental disasters we could’ve imagined,” Soroka said. “Currently, throughout Ukraine, where hostilities have occurred, we’re witnessing significant air, soil, and water pollution and the deterioration of the sanitary and epidemiological situation. It is a painful issue for Mariupol and all occupied and formerly occupied cities and territories.”, The number of mass graves in the occupied cities is very large. In Mariupol, corpses and mass graves are still being found., However, it’s impossible to investigate the situation in Mariupol. Soroka says it is only possible to draw a parallel between Mariupol and the occupied cities in the Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions, where many corpses lie on the ground or in the fields. Although there are health hazards in this situation, he says, on the other hand, “We see how such a term as corpse poison is spread on television, and as a specialist, it is strange to me.”, Decomposition of bodies can pose a health threat because the decay process is accompanied by a variety of staphylococcus bacteria, putrefying bacteria, and other microbes. Civic activists and state personnel are engaged in cleanup operations., “They’re trying to remove all corpses from ravines, dugouts, and similar areas to ensure epidemiological safety. If it’s not done, a cascading effect can occur when the whole ecosystem in this area begins to fall apart,” Soroka said. “So I fully agree with the World Health Organization that there is a risk of an epidemic. But don’t forget that the immunity of a healthy person is robust, and it fights these bacteria powerfully. Another thing is when the body hasn’t received vitamins for many months and is exhausted,” he added., Cholera Risk, Cholera is an acute, fast-spreading infectious disease often characterized by severe diarrhea. It can be fatal., Andriushchenko pointed out during a television appearance that cholera bacteria in the sea at this time of year is an annual phenomenon, typical for Mariupol and the Sea of Azov.WHOspokeswomanMargaretHarris confirmedthat in the past, cholera outbreaks have occurred in Mariupol and neighboring areas. For now, no data are available because no WHO representatives are in Mariupol., Andriushchenko himself announced the first wave of cholera on 6 June: “Shallow graves and rotting garbage on the streets – all this ends up in the water, the sea, and sources of drinking water. The risk of an epidemic is not just threatening. It’s already at a level that we are recording isolated cases [to the extent that we can] and this allows us to say that the epidemic has in principle begun,” Andriushchenko said., There is also a threat of dysentery and viral diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, he said. However, the city’s devastated infrastructure is the main risk factor: “It [a disease outbreak] can occur because of unsanitary conditions. But the worst thing is that even such a seemingly trivial thing as dysentery in the current health system – with the lack of drugs, lack of laboratories, lack of everything we are used to, and lack of vaccines in Mariupol – can lead to tens of thousands of deaths,” he said., The Danger Is Not Only to Health, Soroka told Rubryka that the information about the cholera epidemic spread in the Ukrainian media resembles disinformation., “We gave them [the Russian occupiers] a good justification to close the city, finding a reason to quarantine the city, and not allow inspectors or the Red Cross mission so that they can slaughter everyone there!” the expert said., At the same time, city councilor Maksym Borodin – who like the rest of the city administration is no longer in Mariupol but stays in contact with locals – notes that it is impossible to obtain any objective information about the state of affairs in Mariupol. According to him, there are rumors that people are forbidden to visit the beaches, allegedly because of mines., While this may be true, Borodin pointed out that “all sewage and storm-water runoff goes to the sea without any treatment. Almost all the water mains were damaged. When the occupiers tried to supply water for apartments, most of the water ended up near houses – it flooded all the potholes, all the places where there was rubbish and where people were buried. Water takes this microflora with it and reaches the springswhere people obtain water. There are several in Mariupol, and people use them.

Ukraine Crisis: Week of 4-10 June 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,16 Jun 2022,"Fighting continued last week in eastern and southern Ukraine. Amid the ongoing battle for Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region, Russian forces reportedly pulled troops from the Zaporizhia region to support the offensive (NV, 9 June 2022). As of 10 June, Russian forces controlled more than half of the city (Luhansk Regional Military Administration, 11 June 2022). In the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, Ukrainian forces claim to have killed dozens of Russian soldiers during airstrikes on Russian bases and ammunition depots (Unian, 10 June 2022; Suspilne Media, 9 June 2022; 24 Channel, 7 June 2022)., Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure killed dozens in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia regions last week. Additionally, landmine explosions in the Donetsk and Kherson regions left at least five civilians dead and three wounded. Russian forces also continue to abduct civilians in the occupied territories, abducting around 20 people from Enerhodar in the Zaporizhia region last week, including 11 employees of the Zaporizhia Hydroelectric Power Plant (Unian, 8 June 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-4-10-june-2022

AT 50th Session of the Human Rights Council, Distinguished President,
Excellencies,, Further to Human Rights Council resolution S-34/1 adopted at its 34th Special Session, I present you with an oral update on the grave human rights and humanitarian situation in Mariupol., Due to the security situation on the ground, my Office does not have access to the territory under control of the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups, including access to Mariupol itself. Nevertheless, my team has been monitoring and documenting the situation by speaking directly with people who left the city; communicating remotely with people who remained in the city; collecting and analyzing publicly available information; and by using satellite imagery., The assessment in this oral update is based on that methodology, in accordance with standard OHCHR practice., Between February and the end of April, Mariupol was likely the deadliest place in Ukraine. The intensity and extent of hostilities, destruction and death and injury strongly suggest that serious violations of international humanitarian law and gross violations of international human rights law have occurred., The city was under siege for over a month. At the final stages, following the mediation efforts of the UN Secretary-General and others and the evacuation of 152 civilians from the Azovstal steel plant, the siege there soon ended., On 30 April, Russian armed forces assumed full control over Mariupol, except for Azovstal plant area., We assess that up to 90 per cent of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as well as up to 60 percent of private houses. An estimated 350,000 people were forced to leave the city. The humanitarian situation is devastating, with civilians continuing to bear the brunt of this conflict., A Russian air attack on the Mariupol drama theatre on 16 March stands out among the very deadliest and most emblematic examples of the harm caused to civilians. The theatre had hundreds of civilians hiding inside with signs clearly marked “children”, visible from the sky., Since the first week of March, hostilities in the Mariupol urban area were characterized by the extensive use of weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from tanks and heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes., Death rates increased over time, as the intensity of the assault grew., To date, OHCHR has verified 1,348 individual civilian deaths directly in hostilities in Mariupol, including 70 children. These deaths were caused by air strikes, tank and artillery shelling and small arms and light weapons during street fighting. The actual death toll of hostilities on civilians is likely thousands higher., Bodies have been found in improvised individual or collective graves in yards, streets, and parks, in unattended houses and apartments. Many are still to be buried., Until all dead bodies are recovered and identified, and their status, whether military or civilian, and the exact causes of death established, it will be impossible to know an accurate number of civilian deaths directly caused by hostilities, and those caused by a lack of food, water, medical care and other effects of living through the hostilities., Russian armed forces began to surround Mariupol in early March, and civilians who tried to leave the city did so at considerable risk. By 10 March, the city was completely encircled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. Evacuations took place throughout the month and people felt compelled to evacuate to whichever direction was possible., The destruction and damage to civilian objects in Mariupol, including civilian housing, has been massive and broad, raising serious concerns about compliance with international humanitarian law, particularly the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks and the requirements of proportionality., All hospitals able to receive injured civilians were damaged or destroyed, including the childcare departments of Mariupol hospital No 3. By the end of March, the damage and destruction coupled with the lack of electricity and medical supplies meant that hospitals had effectively ceased to function., Electricity, gas and water supplies in Mariupol were cut in early March, while it was still icily cold outside. People spent days and nights in cold basements and apartments. Older people and persons with disabilities were often confined to their apartments. Many were killed by shelling, while others burned or were suffocated in fires which could not be extinguished due to a lack of available fire services. Due to a shortage of drinking water, people took long, dangerous trips to wells or open reservoirs to procure such water as could be found. Others were forced to melt snow or to drink water extracted from cars or other equipment., The centralized sewage system ceased to function. Not only were food supplies scarce, but people had to go outside during ongoing fighting and under shelling to cook on open fires., Despite our attempts at verifying, it is not clear to what extent the parties to the conflict complied with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. Civilian survivors shared varying accounts, but most reported that military positions were often placed in the immediate proximity of civilians and civilian objects. Attacks on those positions were common practice. The harm to civilians was extensive., More than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been taken as prisoners of war from Mariupol since early March. My Office received allegations of the killing of a Ukrainian soldier hors de combat in Mariupol, and ill-treatment of several others. In the absence of access to prisoners of war in territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups, my Office has not been able to assess their conditions of detention and treatment., OHCHR is also concerned with alleged trials of three Ukrainian servicepeople (who are also third-country nationals) who were taken as prisoners of war in Mariupol. They were convicted of the attempted seizure of power in territory controlled by Russian-affiliated armed groups in Donetsk, training for terrorist activities and mercenarism, and sentenced to death. I recall the prohibition against prosecuting prisoners of war for conduct in substance amounting to lawful participation in hostilities. I have additional concerns that fair trial guarantees were not complied with, including that the defendants in the cases were not able to present a full defense. The so-called ‘courts’ in this area have long failed to comply with international standards, including the general right to a public hearing, the principles of independence and impartiality and the right not to be compelled to testify against onеself. The deprivation of the right of prisoners of war to a fair and regular trial is prohibited under international law and may amount to a war crime., Distinguished President, Excellencies,, The current situation is dire. The shelling has now faded. But a shattered and depleted city is left, with its remaining residents struggling daily with limited access to basic utilities and social services, such as medical care. Risks of infectious disease, including cholera, are being reported. Many people either no longer have a place to live or live in damaged apartments, often with no windows, electricity, gas and running water. Many people are heavily dependent on humanitarian aid from Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups and do not have means to sustain a livelihood., People cannot leave and return to the city freely, including those who left Mariupol in April or March. I am also concerned about the way the so-called ‘filtration’ process of civilians was and is being carried out, reportedly involving arbitrary determinations, intimidation and humiliation, which may amount to ill-treatment, as well as reported instances of family separation and threats to the right to private life. The related risks of detention and ill-treatment for those who do not pass the process are also of concern., Finally, the removal of explosive remnants of war from the city, and recovery, identification and decent burial of all mortal remains, must be immediately prioritized. The Russian Federation must uphold all of its obligations under applicable international law as the occupying Power in Mariupol., In addition, to guarantee our monitoring is independent and impartial, our human rights teams must have complete and unimpeded access to Mariupol and all other affected areas in Ukraine, as well as effective access to relevant information., The tragedy of Mariupol is far from over, and the full picture of the devastation caused is not yet clear. The city can eventually be rebuilt but, the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come. On the parents who had to bury their own children, on people who witnessed their friends commit suicide, on families ripped apart, on all those who had to leave a much-loved city with uncertain prospects of ever seeing it again., Pursuing justice and ensuring remedy and reparation for all victims are crucial next steps for all authorities with power to so act, and for international actors including my own Office., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-commissioner-updates-human-rights-council-mariupol-ukraine-16-june-2022

This included:, a total of 4,481 killed (1,739 men, 1,159 women, 119 girls, and 125 boys, as well as 40 children and 1,299 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,565 injured (1,133 men, 788 women, 125 girls, and 164 boys, as well as 173 children and 3,182 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,714 casualties (2,611 killed and 3,103 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,820 casualties (2,436 killed and 2,384 injured)

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 14 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 15 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 15 June have been included into the above figures.

Attacks on health care include those against health facilities, transport, personnel, patients, supplies and warehouses. These attacks deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health-care providers, and undermine health systems., • Efforts are ongoing to deliver medical supplies from the WHO supply and logistics base in Lviv to affected oblasts amidst fuel shortages, limited warehouse capacity, and security restrictions due to ongoing military operations. Delivery of life-saving supplies to hard-to-reach locations remains a foremost priority for WHO., • One in four people in Ukraine is over 60, and the impact of the ongoing war on older people, including those with disabilities, has been substantial. Essential life-saving support, as well as necessary evacuation assistance, should be provided to those who have not been able or willing to leave their homes, including those living in care institutions. On 14 June WHO released a joint statement with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and HelpAge International on working towards upholding the rights and safeguard the health and well-being of older people through improving and sustaining health and social care provisions., • Between 13 March and 12 June Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) in Ukraine responded to 4604 outpatient visits, of which 16% (736 outpatient visits) were infectious diseases and 14% (644 outpatient visits) were trauma. Among infectious diseases, the majority (640 outpatient visits) were acute respiratory infections., • As of 14 June at least 641 patients (78% of the requests) have been evacuated for medical reasons from Poland, the Republic of Moldova, Slovakia and Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to 13 European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden)., • Please note that the Ukraine situation report will be produced on a biweekly basis.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emergency-ukraine-external-situation-report-15-published-16-june-2022

Attacks against military enlistment offices continued in Russia. Meanwhile, demonstrators held rallies against fuel price hikes and LGBT+ discrimination in several countries. In France, police shot at civilians who did not stop at a road check., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. The battle for Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region continued, with Russian forces reportedly pulling troops from the Zaporizhia region to support the offensive on Severodonetsk (NV, 9 June 2022). As of 10 June, Russian forces control more than half of the city (Luhansk Regional Military Administration, 11 June 2022). Ukrainian forces maintained control over the Azot Industrial Zone, which shelters hundreds of civilians, and the strategically important Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway (ISW, 10 June 2022; Luhansk Regional Military Administration, 14 June 2022). Intense fighting also continued in the Donetsk region, where Russian forces engaged in offensive operations toward Slovyansk (Suspilne Media, 7 June 2022). In the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, Ukrainian forces claim to have killed dozens of Russian soldiers, including two Russian generals, during airstrikes on Russian bases and ammunition depots (Unian, 10 June 2022; Suspilne Media, 9 June 2022; 24 Channel, 7 June 2022).1, Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure killed dozens of civilians in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia regions last week. Additionally, at least five civilians were killed and three were wounded in landmine explosions in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Russian forces also continue to abduct civilians in the occupied territories, abducting around 20 people from Enerhodar in the Zaporizhia region last week, including 11 employees of the Zaporizhia Hydroelectric Power Plant (Unian, 8 June 2022). Violence in nearly all of these regions is both common and highly volatile, making them areas of ‘extreme risk,’ as flagged by ACLED’s Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., Demonstrations against the war in Ukraine also took place in** Armenia, the** **Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, **and the United Kingdom. In France, people gathered to pay tribute to a French journalist who was killed by Russian shelling in May while covering the conflict in Ukraine (La Croix, 10 June 2022; IPI, 31 May 2022)., In Russia, unknown individuals threw Molotov cocktails at a military enlistment office in Vladivostok and the building of the Russian National Guard in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Attacks on military enlistment offices and other military and police facilities continue amid the government’s efforts to attract more citizens to sign military contracts to fight in Ukraine in recent weeks. This violence contributed to the 108% increase in violence in Russia in the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., Rising fuel prices and living costs continued to spark demonstrations across the region last week, with demonstrations in Albania, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Italy, Poland, **Portugal, **and Spain. In Northern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot labor unions and journalists held demonstrations against rising costs and the government’s reliance on Turkey to address the economic crisis. The demonstrations come as the government signed an economic cooperation protocol with Turkey that — apart from financial support and economic reforms — foresees changes that may affect the right to assemble and the freedom of expression (Cyprus Mail, 10 June 2022)., Amid LGBT+ Pride Month, LGBT+ pride marches and demonstrations in solidarity with the LGBT+ community were held in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, and Switzerland last week., Meanwhile, in France, police shot nine times at a car after the driver refused to comply with an order to stop in the 18th district of Paris. The driver was injured in the shooting, while a woman passenger died in hospital the next day (Revolution Permanente, 6 June 2022).

Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 Jun 2022,"Intense fighting is continuing around the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, which should they fall would effectively put the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian control. The conditions for residents that remain are dire, with near constant shelling and utilities such as water and electricity non-functional., A clearer picture of refugee numbers is emerging as more Ukrainians register for Temporary Protection or similar national protection schemes. Increasing numbers of returns to Ukraine means that the estimated number of Ukrainian refugees in Europe is now put at 4.7 million, with roughly half having moved to countries other than those bordering Ukraine., The number of Internally displaced persons within Ukraine has fallen for the first time and is now estimated to be around 7.134 million. This reduction is in part due to large scale returns to the northern region and to Kyiv. There are still evacuations and new displacements occurring, especially in the eastern region, but numbers are relatively low (in the thousands)., Physical constraints and security issues are threatening humanitarian actors and posing challenges in access to conflict-affected areas. Difficulties also remain in establishing “windows of silence” or arranging safe evacuation corridors for the worst affected populations., In conflict affected areas of Ukraine access to medication remains challenging, especially in Eastern oblasts, with Southern and Northern oblasts also reporting poor access.
Access constraints are primarily due to lack of open or functioning pharmacies, lack of medications, and the high cost of medications. Access to specialised healthcare such as maternal, SRH and GBV services continues to be negatively impacted., Multiple protection risks continue to be highlighted across all affected groups. In areas of conflict and of Russian occupation there are reports of arbitrary detention, torture, extra judicial killings, and GBV. For IDPs there are concerns of a greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse as well as human trafficking as displaced women struggle to meet their basic needs due to loss of income and increasing prices., There is also an increase in intimate partner violence. Third country nationals and minorities such as Roma and LGBTIQ+ people face additional barriers in accessing support as well as continued discrimination and increased protection risks., The additional challenges faced by displaced older persons is putting them at increased risk. Older persons are more likely to have chronic illnesses requiring medication, they are more likely to face mobility issues or to have a disability. Many survive off very low incomes which are inadequate to meet their basic needs, especially as prices rise and they have limited access to their normal support networks., Cash or financial assistance is the preferred assistance modality across all affected groups, although there is a lack of data for some of the worst affected areas in conflict zones., Concerns are rising that unsustainable accommodation solutions in most of the neighbouring countries will put refugees at risk in the near future as housing availability is decreasing and financial government assistance will soon come to an end.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-07-june-2022
Reparations for Ukraine: An international route map,Analysis,Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights,Protection and Human Rights,16 Jun 2022,"To bring justice to Ukraine's civilians and enable them to rebuild their lives will require reparations. But while firm progress has been made on instituting war crimes investigations following the Russian invasion, international planning for the delivery of reparations has lagged behind, finds a major new report by Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights., Reparations for Ukraine: An international route map considers the international legal authority for grounding reparations and what form they should take. It then maps out the mechanisms that could be entrusted to take on the task of awarding and administering reparations on the scale required -- and how Russia could be made to contribute. In the light of international precedents and what has worked in other conflict and post-conflict situations, the report proposes a number of principles which should guide the process., 'Civilians in Ukraine have suffered the full force of Russia's invasion, but the experience of other conflicts shows us just how easily civilians can be forgotten by the international community when it comes to reconstruction and stabilization', said Mark Lattimer, Ceasefire's Executive Director. 'Members of the EU, the G7 and the UN General Assembly have both the power and access to the resources to deliver reparations for civilians. What are they waiting for?', Ukrainian civil society organisations have long called for the implementation of an effective compensation mechanism for the victims of war and occupation. Given the extensive preparatory work which needs to be done, civilians who have suffered harm cannot afford to wait for a resolution to the conflict. In order to establish an effective reparations process for Ukraine, it is imperative that the international community avoids further delay.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/reparations-ukraine-international-route-map

Military action targeting the north, south, and east of Ukraine - including major population centres such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and Mariupol - have caused massive displacement, widespread damage to public and private infrastructure, significant disruption to essential services, and many civilians killed or wounded., Prior to the invasion, the UN 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan had identified 2.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. As of 23 May 2022, the IOM estimated that over 7 million people have been internally displaced, living in collective sites or in private accommodation. In addition to IDPs who require urgent support in displacement, there is an additional population of approximately 12 million people in areas directly under conflict, who require immediate assistance in Ukraine., In response to this crisis, the number of actors in the humanitarian response, and the funds dedicated to this response, has rapidly increased. The rapid scale up of the response heightens the need for improved coordination. In addition, current data shows that the humanitarian needs provoked by the crisis are multi-sectoral (affecting not only immediate basic needs but social cohesion, provision of public services, and local economies) and varied across the different areas of the country., REACH aims to respond to this need via area-based assessments at the Oblast level. For each assessed Oblast, REACH will produce a multi-sectoral, area-based analysis of the Oblast and a map of local actors. Finally, REACH will collaborate with local actors including authorities to produce a localised priority plan.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/research-terms-reference-area-based-assessments-displacement-affected-oblasts-ukraine-ukr2210-may-2022-version-1

"Background Briefing: Landmine Use in Ukraine, June 2022 [EN/RU/UK]",Analysis,HRW,Mine Action,15 Jun 2022,"Ukraine: Russian Landmine Use Endangers Civilians, Banned Weapon Threatens Lives, Food Production, (Geneva, June 15, 2022) – Russian forces are using landmines in Ukraine that are causing civilian casualties and suffering, as well as disrupting food production, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Russia is the only party to the conflict known to have used banned antipersonnel mines, while both Russia and Ukraine have used anti-vehicle mines., The 19-page report, “Landmine Use in Ukraine,” details seven types of antipersonnel mines that Russian forces in Ukraine are known to have used since the February 24, 2022 all-out invasion. Ukraine appears to be abiding by its obligations as a member of the international treaty prohibiting antipersonnel mines, which it ratified in December 2005., “Russia’s brazen use of antipersonnel mines in a country that has explicitly prohibited these weapons is unprecedented and deserves strong global condemnation,” said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch, chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, 1997 Nobel Peace Laureate. “Antipersonnel landmines should never be used due to their inevitable and long-term threat to civilian life and livelihoods.”, Antipersonnel mines are designed to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person. They violate international humanitarian law because they cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants. Russia has not joined the 164 countries that have ratified the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which comprehensively bans antipersonnel mines, and requires destruction of stock, clearance of mined areas, and assistance to victims., Several types of landmines produced by state-owned manufacturers in Russia have been used in combat for the first time in Ukraine, Human Rights Watch said. One made in 2021 is the rocket deployed POM-3 antipersonnel mine, which when activated launches to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters then detonates midair, producing fragments that are lethal up to about 16 meters away. The mine is equipped with a sensitive seismic fuze that makes it prone to detonate when approached, as well as a self-destruct feature that sets the mine to explode after a certain period., During the current armed conflict, both Russian and Ukrainian forces also appear to have used anti-vehicle mines, which are designed to damage or destroy vehicles including tanks and armored fighting vehicles. The Mine Ban Treaty does not prohibit anti-vehicle mines or command-detonated (remote-controlled) mines, while other international agreements provide weak restrictions on their use., Evidence indicates that landmine use is affecting agricultural production in Ukraine. The use of farm vehicles in fields and on rural paths and roads has become a high-risk activity in Ukraine. In one incident, a farm employee was wounded while ploughing fields near Kharkiv city in mid-May, when his tractor detonated a TM-62 antivehicle mine placed by Russian forces. Local residents told Human Rights Watch that when the Russian forces withdrew from the area, they did not clear the mines, mark the area, provide any warnings to avoid it, or share any maps of mined locations., There is evidence that Russian forces in Ukraine have also laid victim-activated booby-traps. The Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively prohibits, in all circumstances, all types of victim-activated explosive devices regardless of their technical features, predicted longevity, delivery method, or type of manufacture (improvised or factory-made)., In 2014-2015, Russia-backed forces in eastern Ukraine used landmines in Donetsk and Luhansk regions and sporadically in the following years. There is no credible information that Ukrainian government forces used antipersonnel mines in the previous conflict or current one., Human Rights Watch has documented the use of Soviet and Russian-made antipersonnel mines in more than 30 countries, including Libya. New research shows that the Wagner Group, a private Russian military security contractor with apparent links to Russia’s government, transferred antipersonnel mines into Libya, where they were used in Tripoli in 2019-2020, causing civilian casualties., Russia should cease all use of inherently indiscriminate antipersonnel mines in Ukraine, and Ukraine should ensure that its forces continue to respect their obligations under the Mine Ban Treaty., “Developing and producing landmines that most countries have rejected is a morally reprehensible investment,” Goose said. “Mines set to self-destruct at random intervals only increase the risk of civilian harm, especially for deminers tasked with safely destroying them.”, “Landmine Use in Ukraine” will be presented to countries attending a meeting of the Mine Ban Treaty in Geneva on June 20-22, 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/background-briefing-landmine-use-ukraine-june-2022-enruuk
UN’s Bachelet concerned over Ukraine orphans ‘deported’ to Russia for adoption,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,15 Jun 2022,"The UN’s top rights official expressed her concern on Wednesday at reports that Ukrainian children have been “forcibly deported” from the country’s embattled eastern regions, and taken to Russia for adoption., Michelle Bachelet told the Human Rights Council that her Office, OHCHR, has been looking into the allegations that youngsters have been taken from orphanages in Donbas, where Russia has steadily gained ground amidst intense fighting in recent weeks., ""OHCHR cannot yet confirm these allegations or the number of children who could be in such a situation,"" Ms. Bachelet said. ""We are concerned about the alleged plans of the Russian authorities to allow the movement of children from Ukraine to families in the Russian Federation, which do not appear to include steps for family reunification or respect the best interests of the child."", Institutional care, Before the Russian invasion on 24 February, there were more than 91,000 children in Ukraine's orphanages, boarding schools and other institutions for youngsters, according to UN Children's Fund UNICEF., In a statement, the UN agency said that it was aware of reports that Russia ""may be modifying existing legislation to facilitate the fast-tracking of adoption"" of orphans from the Donbas., ""UNICEF is of the view that adoption should never occur during or immediately after emergencies. Children separated from their parents during a humanitarian emergency cannot be assumed to be orphans. Every opportunity should be provided for family reunification."", Probe latest, At a press conference in Kyiv on Wednesday, the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine - created at the request of Member States in March by the Human Rights Council - said that testimonies it had received indicated that ""there is a significant number of children disappeared in temporarily occupied territories, particularly children from institutions""., For the moment, however, there is ""not clear evidence"" on the number of missing youngsters from State-run centres, and it is very difficult to confirm reports that they have been taken to Russia and given citizenship, said Jasminka Dzumhur, one of three investigators making up the panel., At a scheduled press conference in the Ukrainian capital to mark the investigators' first visit to the country, Commission of Inquiry chairman Erik Mose said that the panel had travelled to Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy, sites of suspected war crimes., Painful testimony, ""In Bucha and Irpin, the Commission received information about arbitrary killing of civilians, destruction and looting of property, as well as attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools,"" Mr. Mose said., ""In Kharkiv and Sumy region, the Commission observed the destruction of large urban areas, allegedly as a consequence of aerial bombings, shelling, or missile strikes against civilian targets."", In accordance with its mandate, the Commission also heard accounts from internally displaced persons including those from eastern Ukraine which it intends to examine further., These testimonies included ""stories of destruction of civilian property, looting, the confinement, mistreatment and disappearance of civilians, as well as reports about rapes and other forms of sexual abuse,"" said Commission member Ms. Dzumhur., Describing the panel's 10 days of work as ""productive"", Mr. Mose noted that individuals had shared their ""painful stories"" which if confirmed, ""may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed in the areas""., In coming weeks and months, the Commission will visit other areas of Ukraine before updating the Human Rights Council in September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/uns-bachelet-concerned-over-ukraine-orphans-deported-russia-adoption

Protection and Human Rights",15 Jun 2022,"Erik Møse, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, On behalf of the Commission of Inquiry for Ukraine, composed of Erik Møse (chair), Jasminka Džumhur and Pablo de Greiff, I want to welcome you to this press conference at the end of the Commission’s first visit to the country., The Human Rights Council set up the Commission to investigate alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, with a view to ensuring accountability. On 12 May 2022, the Human Rights Council also requested the Commission to address events that took place in late February and March in four specific regions of Ukraine. Consequently, the Commission has, during this ten-day long visit to Ukraine given priority to Kyiv city, Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy., In Kyiv, we met with representatives of the Ukrainian parliament, several ministries, and the Prosecutor General, whom we had also met previously. The purpose of these encounters was to exchange information of relevance to the Commission’s mandate and to facilitate future investigations. We also met several Ukrainian NGOs that provided valuable inputs to our work., During the visits to Bucha, Irpin, Kharkiv and Sumy, the Commission met with local authorities as well as civil society organizations, both of which provided significant assistance. Furthermore, the Commission received accounts from individuals who shared their painful stories., Although far from fully staffed, the Commission’s first visit was very productive. At this stage we are not in a position to make any factual findings or pronounce ourselves on issues of the legal determination of events. However, subject to further confirmation, the information received and the visited sites of destruction may support claims that serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, perhaps reaching war crimes and crimes against humanity, have been committed in the areas., In Bucha and Irpin, the Commission received information about arbitrary killing of civilians, destruction and looting of property, as well as attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools. In Kharkiv and Sumy region, the Commission observed the destruction of large urban areas, allegedly as a consequence of aerial bombings, shelling, or missile strikes against civilian targets., Jasminka Džumhur, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, The Commission also had the opportunity to listen to internally displaced persons, including those coming from the East of Ukraine, who referred to displacement of people. Testimonies also included stories of destruction of civilian property; looting; the confinement, mistreatment, and disappearance of civilians, as well as reports about rapes and other forms of sexual abuse. The Commission will examine all these allegations further., The Commission is concerned with the impact of the war on children. It considers it necessary to investigate further reports about the alleged transfer of children placed in institutions in the temporarily occupied territories to the Russian Federation as well as information about expedited citizenship and adoption processes for some of these children. In Ukraine, many displaced children have been separated from families. The physical destruction of schools and their use for the accommodation of IDPs raises challenges concerning the children’s access to education., The Commission has previously stated that it would adopt a victim-centred perspective on its work, and that it would be faithful to its mandate, which asks it to make proposals regarding accountability. Criminal accountability is important, but so are other forms of accountability, including those that enhance the possibility that victims will be able to reconstruct their lives., The Government of Ukraine is making efforts to meet the diverse needs of victims. While there are areas where greater institutional coordination is probably desirable, doing so while the conflict is ongoing poses particular challenges., Pablo de Greiff, Member of Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, The first visit of the Commission will be followed by visits to other parts of Ukraine before the Commission’s oral update to the Human Rights Council in September this year., We will continue with the process of collecting evidence that may serve accountability purposes; whenever possible identifying individuals or entities, and will pay special attention to violations of a sexual nature, of the rights of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations., The Commission will carry out its work independently, neutrally, and objectively, examining violations and abuses regardless of the identity of the perpetrator. We hope that all parties to the conflict will assist the Commission in its work., Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to the Government of Ukraine for facilitating our mission, to Ukrainian civil society organisations, victims and witnesses, and to the various United Nations agencies for their kind collaboration. The Commission also wants to thank the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Ukraine for their indispensable collaboration to the visit., More information on the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/opening-statement-press-conference-commission-inquiry-ukraine-conclusion-its-first-visit-ukraine-kyiv-ukraine-15-june-2022

This included:, a total of 4,452 killed (1,712 men, 1,144 women, 107 girls, and 106 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,316 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,531 injured (1,130 men, 785 women, 124 girls, and 163 boys, as well as 172 children and 3,157 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,668 casualties (2,583 killed and 3,085 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,786 casualties (2,414 killed and 2,372 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 882 casualties (169 killed and 713 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,315 casualties (1,869 killed and 2,446 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 13 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 14 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 14 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-14-june-2022-enruuk
UNICEF briefing note on the situation of children in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",15 Jun 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's daily press briefing at the UN Headquarters in New York, As prepared for delivery, NEW YORK, 14 June 2022 – “I spent last week in Ukraine, meeting with children and families affected by the war, seeing UNICEF’s critical humanitarian response and meeting with authorities, UN colleagues and partner organisations., “I was able to visit Kyiv, Irpin, Bucha, Zhytomyr and Lviv, and the time I spent in the country provided a clear view of the huge impact the war in Ukraine continues to have on children, both inside and outside the country; both in the region and across the world., “The numbers are staggering, and bear repeating. Nearly two-thirds of Ukraine’s children are displaced – whether displaced inside the country or those who have fled across borders as refugees. Children forced to leave homes, friends, toys and treasured belongings, family members and facing uncertainty about the future. This instability is robbing children of their futures – trauma and fear can have long-lasting impacts on children’s physical and mental health., “According to the latest figures from colleagues at OHCHR, 277 children have been killed, with another 456 children injured, mostly due to the use of explosives in built-up, urban areas. This use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on civilian infrastructure must stop. It is killing and maiming children and preventing them returning to any kind of normal life in the towns and cities that are their homes., “At least 256 attacks on health care facilities and one in six UNICEF-supported ‘safe schools’ in the east of the country have been damaged or destroyed., “We are increasingly concerned about the situation with access to safe water with at least 1.4 million in the east without access to running water., “As these numbers show, the war in Ukraine is a child rights crisis, and UNICEF is working to support children and families wherever they are in the country. This critical role of UNICEF in Ukraine is reflected in the agreement recently reached with the government to extend UNICEF’s country programme until the end of 2023, as part of the UN’s transitional framework., “After more than three and a half months of war, UNICEF and partners are taking stock of the humanitarian response so far and directing efforts in the next period to those areas most in need. We have been in Ukraine since 1997 and have stayed throughout the escalation of the conflict to deliver support and protect the lives of children and families. To date, UNICEF has reached over 2 million people with health supplies and access to safe drinking water. More than 600,000 children & caregivers have received mental health and psychosocial support and more than 180,000 children have been engaged in formal and community-based learning., “We have partners on both sides of the contact lines who work to reach children with critical information and life-saving supplies and services. We have activated the rapid response missions in the east of the country, closest to the fighting, and as a result, we have assisted families in over 100 shelters close to the front lines and in hard-to-reach locations. However, despite intensive efforts to ensure safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access, significant challenges remain in the most affected areas across the country, and we continue to call for safe, unfettered access to reach children wherever they may be., “In central and western parts of the country, where it is currently a little more stable, we provide support and strengthen the services and local authorities that are already there, such as local authorities and NGOs. One example is the Spilno (Together) Child Spots – places where parents and their children can go to access support services including therapy and psychosocial support, gain supplies and information, and have a chance to give their children safe play and normality, whilst they sit with other parents, and gain some brief relief and guided peer support. I saw how critical this support is at a Spilno centre in Bucha, where the staff estimated that half of children attending required psychosocial support of some kind., “In Irpin, I visited two schools damaged in the fighting, putting the education of almost 2,000 children at risk when the new school year begins in September. Whilst we do not have verified figures for the number of damaged schools in the country, the figure is likely to be in the thousands. Repairing schools is a priority for UNICEF and the government so children can return to safe-blended- learning in September., “Thanks to the generous support of governments, companies, and individuals we can continue this work across the country and region, including humanitarian cash transfers to extremely vulnerable families., “Ultimately, as important as this work is, children need peace., “UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and to protect all children from harm. Every day that this war continues, is increasing the long-lasting, devastating impact on children, in Ukraine, in the region and across the world.”, Media contacts, Joe English

Joint Statement on the Situation of Older Persons in Ukraine,News and Press Release,HelpAge,Protection and Human Rights,15 Jun 2022,"Since the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, we have witnessed a devastating escalation of violence which has resulted in the large-scale displacement of close to 14 million people—within Ukraine, into neighbouring countries and well beyond. This is the largest refugee outflow in Europe since World War II., Everyone living in Ukraine has felt the impact of this war, but in a country where one in four people is over 60, the impact on older persons, including those with disabilities, has been dramatic. In the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts alone—where some of the most intense fighting has taken place—an estimated 30 per cent of the population is made up of older persons., To say that the health, rights and well-being of older persons are in danger is an understatement. The long-term impacts in this regard began as far back as 2014 in the initial years of this long-running crisis. Amid ongoing warfare, older persons encounter ever-increasing challenges accessing pensions, healthcare and other basic services., In areas of intense fighting, all age groups, including older persons, face serious threats to their lives. However, older persons who have chosen to remain in their homes are often confronted with specific challenges in finding appropriate shelter, basic necessities and supplies due to infirmity, small social networks, lack of digital literacy, etc. This harsh reality must be addressed urgently., The war has also brought forced separation and isolation. Those older persons who have relocated to other areas within Ukraine have undertaken arduous journeys, beset with risk, lacking access to basic health care and other needs while on the move—all while being away from their families and loved ones. Many of those who have remained in their own towns have also experienced limited access to services and a breakdown of their social networks., Furthermore, those who have managed to flee to neighbouring countries face an uncertain future, with few options to earn an income, often managing chronic health conditions, and without knowing when or if they will ever be able to go home., Not least, the war has also placed a spotlight on the heightened challenges faced by women and girls, including older women. Sixty per cent of people over 60 years old who have been affected by the war are women. Fears about their safety, health requirements and their financial and economic needs should urge everyone involved in the humanitarian response to act., Since the start of the war, local and national authorities, humanitarian actors and UN agencies have been on the ground, providing invaluable support to civilians affected by the violence—including older persons. But as the war enters its fourth month, it is crucial that these efforts do not lose momentum, given the many needs of those directly affected., That is why we, as members of the Joint Programme on Ageing—which advocates for the strengthening of rights and the safeguarding of dignity of older men and women—are calling on all humanitarian and other actors to pay special attention to older persons and their specific needs, whether they choose to stay in place or are on the move., Essential life-saving support, as well as necessary evacuation assistance, should be provided to those who have not been able or willing to leave their homes, including those living in care institutions. Older persons who have left the main war zones must also have their specific health and humanitarian needs met through access to a full package of basic services including food and water, appropriate shelter, healthcare, essential medicines and assistive technologies, mental health and psycho-social support, along with other entitlements such as access to pensions, transport and information., Both during peacetime and amid crises, the Joint Programme on Ageing works to uphold the rights and safeguard the health and wellbeing of older men and women through improving and sustaining health and social care provisions. This means that, even as this overwhelming crisis unfolds, we will continue to collaborate with partners to ensure person-centred health and social care for older people—regardless of where they may be., The risk to older persons in Ukraine is real and must not be neglected.

World Risk Poll: Spotlight on Ukraine and Russia,Analysis,IEP,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",15 Jun 2022,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, The Lloyd’s Register Foundation World Risk Poll, when combined with associated data from the Gallup World Poll and a number of other sources, reveals a complex and sometimes counterintuitive view of the world for both Ukrainians and Russians prior to the Russian invasion in 2022., Ukrainian citizens’ positive sentiments on a number of questions on social wellbeing were on the rise at a time when global averages were in decline., In the lead-up to the invasion, Ukrainians’ perceptions of safety and security were improving, with the percentage of people reporting feeling safer than five years prior rising from 19 to 26 per cent, bringing it closer to the global average. This represents a major increase, especially as it came at a time when the global average fell markedly, from 36 to 27.4 per cent, and for Russians the rate fell from 19.2 to 17.4 per cent., The conflict has unfolded within the context of Ukraine’s increasing socio-political reorientation toward the West. By November 2021, 58 per cent of Ukrainians said that, if the country were to join just one economic union, it should join the European Union (EU), compared to 21 per cent that said it should join the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. This was the highest rating ever recorded. Similarly, 54 per cent said they would vote to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), compared to 28 per cent who would vote against joining., Surprisingly, “war and terrorism” was only the sixth highest-rated concern in Ukraine in 2021. Ukrainians rated health-related risks (not including COVID-19) as their top concern. Transportation-related risks, crime and violence, economic concerns and financial hardship were more frequently cited than “war and terrorism”., Additionally, levels of both life satisfaction and optimism about the future were on the rise in Ukraine. Optimism was assessed by measuring the percentage of people foreseeing the “best possible” life conditions for themselves five years in the future. Globally, optimism slightly deteriorated between 2019 and 2021, from 16.6 to 16.1 per cent. In contrast, in both Ukraine and Russia, the score markedly improved, with the Ukrainian score more than doubling and the Russian score increasing by roughly a third. In 2021, the score for both countries was 19.5, several points above the global average., Overall life satisfaction also increased substantially, with the percentage of Ukrainians rating their lives positively, increasing from 28.7 per cent to 41.3 per cent. In Russia, overall life satisfaction also improved, though by a much smaller margin, rising from 42.2 per cent to 46.4 per cent., However, the survey question to show the largest deterioration in Russia was concern over economicrelated issues, where the percentage of people rating this as their top issue rose nearly threefold between 2019 and 2021, indicating that Russians were becoming increasing concerned about the economy prior to the invasion., In contrast to the perceptions of a positive future, Ukrainians’ faith in their government and elections deteriorated substantially between 2019 and 2021. Distrust in government rose from 45.1 to 68.2 per cent, while perceptions of dishonesty in elections rose from 36.1 to 61.1 per cent. The overall drop in Ukrainian confidence in the national government aligns with the generally declining trend in approval for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which fell from a high of more than 70 per cent in September 2019 to just over 30 per cent in 2021., One of the more striking results from the study was the lack of faith Ukrainians had in their government to deal with a disaster. In 2021, only 20.3 per cent of the population believed that the government could effectively manage a disaster. This compared to 47.6 per cent in Russia and 50.5 per cent globally. However, Ukrainian confidence in the military was relatively strong, with 67.4 per cent of citizens expressing confidence in the military. Russia had an even higher levels of confidence, with 72.5 per cent of the population expressing confidence in the military, though both of these levels were lower than the global average of 76.7 per cent., Findings on the popularity of President Putin may give some insight into his thinking towards the war. In Russia, President Putin’s popularity has always been high. However, Putin’s highest popularity ratings occurred when Russia invaded Georgia and following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. A similar jump in approval occurred following the invasion of Ukraine, with his popularity rising from 63 to 83 per cent between November 2021 and May 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-risk-poll-spotlight-ukraine-and-russia

Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Jun 2022,"Introduction and methodology, Since the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, over 8 million people have been displaced internally across the country. In early April, further escalation was reported in the Eastern part of the country, causing more damages to infrastructure and disruptions in access to services in affected areas, as well as additional displacement. To inform humanitarian actors, REACH launched a Humanitarian Situation Monitoring initiative across conflict-affected settlements and in areas hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs). After a baseline round of data collection (‘Rapid Needs Assessment’), REACH launched a second round of data collection, focused specifically on conflict-affected areas (CAA) in the East and South, as well as a selection of IDP-hosting settlements along evacuation routes or in key arrival hubs. Following the second round of data collection a third round of data collection was launched in government-controlled areas (GCA), covering both conflict-affected and IDP-hosting areas., Data collection for the third round was conducted between 2 May and 16 May through 515 telephone interviews with non-government organisation (NGO) and local authority key informants (KIs). 103 settlements (towns or villages) were selected for data collection. Settlement selection criteria included being among the 10 most populous settlements in specific oblast, not including settlements with a population size under 30,000. Enumerators aimed to interview 5 different KIs per settlement. KI responses were aggregated at settlement level. This brief provides key findings in conflict-affected settlements in GCA. In addition, it provides an overview of IDP-needs for those conflict-affected settlements that reported IDP presence., While the current assessment was conducted in conflict-affected areas in GCA, concurrent data collection was conducted in non-government-controlled areas (NGCA). The findings of this assessment can be found in a separate factsheet (available upon request)., Key highlights, Needs in conflict-affected areas, • Among assessed settlements in conflict-affected areas, concerns were reported across almost all measured indicators in Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Avdiivka, Toretsk, Lysychansk, and Kharkiv. This indicates that humanitarian needs might be particularly high in these specific settlements., • Most frequently reported concerns across assessed conflict-affected settlements were disruptions to transportation and fuel, arrival of displaced persons, disruption to work or livelihoods, access to financial services (cash, banks, or ATMs), disruption to child welfare (including family separation), as well as safety concerns., • While disruptions to transportation and fuel were the top concerns across almost all conflict-affected settlements, car fuel was also the most frequently reported need by KIs in these settlements, followed by financial resources and medicine., • Ongoing conflict in assessed settlements such as Rubizhne, Toretsk, Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, compounded by reporting of restrictions to movement have likely further deteriorated the humanitarian situation in these settlements., Needs in IDP-hosting areas, • A reportedly large influx of IDPs in central and western oblasts have likely put additional pressure on resources and services, which is in line with KIs reporting an increase in rental prices in these oblasts, • Most frequently reported concerns across assessed IDP-hosting settlements were access to employment, provision of accommodation, access to food, as well as access to baby products, and hygiene products.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-june-2022
"Ukraine: Commission presents guidance to help people fleeing war access jobs, training and adult learning",News and Press Release,EC,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jun 2022,"Since the beginning of Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine and its civilians, over 7 million people have fled Ukraine and reached the EU. So far, only a relatively small number of those of working age have entered the EU labour market, though the number of people wanting to do so is expected to rise., Ensuring a swift and effective integration into the labour market is important both for host communities and for those fleeing the war to rebuild their lives, continue developing their skills and, eventually, support reconstruction in Ukraine., Understanding and recognising the skills and formal qualifications that people bring is critical to ease their entry into the labour market and make sure they get a job that corresponds to their skills. Moreover, improving existing skills and acquiring new ones is essential for successfully participating in the labour market and society., Today's guidance:, a. to integrate people arriving from Ukraine into the labour market; and, b. support their access to vocational education and training (VET) and adult learning., The guidance covers both people eligible for temporary protection under the Temporary Protection Directive as well as those eligible for adequate protection under national law., Access to jobs and training, As part of today's guidance, the Commission invites Member States to:, a. encouraging those arriving in the EU to register with local Public Employment Services;, b. reflecting the needs of people fleeing the war in the work of national authorities and employment services (e.g. paying particular attention to labour market access for women and access to childcare and school education; recruiting people in sectors with shortages of workers, or where they could support others arriving from Ukraine);, c. providing support to employers hiring people fleeing, and allowances for the creation of start-ups; and, d. opening up entrepreneurship support programmes to new arrivals., Recognising existing skills and investing in new ones, As part of today's guidance, the Commission invites Member States to:, The Commission has made a number of tools available in Ukrainian under the Europass platform. This will help Ukrainian-speaking users create CVs, test their digital skills, send applications and find job and training offers in the EU. In addition, the Ukrainian translation of the European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences and Occupations (ESCO) will be available shortly., Support from EU Funds, EU funds can support Member States' measures to provide access to the labour market, VET and adult learning. This includes funding from the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD), and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). InvestEU, the Technical Support Instrument, and Erasmus+ can also help., Today's guidance features several concrete examples of EU-funded projects supporting labour market integration, such as:, Next steps, Member States are invited to continue their efforts to support those fleeing Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and facilitate their integration into the labour market, including by making the best use of the support available at EU level. The Commission stands ready to work with national authorities and other relevant stakeholders further and will continue to provide guidance in light of the evolving situation., Background, The EU's welcome to those fleeing Russia's war of aggression is epitomised by the unanimous activation – for the first time in history – of the EU's Temporary Protection Directive, which grants beneficiaries with an immediate secure status characterised by access to a residence permit, housing, schools, healthcare and jobs. Under this directive, people fleeing the war have the right to access the labour market, to educational opportunities for adults, and to VET and practical workplace experience. The Communication on ‘Welcoming those fleeing the war in Ukraine' from 23 March encouraged Member States to extend access to the EU labour market to beneficiaries of adequate protection under national law. Today's Communication invites Member States to extend access to VET and adult learning to beneficiaries of adequate protection under national law as well. Adequate protection is an alternative to temporary protection that may be offered by Member States to third country nationals who were legally residing in Ukraine and fled because of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine., The new guidance complements and builds on the variety of measures already taken at EU level to assist people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many of which the Commission outlined in a Communication in March. In particular, the Commission presented operational guidelines to support Member States in applying the Temporary Protection Directive, a recommendation to help professionally qualified refugees access jobs in the EU, and a 10-Point Plan on stronger European coordination on welcoming people fleeing the war against Ukraine. In addition, various initiatives make it easier for Member States to make full use of the available EU funds, notably the “Cohesion's Action for Refugees in Europe” (CARE)regulation.

"Communication, community engagement and accountability across the Ukraine response, A snapshot, May 2022",Assessment,CDAC,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",14 Jun 2022,"Background, The invasion of Ukraine has created the biggest displacement crisis in Europe since the second world war. By the 10 May 2022, approximately 5.9 million refugee movements had been recorded out of Ukraine, with a further 8 million people internally displaced. The flows are complex, with 1.5 million movements back into Ukraine reported and an estimated 2.4 million refugees having travelled beyond the countries bordering Ukraine. The majority of current refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) are women, children and older people, making protection and safeguarding key considerations of the ongoing response., Every affected person – whether in-country or a refugee (Ukrainian or third-country national) – requires information to make important decisions and communicate with friends, family and people providing aid. Yet there is significant evidence that two-way communication and engagement with communities can be the weakest link in complex humanitarian responses.2 Three months on from the start of the invasion, there are indications that this is the case in the Ukraine response., As part of CDAC Network’s efforts to ensure predictable and coherent engagement with communities and to drive change in communication, community engagement and accountability (CCEA) policy and practices, it has undertaken a rapid review of the state of CCEA in the Ukraine response., This report provides a snapshot of the current CCEA structures and services being provided by Network members and partner organisations in Ukraine and border countries. It also outlines recommendations for improvement regarding the consolidation of responder efforts and the drive for more inclusive and locally led CCEA, and provides suggestions to address CCEA gaps., The report is informed by continuous engagement with CDAC Network members since 24 February 2022; key informant interviews held in Poland between 3–6 May 2022; email correspondence between 3–13 May 2022 with response actors operating in Ukraine and border countries; CDAC community of practice (CoP) calls on in-country coordination and collaboration held in early March; and desk research of publicly available information. For a full list of organisations consulted for this report, see the Annex., This report is a living document and will be updated regularly with the most recent CCEA initiatives by operational partners, and an ongoing assessment of gaps and areas for improvement., Last updated: 30 May 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/communication-community-engagement-and-accountability-across-ukraine-response-snapshot-may-2022

This included:, a total of 4,432 killed (1,693 men, 1,138 women, 103 girls, and 106 boys, as well as 68 children and 1,324 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,499 injured (1,123 men, 780 women, 124 girls, and 159 boys, as well as 173 children and 3,140 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,637 casualties (2,571 killed and 3,066 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 4,762 casualties (2,403 killed and 2,359 injured),  On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 875 casualties (168 killed and 707 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,294 casualties (1,861 killed and 2,433 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 12 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 13 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 13 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-13-june-2022-enru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Jun 2022,"June 14, 2022, DURHAM, N.C., USA—The global human development organization FHI 360 is launching new initiatives in Ukraine to address the growing risks of human trafficking and gender-based violence and to provide case management support for survivors., “In any crisis where large numbers of people are on the move, particularly large numbers of women and unaccompanied children traveling alone, predators will try to take advantage,” says Carly Owens, a protection specialist at FHI 360. “In the case of Ukraine, we are deeply concerned because the human sex trafficking rates were high in Eastern Europe prior to the war. The trafficking networks are already in place. It is vital that displaced women and children are able to see the warning signs and seek help.”, FHI 360 is providing group therapy for women in several collective shelters in western Ukraine, where 2.9 of the 8 million total displaced persons (UN OCHA) have thus far sought refuge from the violence of war. Team members are distributing dignity kits equipped with hygiene supplies, flashlights and whistles, and are disseminating educational materials to raise awareness of risks of sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking as well as resources for survivors. The organization is also installing washer-dryer units in the shelters., “There is rightfully a lot of attention on allegations of sexual violence as a weapon of war,” Owens says. “But we frequently see rising rates of trafficking and all forms of gender-based violence in conflict. This is just a such a ripe environment for exploitation. We cannot turn away from that.”, FHI 360 has been working in Ukraine since 2012, partnering with institutions of higher education and supporting local organizations in their efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic., About FHI 360:, FHI 360 is a nonprofit human development organization dedicated to improving lives in lasting ways by advancing integrated, locally driven solutions. Our staff includes experts in health, education, nutrition, environment, economic development, civil society, gender equality, youth, research, technology, communication and social marketing — creating a unique mix of capabilities to address today’s interrelated development challenges.

Migration tendency in eastern Ukraine: Negative trends in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts,Analysis,UNCT Ukraine,Protection and Human Rights,31 Aug 2018,"About USE, The UN Social Cohesion and Reconciliation Index for Eastern Ukraine (USE) is an analytical tool designed to improve the understanding of societal dynamics in government-controlled areas (GCA) of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and neighboring Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. This helps to identify strategic entry points for policies and programs that contribute to strengthening social cohesion., USE is based on the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation (SCORE) Index methodology, which was originally developed in Cyprus by the Center for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development and UNDP. The initiative in Ukraine is jointly implemented by three UN entities, UNDP, UNICEF and IOM, under the overall direction of the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, and is one of the UN’s evidence-based knowledge products for joint analysis and programming in Ukraine., USE is implemented on an annual basis and consists of two components: one component captures the views of 6,000 adults residing in the five oblasts in eastern Ukraine, including along the GCA side of the contact line; the other component captures the views of adolescents in Donetsk and Luhansk GCAs. The USE conceptual model comprises more than 70 indicators, each measured through multiple questionnaire items., Conceptualization and analysis of the data has been done in consultations with government and civil society representatives in Kyiv and in each of the five oblasts.

Reintegrating ATO & JFO Veterans (January 2022),Assessment,SeeD,Recovery and Reconstruction,31 Jan 2022,"Upon their return from the conflict, many ATO/JFO veterans in Ukraine find it difficult to return to their pre-conflict lives. Major challenges they often face include economic and social reintegration, responding to conflict-related trauma, navigating a complex system of provisions and services, receiving psychosocial rehabilitation, and re-connecting with their communities and social networks. Failing to reintegrate veterans (ATO/JFO veterans and veterans will be used in the report interchangeably) puts them at risk of social exclusion, economic insecurity, and mental health issues. Such chronic challenges can lead to an increased risk of radicalisation and exacerbates social cohesion in the country., The present study aims to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the current challenges that ATO/JFO veterans in Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr oblasts experience post-deployment, by comparing them to a sample of citizens coming from the same oblasts. Specifically, the current study focuses on the challenges of economic security and employment, mental health, intergroup relations and social inclusion, citizenship, and political attitudes. It presents evidence-based recommendations by which policymakers and other relevant stakeholders can facilitate ATO/JFO veterans’ reintegration into their communities and into Ukrainian society in general., SCORE results show that unemployment is higher among veterans, particularly among young male veterans living in small towns and rural areas. Further, results show that veterans experience higher levels of aggression relative to the comparable sample, while female veterans in particular are more likely to face depression. Analyses identify factors that underlie these mental health chal-lenges and reveal entry points for intervention. SCORE results also show that veterans are not feeling particularly alienated from their communities, however they tend to report increased tensions with groups that seemingly hold divergent views about the conflict (e.g., people living in NGCAs)., Most Ukrainian citizens do not report high tensions with JFO personnel. Nonetheless, certain oblasts and communities are found to feel distant towards and threatened by veterans. Further analyses reveal potential reintegration pathways which can ameliorate intergroup relations in these areas., Veterans tend to be more active and civically engaged than non-veterans. Importantly, veterans tend to also exhibit higher violent political and civic tendencies. Analyses identify radicalising factors and present potential entry points to prevent violent civic tendencies. SCORE results show that veterans have very distinct political preferences and future visions for the conflict. Specifically, they tend to be more strongly in favour of accession to the EU and to NATO than their non-veteran peers., They also tend to endorse military operations over negotiations, reject special status for NGCAs as a potential solution, and are not particularly enthusiastic about policies like improving access to Ukrainian media or to Ukrainian universities for those in the NGCAs. This study also includes a series of predictive analyses revealing entry points for addressing the challenges veterans face., To assess the validity of our findings, two focus group discussions (FGDs) with veterans were conducted. FGDs were held separately for male and female veterans as the two groups often have distinct experiences and challenges when returning to civilian life. These discussions informed the interpretation of the SCORE results and contributed to the generation of solutions to the issues faced. We end the report with a series of policy and programmatic recommendations to improve veterans’ mental wellbeing, their economic security, and their social reintegration, with the overall aim of increasing veterans’ wellbeing and, more widely, improving social cohesion in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/reintegrating-ato-jfo-veterans-january-2022

Major attacks continue to be reported across the country, resulting in widescale destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement., Over the last two weeks, fighting has intensified in Eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas, Kharkivska, and Luhansk regions. The cities of Sloviansk and Severodonetsk also continued to be targeted by the Russian Federation military. Increased hostilities in Sloviansk led to the doubling of evacuees this week, as hundreds of people flee the city daily. Further attacks have been reported in Dnipropetrovska, Chernihivska, Sumska, Zaporizka and Mykolaivska oblasts. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified that between 24 February and 7 June, there have been 9,444 civilian casualties in the country, including 4,266 persons killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher., People fleeing Ukraine, particularly women and girls, continue to face challenges and vulnerability risks as they seek safety in neighboring countries. The UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence, Pramilla Patten, stated that she believes the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is “turning into a human trafficking crisis,” calling for a resolution of the issue through “a concerted, integrated and holistic cross-border response humanitarian partners, law enforcement agencies, border forces, immigration officials and political leaders.” IOM is particularly concerned about ongoing internal and cross-border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. On 30 May, IOM released the fifth round of its Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, General Population Survey, which documented changes in displacement and mobility flows from 17-23 May. Approximately 16 per cent of the population, over 7.13 million people (63 per cent women and 36 per cent men), have been displaced as of 23 May, representing a decrease of 900,000 internally displaced persons (11 per cent) compared to figures from 3 May (fourth round of the report). Meanwhile, IOM estimates that approximately 4.48 million persons, including internally displaced persons and those who crossed into neighboring countries, have returned to their oblast of origin, although the situation remains unsteady. As the crisis evolves, displacement and mobility patterns continue to change, requiring scaled-up and integrated interventions that address both emerging and existing needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-21-10-june-2022

This factsheet includes cumulative responses from 3 April to 25 May., Interviewees were selected among individuals reportedly wanting to enter Ukraine purposively to gain a broader understanding of experiences and intentions.

MCC raises $8.8 million in response to crisis in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MCC,Food and Nutrition,13 Jun 2022,"Through an incredible outpouring of support by donors, Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) has raised US$8.8 million (CA$11.1 million) to respond to the needs of the people of Ukraine., Those donations have empowered MCC’s local partners to provide life-saving emergency support since day one of this conflict. They’ve provided shelter for people fleeing for safety, brought food to sick and elderly people who cannot leave their homes and fueled vehicles ferrying vulnerable people to safety., June 3 marked 100 days since the Russian military invasion of Ukraine began. In that time, MCC has allocated $2.1 million (CA$2.65 million) through our partners in-country, reaching approximately 16,000 people with emergency food, cash assistance, hygiene items, shelter or other forms of relief. MCC also is shipping five containers of emergency supplies, including comforters, canned meat and relief kits, to Ukraine. They are expected to arrive in July., Many of MCC's partners in Ukraine have continued their incredible work despite the dangerous reality of caring for people during a war. Pavel* is the director of MCC partner Kharkiv Independent Evangelical Christian Baptist Churches (KECB) in Kharkiv. He says MCC's support has allowed them to keep their kitchens running for more than three months., ""Those who do not have enough food or have run out of money to buy the food, they are coming to [KECB] and we serve food to them. We are preparing food every day — you have given to our hands something that we can provide to other people."", As the last few months progressed, MCC's planning with its partners in Ukraine reshaped itself as the situations on the ground changed. Early plans that prioritized quick response are evolving as logistical challenges like transportation are being assessed and addressed. While the needs are as immediate as in the first days, MCC and its partners also now are considering how to meet those needs over a prolonged conflict., Bruce Guenther, MCC’s disaster response director, says MCC is equipped well to respond to both the urgent and persisting needs in a situation like this., ""MCC has been responding to the conflict in eastern Ukraine since it began in 2014. So while this invasion represents an intensification of that conflict, our response has been ongoing. While we need to plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, this conflict is likely to continue for some time. Our immediate focus is to ensure that we continue to support our partners in meeting basic needs including food, safe shelter and trauma care for vulnerable families.”, Linda Herr is MCC's area director for Europe and the Middle East with her husband James Wheeler. She says the generosity of MCC donors is appreciated more than she can truly express., ""To see so many people offer their support to the people of Ukraine and to be in a position to see and hear how it's directly making a difference in the lives of people who need it — I'm humbled. Thank you, sincerely, to every one of you who donated or in another way supported MCC's work in Ukraine."", Some last names have been omitted for security purposes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mcc-raises-88-million-response-crisis-ukraine

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 12 June 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,13 Jun 2022,"Date: 13 June 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 12 June 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 9,785 civilian casualties in the country: 4,395 killed and 5,390 injured. This included:, a total of 4,395 killed (1,666 men, 1,120 women, 102 girls, and 105 boys, as well as 68 children and 1,334 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,390 injured (1,094 men, 759 women, 123 girls, and 156 boys, as well as 172 children and 3,086 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,593 casualties (2,553 killed and 3,040 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,743 casualties (2,390 killed and 2,353 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 850 casualties (163 killed and 687 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ternopil and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,192 casualties (1,842 killed and 2,350 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 9 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred from 10 to 12 June only, as during these days OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported from 10 to 12 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-12-june-2022-enruuk

"‘Anyone can die at any time’: Indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces in Kharkiv, Ukraine",Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,13 Jun 2022,"Ukraine: Hundreds killed in relentless Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv by indiscriminate Russian shelling using widely banned cluster munitions and inherently inaccurate rockets, Amnesty International said today., A new report, ‘Anyone can die at any time’: Indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces in Kharkiv, Ukraine, documents how Russian forces have caused widespread death and destruction by relentlessly bombarding residential neighbourhoods of Kharkiv since their invasion began in late February., During an extensive investigation, Amnesty International found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions as well as scatterable mines, both of which are subject to international treaty bans because of their indiscriminate effects., “The people of Kharkiv have faced a relentless barrage of indiscriminate attacks in recent months, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians,” said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser., “People have been killed in their homes and in the streets, in playgrounds and in cemeteries, while queueing for humanitarian aid, or shopping for food and medicine., “The repeated use of widely banned cluster munitions is shocking, and a further indication of utter disregard for civilian lives. The Russian forces responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable for their actions, and victims and their families must receive full reparations.”, The director of the Medical Department at the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration told Amnesty International that 606 civilians had been killed and 1,248 injured in the Kharkiv region since the conflict began.Most of the strikes investigated by Amnesty International inflicted multiple casualties over widespread areas., While Russia is not a party to either the Convention on Cluster Munitions or the Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines, international humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate attacks, and the use of weapons that are indiscriminate by nature. Launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death or injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects, constitutes war crimes., The people of Kharkiv have faced a relentless barrage of indiscriminate attacks in recent months, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians, Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser, PLAYGROUND ATTACK, The bombardment of Kharkiv, home to 1.5 million people, started on 24 February when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Residential neighbourhoods in the northern and eastern parts of the city bore the brunt of the shelling., On the afternoon of 15 April, Russian forces fired cluster munitions in and around Myru Street, in the Industrialni neighbourhood. At least nine civilians were killed and more than 35 injured, including several children.Doctors at Kharkiv’s City Clinical Hospital 25 showed Amnesty International metal fragments they had removed from patients’ bodies, including the distinctive pieces of steel rods contained in 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions., Tetiana Ahayeva, a 53-year-old nurse, was standing by the entrance of her building when several cluster bombs exploded. She told Amnesty International: “There was a sudden sound of firecrackers everywhere, lots of them, all over. I saw puffs of black smoke where the explosions occurred. We dropped to the ground and tried to find cover. Our neighbour’s son, a 16-year-old boy called Artem Shevchenko, was killed on the spot… His father had a shattered hip and a shrapnel wound in his leg. It’s hard to say how long the explosions lasted; a minute can seem to last forever.”, In a nearby playground, Oksana Litvynyenko, 41, suffered devastating injuries when several cluster munitions exploded while she was walking with her husband Ivan and their four-year-old daughter. Shrapnel penetrated her back, chest and abdomen, puncturing her lungs and spine. She tragically died on 11 June. The strike took place in the middle of the afternoon, while many other families were at the playground with their children., Ivan told Amnesty International on 26 April: “All of a sudden, I saw a flash… I grabbed my daughter and pushed her against the tree and hugged the tree, so that she was protected between the tree and my body. There was a lot of smoke, and I couldn’t see anything… Then as the smoke around me eased, I saw people on the ground… my wife Oksana was lying on the ground. When my daughter saw her Mum on the ground in a pool of blood, she said to me, ‘Let’s go home: Mum is dead and the people are dead’. She was in shock and so was I. I still don’t know whether my wife will recover; the doctors cannot say if she will be able to speak or walk again. Our world has been turned upside down.”, After more than one month in intensive care, Oksana’s condition had improved slightly, but she died from her injuries on 11 June. Amnesty International researchers found the distinctive fins and metal pellets and other fragments from the 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions at the playground. Several small craters in the concrete ground were also visible, consistent with the damage expected from the explosion of such munitions., All of a sudden, I saw a flash… I grabbed my daughter and pushed her against the tree and hugged the tree, so that she was protected between the tree and my body, Ivan Litvynyenko, playground attack survivor., HUMANITARIAN QUEUE STRIKE, At least six people were killed and 15 were injured on the morning of 24 March, when cluster munitions struck a parking lot near the Akademika Pavlova metro station where hundreds of people were queuing for humanitarian aid., Valeriia Kolyshkina, a sales assistant in a pet shop close to the scene of the strike, said that one man was killed when the explosions destroyed the glass front of a nearby store., She told Amnesty International: “A man was killed just outside the shop. He was standing outside smoking while his wife was buying pet food… Metal shrapnel came through the front window, flying over my head as I was behind the counter. Then there were several more explosions. It was utter panic. The shop was full of people. We ran to the storage room at the back of the shop for protection. It was very scary… I thought I would die.”, Ruslan*, a local policeman who witnessed the attack, said: “It was really a horrible situation, shrapnel was falling like rain.”, Amnesty International researchers found parts of a 220mm Uragan rocket, which carries 30 submunitions, still embedded in a crater in the tarmac. Around the area, they also found fins and fragments from the 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions, and multiple other craters., Two other cluster munitions also hit the roof of the Holy Trinity Church, approximately 500 metres from where the rocket landed. The church serves as a humanitarian hub where volunteers prepare food and aid packages to be distributed to people who struggle to access humanitarian assistance distribution points, such as older people and those with disabilities and reduced mobility. Pastor Petro Loboiko and Pastor Serhii Andreiivich showed Amnesty International shrapnel from two cluster munitions that had penetrated the church’s walls and doors after exploding on the roof., It was utter panic. The shop was full of people. We ran to the storage room at the back of the shop for protection. It was very scary… I thought I would die, Valeriia Kolyshkina, a sales assistant in a pet shop close to the scene of the strike., LOST LIMBS, On the afternoon of 12 March, Veronica Cherevychko, a 30-year-old logistics manager and mother, lost her right leg when a Grad rocket struck a playground in front of her home in the Saltivka neighbourhood., She told Amnesty International: “I was sitting on this bench when the explosion happened. I remember hearing a whistling sound just before the explosion. Then I woke up in hospital, without a leg; my right leg was gone. Now my life is divided into before 12 March, and after 12 March. I will get used to this. Now I am not yet used to it; I often try to touch my leg, to scratch my foot… I don’t know what to say about [the] people who did it. I will never understand them.”, Three people were killed and six injured when a series of cluster munitions exploded in the same neighbourhood on the morning of 26 April. Olena Sorokina, a 57-year-old cancer survivor, lost both legs in the blast. She was sitting outside her building waiting for a delivery of humanitarian aid when she heard the sound of a flying shell and ran to the entrance of the building., Olena blacked out, then woke up in an ambulance and realized that she had lost a leg. She was taken to hospital, where her other leg also had to be amputated. She is now in western Ukraine, hoping to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility elsewhere in Europe. Olena told Amnesty International: “After the battle with cancer, now I have to face another battle to learn to function without legs.”, Unguided rockets – such as Grads and Uragans, which have been routinely used by Russian forces – are inherently inaccurate, making them indiscriminate when used in populated areas. Unguided artillery shells have a margin of error of over 100 metres. In residential areas where buildings are no more than a few metres apart, such inaccuracies are virtually certain to cost civilian lives and cause widespread destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure., Ukrainian forces, for their part, often launched strikes from residential neighbourhoods, endangering civilians in those areas. Such a practice violates international humanitarian law, but does not in any way justify Russian forces’ repeated indiscriminate strikes., I don’t know what to say about [the] people who did it. I will never understand them, Veronica Cherevychko, a 30-year-old logistics manager who lost her right leg., METHODOLOGY, Amnesty International researchers investigated 41 strikes (which killed at least 62 people and injured at least 196) and interviewed 160 people in Kharkiv over 14 days in April and May, including survivors of attacks, relatives of victims, witnesses, and doctors who treated the injured. The organization’s researchers collected and analysed material evidence from strike locations, notably munitions fragments, as well as an array of digital materials., All of Amnesty International’s ongoing documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/anyone-can-die-any-time-indiscriminate-attacks-russian-forces-kharkiv-ukraine
Update 81 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (12 June 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Jun 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency and the Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) have worked together to restore the remote transmission of vital safeguards data from the facility to IAEA headquarters after a technical interruption of almost two weeks, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The Director General welcomed the development as an important and positive step for the implementation of IAEA safeguards at Ukraine's largest NPP. However, he also stressed that IAEA inspectors must still go to the facility as soon as possible to carry out essential nuclear material verification activities which cannot be done remotely., The transfer of safeguards data from IAEA systems installed at the ZNPP was cut on 30 May and re-established earlier today. The images recorded by IAEA surveillance cameras during this time period are now being downloaded for review by Agency inspectors to confirm that continuity of knowledge has not been lost., Russian forces took control of the ZNPP more than three months ago, but its Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant., “Remote transmission of safeguards data is an important element of IAEA safeguards in Ukraine and elsewhere,” Director General Grossi said. “However, it is not a substitute for the physical presence of IAEA inspectors at NPPs to verify nuclear material at regular intervals.“, The interval of physical inventory verifications at NPPs cannot exceed a specified duration. This is particularly critical at two of the units at ZNPP. In addition, these units have been refuelled in recent months and a physical verification of the nuclear material therein is a safeguards pre-requisite before re-starting them., “If I am not able to dispatch inspectors to perform the required verification at ZNPP, implementation of safeguards in Ukraine will be compromised,” Director General Grossi added., The Director General said he was continuing his efforts to agree and organize an IAEA-led International Mission to the ZNPP as soon as possible to carry out safety and security work at the plant in southern Ukraine. IAEA inspectors would at the same time conduct their on-site verification activities there., The IAEA continues to receive safeguards data from its systems installed at the other three operational NPPs in Ukraine and from the Chornobyl NPP., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine informed the IAEA today that eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-81-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-june-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",10 Jun 2022,"The United Nations country team in Ukraine is proud to present its joint 2021 annual results report and key priorities for 2022 in response to the ongoing war and its consequences. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine the United Nations, in close cooperation with the government, civil society and development partners, has achieved noteworthy results in 2021. In 2022, following the start of the war, the United Nations remained in Ukraine to support the Government and the people, including in areas in the immediate vicinity of the frontline. To address the immediate humanitarian needs, the UN is also supporting the government’s vision for early recovery as per the National Reconstruction Plan., Chapter 1 Key developments in the country and regional context in 2021, In 2021, Ukraine’s development continued to be influenced by the effects of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and socio-economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the country’s regional context was affected by the volatile relationships between key regional players, including the Russian Federation, the United State of America, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU. Deteriorated security situation, affected by the recurring tensions around Ukraine caused by the Russian Federation’s military activities along the borders of Ukraine attracted significant international concern and impinged on Ukraine’s socioeconomic development and domestic political process., The political environment in Ukraine remained stable with some technical changes in the Cabinet of Ministers taking place upon the initiative of the President who remained the key determinant of Ukraine’s domestic dynamics. Following the major steps taken by the Government on its reform agenda in 2020, the process remained on track although no significant new reforms had been initiated by the Government since its reforms agenda was influenced by political imperatives. These imperatives consisted in preserving macroeconomic stability and increasing budget revenues, promoting infrastructural development, and deoligarchization. As a result, some of the reform processes saw little outcome, e.g. ‘tax amnesty’; others achieved moderate progress, e.g. the judicial reform, whereas still others, like the security sector reform, were postponed for 2022., Ukraine’s reforms continued to receive significant international support, both in terms of funding and direct advocacy led by the G7 countries. And yet, due to the geopolitical and regional volatility around Ukraine, the emphasis of this support was drawn away from Ukraine’s reforms to focus on security. As a result, reforms became less sustainable, which may puts at risk obtaining further international assistance, thus leading to potential potential setbacks in the reform agenda. This was evidenced by developments that eroded the independence of the national anti-corruption infrastructure and undermined the completion of judicial reform, which faced resistance at various levels, which. In sum, interests of political stability and security interacting with the national reform agenda increased risks for and vulnerabilities of the sustainability of Ukraine’s reforms., The conflict in eastern Ukraine continued to impact on Ukraine’s stability, and its political and sustainable socio-economic development. Despite violence at the contact line remaining at relatively lower levels compared to previous years, the conflict remained a constant source of threat for the country’s stability, limiting the prospects for its economic development, undermining social cohesion and contributing to an impasse in Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The continuing isolation of the non-government-controlled area (NGCA) in eastern Ukraine from the rest of the country brought about by the politicization of the pandemic mitigation measures fuelled more divisions in Ukrainian society and facilitated the absorption of the NGCA by the Russian Federation. The consolidation of divisive lines in eastern Ukraine was mirrored by the consolidation of national public opinion, which increasingly interpreted the problem of reintegration through the government concept of deoccupation. The Government’s initiatives aimed at eliminating isolation by reaching out to targeted population in NGCA residents had limited effect in imposing its political agenda and also due to the continued stalemate in all negotiations on eastern Ukraine., Due to the deterioration of Ukraine’s regional security, the Government had to seek stronger international support in the form of commitments and guarantees as well as more security assistance against a backdrop of a complete lack of bilateral diplomatic dialogue with the Russian Federation. This situation led Ukraine to adopt a more assertive foreign and security policy. This policy aimed at positioning the country to take on a more active role in regional politics, gaining more leverage in its relations with key international partners, enhancing security, and delinking security policy goals from reform commitments. All of these served to strengthen the political agenda of preserving the national sovereignty and restoring territorial integrity. The launch of the Crimean Platform became one of the main results of foreign policy assertiveness, bringing the issue of Crimea back on the international agenda and formalising diplomatic support from Ukraine’s international partners. Other important innovations of Ukraine’s foreign policy in 2021 included a greater emphasis on regional cooperation frameworks similar to the Association Trio, Lublin Triangle and the Quadriga, seeking to promote Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration, which remains the key goal of the national foreign policy. The renewal of the US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership and the mobilization of wide political and diplomatic support to the country’s sovereignty and security in the face of military escalation crises have become the largest achievement of Ukraine’s foreign policy., The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remained a critical part of Ukraine’s key longterm development framework, together with the EU Association Agreement. In March 2021, the Government approved the National Economic Strategy 2030 (NES 2030), which became the central strategy for long-term strategic planning and monitoring in Ukraine. The NES 2030 set ambitious goals of: doubling Ukraine’s GDP by 2030; creating an enabling environment for business and economic development; winning the competition for capital; developing key sectors; and ensuring equal human development. However, economic performance remains structurally constrained by uncompleted reforms and transformations in key sectors of the economy. There was still a key concern in 2021 regarding energy security and energy poverty, which led the Government to tighten regulations of the gas market, not only for the population, but also for industries. Market price distortions are expected to further increase and remain a burden on the state budget and the private sector., In 2021, the GDP was estimated to grow by 3.4 percent (WB), with similar moderate growth rates in the next two years. Economic performance was further impacted by the COVID-19 situation, the slow increase of vaccination rates and new adaptive lockdowns since November 2021, as well as the market reaction to the military build-up and escalation near Ukrainian borders., In July 2021, the Government of Ukraine updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, committing to an economy-wide net reduction of 65 percent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, leading to net zero by 2060. The NDC is therefore an ambitious commitment by the Government that needs to be transformed into concrete actions and a related investment plan, which will require significant national and international financing. In October 2021, Ukraine submitted its application to the United Nations Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE), which support countries in reframing their economic policies by creating an enabling environment to finance the green economy transition., The United Nations Common Country Analysis, updated in December 2021, further outlined key Ukraine’s development challenges and opportunities guiding United Nations actions and programming interventions in the coming years under the new Ukraine-United Nations Cooperation Framework.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-nations-country-team-ukraine-2021-results-report-enuk

The approximate number of people with chronic conditions in Bucha municipality (Kyiv oblast) accounts for around 10 000 people and up to 20 000 people in Gostomel, Borodyanka and Dymer communities., To ensure access to primary health care and medicines in the affected areas of Kyiv region, WHO in Ukraine in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Academy of Family Medicine initiated a project to support primary health care system in the format of mobile health units to bring essential health services closer to the people of Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka, Dymer, Ivankov and other surrounding communities., “WHO is extending primary health care services in the communities of Kyiv oblast, severely affected by war. Working closely with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and Ukrainian Academy of Family Medicine, we facilitate access to essential medical services and medicines to people in Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Borodyanka and other hard-hit areas in the region through establishment and operation of mobile health units, which will conduct over 120 community visits and over 1500 primary health care consultations for war-affected patients over the coming months,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine., “A full-scale war is ongoing in Ukraine, our brave people are defending our land every day. We defend the right to freedom and independence, to the future of Ukraine. Thanks to the international support, we have the opportunity to help the most affected by the war territories of Ukraine, in particular Kyiv region. We are grateful to the joint efforts of the Ministry of Health, WHO and the NGO ""Academy of Family Medicine"", the residents of the community gained access to medical care and medicines. By supporting local health care facilities, including primary health care centers and family medicine clinics, we are restoring the continuity of medical care to the war-affected population and providing psychological support. From the first days of de-occupation, the joint efforts of the Ministry of Health and the regional military administration organized outpatient medical care by specialists of specialized institutions - the Center for Emergency Care, ""Ohmatdyt"", the Heart Institute, Kyiv regional hospitals,” said Iryna Mykychak, Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine., ""We are grateful to the World Health Organization for the partnership in the implementation of the project on mobile health teams in Kyiv region - an important initiative, facilitating access to primary health care services and essential medicines for population in war-affected settlements in Kyiv region,"" said Iryna Voloshyna, project manager for mobile teams from the NGO ""Academy of Family Medicine of Ukraine""., During the visit to Kyiv region, Dr Jarno Habicht and Iryna Mykychak met with health care workers and thanked them for their efforts and tireless work in providing the necessary assistance to the affected population of Kyiv region in these difficult times., Within the project, doctors in mobile health units conduct community visits, provide consultations and deliver health services, including medical examination, diagnosis, prescribing treatment and medication, referral to specialists/hospital for specialized care, promoting good health and counseling on preventing health problems, managing follow-up. They also focus on community outreach services and home visits to disabled persons and other affected patients in need to extend the essential health services closer to the people., Over the next three month, the project aims at restoring and ensuring the continuity of care for the war-affected population, supporting local primary health care facilities and health workers with regard to restoration and integration of services into the e-Health system, improving access to and availability of medicines for patients with non-communicable diseases (diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.)., The project has been implemented by WHO with the support of Switzerland and the Government of Canada., Media inquiries:, Iryna Tarnavska, Communications Officer, WHO in Ukraine, tarnavskai@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-and-ministry-health-ukraine-scale-primary-health-care-services-patients-war-affected-areas-ukraine-enuk
MSF congressional testimony on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",11 Jun 2022,"Emergency coordinator Christopher Stokes speaks to the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform, Subcommittee on National Security, Chairman Lynch, Ranking Member Grothman, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for organizing this hearing on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine., I am speaking to you from Ukraine, where I am serving as an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), better known in the United States by our English name, Doctors Without Borders. Last year, MSF marked 50 years of providing medical care in humanitarian emergencies. We operate in over 70 countries around the world, adhering to the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence in line with universal medical ethics. In keeping with the principle of independence, we choose not to be funded by the United States and most other governments. Our principles not only form the core of our identity, but they are also our protection when working in war and conflict., The people of Ukraine are tragically familiar with armed conflict. MSF first worked in Ukraine in 1999 and has been responding to the conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014. As you are aware, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated in late February 2022, displacing millions of people across the country. Civilians have been injured and killed, homes, towns and cities destroyed, and medical facilities damaged. The war has created a large-scale, urgent need for medical assistance, food, safe water, and shelter. While the geographic scope of active conflict areas has diminished, people in areas recently affected by conflict or in areas under occupation, or otherwise contested, continue to need emergency humanitarian assistance., MSF’s response in Ukraine, Before February 24, MSF’s work in Ukraine included providing support for elderly, isolated, or displaced people with chronic diseases through mobile clinics and home-based care. In recent months, these needs have only grown. With the extreme escalation in violence, MSF has expanded our work in Ukraine, where we currently employ over 600 staff comprised of about 140 internationals and 470 Ukrainians. We have teams working in multiple locations including Bila Tserkva, Dnipro, Chernihiv, Sumy, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Poltava, Pokrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Uzhhorod, Kropyvnytskyi, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr. Our teams include doctors, nurses, psychologists, logisticians, and management personnel. Since February 24, MSF has brought more than 800 metric tons of medical and relief supplies into Ukraine. MSF also initially mobilized a response in neighboring countries of Poland, Belarus, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia, and Russia, although the majority of our operations are currently focused inside Ukraine., The extensive solidarity network in Ukraine – comprising formal and informal networks of organizations and individuals mobilized as part of the humanitarian response – has served as a safety net for vast numbers of people in Ukraine who have fled areas of fighting, or who have remained in their homes because they are unable or unwilling to leave. These volunteer networks play a significant role in the way assistance reaches people in need, and how people find shelter and other forms of support to meet their basic needs., Ukraine has an advanced health care system run by highly trained and experienced staff. We find that, in general, Ukrainian health care workers have not left, and many who moved their children and other family members to safety have returned to care for those unable or unwilling to evacuate Ukraine. These health care workers are asking for the supplies and support needed to continue to care for their patients., Over the past months MSF has established medical supply lines and provided training on mass casualty response to hospitals across Ukraine. We have worked alongside Ukrainian doctors and nurses to restart medical care in the wake of active fighting. In addition to basic primary health care, we are providing mental health care to address the psychological consequences of the war. We have established hotlines to reconnect people with existing services., Many who find themselves in need of support are elderly or disabled. Their access to health care was severed by fighting, and we are working with volunteer networks to deliver medication directly to their homes. We continue to support shelters for survivors of sexual violence by providing training and mental health consultations. We also run a hotline for survivors of sexual and domestic violence in Kyiv and other areas, offering confidential consultations and delivery of medications to prevent HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancy., Across Ukraine, we are identifying and filling gaps in the health system but also stepping back as appropriate when the health care system and local organizations and volunteers demonstrate a capacity to respond. As the conflict enters a new phase, we are seeing a continued need for flexibility in the humanitarian response. Mobile medical clinics allow us to reach people both in urban areas where instability makes movements dangerous and in outlying rural areas where medical care has been interrupted by conflict., As road access was made difficult by the war, we looked for alternative forms of patient transportation and MSF is currently operating two trains for medical transport purposes. These trains move patients from overburdened hospitals close to active conflict zones to hospitals away from the fighting and where there is more capacity for patient care. As of June 8, 24 referral journeys by train were completed, assisting 653 patients and their caretakers. Most of these patients are civilians, wounded by heavy artillery and rockets used extensively and indiscriminately in densely populated areas. An additional 78 infants and toddlers were also evacuated from an orphanage via train., At the time of the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station on April 8, hundreds of civilians were awaiting evacuation trains to safer areas of Ukraine. MSF had evacuated patients from there only two days before. In the aftermath of the attack, MSF transferred 11 people who were injured to safer hospitals in the West of the country. Most of them were children with the youngest being 8 years old. With roads considered too dangerous, the MSF train is currently the only means to move large numbers of critically war-wounded safely across the vast distances of the country., According to the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM), upwards of 7 million Ukrainians are displaced within the country. MSF is supporting displaced persons staying in shelters who are often extremely vulnerable: elderly people, disabled people, unaccompanied children, and people who cannot afford to move within Ukraine or to leave the country. In the shelters, our teams run mobile clinics, providing medical consultations and continuation of care and medications for people with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and epilepsy. We also conduct referrals to hospital for severely unwell patients, provide psychological first aid and mental health consultations; and distribute basic relief items. In some areas, clinics for displaced people are staffed by Ukrainian doctors who are themselves displaced., Destruction of infrastructure across Ukraine is an immense burden on civilians and on humanitarian responders. For example, thousands of people sheltered in the metro stations of Kharkiv during the peak of the violence. While most were able to find a place to stay when metro service resumed on May 24, we are following up with others who are still searching for shelter., The unpredictable security environment continues to make the humanitarian response difficult. However, civil society responders and volunteer networks are identifying individuals and households in need. MSF is supporting them with food, hygiene kits, and medical supplies and is continuing to supply health facilities in multiple areas., As the front lines shift, we continue to work with health facilities to ensure they have adequate supplies as well as training to continue treating patients even if their supply lines are interrupted by fighting. We are also working with some health facilities to set up autonomous supplies of electricity through generators and solar power, and clean water to continue functioning for up to a week in the event that their normal supply is interrupted., Contested and occupied areas outside Ukrainian government control, In addition to the needs of people in areas under Ukrainian government control, there are significant needs in areas that fall outside its control. MSF has been working in contested areas in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and we have witnessed how, for the past eight years, many of the 1.6 million people living in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts have faced restrictions on movement and access to services as a result of the conflict. Access to areas outside of Ukrainian government control is limited, resulting in a restricted humanitarian presence, a lack of regular data collection, and an inability to carry out independent needs assessments. Based on available information, health needs in occupied and contested areas are extensive and the situation is continuing to deteriorate due to the impact of ongoing conflict., As the war drags on, the protection of civilians who are residing in these areas must be ensured, including by guaranteeing the unhindered delivery of impartial humanitarian aid and medical care. In accordance with international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles, MSF is seeking urgent access to all people affected by the conflict, wherever they are. This means MSF will engage with all parties to the conflict with the sole objective of providing medical care and humanitarian aid to ensure the survival of the population., Humanitarian response in neighboring countries, In addition to our humanitarian operations in Ukraine, MSF continues to monitor and address the medical needs in bordering countries. In Slovakia, we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Health to be able to import medical supplies and we have trained health staff on tuberculosis (TB) and multi-drug resistant (MDR-TB) care, and care for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). In Belarus, we support the national TB program, provide hepatitis C treatment in prisons, and assist people displaced between Belarus and EU countries as well as those displaced from Ukraine., In Russia, MSF has long been working with health authorities to provide treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and we have partnered with local NGOs to support vulnerable groups. We have seen an increase in need for chronic disease treatment, including of people in Russia displaced by conflict who cannot refill their medications. MSF has recently established an emergency response project in the south of Russia, targeting the areas of Rostov and Voronezh. MSF is supporting people who are displaced by the conflict and who have limited access to medical and humanitarian assistance provided by conventional support systems. In partnership with local organizations, our team in Voronezh is connecting people in need to existing systems for medical and humanitarian assistance, facilitating referrals both to public and private healthcare providers, and supporting with covering medication costs., Long-term impacts of the war in Ukraine and humanitarian assistance needed in the future, The type of humanitarian response we need moving forward is one that is characterized by the fundamental principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence. People in need of life-saving assistance have a right to receive it, regardless of where they are from or where they are now. While we continue to focus on the urgent needs of people in Ukraine, we know that the harms of war do not end when the fighting ends. The destruction of civilian infrastructure, the devastation of the economy, the risks of unexploded ordnance, and the longer-term recovery from physical and psychosocial traumas will reverberate well into the future and will be costly to address, in terms of time and resources., The destruction of infrastructure in both rural and urban areas will require significant rebuilding, restoration, and investment. Damaged or destroyed infrastructure has a direct bearing on people’s health and their ability to meet their basic needs. Where fighting is concentrated and prolonged, water, sanitation, and health care systems will be at risk of collapse. Indeed, in some places this is already the case with people facing water shortages that pose a significant public health risk, particularly in a country where cholera is a concern., In the East, civilians will need access to humanitarian support regardless of who is controlling the territory. Maintaining access to primary health care in unpredictable security contexts will be a challenge in the coming months. Regardless of war, babies are born, routine childhood ailments require attention, and those with chronic diseases need access to medications and therapies. While we can provide hospitals with training and materials to respond to influxes of war-wounded, the initial medical act that saves a person’s life is often just the first step on the path to recovery. War inflicts both physical and psychological traumas that require specialized and long-term rehabilitation and treatment., In some locations where Ukrainian forces have recently regained control, systems of care are being restored relatively quickly. This, combined with support received from solidarity networks, means that humanitarian actors must proactively seek the gaps that remain in the immediate response even while others begin to focus on long-term recovery. In addition to the extensive restoration of destroyed infrastructure, this effort will require cash and other types of support for vulnerable groups who are unable to meet their basic needs. In other locations, especially in more rural communities, access to medical care and basic services is not as quick to return and there is a need for more sustained humanitarian assistance until local systems are back online., Broader humanitarian impacts of the war in Ukraine for other areas in crisis around the world, While we continue to respond to the medical needs of people affected by war in Ukraine, it is important that their needs are met in addition to and not at the expense of other vulnerable people around the world. Much has been said about the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on food and other commodity prices, and the exacerbating impact of these trends on humanitarian crises around the world. MSF’s principles of neutrality and impartiality mean that we believe that people have a right to assistance on the basis of need, irrespective of country, religion, political affiliation or any other criteria., Therefore, we must also echo the concern expressed by others - including the Director General of the World Health Organization - that while Ukrainian assistance rightly continues to scale-up, in crises farther from the headlines that are every bit as severe, the gap between needs and resources is growing alarmingly., We are witnessing firsthand the human cost of this gap. In Chad we are straining the limits of our capacity to scale up nutrition programs after the UN’s programs were recently and drastically cut. We are doing our best to scale up our response in Northwest Nigeria, where malnutrition is escalating amidst violence, insecurity and displacement, which inexplicably does not feature in this year’s UN Humanitarian Response Plan at all. In some places we are caring for women who were raped while gathering resources to supplement food rations that were halved by recent cuts., In an increasing number of countries we see the effects of interruptions in routine childhood immunization programs in the form of outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases that can kill or cause lasting harm to the health of the youngest children. Countries affected by political instability and conflict face the most hardship, such as in Afghanistan where over the past year our pediatric hospitals have been so overwhelmed with severely ill children that we have had to put two or three patients to a bed., The lives of people outside Ukraine are just as important as those of Ukrainians. Their needs are as acute and deserving of just as much attention and resources as those in the spotlight today. We recognize and applaud this government’s recent commitment of an additional $4.3 billion in funding for food assistance in Ukraine and elsewhere yet regret that it will not be nearly enough. In recent years we have seen the resources and resolve the United States and international community are capable of mobilizing when the political will exists. We urge you and other governments to rise to this moment, and to respond to needs in these neglected crises and to all people displaced no matter where they are from, with the same determination and commitment as those in Europe., Thank you for your concern for people living in Ukraine and in humanitarian crises around the world and for the opportunity to give testimony about the complex problems MSF’s patients face on a daily basis. I will be pleased to answer any questions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/msf-congressional-testimony-humanitarian-crisis-ukraine

Ukraine Crisis: Week of 28 May -03 June 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,3 Jun 2022,"Fighting continued last week in eastern and southern Ukraine. In the Luhansk region, Russian forces occupied most of Severodonetsk but were pushed back in some areas following successful counterattacks by Ukrainian forces (Wall Street Journal, 5 June 2022). The capture of Severodonetsk is an important objective for Russian forces, potentially paving the way for securing full control of the Luhansk region (Washington Post, 7 June 2022). Intense fighting also continued across the Donetsk region, with both sides claiming to have inflicted significant losses on their opponent (24 Channel, 1 June 2022; Armed Forces of Ukraine, 29 June 2022; Izvestia, 2 June 2022)., Ukrainian forces claim to have pushed back the Russian Black Sea fleet more than 100 kilometers from the coast in operations to ease the blockade of Ukrainian seaports (Ukrinform, 6 June 2022). Since the start of the full-scale invasion, the Russian blockade has contributed to global food supply disruptions, including growing food insecurity in African countries that largely depend on Ukrainian and Russian wheat (The Guardian, 31 May 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-week-28-may-03-june-2022

Technical brief: Key Principles and Recommendations for Inclusive Cash and Voucher Assistance in Ukraine,Manual and Guideline,CBM,Coordination,30 May 2022,"Introduction, This technical brief is intended to provide general guidance for humanitarian agencies operating in Ukraine on how to implement Disability Inclusive Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA). It aims to ensure that disability is mainstreamed within the CVA intervention and in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD),
International Humanitarian Law and the Humanitarian Principles.
The IASC Guidelines on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action (2019) define four ‘must do’ actions that are required for persons with disabilities to be included successfully in all phases of humanitarian action. They apply to every stakeholder in every sector and all contexts:, Promote meaningful participation, Remove barriers, Empower persons with disabilities, Disaggregate data for monitoring inclusion, While always respecting these four key actions, the following eight areas of focus are proposed in order to achieve disability inclusive CVA. We offer specific recommendations for each such area., Strategic Considerations, Ensure that CVA reaches all persons with disabilities, including all who were not able to evacuate, Link humanitarian CVA efforts to social protection schemes, Support persons with disabilities in institutions, Programmatic Considerations, Ensure identification and registration of persons with disabilities, Design and adapt delivery modalities to ensure persons with disabilities can access cash and markets by identifying barriers and enablers, Consider a realistic Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) for persons with disabilities and diverse transfer value, Monitor inclusive cash outcomes through CVA and adjust approaches as necessary, Engage persons with disabilities and their representatives groups throughout the CVA programme cycle",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/technical-brief-key-principles-and-recommendations-inclusive-cash-and-voucher-assistance-ukraine

Ukraine: Russian Strikes Killed Scores of Civilians in Chernihiv [EN/AR/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Jun 2022,"Both Sides Obligated to Minimize Civilian Harm, Russian forces killed and wounded numerous civilians in eight attacks in Chernihiv city in northeastern Ukraine in early March 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. Four of these attacks, from the air and ground, were in clear violation of the laws of war. They included the bombing of an apartment complex that killed 47 civilians, an attack that killed at least 17 people in a bread line outside a supermarket, and two separate attacks, including one using widely banned cluster munitions, that damaged two hospitals., Ukrainian forces may have placed civilians at risk in five of the Russian forces’ attacks, including one where Territorial Defense Forces had established a base at a school. One of these Russian strikes hit a hospital, which has enhanced protections under the laws of war, making the strike on the facility unlawful despite the possible presence of a military checkpoint near the hospital. The four other strikes may still have violated prohibitions against indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, despite the apparent nearby presence of Ukrainian troops., “Russian forces in March repeatedly attacked populated areas in Chernihiv from the ground and air with seeming disregard for civilian loss of life,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The failure of Ukrainian forces in some areas to remove civilians added to the casualties, but the attacker must still distinguish between civilians and combatants.”, The Russian military began attacking Chernihiv on February 24, the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Human Rights Watch investigated attacks on the city that occurred between March 3 and March 17. While Russian forces never captured Chernihiv, by late March they had effectively surrounded the city, trapping civilians and subjecting them to further bombardment. Russian forces withdrew from the area on March 31 as part of their broader retreat from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions., Between March 8 and May 9, Human Rights Watch interviewed 34 people including 24 witnesses to the eight attacks, as well as emergency responders, Chernihiv Regional Administration officials, and local prosecutors, who provided civilian casualty figures. On April 19 and 20, researchers inspected the sites of the eight attacks., Human Rights Watch also reviewed satellite imagery to corroborate the dates and scale of the damage, and to help determine the location of any Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the attacks. Obituaries of Ukrainian soldiers published in local media also helped to assess whether Ukrainian military personnel were in the vicinity of the attacks., The Ukrainian Department of Medical Care for the Chernihiv region said that at least 98 civilians were killed in the eight attacks and at least another 123 were wounded. The department’s head said that these numbers were based on reports from local hospitals, emergency medical services, and the official morgue logbook. The official provided Human Rights Watch with the names, ages, and genders of 22 of the people killed and 122 of the people wounded in the attacks. She said forensic experts were still compiling the personal information related to the other casualties and that she would share this with Human Rights Watch when it was complete., In the deadliest of the eight attacks, Russian forces on March 3 dropped several unguided bombs on an apartment building complex, killing 47 civilians. “When the explosions happened, I saw people falling out of the windows,” a resident of one of the buildings said. “Some of them were on fire.” Several witnesses interviewed said they did not believe that any Ukrainian forces were in the area at the time., In a March 17 attack on the city center, Russian forces launched an Uragan cluster munition rocket that damaged a medical complex housing two hospitals. Local officials said the attack killed 14 civilians and injured 21 others. Witnesses said they saw no military targets in the area at the time., Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have repeatedly used cluster munitions, which are inherently indiscriminate weapons, in attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians and damaged homes, hospitals, and schools. Ukrainian forces appear to have used cluster munitions at least once., Serious violations of the laws of war, including indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, committed with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for attempt to commit a war crime, as well as assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime. Commanders and civilian leaders may be prosecuted for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility when they knew or should have known about the commission of war crimes and took insufficient measures to prevent them or punish those responsible., The Russian attacks in Chernihiv demonstrate the devastating impact on civilians and civilian infrastructure when armed forces use explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, and the increased likelihood of unlawful indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks., These weapons have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. Long-term effects of their use include damage to civilian buildings and critical infrastructure, interference with services such as health care and education, and displacement of the local population., March 3 Airstrike on Apartment Complex, On March 3 at about 12:15 p.m., Russian aircraft dropped several unguided bombs at an intersection on Chornovola Street in a residential neighborhood in the center of Chernihiv. Local authorities said the attack killed at least 47 civilians and wounded 32. The attack damaged an apartment building and several other residential and commercial buildings, one of which contained a pharmacy., Human Rights Watch spoke by phone to three witnesses to the attack, including a doctor and two Chernihiv residents. Human Rights Watch also verified and analyzed 22 videos and 12 photographs taken during and just after the attack., The doctor said that he and his colleagues treated 35 injured people ranging in age from 7 to 55. He said he remembered one boy whose ankle was cut open and a girl who had a metal fragment from the munition in her face. A boy about 12 had metal shards in his brain and damage to the skull, he said., Human Rights Watch researchers who visited the attack site on April 19 saw at least five distinct impact craters left by munitions. At least one more bomb had hit a nearby 18-story apartment building, seriously damaging floors 12 to 15. The blasts also seriously damaged two nine-story apartment buildings and blew out the windows and seriously damaged the facades of two other nine-story apartment buildings. A pharmacy in one of these buildings was also seriously damaged, as well as a medical center that was not in use at the time., The area had not come under attack since March 3., Olena Piatkina, a resident of one of the damaged buildings, said she was in the basement sheltering when one of the bombs struck just meters from her building:, After the explosion, I looked left and saw light coming into the basement. I started crawling out through the rubble. I saw lots of fires outside. As I was getting out of the basement, a man handed me a baby that was covered in blood and asked me to help him get out another three children who were there in an apartment. There was one girl who had been hit in the head and was covered in blood. The children were all in shock and crying., Based on its interviews and videos, Human Rights Watch found no indications that Ukrainian military forces were deployed in the area at the time of the attack., The strikes appear indiscriminate, in violation of the laws-of-war prohibition on attacks that are not directed at a specific military objective., March 3 Attacks on Schools, Houses on Biloruskyi Lane, In three attacks on March 3, Russian bombs hit two schools and several homes on Biloruskyi Lane, all within several hundred meters of each other. Human Rights Watch interviewed eight witnesses to the attacks and observed the damage., School 18 is a primary and secondary school, but after the Russian invasion the local Territorial Defense Forces established their headquarters there, residents and volunteer aid workers said. At the same time, the school was used as a distribution center for food and other aid., About 12:30 p.m., an aircraft flying overhead dropped a bomb, a witness said. The munition caused severe damage to one corner of the school, which Human Rights Watch observed during a visit on April 19. At least 150 people were at the school when it was hit, some of them Ukrainian armed forces including from the Territorial Defense Forces, said a witness., Local officials said that 2 civilians were killed and 14 were wounded in the attack. A photo posted to Facebook on March 4 from the school, shows two bodies covered in plastic sheets., Either shortly before or after the attack on School 18, the aircraft dropped a bomb on School 21, 250 meters away. A high school student said that he was in the yard of his home, about 100 meters from the school, when he “heard a whistle, and then a big explosion.”, At the time of the attack, about 200 civilians were sheltering in the school basement because their homes did not have basements, the student said. A man living near School 21 said Territorial Defense Forces had set up a military post with sandbags in front of the school at the intersection with Biloruskyi Lane. One woman said she saw the body of a Territorial Defense Force member lying on the sandbags after the attack., Volunteer workers were on the ground floor and first floor of School 21, gathering clothing and other items for the Territorial Defense Forces and cooking for them and armed forces personnel. The student said that there may have been some soldiers coming in and out of the school to pick up food and aid, and he saw armed men driving in civilian cars. A man living near the school said Territorial Defense Forces were also sleeping in the school., The strike on School 21 destroyed much of the building. Local officials said 3 civilians were killed and 19 others were wounded. The people killed and wounded were on the ground floor, the first floor, or in the yard at the time of the attack, the student said., One of the wounded survivors posted an Instagram story on March 3, since reposted on Twitter, in which she describes the attack., The local news site Suspilne Media posted six obituaries for members of the Territorial Defense Forces who died in the attacks on School 18, School 21, and Biloruskyi Lane, indicating the military presence., Just after the two schools were hit, at least two more apparent bombs struck a cluster of houses on Biloruskyi Lane, about 150 meters from School 21, leaving two large impact craters, destroying at least eight houses, heavily damaging seven more, and damaging the roof of another, killing at least six people. A university student said he and his brother rushed to the destroyed houses after the attack to check on their friends:, Our friends were fine, but we decided to start digging where the other houses had been destroyed, and as we started, we heard voices from under the rubble. We got one woman and her mother out, and her 14-year-old son, but he was dead. We kept digging around the other destroyed houses and dug out another three dead people: the older sister of my former classmate, her boyfriend, and an older man who I think was her father or grandfather., A woman living close to the houses that were destroyed said one family with many victims was that of Volodymyr Vasylchenko, whose mother-in-law, 86, was killed along with his son-in-law Mykhailo Zheldak, 40, and Zheldak’s daughter Polina, a third-year language student; Zheldak’s son Glib, who was 14 and in seventh grade; and a friend of Polina’s who was staying with the family., “People were digging through the rubble and there was a voice,” the woman said. “They took out a boy, it was little Glib.... His head was crushed.”, Zheldak’s wife, Svitlana, and her mother and Volodymyr’s wife, Valentyna Vasylchenko, survived the attack and had since left the city, the woman said. The Zheldaks had apparently moved into the Vasylchenko home because they had presumed the area was safer than where they lived, but all were killed except for Svitlana and Valentyna., Anatolii Vasylchenko, an emergency responder with the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Chernihiv, said that based on his analysis of the crater sizes, he believed that aircraft had carried out all the attacks in and around the schools. The impact craters and scale of blast damage to structures that Human Rights Watch observed indicate the use of a large air-delivered blast weapon totaling 250 kilograms or greater in weight., Ukrainian forces failed to protect civilians under their control from the effects of attacks by not removing them from the vicinity of their forces, Human Rights Watch said. Using schools for military purposes is also contrary to the Safe Schools Declaration, which Ukraine signed in 2019., While the Russian attacks on the Territorial Defense Forces targeted legitimate military objectives, the strikes on nearby homes may have been indiscriminate because they did not appear to have been directed at a specific military target., March 13 Attack on Myru Avenue Apartment Buildings, On March 13, two munitions struck a nine-story apartment building on Myru Avenue, and four additional munitions left impact craters next to the building. Human Rights Watch inspected the damage and interviewed two witnesses to the attack., A resident of the building’s fifth floor, who was home at the time, estimated that about half of the roughly 200 families living in the building were there when the attack took place. Emergency workers had to rescue him from his apartment by crane, he said. Researchers saw heavy damage to the building, as well as damage to four newly constructed apartment buildings nearby, none of which were inhabited at the time of the attack., The head of the Chernihiv Department of Medical Care, Tetiana Lebedeva, said on April 20 that she did not know the number of dead because officials had yet to remove all bodies from the rubble. As of April 28, officials said they had dug out of the rubble and identified six bodies. Two residents told Human Rights Watch that three people – on the third, fourth, and sixth floors, as well as a couple and their three young children living on the ninth floor, the Manko family, were all killed in the attack. One of the two residents said that at least five building residents have been missing since the attack. “My friends used to live on the third and fourth floors – they all died,” one of the residents said. “I used to visit them and now they are all dead. They are lying there under the rubble.”, Lebedeva and the two residents said at least eight people were injured, including the wife of the man killed on the sixth floor, Volodymyr Bolshak, 49., This was not the first time the building had come under attack; a munition struck the seventh floor around March 7, and another attack had left two small craters in the earth surrounding the building., A building resident said he thought he had seen Territorial Defense Forces in the basement of the building, and in the basement of one of the newly constructed towers next door at the time of the March 13 attack., Human Rights Watch reviewed satellite imagery of Myru Avenue, collected before and after the attack, which showed the presence of several roadblocks on March 11 and March 18. One roadblock is in front of the apartment buildings that were damaged in the attack. Several roadblocks are also visible on March 11 about 270 meters south of the apartment buildings, at the intersection of Myru Avenue and Volodymyr Drozd Street., Satellite imagery recorded on March 18 shows a large deep pit on the other side of Myru Avenue, across from the buildings that were damaged. The purpose of the pit remains unclear, but it might have been used to protect an armored vehicle. The impact craters and damaged buildings visible in the March 18 image are consistent with witness accounts of the attack and what Human Rights Watch saw at the site. Human Rights Watch found no obituaries of Ukrainian armed forces personnel from that time and place., The lawfulness of the attack will depend in part on whether Territorial Defense Units and military vehicles, all of which are legitimate military targets, were at the site. However, even if Ukrainian forces were deployed near or in the building, the attack would need to discriminate between combatants and civilians, and the expected loss of civilian life could not be disproportionate to the anticipated military gain from the attack. If no military objectives were present at the time, the attack would have been unlawful., March 16 Attack on Bread Line on Dotsenka Street, On March 16 at around 9 a.m., dozens of people were gathered at a gate in front of a loading dock at a Soyuz supermarket waiting for free bread when a munition struck in front of the line. Ukrainian authorities reported that at least 18 people were killed and another 26 were wounded. Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses to the attack, and one who arrived at the site 30 minutes later., Dominic Serdiuk, 14, said he was waiting in line with other neighborhood residents who had heard that they could get bread:, At first it was quiet and calm, but then suddenly there were bangs, then gray smoke, and then an explosion. People fell to the ground and then something began to stink. I found myself lying on the ground and I looked down and saw a wound and blood on my left knee and another on my right knee. An old lady came over and used a piece of fabric as a bandage to stop bleeding and tied it above my left knee, and a man covered my left knee with some cloth and carried me on his shoulder toward my house. Before we got there, four men came over and lay me on a slab of wood and took me to a school that was being used as a makeshift clinic., Serdiuk received medical treatment and when interviewed on April 19 was able to walk with a limp. His doctor told him that a fragment of bone in his left knee was missing., At the time of the attack, another munition hit an apartment building 150 meters away. A building resident said the explosion caused a fire that killed a woman living on the first floor of the building, and another, Oleksandra, 65, living on the fourth floor. Another neighbor, Valentina Zakharovna, 73, died while waiting in the bread line, the resident said., Human Rights Watch examined the crater that the munition left and markings on the wall caused by the explosion, as well as the remains of the gates, which had numerous holes blown through them from the attack., All five witnesses said that to their knowledge, no Ukrainian armed forces, including Territorial Defense Forces, were in the area at the time. One supermarket worker said that he had seen soldiers around the loading dock for a few days in late February and early March, but they had left the area days before the attack. On April 19, Human Rights Watch found a Ukrainian military uniform in a corner of the loading dock area but was unable to determine how it got there or when. Human Rights Watch found no obituaries of Ukrainian armed forces personnel from the date or place of this attack., The strikes appear indiscriminate in violation of the prohibition on attacks that are not directed at a specific military objective., March 17 Attack on the Children’s Regional Hospital, On March 17 at about 9:30 a.m., at least one Uragan cluster munition rocket struck a medical complex containing the five-story Chernihiv Regional Children’s Hospital on Pyrohova Street. Local officials said the attack killed 14 civilians and injured 24 others., Human Rights Watch interviewed two witnesses to the attack. Volodymyr Andriushchenko, a pediatrician at the children’s hospital, said that at least 20 patients were in the hospital building that day, none of whom were injured in the attack. He said that metal fragments pierced the walls and shattered windows of the hospital and wounded at least one man, who was outside with a group of people smoking during the initial explosion. The wounded man was then dragged into the hospital., Andriushchenko said that, after the initial explosion, he saw about five smaller explosions in what looked like bright fireworks, going off within a few seconds of each other. After the attack, a car that had been parked outside the hospital was full of small holes, “like a sieve,” he said., Andriushchenko said that he saw several unexploded submunitions in the area. He also found a small piece of chopped steel rod lodged in the insulation of his office window frame that was apparently discharged by a submunition when it detonated., Vasylchenko, the emergency responder, said that his team found four unexploded 9N210 fragmentation submunitions dispersed from a Russian 220mm Uragan cluster munition rocket, including one in the yard of the hospital, and the empty cargo section of the rocket that was lodged in the ground 20 meters from the main hospital building. He showed Human Rights Watch a photograph of all the submunitions that he said they found at the hospital., When visiting the site on April 20, Human Rights Watch identified seven distinct impact craters from the submunitions used in the attack, including five that show uniform fragmentation patterns, as well as multiple round and oval holes in a thin metal fence, consistent with the detonation of fragmentation munitions, within 15 meters of the Regional Children’s Hospital and 55 meters of nearby City Hospital No. 1, which was not damaged in the attack. Andriushchenko said the attacks also affected several houses in the residential area surrounding the hospitals., Vasylchenko said that he was unaware of any military forces in the area at the time of the attack. Human Rights Watch found no indications that Ukrainian forces were in the vicinity at the time. No obituaries were found of Ukrainian armed force members who died there that day., Hospitals have enhanced protections under the laws of war, which make the strikes on this hospital complex unlawful. In addition, the use of cluster munitions was also unlawful, as they are inherently indiscriminate weapons., March 17 Attack on Chernihiv City Hospital No. 2, On March 17 at about 4:20 p.m., munitions damaged City Hospital No. 2, located in a medical complex in northeastern Chernihiv. The complex also houses a maternity hospital and City Hospital No. 3, neither of which were damaged in the attack. Local authorities said that two doctors and two nurses were injured by broken glass. Human Rights Watch interviewed two witnesses to the attack., A medical worker said he was outside of City Hospital No. 2 at the time and heard several explosions nearby. Many of the patients and medical workers sought shelter in the basement. Then the hospital itself was hit by three munitions, including one on the trauma clinic., “The next morning, we went outside and saw that, instead of snow, everything was covered with shards of glass,” he said., During a visit to the hospital on April 20, Human Rights Watch saw that most of the windows had been blown out and the roof was damaged. Holes and cracks were visible in some of the exterior and interior walls., The medical worker said he did not see any Ukrainian armed forces in the area at the time of the attack. He did see several policemen, who are civilians, checking the documents of people entering the building., Iryna Goi, head of maintenance at the hospital, said the military had established a checkpoint about 50 meters south of the hospital with two soldiers who checked people’s documents., Satellite imagery from March 18 shows a potential roadblock about 50 meters from the hospital, in about the location that Goi had mentioned, as well as three circular structures with a roughly 4-meter diameter next to the roadblock. Human Rights Watch was not able to determine their purpose. Satellite imagery as of late April no longer showed signs of the structures., A researcher from a Ukrainian human rights organization visited the site on May 13. While the pits were gone, the soil in those areas had been recently disturbed, and the remains of a sandbag, often used for military barriers, lay a few meters away., Human Rights Watch found no obituaries from the attack linked to Ukrainian armed forces personnel., Hospitals have enhanced protections under the laws of war, which make the strikes on this facility unlawful. The presence of a military checkpoint near the hospital does not change the hospital’s protected status., International Humanitarian Law, International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, applicable during the international armed conflict in Ukraine can be found in the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I), and customary international law., The laws of war obligate parties to a conflict to distinguish at all times between combatants and civilians. Civilians may never be the deliberate target of attacks. Warring parties are required to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects. Attacks may target only military objectives. Attacks targeting civilians, or that fail to discriminate between combatants and civilians, or would cause disproportionate harm to the civilian population compared to the anticipated military gain, are prohibited., Forces must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating military objectives – including combatants, weapons, and equipment – in or near densely populated areas, and endeavor to remove civilians from the vicinity of military targets., Under the laws of war, hospitals and other medical facilities must be “respected and protected” in all circumstances. Medical facilities remain protected from attack unless they are used to commit hostile acts that are outside their humanitarian function. Even then, they are only subject to attack after a warning has been given setting a reasonable time limit, and after such warning has gone unheeded. The presence of injured combatants or armed personnel providing building security does not affect the civilian character of medical facilities., Attacking forces are not relieved from their obligation to take into account the risk to civilians, including the duty to avoid causing disproportionate harm to civilians, because the defending party has located military targets within or near populated areas. That is, the presence of forces in a populated area would not justify attacking the area without regard to the threatened civilian population, including the duty to distinguish combatants from civilians and refrain from disproportionate attacks., Warring parties are obligated, circumstances permitting, to give “effective advance warning” of attacks that may affect civilians. An “effective” warning would take into account the timing of the warning and the ability of the civilians to leave the area. A warning that does not give civilians adequate time to leave for a safer area would not be considered “effective.”, Ukraine, but not Russia, has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to take concrete steps to make students, teachers, and schools safer during armed conflict, including by agreeing to refrain from using schools for military purposes. Unlawful attacks on schools and hospitals are among the grave violations against children in armed conflict that should trigger inclusion on the UN secretary-general’s annual “list of shame.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-strikes-killed-scores-civilians-chernihiv-enarruuk
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 9 June 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,10 Jun 2022,"From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 9 June 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 9,585 civilian casualties in the country: 4,339 killed and 5,246 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 8 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 9 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 9 June have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation's military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-9-june-2022-enruuk
EU sets up €20 million support for Ukrainian start-ups through European Innovation Council,News and Press Release,EC,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",9 Jun 2022,"The European Commission has launched an ambitious €20 million action to support the Ukrainian innovation community. Through a targeted amendment of the 2022 European Innovation Council (EIC) work programme, the new initiative will support at least 200 Ukrainian deep tech start-ups with up to €60,000 each. In addition, the EIC will offer non-financial support, such as business advisory services and matchmaking. This will enhance the capacity of Ukrainian innovators to interact with the European innovation ecosystem, enter new markets and benefit from the European financing instruments., Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: “While fighting Russian military aggression it is vital for Ukraine to look forward. The country has a vivid start-up scene and great potential for innovative businesses. It is very important to preserve this economic capacity and enable Ukrainian tech innovators to grow and integrate further into the European innovation ecosystem. We want them to expand their operations to the European markets and beyond.”, Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: “We aim to mobilise all possible resources and provide support to Ukraine. Today, we are calling on the European innovation actors such as start-up associations, enterprise support centres, incubators and accelerators to join us in supporting the Ukrainian deep tech community to make it stronger, more resilient and competitive.”, Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth said: “Prior to Russia's invasion, Ukraine had a vibrant tech start-up scene, with over 1600 start-ups. This new action aims to safeguard this progress, reinforce links to the European innovation ecosystem, and ensure Ukrainian start-ups are well placed to become a critical driver for rebuilding the Ukrainian economy.”, The €20 million support will be disbursed through a competitive call for proposals for a pan-European network of start-up associations, supporting Ukrainian innovation stakeholders. Synergies with relevant EU initiatives, such as the Enterprise Europe Network will be ensured. With this call, opening on 23 June, the European Innovation Council (EIC) aspires to ensure the business continuity of the Ukrainian tech companies and foster their growth. The action can help prepare Ukrainian start-ups to compete for future EIC funding opportunities. The EIC can fund start-ups up to €17.5 million in grants and equity investment and can crowd-in further private investments up to three times the amount invested by public funds., In addition, following Ukraine's ratification, the agreement associating Ukraine to the Horizon Europe and Euratom Research and Training Programmes entered into force today. The agreement was signed on 12 October 2021 on the occasion of the EU-Ukraine Summit. Now European and Ukrainian researchers and innovators, universities, businesses, including small and medium-sized ones (SMEs), have all the opportunities to work together on equal terms to reach joint goals and address critical challenges. In view of the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the EU's commitment to offer tangible means of support to the Ukrainian research and innovation community, Ukraine will participate in Horizon Europe and Euratom Programmes without having to contribute financially for years 2021 and 2022. Its waived contribution was estimated at around €20 million., This support is complementary to the ongoing ‘European Research Area for Ukraine' (ERA4Ukraine), Horizon4Ukraine and ERC for Ukraine initiatives, as well as the dedicated fellowship scheme of €25 million under the Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions (MSCA) for displaced researchers of Ukraine., Background, In February 2022, the Commission adopted the annual work programme of the EIC, opening funding opportunities worth over €1.7 billion in 2022. Launched in March 2021 as a major novelty under the Horizon Europe programme, the EIC has an overall budget of over €10 billion between 2021 and 2027. To mobilise all possible resources and provide support that can help Ukraine in these difficult times, the EIC work programme has been amended to launch an additional call for proposals targeting Ukraine's deep-tech community, which has a strong potential for creating breakthrough innovations. In the past years, the Ukrainian start-up scene has been growing steadily and increasing its contribution to the Ukrainian economic growth. This action should strengthen the Ukrainian tech ecosystems and supporting innovative solutions for rebuilding the Ukrainian economy and infrastructure after the war., Relations between the EU and Ukraine in the field of research and innovation date back to 2002 when the European Community and Ukraine signed an Agreement on cooperation in Science and Technology. In 2015, Ukraine became fully associated to Horizon 2020, the EU's research and innovation programme (2014-2020), with 170 Ukrainian entities receiving close to €46 million in EU funding and showing innovation leadership and excellence in researchers' mobility, as well as in transport and energy. In 2016, Ukraine and the EU also concluded an agreement on the association of the country to the Euratom Research and Training Programme. The Euratom Research and Training Programme aims at improving the levels of nuclear safety and radiation protection. On 10 May 2022, the Commission announced the launch of the new MSCA4Ukraine scheme, part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. With a total budget of €25 million, the new scheme will enable scientists from Ukraine to continue their work in Europe and countries associated to Horizon Europe, helping to safeguard Ukraine's research and innovation system, and the freedom of scientific research at large., For More Information, EIC work programme 2022, EIC Action for Ukraine factsheet, EIC Impact report 2021, Funding and tender portal, ERA4Ukraine, International cooperation in R&I - Ukraine, Horizon Europe, Euratom, Europe's Global Approach to Research and Innovation, Print friendly pdf, Press contact, Johannes BAHRKE Phone +32 2 295 86 15 Mail johannes.bahrke@ec.europa.eu, Marietta GRAMMENOU Phone +32 2 298 35 83 Mail marietta.grammenou@ec.europa.eu",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-sets-eu20-million-support-ukrainian-start-ups-through-european-innovation-council

This included:, a total of 4,302 killed (1,639 men, 1,075 women, 100 girls, and 105 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,316 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 5,217 injured (1,065 men, 727 women, 120 girls, and 149 boys, as well as 170 children and 2,986 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,472 casualties (2,493 killed and 2,979 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,665 casualties (2,339 killed and 2,326 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 807 casualties (154 killed and 653 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 4,047 casualties (1,809 killed and 2,238 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 7 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 8 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 8 June have been included into the above figures.

From Palanca to Bucharest: the refugees' journey in the quest for a better future,News and Press Release,TSF,"Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",31 May 2022,"In Palanca, on the Moldovan-Ukrainian border, about 30 people get on each bus to Bucharest. These buses bring refugees safely from Ukraine towards a possible better future. ""Refugees"": this often anonymous group that we find every day in the press, but which, by dint of reading and listening to it, loses all its humanity., By taking the bus with them, we have the opportunity to talk to each of them, to listen to their stories, to see their looks, sometimes tired, sometimes full of hope. Their stories are all different, but they all have one element in common: the simple desire to continue their lives, to see the war end, to realise their dreams, in peace., Petro and Ivanna had chosen to leave Kiev to live out their retirement in the sunny Odessa. This retired couple forced to leave their country, are now trying to reach Spain in order to end their days in peace., We meet the family who found themselves living in a neighbourhood where there was no water or electricity. ""Without electricity it was hard, but it was still OK,"" they tell us, ""but as soon as the water was gone, it became very complicated.” In addition to the material damage, the bombings sometimes have much more severe consequences. Their youngest child hadn't been able to sleep for weeks, waking up in panic during the night. This is when the decision to leave their country has taken shape, because their lives couldn’t continue like this. Talking to the other members of the family, we realise that they are just a family like any other. A child who is a Youtuber and a video game enthusiast, the daughter with whom we discover that we like the same music and we know the same bands. The family now heads to Prague, once again, to try to continue their lives, in peace., Ivan, the sailor from the merchant navy who wants to join his friends in Lithuania. He run to cross the border and avoid being drafted into the army, ""because my thing is boats, not guns"", he tells us. And Ahmet, a Turk, who is trying to join his sister in Germany to continue studying., Aurelia, a Russian translator from Odessa, who has decided to stay in Huşi, to help as a translator. She shows us all the pictures she has on her phone of Odessa, its beach, its monuments. She tells us that for her the sky is always bluer in Odessa. Because yes, Petro, Ivanna, Ivan, Ahmet, and all the other people we met, did not leave their country of their own free will. On the contrary, they left sometimes their family, sometimes their job, their friends, sometimes a part of their life, sometimes their entire life., About 16 hours of travel separate them from a possible new beginning. Yet another journey on top of the fatigue, the worry, the days and weeks spent in dangerous conditions before being able to cross the border. Throughout this journey, the free Wi-Fi connection provided by TSF on the bus helps Petro, Ivanna, Ivan, Ahmet, and all the others to stay in touch with those they have left behind, to find the strength to continue their journey. The connection also allows them to follow the news from their country, and to seek information for the next steps in this journey to a life as new and normal as possible and make this part of their exile a little bit less difficult.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/palanca-bucharest-refugees-journey-quest-better-future
Ukraine humanitarian response supported by data collaboration,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",9 Jun 2022,"LVIV, Ukraine/UNITED NATIONS, New York – When Viktoria Kravets, 17, woke up early on 24 February in her home in Ukraine, she knew something was terribly wrong. “I immediately saw a dozen notifications and thought that I was still asleep,” she recalled to UNFPA. “I lay in bed and couldn't understand what was going on. Our school lessons were suspended, and I sat at home flipping through the news with fear.”, Reliable information can be elusive even under normal circumstances, but in humanitarian crises, uncertainty only grows. In the moment when individuals are forced to make life-or-death decisions about whether to flee, where to go and what to bring, we often see communications systems break down, leaving routine forms of reporting to be replaced by rumour and misinformation., These are moments when organizations, too, must make life-or-death decisions about where to locate aid and resources. To address this, UNFPA is providing updated population data to humanitarian responders, an initiative that is saving lives., ""Good data systems are critical. Coordinated, triangulated, and high-quality data across the full spectrum of humanitarian support allows for an evidence-based, rights-centred, effective response that leaves no one behind,"" said Dr. Julitta Onabanjo, the head of UNFPA’s technical division, in a session on the sidelines of the United Nations Commission on Population and Development., Real-time data, ""Coordinated efforts to align population data and displacement data are badly needed to inform humanitarian decision-making,"" Giulia Vallese, UNFPA’s Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said at the event., UNFPA quickly mobilized to meet this need., By the first week of March, UNFPA had provided a so-called “common operational dataset” to humanitarian partners, featuring updated population projections by sex, age and region for Ukraine. The country’s last census dates back to 2001 (its long-awaited next census was due to take place in 2023), so UNFPA complemented outdated information with more than 20 years worth of civil registration data, administrative migration data, and geospatially referenced data., ""Knowing who they are, where they are, and in which physical and mental conditions they reach the services can make the difference between life and death,"" Ms. Vallese said., UNFPA is using these data to allocate medical supplies, dignity kits and essential reproductive health and psychosocial services to women affected by the war in Ukraine, including displacement sites in neighbouring countries., The data are also featured on the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform for use by other life-saving organizations. For example, the International Organization on Migration used the common operational dataset to mobilize a population survey helping to understand the state of internal displacement within Ukraine., Doing her part, “Political decision-making relies on near real-time data,” said Hans-Christian Mangelsdord of the German foreign affairs ministry, speaking at the UN event, which was hosted by the Government of Moldova, the UN Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration., UNFPA is working closely with partners to update the dataset, which as of late May and early June reflected the mass movement of an estimated 7 million refugees and more than 7 million internally displaced within the country., Victoria, too, is doing her part. She volunteers in shelters and aid distribution locations, registering displaced individuals and families to help ensure their needs are known and met., “We are registering refugees here,” she said in a video diary she recorded for UNFPA. Her diary highlights not only the strains on her community but also their resilience and determination., “There are in fact, many people,” she emphasized. “There are people here, still alive.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-response-supported-data-collaboration
Ukraine: EU announces additional €205 million in humanitarian aid as Commissioner Lenarčič visits Ukraine,News and Press Release,ECHO,Contributions,9 Jun 2022,"In light of the soaring humanitarian needs in Ukraine, Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, visits Ukraine today to meet humanitarian organisations and high level Ukrainian government officials to help coordinate the EU's crisis response on the ground., On the occasion, the EU today is allocating another €205 million in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. This brings total EU humanitarian aid funding and the value of in-kind assistance to over €700 million in response to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, of which €13 million is dedicated to projects in neighbouring Moldova., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič said: *“For more than 100 days, we have witnessed unnecessary **suffering and countless violations of international humanitarian law. *In this moment of crisis, our duty is to stand by the most vulnerable. We have swiftly responded by considerably scaling up our presence in Ukraine. With this funding our humanitarian partners are providing food, water, healthcare, shelter, protection and cash assistance. We are also working closely with the Ukrainian authorities to ensure the assistance provided by the EU Member States is aligned with the constantly evolving needs. Through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism we have delivered millions of life-saving supplies to Ukrainians, and we are committed to support Ukraine as long as it takes.”, EU humanitarian support in Ukraine, In addition to financial humanitarian assistance, the EU has mobilised all possible resources to enable aid into Ukraine, which includes:, EU humanitarian partners are ensuring that assistance reaches the most vulnerable people, even in the restricted areas. They are providing cash assistance, water, food, healthcare, protection and emergency shelter to affected civilians. As of today, EU-funded cash assistance programmes have already reached 1.59 million people with a monthly grant of 2,200 UAH. This is helping them to purchase items they need the most, while simultaneously contributing to the local economy., Background, Since the start of Russia's invasion on 24 February, the humanitarian needs in Ukraine have risen to unprecedented levels. According to the United Nations, up to 15.7 million people require humanitarian assistance. The war in Ukraine has already forced more than 14 million people to leave their homes, of which almost 7 million people have crossed the border to neighbouring countries. It is estimated that more than 8 million people are internally displaced. Meanwhile, close to 13 million people are stranded in affected areas, either unwilling or unable to leave due to military action., The EU has responded to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine on 28 February with €90 million of funding, on 10 March with €3 million for Moldova, on 19 April with €50 million, and today with additional €205 million that has been requested by the European Commission and currently under adoption by the EU's Budgetary Authority, bringing the total amount of EU humanitarian aid in response to the war to €348 million.

Demonstrations were held across the region against the Russian invasion and price hikes, with the rising cost-of-living sparking demonstrations in several countries. Unionists marked the 100th anniversary of Northern Ireland with a march through Belfast. Meanwhile, cross-border fighting took place along the Kyrgyz-Tajik border and the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued last week in the eastern and southern regions of the country. In the Luhansk region, Russian forces occupied most of Severodonetsk but were pushed back in parts following successful counterattacks by Ukrainian forces (Wall Street Journal, 5 June 2022). The capture of Severodonetsk is an important objective for Russian forces in the region, potentially paving the way for Russian forces to secure full control of the Luhansk region (Washington Post, 7 June 2022). Intense fighting also continued across the Donetsk region, with both sides claiming to have inflicted significant losses on their opponent (24 Channel, 1 June 2022; Armed Forces of Ukraine, 29 June 2022; Izvestia, 2 June 2022).1 In the Kharkiv region and southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhia, Russian forces did not conduct major offensive operations last week, focusing instead on defending currently occupied territories (ISW, 4 June 2022)., Separately, Ukrainian forces claim to have pushed back the Russian Black Sea fleet more than 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian coast in operations to ease the blockade of Ukrainian seaports (Ukrinform, 6 June 2022). The Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports since the start of the full-scale invasion has contributed to worsening global food supply disruptions, including growing food insecurity in African countries that largely depend on Ukrainian and Russian wheat (The Guardian, 31 May 2022)., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with airstrikes and artillery attacks last week. Deadly Russian airstrikes and shelling of civilian targets were recorded in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv regions. These trends contribute to the 240% increase in violence in the Mykolaiv region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the Mykolaiv region last month.2, Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Belarus, Cyprus, France, Germany, Montenegro, Italy, Poland, Russia, and Serbia last week, Meanwhile, demonstration activity against rising living costs was reported across the region last week. Demonstrators demanded better salary increases and relief measures to face increased living and production costs and rising fuel prices during demonstrations in Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. In Italy, fishermen demonstrated in several coastal cities against an increase in the price of diesel fuel, with outbreaks of violence reported in Marche and Rome. In Marche, a demonstrator assaulted a police officer as demonstrating fishermen tried to block local fishermen, who had decided not to join their action, from sailing in San Benedetto del Tronto. In Rome, police charged demonstrating fishermen as they attempted to push through a police cordon during a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Agriculture., In Northern Ireland, around 25,000 unionists marched through Belfast to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland on 28 May (BBC News, 28 May 2022).3 Marchers call for the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom to be protected. Around 130 parade bands took part, including the Orange Order, the Royal Black Institution, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, and the Independent Orange Order. The march was originally scheduled to be held last year but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic (BBC News, 28 May 2022). Commemorations and sectarian demonstrations in Northern Ireland are often at risk of turning violent, with most parade-related violence in Belfast occurring during the annual marching season, beginning in March and peaking in July (*for more, see this *ACLED report on Northern Ireland)., Tajik and Kyrgyz forces clashed along the disputed border between the Batken district of Kyrgyzstan and the Israfa district of Tajikistan last week. Kyrgyz and Tajik sources both accused opposing forces of crossing the border and triggering the clash (RFE/RL, 3 June 2022; Asia-Plus, 3 June 2022). The exchange of fire left one Tajik and two Kyrgyz border guards wounded. Much of the 970-kilometer border between the countries is yet to be demarcated (RFE/RL, 3 June 2022), prompting sporadic outbreaks of violence (for more, see this ACLED report on violence along the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border). Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards have engaged in multiple clashes this year, including a deadly clash in mid-April., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued last week. On 28 May, one Armenian serviceman was killed during clashes in the Syunik region of Armenia. Fighting was also reported in the Shahumyan province, contributing to the 219% increase in violence in Shahumyan in the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in the region in the past month. While claimed by the de facto state of Artsakh, Shahumyan is controlled almost entirely by Azerbaijan following gains in the war of 2020. Additionally, one Azerbaijani civilian was hit by a landmine in the Fizuli region.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-28-may-3-june-2022
Preventing a second crisis: Health needs extend beyond Ukraine’s borders warns IFRC,News and Press Release,IFRC,"Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 Jun 2022,"Budapest, 9 June 2022 – A crisis is emerging in the shadow of conflict across Ukraine: one that extends beyond the country’s borders. Ukraine’s already stressed healthcare system is buckling under the weight of expectation and medical needs as people continue fleeing conflict areas seeking safety. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working around the clock to address needs far greater than what’s visible to the eye., *“We know it’s possible to prevent a secondary crisis, but no one organization or entity can do it alone,” *said Xavier Castellanos Mosquera, IFRC Under Secretary General., More than 290 health care facilities and counting across Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed during the conflict according to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than 1.4 million people are without running water across eastern Ukraine, while UNOCHA reports an additional 4.6 million people in the country at risk for losing access to running water -- a growing risk of water-borne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea. Lack of electricity makes it impossible for water treatment and sanitation efforts to be effective., Health systems in immediate neighbouring countries, including Romania, Belarus, Hungary and Moldova, were already stretched prior to the conflict due to COVID-19. While each country is providing health support to an increased number of people, this can divert valuable health resources away from the people who are still recovering from impacts of COVID-19. The sheer volume of current and future health needs as the conflict continues requires additional resources., “The lack of medical supplies, health care staff and critical infrastructure grow day by day,” said Nick Prince, IFRC Emergency Health delegate. “The millions who have migrated to the western area of Ukraine and eastern European countries are at an elevated risk of infectious diseases given the overcrowded living conditions, limited access to shelter, nutritional stress and exposure to the elements.”, On top of these factors, people on the move are forced to delay treatment for existing chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer and, in the absence of vaccinations to meet safe thresholds – including for COVID-19, there is the very strong likelihood of the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. Ukraine also has some of the highest burden of chronic infectious diseases in Europe, particularly HIV and Tuberculosis – a massive risk not only for displaced people themselves, but also for Ukraine’s health care system once they return., *“The Red Cross calls on governments and the international community to provide funds for inclusive access to health services and vaccines, testing and treatment, clean water and mental health and psychological support in the long-term,” *said Castellanos Mosquera., In Uzhhorod, Ukraine -- where roughly 100,000 people from conflict-torn areas have fled, doubling the city’s population -- a Red Cross health center will open this month to treat both urgent and primary care needs free of charge to all patients. It’s the first of its kind in the area. In collaboration with local authorities, the clinic aims to serve people in need for years to come. The Ukrainian Red Cross has nearly a dozen mobile health teams in the country with more on the way and is providing mental health and psychosocial support to people who have been forced to flee. In addition, food, baby supplies and hygiene items are available to anyone in need., In Moldova, Red Cross teams are preparing to install more handwashing stations and continue to distribute hygiene kits. Access to clean water– the number one prevention mechanism for disease prevention – remains a priority. Red Cross volunteers across eastern Europe are also integrating with teams distributing emergency cash to people who have fled Ukraine to ensure they have access to critical health resources and information., In Hungary, the Hungarian Red Cross, supported by the Spanish Red Cross has set up health posts at the border crossings to provide first aid, primary health care, mental health support and emergency relief to people arriving by train from Chop, Ukraine., In Budapest:, Katie Wilkes, +1 312 952 2270, RRCommsCo.Budapest@ifrc.org, Merlijn Stoffels, +31 65 491 8481, RRCommsTL.Budapest@ifrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/preventing-second-crisis-health-needs-extend-beyond-ukraines-borders-warns-ifrc

** Spokespeople, recent photos and footage are available **  , Press release9 June 2022, The DEC's Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal has now raised over £350 million to help families affected by the crisis over the weeks, months and years ahead.   , DEC charities are working with local people on innovative projects including a bicycle delivery team in Kharkiv to ensure food gets to the hardest to reach elderly and people with disabilities, many of whom can't leave their beds.  , Download still images and the film of cycle couriers delivering food to most vulnerable  , The DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal has now raised more than £350 million, it was announced today. With the funds raised, DEC member charities and their local partners are working hard and finding innovative ways to ensure that the millions affected by the conflict, and in desperate need, have food, cash, water, shelter, medical assistance, protection and trauma care.   , DEC member charity CAFOD is supporting a mass food distribution project, through funding a local partner Depaul Ukraine and has already supplied regular food baskets to 21,000 people, which each cost £10 and last five days. As part of this, a team of cycle couriers are delivering food to elderly and people with disabilities, and those who struggle to leave their homes. This is just one example of the innovative ways DEC funds are supporting local people to get aid to where it is most needed. , Father Vitaliy, from Depaul Ukraine, who is leading the cycling initiative in Kharkiv, said: ""The humanitarian crisis in this part of the city is huge. What I do see is that the poor people of Ukraine are now much poorer. In these three months we have been feeding more than 21,000 people from around Ukraine. We are focusing on those who are not able to move because of their physical health.  , ""Love is inventive until infinity. We now have a big problem with petrol, but our work to distribute aid will never stop because of human energy. There are so many young people who want to help others and together they started this great initiative. One of the co-ordinators saw how her friend was paralysed and needed someone to bring him food.  Her friend offered to deliver food to him on his bicycle -- it was 30 kilometres away -- and an idea was born.   , ""Today I was surprised to learn from the cycle group that they are now feeding more than 700 people. They have a list of disabled and elderly people, some of them who aren't able stand up from their beds. Everything is destroyed, and people are coming to us asking for aid.""  , Aleksander, 50, an engineer-designer of radio equipment and now one of the vital cycle couriers said: ""I have a wife and two daughters -- all of them except the youngest daughter were against escaping the city. But after the first week of war, it became obvious that Kharkiv would not be left in peace, so I insisted on my family's evacuation. It was the hardest decision of my life. Saying goodbye to them at the train station felt unreal. Afterwards, I returned home and just lay on my bed, emotionless.   , ""I want to be useful and to be an example to my kids for the future. As bicycle delivery volunteers, we are united by a common goal - to help. We live without making plans for the future. We simply wake up, make our deliveries, spend a couple of hours of free time, and repeat. We are alive, and that is enough to be happy.""   , Saleh Saeed, CEO of the DEC said: ""It has been incredible and humbling to watch this outstanding wave of generosity and warmth from the British public to the people of Ukraine.  In spite of the impact of Covid-19 and the growing cost-of-living crisis here in the UK, families, schools, community groups and individuals across the country have given what they can and given so generously.  , ""Seeing this help in action has been truly inspiring. I am in awe of the aid workers and volunteers in Ukraine and neighbouring countries who are selflessly putting their needs aside to help others to cope with this devastating conflict. There are so many examples, but one project that has particularly impressed me is the team of cyclists in Kharkiv, who with DEC funds, are working together to deliver food to very vulnerable elderly and disabled people who otherwise would be without. Their tireless energy and ingenuity is astonishing. I am deeply moved and grateful to the British public, the UK government, companies and trusts for making it all possible. Thank you."" , DEC charities have so far budgeted £74.5 million to spend over the first six months of the response. Funds from the appeal, which includes £25 million in matched funding from the UK government, the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through UK Aid Match, will be spent over a period of at least three years to meet the ongoing needs of people affected by the conflict, both inside Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries of Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Poland.    , Below is a summary of planned expenditure in these first 6 months, although these plans may be adjusted to meet changing needs on the ground.   , Health:  28% will be spent on provision of primary healthcare services, providing items like trauma kits and first aid kits, as well as supporting healthcare facilities with oxygen compressors and vital pharmaceutical products.    , Cash:  23% will support affected populations needs (internally displaced people, refugees, as well as members of the host communities) through multi-purpose cash delivered using a variety of approaches: pre-paid cards, digital transfers etc to meet vital basic needs   , Food:  16% will be spent by members and their local partners to deliver food provisions (sugar, salt, oatmeal, canned sardines, white rice, and black tea), hot meals or using cash transfers like supermarket vouchers.     , Water, sanitation & hygiene: 11% will be spent on safe drinking water, hygiene information and hygiene kits.   , Protection: 11% will be spent on psychosocial support for women, children, older people and people with disabilities, stress management training sessions.   , Shelter: 2% will be spent on bed linen, blankets, towels, kitchen sets, jerry cans, buckets for displaced people and host communities.   , ENDS, Notes to editors:   , Media enquiries please call 020 7387 0200 or 07930 999 014 (out of hours)., Spokespeople available in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and the UK.  For more information or to request interviews in advance please contact: kgarvin@dec.org.uk;

"HCT Strategy on Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian Action in Ukraine, May to December 2022",Manual and Guideline,UNCT Ukraine,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",9 Jun 2022,"CONTEXT AND RATIONALE, The humanitarian context in Ukraine is unique amongst today’s crises. The launch in February 2022 by the Russian Federation of a full-scale military invasion, which has followed eight years of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine, has already affected millions of Ukrainians, many of them civilians, displaced millions of peoples, caused civilian deaths and injuries, and damage to civilian buildings, including hospitals, schools, and homes. The current situation remains directly tied to the impact of prolonged military operations, predominantly happening into urban environment where intense hostilities have been conducted with a critical lack of distinction between civilian and military objectives resulting into a wide impact on civilian casualties and exacerbating human suffering, separation of communities, internal displacement, damage on infrastructure, high levels of landmine and unexploded ordnance-contamination.
The nature of this crisis fundamentally challenges compliance and respect with International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law as well as normative principles related to the protection of civilians. The ongoing armed violence in Eastern Ukraine and rapidly deteriorating security environment in civilian living space is putting hundreds of thousands of people’s lives at risk. The international armed conflict between the Federation of Russia and Ukraine must be governed by International Humanitarian Law, including the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, which apply to all parties to the armed conflict, obligating them to always distinguish between civilians and combatants, and to take precautions to protect civilians and other non-combatants from the hazards of war.
A series of worrying developments has increased the level of humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Of particular concern are:, Full-scale military operation in eastern Ukraine with excessive impact and threats to the physical security of civilians involving cluster munitions and the disproportionate use of explosive weapons in urban environment, including internationally banned weapons., Interference by the parties to the conflict of access to humanitarian assistance and limiting access to food, medicine, education, and adequate housing., The limited measures taken by the parties to the conflict in avoiding the recurrence of breaches of their obligations to prevent violations of the rights and unnecessary harm on civilians in accordance with the letter and the spirit of IHL and IHRL., The security constraints in areas directly affected by the conflict and in areas outside of Government control, combined with bureaucratic impediments on the delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected populations., The lack or limited knowledge by the parties to the conflict, local authorities and relief providers about the nature and operating principles for humanitarian action context, which require a clear distinction from military action., The need to ensure a human rights-based approach in the provision of support to the Government of Ukraine in its efforts to assist affected populations and promote humanitarian principles with national counterparts for delivery of assistance to affected peoples., The scale of displacement, dynamic and underscoring complex protection issues to which humanitarian assistance to Internally Displaced Peoples must address their most urgent needs and identify opportunities for long-term durable solutions., Against this backdrop, the HCT Protection Strategy Working Group has developed this Protection Strategy to support the humanitarian response. It will strategically leverage the resources of the HCT to establish a system to address protection within assistance delivery, promote legal norms, advocacy, confidential representations, and humanitarian diplomacy to ensure a coherent protection approach that addresses the causes and consequences of violations and abuses of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, including those contain in the Convention of the rights of the child and its protocols. The HCT’s Protection Strategy takes stocks of the previous HCT Protection Strategic framework (2019 – 2021) that already captured some of those existing challenges, to allow the HCT, protection partners and other duty bearers to 1) strengthen evidence based advocacy support on the most critical protection risks, 2) promote accountability for obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law with the parties to the conflict and other humanitarian duty bearers, and 3) ensure that all collective actions assisting conflict affected peoples, including Internally Displaced Peoples and those remaining to address immediate and longer-term protection needs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/hct-strategy-centrality-protection-humanitarian-action-ukraine-may-december-2022
Russian war crimes in Ukraine: EU supports the International Criminal Court investigation with €7.25 million,News and Press Release,EC,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",8 Jun 2022,"Today, the European Commission has launched a new project, under its Foreign Policy Instrument, to support the investigation capacities of the International Criminal Court (ICC) with €7.25 million. This project, which was first announced by HRVP in Kyiv, is part of the EU's efforts to fight impunity for international crimes globally. In particular, it will help the ICC to scale up its investigation capacity to respond to the ongoing investigations into war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine., High Representative/Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borrell, stated: “There can be no impunity for the crimes committed under Russian occupation. The International Criminal Court's investigations are crucial to ensure accountability and justice for the heinous crimes committed in Ukraine.”, Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: “One thing is clear: a global response is necessary to ensure that those responsible for the atrocities committed in Ukraine are brought to justice. We are closely cooperating with the International Criminal Court to make sure that there is no impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes.”, The EU supports the investigation launched by the ICC Prosecutor. On 25 April, Eurojust and ICC agreed to join forces and for the Court to participate in the EU's Joint Investigation Team. The information on possible war crimes and crimes against humanity is currently being collected to enable investigation and adjudication by relevant actors in the futureto ensure that those responsible for war crimes and other atrocities are held accountable., This crisis response measure will provide targeted support to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC to further scale up the Office's data storage and processing infrastructure and to build up additional analytical and forensic capacity for new types of evidence, including digital., Background, The European Union is committed to make Russian decision-makers accountable for the gross violations of international law and international humanitarian law in Ukraine. Following reports of the atrocities committed in Bucha, in Ukraine, President von der Leyen spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, agreeing to ensure a close cooperation. President von der Leyen tasked Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, to follow-up and support the coordination of the EU efforts to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine., In this context, it is crucial to ensure safe storage of evidence outside Ukraine as well as to support the investigations and prosecutions by various European and international judicial authorities. The Commission proposed to amend the Eurojust Regulation to give the Agency the legal possibility to preserve and share evidence on war crimes. The proposal was agreed by the European Parliament and the Council on 19 May., The European Union Advisory Mission (EUAM) that was already in Ukraine before the war, will help the Ukrainian Prosecutor General in providing training and donating equipment to ensure safe investigation and collection of evidence to be presented in front of the International Criminal Court. The EU is also looking into additional ways of supporting the investigation of the ICC., The Ukrainian General Prosecution Office, 13 EU Member States and the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) have opened investigations on war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine. The Ukrainian prosecution office has established a dedicated homepage, requesting citizens to register and document such crimes. An EU Joint Investigation Team (JIT) was set up with Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine, supported by Eurojust and Europol. Eurojust and the International Criminal Court (ICC) agreed on 25 April to join forces and for the Court to participate in the Joint Investigation Team. Recently, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia became members of the JIT too. Other Member States are expected to join the JIT. The Genocide Network, hosted at Eurojust, has started training sessions for judicial authorities in the Member States and in Ukraine to enhance case building for core international crimes. The EU also stands ready to support the investigations, for instance with expertise such as forensic experts, equipment or training possibilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russian-war-crimes-ukraine-eu-supports-international-criminal-court-investigation-eu725-million

While humanitarian partners have been on the ground providing assistance since the first days of the invasion, with access to Kharkiv city and its rural surroundings now improving, a scale up of the response is both required and expected. This brief presents a concise overview and update on displacement trends, the most immediate humanitarian needs, and the key characteristics of the local response currently in place. The aim is to inform partners on primary considerations in regards to setting up or scaling up a response in Kharkiv., The findings presented in this brief are based on 13 Key Informant (KI) Interviews with local actors including civil society organisations, volunteer networks, international NGOs and local authorities, conducted by REACH from 30 May to 3 June. The findings should be considered as indicative only., Summary of Findings, Kharkiv is still not safe for return: frequent shelling and unexploded ordinance still pose a significant risk to life of local communities and volunteers., Some households are returning to their places of habitual residence, and re-opening their businesses, despite safety risks., Priority needs are for medicines and fuel, multi-purpose cash and livelihoods support., Local actors and volunteer networks are best positioned to identify needs and deliver assistance, with international actors and donors providing financial and in-kind support., While effective at delivering food, non-food and hygiene items, local volunteer networks are less equipped to respond to shelter needs in terms of rehabilitation and repair works., The locally-led response by volunteer networks will not be sustainable in the longer term, due to limited funds and human resources., Some KIs reported concerns about the safety of volunteer staff, in particular when utilised by international partners to deliver assistance in areas they have not been traditionally operating in., Security risks remain present and local organisations often lack the capacity to conduct detailed assessments of risks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-overview-kharkivska-oblast-june-2022

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 6 June 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 7 June only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.

This new financing is part of the total support package of over $4 billion that the World Bank is mobilizing, which is up from the earlier estimated $3 billion. Nearly $2 billion of this funding has been disbursed., Funding from this latest project will be used to pay for wages for government and social workers. The project has benefited from financing guarantees from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Lithuania, and Latvia; parallel financing from Italy and expected future guarantees, including from Denmark. The project has also been co-financed by contributions to a new Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) from several countries, including Switzerland., “The World Bank Group is providing continuing support for Ukraine and its people in the face of the ongoing war,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “We are working with donor countries to mobilize financial support and leveraging the flexibility of our various financing instruments to help provide Ukrainians with access to health services, education and social protection.”, The World Bank’s portfolio of projects in Ukraine supports improvements in public services that directly benefit ordinary people, in areas such as water supply, sanitation, heating, power, energy efficiency, roads, social protection, education and healthcare., “Maintaining these core services, and the ability of the government to deliver them, is essential to preventing further deterioration in living conditions and poverty in Ukraine beyond the suffering inflicted on the population because of the war,” said World Bank Country Director for Eastern Europe Arup Banerji. “In addition, keeping government capabilities functioning will be the bedrock of any recovery and reconstruction going forward.”, A recent roadmap issued by the World Bank outlines the Bank Group’s initial short-term response and proposed a medium-term, targeted approach encompassing the 15 months from April 2022 to June 2023., Since Ukraine joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank’s commitments to the country have totaled almost $16 billion in about 90 projects and programs, including the project approved today., PRESS RELEASE NO: 071, Contacts, In Washington

Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",8 Jun 2022,"As humanitarian needs continue to rise in Ukraine due to the illegal Russian invasion, the EU is providing direct operational support to aid organisations working inside the country., In this regard, the EU has set-up and fully funded two warehouses in Ukraine, respectively in Vinnytsia and Dnipro, as well as contracting trucking services to get humanitarian aid to those in need. The use of these EU funded humanitarian services is offered free of charge to aid organisations operating in Ukraine, as part of the new European Humanitarian Response Capacity system, currently implemented by Handicap International. France will also co-fund these operations in Ukraine, being the first EU Member State joining the initiative., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “Humanitarian principles are being violated by the ongoing war against Ukraine. While the EU keeps supporting civilians in neighbouring countries who are fleeing from war, we must continue assistance inside Ukraine for those who did not leave, by choice or need. The European Humanitarian Response Capacity initiative provides services to humanitarian partners and EU Member States ensuring a more impactful response.”, EU supported trucking operations in Ukraine started earlier in April this year. Until now, they supported more than 18 EU and local humanitarian partners in delivering over 750 tonnes of humanitarian cargo through 56 consignments. Deliveries managed to get aid to hard-to-reach districts such as the city centre of Kharkiv and Kramatorsk. Humanitarian aid already delivered includes food and essential items, hygiene and medical supplies. The warehouse in Vinnytsia is also equipped with a temperature-controlled facility to ensure the compliance with storage requirements for items such as medicines., Background, The war in Ukraine has already forced more than 6.8 million people to flee to neighbouring countries like Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, the majority of them being women and children. This is the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world., The Commission is working on all fronts to provide emergency assistance to people fleeing from war in Ukraine, helping neighbouring countries to strengthen their response and by providing support inside Ukraine. Despite the heavy fighting that is severely hampering access in eastern Ukraine, EU's humanitarian partners are ensuring that assistance reaches the most vulnerable people even in the restricted areas. Earlier in April, the European Humanitarian Response Capacity (EHRC) rolled out a first operation in aid of Ukraine in Moldova, featuring the set-up of the EU hub in Chisinau and the deployment of shelter supplies funded by the EU., Moreover, all 27 EU Member States, plus Norway, Turkey and North Macedonia have offered in-kind assistance to Ukraine through the largest ever operation of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). It includes amongst others, delivery of medical supplies, mobile hospitals, shelter equipment, ambulances, firefighting equipment, and food.

Celebrating the power of partnership: Rotary International and ShelterBox announce three-year partnership renewal,News and Press Release,Shelter Cluster,Shelter and Non-Food Items,7 Jun 2022,"Rotary International and the disaster relief charity, ShelterBox, have announced a three-year partnership renewal that will help the charity support more people, in more places, in more ways., ShelterBox was first adopted as a millennium project by the Rotary Club of Helston-Lizard, forming a special humanitarian alliance that since 2000 has helped make a tangible difference to the lives of people around the world, raise awareness and funds. Based in Cornwall, ShelterBox provides emergency shelter and other essential items to people who have lost their homes to conflict and disaster., With growing collaboration with Rotary members and clubs across the globe, ShelterBox became Rotary’s official project partner in disaster relief in 2012. This has helped transform it into an internationally recognised disaster relief charity, together supporting more families when they need it most., The official partnership has been renewed for another three years. The agreement is being announced today at the annual Rotary International Convention, this year hosted in the USA, where ShelterBox chief executive Sanj Srikanthan will give a keynote speech to more than 10,000 Rotary members., Sanj Srikanthan, Chief Executive at ShelterBox, said: “Rotary has been beside us on our journey from day one and we are reminded of the significance of the partnership each time we mobilise., “What began as a local connection with one Cornish Rotary Club has led to an extraordinary international movement that has provided emergency shelter to millions of people around the world., “Rotary members are involved in ShelterBox as volunteers, staff or response team members. Our responses can stretch us logistically and often it’s the Rotary network that help us navigate the import challenges that delay our lifesaving aid or provide us with warehousing space while we wait to distribute shelter kits., “Rotary members also help ShelterBox response teams make vital community contacts and reach disaster-affected families in remote areas who might otherwise go without.”, Most recently, in addition to their own significant response to the Ukraine crisis, Rotary members have been supporting ShelterBox’s relief effort. Using their networks in Poland, Moldova and Ukraine, Rotary members have been providing invaluable situational awareness and connections enabling ShelterBox to provide aid to those in need., The charity is providing mattresses to people in collective centres; tarpaulins, rope, tools, and other essentials to help people living in damaged buildings; in addition to supporting women and children fleeing into Moldova., The Rotary partnership often gives ShelterBox the flexibility and scale to respond in fast changing emergencies, including in the Philippines after Typhoon Rai made landfall in December 2021., The Philippines is ravaged so often by tropical storms that ShelterBox has adapted the way it works – pre-positioning aid in the country with a team on the ground ready to go when the next disaster strikes. With the help of the Rotary Club of Cebu, ShelterBox provided emergency shelter aid to 100,000 people in the aftermath of the super typhoon., ShelterBox has a global network of 14 affiliates, who raise funds and awareness worldwide, that evolved from Rotary relationships., Rotary International General Secretary and CEO John Hewko said: “Rotary is a global network whose members make a lasting difference in their communities – and worldwide. We are people of action, which is why our disaster relief partnership extends far beyond financial support., “Rotary clubs worldwide offer valuable, practical assistance to help ShelterBox reach more families fleeing disaster or conflict., “In Haiti last year, the Rotary Club of Les Cayes provided situational updates and helped ShelterBox understand local context so they could start work sooner., “In Honduras, the Rotary Club of San Pedro Sula, helped to find the communities where ShelterBox could make the biggest difference following Hurricanes Iota and Eta. They unloaded shipping containers, travelled to remote communities to distribute aid, and delivered shelter training., “Rotary and ShelterBox will continue to collaborate, better supporting communities in need by improving preparedness, and prepositioning aid in areas prone to disaster.”, The renewal of the partnership comes at a decisive time against the backdrop of Covid and the impact it’s had on communities worldwide. It’s a crisis that will be dwarfed by the impact of a changing climate in the years ahead, with ShelterBox research highlighting how 167 million homes could be lost to climate change in the next 20 years. Flooding will be a leading cause of weather-related disaster, warming oceans will bring heavier rain to places that can’t cope with it, and other parts of the world will face ever more deadly droughts like the one East Africa is currently confronting., To better meet the needs of the people who need support, ShelterBox is continuously evolving to find durable solutions. It no longer provides aid only in boxes, instead providing combinations of aid, packaged in a variety of ways to make a tangible difference., A tarpaulin is the difference between a family staying dry in their makeshift home or not. Solar lights help families spend time together when electricity supply is impacted. A mosquito net helps families worry less about their children’s health in areas known to have malaria or dengue fever. Cash empowers local communities to hire skilled labour or buy the materials they need to rebuild their houses., ShelterBox currently has teams working to support communities in Ukraine, Yemen, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, the Philippines, Syria, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Nigeria., To find out more about ShelterBox visit shelterbox.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/celebrating-power-partnership-rotary-international-and-shelterbox-announce-three-year-partnership-renewal

Война в Украине: никакой амнистии для виновных в изнасилованиях,News and Press Release,UN News,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",6 Jun 2022,"Женщины и дети – в числе жертв агрессии России против Украины. Они не только гибнут и получают увечья в результате ракетных обстрелов, но и подвергаются сексуальному насилию. В ООН поступают сообщения о случаях надругательств над детьми в присутствии родителей и других зверствах. Об этом, выступая в Совете Безопасности ООН, рассказала Специальный представитель Генсека по вопросам сексуального насилия в условиях конфликта., Прамила Паттен подчеркнула, что в офис Управления ООН по правам человека поступили многочисленные сообщения об изнасиловании женщин, но их число не отражает истинных масштабов таких преступлений, ведь многие жертвы не готовы говорить о том, что с ними случилось., Жертвы сексуального насилия, «По состоянию на 3 июня Мониторинговая группа Управления Верховного комиссара ООН по правам человека получила сообщения о 124 предполагаемых актах сексуального насилия в условиях конфликта, совершенных в отношении женщин, девочек, мужчин и мальчиков в Чернигове, Днепропетровске, Донецке, Харькове, Херсонской, Киевской, Луганской, Николаевской, Винницкой, Запорожской, Закарпатской и Житомирской областях», – сообщила Прамила Паттен., По ее словам, из-за активных боевых действий, массовых перемещений внутри страны, нарушений работы служб по оказанию услуг и стигматизации, связанной с сексуальным насилием, предполагаемые жертвы часто не могут или не хотят сообщать правоохранительным органам о том, что с ними случилось. После начала конфликта были закрыты многие службы, в том числе работавшие при поддержке ООН., «В нынешних условиях многие утверждения о сексуальном насилии, связанном с конфликтом, трудно, если вообще возможно, проверить…», – добавила представитель ООН., Прамила Паттен сообщила, что 49 из поступивших 124 заявлений о сексуальных надругательствах касаются детей. Большинство жертв составляют женщины. В семи случаях насилию подверглись мальчики, в 19 – мужчины., Проверка всех заявлений продолжается. Во время визита в Киев Специальный представитель Генсека встречалась с Генеральным прокурором Украины, которая сообщила ей, что в период с 24 февраля по 12 апреля на горячую линию поступали сообщения об изнасиловании, групповых изнасилованиях и беременности после изнасилования. Были сообщения о том, что родителей принуждали смотреть, как насилуют их ребенка, или мужа смотреть акт изнасилования жены., Специальный представитель Генсека ООН сказала, что из опыта других конфликтов по всему миру понятно, что поступившие сведения – это лишь верхушку айсберга. В ходе боевых действий очень трудно собрать достоверные данные., Но для того, чтобы международное сообщество отреагировало надлежащим образом, по ее словам, не нужны дожидаться проверки всех жалоб. Даже одного случая достаточно для того, чтобы все стороны приняли превентивные меры., Амнистия за сексуальные преступления неприемлема, В этой связи Прамила Паттен высоко оценила действия украинских властей, которые подписали с ООН соглашение по предотвращению сексуального насилия в контексте конфликта. На основе этого соглашения будут разработаны планы действий для вооруженных сил, полиции, пограничников и других правительственных сил безопасности и обороны с привлечением к выполнению планов более 100 тысяч добровольцев., В соглашении также прописано, что жертвы сексуального насилия, а также их дети будут иметь доступ к всесторонним услугам, включая психологическую, юридическую и социально-экономическую помощь., Представитель ООН полагает, что вопросы сексуального насилия должны рассматриваться в ходе переговоров о прекращении боевых действий., По ее словам, такие преступления не должны оставаться безнаказанными и, как правило, они находят отражение в конкретных положениях любого мирного соглашения, в том числе тех, которые касаются мер безопасности и механизмов правосудия переходного периода., Прамила Паттен добавила, что амнистия за преступления, связанные с сексуальным насилием, должна быть исключена и запрещена., Торговцы людьми пользуются уязвимым положением украинских беженцев, Говоря о борьбе с торговлей людьми в условиях конфликта в целях сексуальной эксплуатации или проституции, Специальный представитель Генсека ООН призвала принимать все меры для повышения осведомленности и обучения военнослужащих, пограничников, полиции и сотрудников иммиграционной службы, а также активизировать действия со стороны соседних и принимающих стран, в том числе институтов Европейского союза., Специальный представитель напомнила, что женщины и дети, спасающиеся от конфликта, становятся легкой добычей для «торговцев живым товаром». Она рассказала о своих недавних поездках в Польшу и Молдову и посещении приемных пунктов на границе. Говоря о том, что беженцы из Украины получают в соседних странах поддержку со стороны национальных и местных властей, а также частных лиц, представитель ООН подчеркнула, что без проблем в сложившейся ситуации не обойтись. Ведь за последние 100 дней перемещенными лицами стали почти 14 миллионов украинцев, в основном женщины и дети. Примерно 6,8 млн из них бежали за границу. Все эти перемещения, безусловно, чреваты повышением рисков торговли людьми, в том числе в целях сексуальной эксплуатации и проституции., В этом контексте представитель ООН рассказала о случаях, когда среди добровольцев оказываются «торговцы людьми» и другие преступники, которые пытаются воспользоваться бедственным положением беженцев. Они ходят по приемным пунктам и предлагают молодым девушкам и женщинам услуги по транспортировке, но благодаря хорошей подготовке гуманитарного персонала многие случаи удалось пресечь и вывести мошенников на чистую воду. Но эта проблема требует скоординированного и системного подхода, в том числе, как сказала Прамила Паттен, политической воли европейских лидеров и действий со стороны Совета Безопасности ООН., Читайте также:, Украина: ООН помогает жертвам сексуального насилия, Она подчеркнула, что это только верхушка айсберга, поскольку сексуальное насилие остается самым замалчиваемым преступлением, а жертвы далеко не всегда обращаются за помощью.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/voyna-v-ukraine-nikakoy-amnistii-dlya-vinovnykh-v-iznasilovaniyakh
Update 80 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (7 June 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Jun 2022,"Dozens of radiation detectors are once again transmitting data from the area around the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) after Ukraine – with technical support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – succeeded in reviving a vital information link that was cut at the start of the conflict more than 100 days ago, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC) on 6 June began receiving radiation measurements from the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 Chornobyl accident, marking the successful outcome of efforts to both restore the automated collection of such data and reconnect the local monitoring stations with the Agency’s International Radiation Monitoring Information System (IRMIS)., The radiation monitoring network in the area stopped functioning on 24 February, the first day of the conflict when Russian forces occupied the Chornobyl site and held it for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March. The transmission of safeguards data from the NPP to IAEA headquarters was also lost at that time, but fully re-established four weeks ago., IAEA experts visiting the area last week provided technical advice to their counterparts from the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Centre (UkrHMC) and the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) as they sought to restore the data gathering and transfer of the results to IRMIS, a web-based tool for voluntarily sharing radiation information with the IAEA and participating countries., Most of the 39 detectors sending data from the Exclusion Zone – spanning 30 kilometres around the NPP – are now visible on the IRMIS map and updated as they were before the interruption, Director General Grossi said, adding that the measurements received so far indicated radiation levels in line with those measured before the conflict., Effective on-site and off-site radiation monitoring is among the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security that the Director General outlined early during the conflict, several of which have been compromised in recent months., “The resumption of radiation data transmission from the Exclusion Zone is a very positive step forward for nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. It ends a long period of virtual information blackout that created much uncertainty about the radiation situation in the area, especially when it was under Russian occupation,” he said. “I congratulate Ukraine for this important milestone, achieved with the help of the IAEA’s technical assistance.”, Director General Grossi has from the beginning of the conflict voiced grave concern about the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, establishing a comprehensive programme of assistance to help Ukraine reduce the risk of a severe nuclear accident., The IAEA has so far sent three combined safety, security and safeguards missions to Ukraine, two of them personally led by the Director General. The Agency has also delivered equipment requested by Ukraine, including different types of radiation monitoring devices, and provided training and other technical advice., In addition, the IAEA is coordinating international assistance to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and state entities through the overall mechanism of the Agency’s Response and Assistance Network (RANET), where countries can register their capabilities for support in areas ranging from radiation dose assessments and decontamination to nuclear installation assessment and advice, radioactive source search and recovery, and much else., Eleven IAEA Member States registered in RANET have so far offered to provide specialised equipment to Ukraine, in response to a comprehensive request for equipment Ukraine said it needed for the safe and secure operation of its nuclear facilities. Ukraine’s list, submitted in late April, included radiation measurement devices, protective material, computer-related assistance, power supply systems and diesel generators, among other items., The IAEA has now updated Ukraine’s list with details on the offers received and ongoing preparations for equipment procurement and delivery, with a focus on identifying priorities and avoiding duplications. The amended list has been posted on the IAEA’s Unified System for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies (USIE) – a 24/7 secure communication channel., “I’m very encouraged by the generous offers in terms of equipment and extrabudgetary contributions that we have received. I’m confident that more countries registered in RANET will come forward and provide the assistance Ukraine has requested and needs to help prevent the very real danger of a nuclear incident,” Director General Grossi said., Underlining the potential risks facing Ukraine’s nuclear facilities, the country informed the IAEA on 5 June that a cruise missile was observed flying above the South Ukraine NPP. “If a missile goes astray near a nuclear power plant, it could have a severe impact on its physical integrity, potentially leading to a nuclear accident,” the Director General said, reiterating concerns he has voiced previously regarding such events. One of the seven safety and security pillars says that “the physical integrity of the facilities – whether it is the reactors, fuel ponds, or radioactive waste stores – must be maintained”., Ukraine also told the IAEA this week, when asked about the spare parts situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP (ZNPP), that “supply chains are disrupted or lost, and stocks of consumables and spare parts are reduced in the repair and maintenance processes”. According to the operator, however, “a reserve of consumables and spare parts was created at ZNPP to maintain nuclear safety,” Ukraine said. One of the safety pillars calls for “uninterrupted logistical supply chains and transportation to and from the sites”., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine told the IAEA today that eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the ZNPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., With respect to safeguards, the IAEA is continuing technical attempts, with the assistance of the operator, to re-establish the transmission of remote safeguards data to IAEA headquarters from the ZNPP that stopped on 30 May. The IAEA continues to receive safeguards data from its systems installed at the other three operational NPPs in Ukraine and from the Chornobyl NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-80-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-7-june-2022

Protection and Human Rights",3 Jun 2022,"After 100 days of Putin's war, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said we must be 'steadfast' in our support for Ukraine., The UK’s steadfast support for Ukraine will never waver, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said., For 100 days Putin’s barbaric and unprovoked war has brought death and destruction to Ukraine on a scale not seen in Europe since WW2, but he has failed to make the headway he expected in the face of heroic resistance., Tens of thousands have died and more than 6.6 million refugees have fled the country. While 8 million Ukrainians are internally displaced, almost 13 million are stranded in conflict zones and almost 16 million require humanitarian support., Russia’s theft of grain and its destruction and blockading of key ports has also significantly exacerbated one of the most severe food crises in recent history, which now threatens many countries and is putting the world’s most vulnerable at risk., The Foreign Secretary said this grim anniversary was a day to honour the resolve of the Ukrainian people, who have shown Putin cannot win as long as they receive the international support they need and deserve., The Foreign Secretary said the UK would remain steadfast in its support to ensure Ukraine wins its battle for self-determination and Russian forces withdraw., On Friday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said:, “Today marks 100 dark days since Putin launched his unjustified and illegal war against Ukraine. He expected the invasion to be over in days, but significantly underestimated the resolve of brave Ukrainians, who have valiantly defended their country., “Putin’s invasion has brought death and destruction on a scale not seen in Europe since WW2. This war has huge ramifications for global peace, prosperity and food security. It matters to us all., “Today is a moment to pay our respects to the thousands of innocent civilians murdered since the invasion, and reaffirm our steadfast support for Ukraine’s heroic defence, to ensure they succeed and Putin fails.”, Since Putin started massing his forces on Ukraine’s borders the UK has played a vital role galvanising and leading the international response., Sanctions: Together with our allies, we continue to impose crippling economic sanctions, cutting off funding for Putin’s war machine. The UK has sanctioned over 1,000 individuals and 100 entities, including oligarchs with a net worth of more £117 billion. We have targeted Russian trade, with import tariffs covering £1.4 billion worth of goods. Russia’s economy is set to take a £256 billion hit, with its GDP expected to shrink up to 15 per cent this year – the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union., Military support: We were among the first to provide military support to Ukraine, including 10,000 missiles and training more 22,000 army members, helping to halt Putin’s barbaric onslaught., Humanitarian aid: We are a leading humanitarian donor, providing £220 million of aid. We have sent more than 11 million medical items to Ukraine, and are donating 42 ambulances, saving thousands of lives., International engagement: The UK has led international efforts to support Ukraine’s objectives, working with the EU, NATO and likeminded allies. The UK, Ukraine and 44 other countries launched an OSCE mission to investigate Russia’s violations of human rights & international humanitarian law. We are making sure Russia is held to account for war crimes and, providing an additional £1 million to the ICC to support their investigations into war crimes and, with the US and the EU, creating the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA)., Exposing Putin’s lies: We are countering the Kremlin’s blizzard of lies and disinformation by telling the truth about Putin’s war of aggression. We will work with our allies on the urgent need to protect other European countries that are not members of NATO and that could become targets of the Kremlin playbook of subversion and aggression.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-has-shown-world-it-will-prevail-its-battle-freedom

Shelter and Non-Food Items",6 Jun 2022,"Singapore, 6 June 2022 - As the armed conflict in Ukraine crosses the 100-day mark, the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) presses on to deliver targeted assistance in its relief efforts for Ukrainian communities: vulnerable children, persons living with rare diseases and refugees. The homegrown humanitarian organisation shares this update, along with reflections from partners and volunteers (Annex A)., Psychosocial support to mothers, children, Over the past three weeks, SRC deployed two psychosocial support responders to Poland’s largest assistance centre, PTAK Humanitarian Aid Centre, to support the Child Safe Space. The two Singaporeans engaged mothers and children in psychosocial support activities such as sports, art therapy, and more. The team also distributed childrens’ shoes and 350 child care packs consisting of notebooks, crayons, children’s toothbrush and toothpaste, and stress balls. Additionally, they distributed 100 walking aids and 340 trolley bags to the other refugees staying at the Humanitarian Aid Centre, to support them in their continuing journey., Medical equipment for Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital, “Our sincere appreciation to the Singapore Red Cross for their consistent support in bringing humanitarian aid and relief to those in need in Ukraine. Children are always extremely vulnerable in wartime. This generous donation to the Okhmatdyt hospital is yet another proof that a friend in need is a friend indeed. This help will allow Ukrainian doctors to protect and save the most precious thing that we have and stand for – the lives of our children, the future of our nation.” - Kateryna Zelenko, Ambassador of Ukraine to Singapore, SRC will also fund diagnostic equipment, including two ultrasound machines and an intraoperative neuromonitoring system for spinal surgery, for Ukraine’s largest children’s multidisciplinary hospital «Okhmatdyt». It used to serve over 300,000 patients annually, with neurosurgeons and other specialists performing more than 7,000 operations of various levels of complexity. While many of the patients have been evacuated, the hospital continues to care for the most critical patients and the wounded., Support for displaced persons from Ukraine living with rare diseases, Singapore Red Cross and EURORDIS (Rare Diseases Europe and the Razem z Ukrainą coalition) will collaborate to support 500 Ukrainian families living with rare diseases with appropriate emergency housing, specialised equipment (e.g. wheelchairs, medical supplies) and psychological support. Ukrainian patients have been severely impacted and no longer have access to supplies and to medical professionals they have been used to., SRC and DEBRA (Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association) International, with the support of DEBRA Singapore, are collaborating to procure and supply the most critical medical needs such as specialised dressings, medical equipment, medicines, specialised nutritional products, and other urgent needs for 120 families living with congenital epidermolysis bullosa, a rare skin condition that in its most severe forms affects all of the body's linings, the skin, the linings of the mouth and oesophagus, and even the eyes. In more severe cases, patients need to be wrapped completely in protective foam dressings secured by tubular bandages. In many cases, gastrostomy tubes are required for nutrition input., Distribution of Relief Goods and Care packs to refugees arriving in Poland, The Singapore Red Cross deployed disaster response volunteers to the Medyka Border Crossing. This is the busiest border crossing in the Polish-Ukrainian border. Humanitarian organisations have set up a makeshift tent-city, offering a variety of relief items and services to refugees crossing the border such as hygiene items, SIM cards, meals, and health services. Przemyśl train station is where refugees can continue travelling to larger Polish cities like Warsaw and Krakow free of charge. From there, connecting trains and buses can take them to other European countries. The team was active in both the Medyka border crossing and the Przemyśl train station. They conducted activities such as the procurement and distribution of hot meals, hygiene items (toothbrush, tooth paste, sanitary pads, diapers, and more), 250 blankets, trolley bags, and food items to be sent across the border into Ukraine. The team has also procured educare packs for children, containing crayons, soft balls/ toys, small towel, toothbrush, and toothpaste., Since 25 February 2022, SRC’s mission to Ukraine's neighbouring countries has covered Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Romania to oversee the humanitarian response and aid distribution contributed by the People of Singapore to SRC's humanitarian response to Ukraine, and to identify partners with whom we can expand our operations., In its latest tranche of humanitarian aid to support Ukrainian refugees, SRC has committed another S$2 million in medical and first aid kits, medical equipment and medicines for rare diseases, hygiene and essentials. The latest disbursement follows SRC’s earlier tranches of aid worth approximately S$4 million. This brings the total disbursement to S$6 million. (Details in Annex B)., In Singapore, at least 120 individuals and groups have stepped forward to raise funds in support of the SRC’s public fundraising appeal, in aid of affected communities in and around Ukraine. To date, more than S$7.4 million has been raised, since the start of the appeal on 25 February.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-crisis-100-day-update-singapore-red-cross-provides-psychosocial-support-delivers-targeted-aid-vulnerable-communities
Loss that cannot be counted: An MCC partner in Ukraine supports people destabilized by war,News and Press Release,MCC,"Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 Jun 2022,"By Jason Dueck, June 6, 2022, Content note: This story contains a brief description of a stillbirth, As millions of civilians continue to flee the devastation of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, organizations like MCC partner UMAN (Charitable Foundation Uman Help Center) are working tirelessly to support those who've left everything they know behind., UMAN operates in the Ukrainian city of Uman, about 200 km (124 miles) from the capital of Kyiv. Due to its centrality within the country, it's been a major hub for the mass movement of displaced people. Hundreds of thousands of people pass through, some stop for a night or two on their way to the west and many others choose to stay. Dima Krotik, founder and director of UMAN, says around 100,000 displaced people have resettled in the Cherkasy oblast (province) surrounding Uman, itself a city of only 80,000 before the invasion. He says the needs are great and the supply is limited., ""Since the first week [of the war], we've been organizing distribution events for these people where we distribute food and other basic items. The supply chain for food has been inconsistent, but it's improving. We still had a container with comforters and hygiene kits left in it, so we've been distributing those as well. MCC responded very quickly by providing some funds, so we were able to be effective very quickly."", MCC is shipping five more containers of emergency supplies like that one to Ukraine with more planned for later in the year. With this increased demand for supplies in Ukraine and other countries around the world, MCC's inventory is getting low — donations of comforters, towels, soap and other kits are greatly needed. To find instructions and drop-off locations visit MCC Canada’s website or MCC U.S.’s website., Before the war, UMAN primarily worked with people with very little or no income, but Krotik says that now he hears countless testimonies of people who've lost their otherwise comfortable lives in a flash., ""People are sharing with me that just a couple of days ago, they had everything — a house, a car, jobs. Or they might get into the city in a very nice car but have nothing else but the clothes on their backs and now they are coming to us for food and secondhand clothes. They're not fleeing poverty, they're fleeing war."", He says he's heard a lot of very difficult stories over the last few months, but one family in particular has not left his thoughts., ""There was a family from Poposna, which has been completely destroyed — they have nothing to go back to. The family has many children. They asked us if we could house them because they have nowhere to go back to. The mother, she was pregnant and quite long-term, seven or eight months. And because of the stressful situation, the child died in her womb. We were able to find a house for them in a village near Uman, but we don't know if they'll stay here once the war is over."", For those trying to survive under such taxing conditions, hope can feel like an exhausted resource. But Krotik, who is also a pastor of a local church, says a very important part of the work UMAN is doing is offering counselling and spiritual care., ""We talk and listen and pray with people, we invite them to our church and into our small groups,"" he says. They also offer Scripture verses about anxiety and living in fearful times. ""Encouragement is very helpful so people don't fall into despair."", June 3 marked 100 days since the Russian military invasion of Ukraine began. In that time, MCC has allocated CA$2.65 million (US$2.1 million) through our partners in-country, reaching approximately 16,000 people with emergency food, fuel, shelter or other forms of relief. In Canada, support this work by donating here or finding a drop-off location to donate relief supplies.

"Sexual Violence ‘Most Hidden Crime’ Being Committed against Ukrainians, Civil Society Representative Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",6 Jun 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9056TH MEETING (AM)
SC/14926, Allegations of sexual violence by Russian troops in Ukraine are mounting as the conflict passes its 100-day mark, a senior United Nations official told the Security Council today, voicing regret over a stark discrepancy between that painful reality and the global community’s ambition to end the use of rape as a tactic of war., Pramila Patten, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, recalled her recent visit to Ukraine and outlined the elements of a recently signed framework of cooperation on the prevention and response to conflict-related sexual violence, which seeks to strengthen accountability and combat those abhorrent crimes. “Too often have the needs of women and girls in conflict settings been side-lined and treated as an afterthought,” she said, welcoming that the newly signed framework makes them an explicit priority., Recalling the Council’s many resolutions — backed up by international law — prohibiting the use of sexual violence as a tactic of war, she noted the gaping chasm between those commitments and the situation of many women around the world. “Painfully, my visit cast into stark relief the gap that still exists between the aspiration of prevention expressed by this Council through the robust normative framework that has been established over the past decade and the reality on the ground for the most vulnerable,” she said. As of 3 June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had received reports of 124 alleged acts of conflict-related sexual across Ukraine — mostly against women and girls — and a national hotline had received reports of crimes ranging from gang rape to coercion to watch an act of sexual violence committed against a partner or a child., Against that backdrop, she urged humanitarian actors to prioritize support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence as a life-saving component of their work and warned against waiting to act. “We do not need hard data for a scaled-up humanitarian response, nor for all parties to put in place preventive measures,” she stressed, detailing the provisions of the recently signed framework — which seeks to strengthen cooperation between those working to combat and deter sexual violence in Ukraine and reduce the risk posed by human traffickers — and calling for the international community’s steadfast support., Natalia Karbowska, Co-Founder and Director of Strategic Development for the Ukrainian Women’s Fund, recounted her organization’s efforts to provide food, medicine and other support to Ukrainian women whose lives were destroyed by the Russian Federation’s invasion. Describing sexual violence as “the most hidden crime”, she noted that for every girl or woman who is willing to tell her story, there are many others who will be silent for years. The Russian Federation is using sexual violence and rape as instruments of terror to control civilians, she said. Although the full scale of conflict-related sexual violence is not yet known, human rights activists and law enforcement agencies estimate that hundreds of cases have been committed not just against women and girls, but also men and boys and people of other gender identities, she said., Also briefing the Council was Sherrie Rollins Westin, President of the non-profit organization Sesame Workshop, who said her group supports children and caregivers affected by conflicts and crises around the globe. Urging the international community to prioritize caregivers and young children in their humanitarian response, she said the latter have the most to lose, as their brains are developing faster than at any time in their lives. Exposure to traumatic events can have lasting impacts on their health, cognitive development and emotional stability. “Right now, children are experiencing the kind of exposure to trauma and stress that has the potential to derail their lives,” she warned. Against that backdrop, she urged the humanitarian community to build interventions to support young children into their work — including mental health services, quality early childhood education and help for caregivers — and pointed out that less than 3 per cent of humanitarian funding currently goes to such crucial programmes., As Council members took the floor, many expressed support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General’s framework of cooperation, and called for an urgent end to the use of rape and other sexual crimes as tactics of war — both in Ukraine and elsewhere in the world., Brazil’s representative reiterated his country’s call for urgent, independent investigations of all reports of sexual violence being committed in Ukraine, emphasizing that perpetrators — be they agents of the State or not — must be held accountable. Also noting that human traffickers and criminal networks may be taking advantage of the conflict to exploit women and children, he said States have a duty to prevent predatory individuals and criminal organizations from profiting from the situation. “This Council has already failed in preventing the outbreak of the conflict and in ensuring the cessation of hostilities — it must not fail in repudiating sexual crimes and human trafficking,” he stressed., The representative of the United Arab Emirates said that, even before the crisis in Ukraine, the world was already in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. Some 28.7 million women and girls around the world were in a condition of forced labour, debt bondage, forced marriage and slavery, with millions of displaced persons in the Middle East at the epicentre of the crisis. Commending the recently signed framework, she urged the Council to keep “top of mind” the conflict’s knock-on effects on global food security, and to pursue the only true path towards ending conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine — namely, a diplomatic resolution of the conflict., Charles Michel, President of the European Council, said sexual and gender-based violence remains a global threat faced by women across the world. In its own neighbourhood, the European Union stands committed to protecting all those seeking refuge from the fighting in Ukraine — largely women and children — and to providing them with education, health care and access to the labour market. He also described Moscow’s attempts to use food supplies as a “stealth missile against developing countries”, emphasizing that the Union has “zero” sanctions against the Russian Federation’s agricultural sector, and does not prevent it from transporting grain, food or fertilizers., Meanwhile, Ukraine’s delegate voiced grave concern about the fate of some 1 million Ukrainians, including children, who have been forcibly removed to the Russian Federation and are being turned into Russian citizens. Calling on the international community to do more to protect them, he also cited numerous allegations of sexual crimes committed by Russian troops, with the bodies of those tortured or raped burned to hide evidence. Welcoming the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry’s visit to Ukraine to gather first-hand information, he went on to note that Kyiv is ready to resume food exports from Odessa to the rest of the world. However, efforts are needed to prevent the Russian Federation from exploiting those operations, he said, also cautioning that any concessions advised by Ukraine’s well-meaning partners would only lead to more war., For his part, the representative of the Russian Federation criticized Ukraine and Western members of the Council for ratcheting up accusations — levelled without evidence — of sexual crimes committed by Russian troops. Unlike those baseless accusations, he provided numerous “concrete examples” of crimes by Ukrainian nationalists, including a threatened rape and shooting committed by a Ukrainian senior lieutenant against a couple in Mariupol. In recent years, Ukraine has risen to the top five countries in Europe with the most victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. On another matter, he noted the stated intention of the United States and the United Kingdom to supply long-range artillery and multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine, describing promises that Kyiv will not use such weapons against targets in Russian territory as “unconvincing”., Also speaking were representatives of France, Mexico, United States, China, Ghana, Norway, India, United Kingdom, Gabon, Kenya, Ireland, Albania, Italy, Latvia (on behalf of the Baltic States), Germany, Poland and Slovakia., The meeting began at 10:02 a.m. and ended at 12:58 p.m., Briefings, PRAMILA PATTEN, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, briefing the Security Council via videoconference, recalled her visit to Ukraine in early May. “Painfully, my visit cast into stark relief the gap that still exists between the aspiration of prevention expressed by this Council through the robust normative framework that has been established over the past decade, and the reality on the ground for the most vulnerable,” she said. While the Council’s commitment is unequivocal, and its resolutions make clear that even wars have limits, allegations of sexual violence are mounting as the conflict passes its 100-day mark., Noting that she has issued three public statements since the war broke out in February — “to ensure that this issue is not shrouded in silence or normalized by impunity” — she said she has also urged all parties to the conflict to ensure the protection of civilians from sexual violence, including those displaced internally and across national borders. She also called for swift and rigorous investigations that ensure accountability as a central pillar of deterrence, prevention and non-repetition, “because the failure to acknowledge and investigate such crimes is the surest sign that violations will continue unabated”. At the same time, it is essential that humanitarian actors prioritize support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence as a life-saving component of their work., Stressing that victims are often unable or unwilling to report to law enforcement authorities, she also spotlighted the steep reduction in functioning service providers, such as maternity hospitals. As of 3 June, the Human Rights Monitoring Team of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had received reports of 124 alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence, occurring against women, girls, men and boys in various Ukrainian cities and regions. Women and girls constitute most of the alleged victims, while some reporting instances of sexual violence were also men and boys. Verification of cases is ongoing, and a national hotline on domestic violence, human trafficking and gender-based discrimination has been set up. To date, it has received reports of rape, gang rape, pregnancy following rape, attempted rape, threats of rape, coercion to watch an act of sexual violence committed against a partner or a child, and forced nudity., Warning against waiting too long to act, she declared: “An active battleground is never conducive to accurate ‘book-keeping’ […] if we wait for hard data and statistics, it will always be too late.” The international community must mobilize immediately on the basis of its common conviction that even one case of sexual violence is unacceptable. “We do not need hard data for a scaled-up humanitarian response, nor for all parties to put in place preventive measures,” she stressed, commending the leadership of the Ukrainian authorities in their agreement of a framework of cooperation with the United Nations on the Prevention and Response to Conflict Related Sexual Violence, which was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna on 3 May. That framework will serve as the basis for a comprehensive and multifaceted preventive and service response, as well as the more effective coordination of all stakeholders, including United Nations agencies., She went on to outline five critical areas of the framework. First, strengthening rule of law and accountability as a central aspect of deterrence and prevention of crimes of sexual violence. Second, strengthening the capacity of the security and defence sector to prevent sexual violence. Third, ensuring that survivors of sexual violence, as well as their children, have access to comprehensive services, including sexual and reproductive health, psychological, legal, socioeconomic services and reintegration support. Fourth, looking ahead to ongoing and future negotiations for cessation of hostilities, ensuring that sexual violence is addressed in the framework of any ceasefire agreement, and ensuring that amnesties for sexual violence crimes are explicitly prohibited. And fifth, addressing conflict-related trafficking in persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation or prostitution., “Too often have the needs of women and girls in conflict settings [have] been side-lined and treated as an afterthought,” she said, welcoming that the framework of cooperation makes them an explicit priority. Calling on the Council and the international donor community to stand in solidarity with Ukrainian authorities and the United Nations entities to support its implementation, she noted that she recently had the opportunity to debrief the Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations on her visit to Ukraine. At that meeting, she emphasized that her Office is at the disposal of all parties to the conflict to support the implementation of preventive measures that mitigate the acute risks of conflict-related sexual violence. “I look forward to further consultation with the Mission […] on possible modalities for cooperation in this sphere, including the facilitation of access to areas not under Ukrainian Government control,” she said., Drawing the Council’s attention to the trafficking dimension of the conflict in particular, she recalled her visits to reception centres at border crossing points in Poland and the Republic of Moldova and praised the outpouring of support for those fleeing Ukraine. However, the protection challenges facing the nearly 6.8 million people who have crossed that country’s borders are also unprecedented. From the outset of the conflict, heightened risks of trafficking in persons — including for purposes of sexual exploitation and prostitution — have been alarmingly evident. The lack of consistent vetting of accommodation offers and transportation arrangements is a serious concern, as well as the limited capacity of protection services to address the velocity and volume of displacement. There are also concerns regarding the multiplicity of volunteers, with limited vetting, and little or no training or experience., She illustrated those challenges with several examples, emphasizing that it remains critical to ensure that effective protection systems are in place in all transit and destination countries, and at all border crossings. Strengthening the overall response to trafficking is a critical aspect of the framework, which will also require a coherent and coordinated response at the level of European institutions. That entails a concerted, integrated and holistic cross-border response by humanitarian partners, law enforcement agencies, border forces, immigration officials and political leaders. “A regional compact is urgently required,” she stressed, welcoming the presence of the President of the European Union, Charles Michel, in the Council Chamber. She also acknowledged that even as the Council focuses on Ukraine members must also ensure that victims in conflicts from Yemen to Myanmar to northern Ethiopia are not forgotten and resources are not drained or diverted., NATALIA KARBOWSKA, Co-Founder and Director of Strategic Development, Ukrainian Women’s Fund, said her voice represents those of her organization which has been working on supporting women in Ukraine for 22 years, as well as those of hundreds of other women’s groups working around the clock supporting women, providing food and medicine, healing the trauma and giving them the strength to continue living. When the war started, she said that she was in a meeting discussing localization of a national action plan on implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The war showed that the women, peace and security agenda is more relevant today than ever before. It has a new meaning: security of each and every woman is security of the whole country. No one can feel safe when sexual violence and rape are taking place in their community. Women’s organizations are usually the first ones that women who experienced sexual violence approach. They provide psychological assistance and, together with law enforcement agencies, document the cases and support investigation processes., “Sexual violence in this war is the most hidden crime,” she pointed out, noting that for every girl or woman who is willing to tell her story, there are many others who will be silent for years. “The Russian Federation is using sexual violence and rape as terror to control civilians at the temporary occupied territories,” she said. Although the full scale of conflict-related sexual violence is not yet known, human rights activists and law enforcement agencies estimate that hundreds of cases have been committed, not just against women and girls, but also men and boys and people of other gender identities, and of all ages. She asked why the Russian Federation still sits on the Security Council and why it participates in United Nations peacekeeping operations., But as the war continues, Ukrainian women refugees need more permanent housing and work. The situation opens new risks for sexual and labour exploitation, she continued, recalling “stories of women and children who were forced to go to Russia by Russian troops — through the so-called filtration camps.” She said she met a 16-year-old boy from Mariupol whose mother was brutally taken to such a camp and that no one knew what happened to her. “There are hundreds of stories like this. How is this called? Trafficking? Slavery? Terror and crime,” she said, noting that the Russian Federation is “using war crimes as a weapon”. Resolution 1325 (2000) remains a powerful instrument, however there is a need to create new tools that will make it work properly at different levels, and most importantly, for women on the ground. She urged the Council to develop such instruments, keep pressure with sanctions, and continue providing military and humanitarian support., SHERRIE ROLLINS WESTIN, President of the non-profit organization Sesame Workshop, said her group supports children and caregivers affected by conflicts and crises around the globe. “In Ukraine, the gender dimensions of the crisis are particularly pronounced,” she said, noting that most victims of atrocities in the current conflict are women and children. Urging the international community to prioritize caregivers and young children in their humanitarian response, she said the latter have the most to lose as their brains are developing faster than at any times in their lives. Any exposure to traumatic events can have lasting impacts on their health, cognitive development and emotional stability. “Right now, children are experiencing the kind of exposure to trauma and stress that has the potential to derail their lives,” she warned., Thankfully, she said, the global community already has the tools to assist young children in Ukraine, which can be built directly into their responses. First, they should directly provide mental health and psychosocial support as a first-line humanitarian intervention. Second, they should invest in quality early childhood education and support, which have been proven to reduce the impacts of trauma and conflict-related stress. Outlining similar work that Sesame Workshop is already doing with refugee children in Jordan — and which does not impose additional cost burdens on humanitarian responses — she went on to stress that caregivers also must not be forgotten as they work to provide children in Ukraine with the urgent support they need. Currently, less than 3 per cent of humanitarian funding is allocated to such early childhood interventions, she said, calling for its rapid scaling up and emphasizing that any hope for a prosperous and peaceful future depends on support provided to children today., Statements, NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that the sanctions adopted by the European Union have the sole objective of bringing Moscow to return to respecting the Charter of the United Nations. Expressing outrage at the many credible allegations of sexual violence, he urged all members to be “the guarantors of the resolutions of this Council on sexual violence”. France fully supports the action of the United Nations on the ground to discover the facts, and it provided Ukraine with expertise to collect evidence and establish accountability. Expressing support for the United Nations action to prevent the risk of trafficking and smuggling of human beings, he applauded the efforts of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to provide services essential for victims of violence. “There can be no lasting peace without the full participation of women,” he stressed., ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) said that 90 per cent of people who have left the country are women and children, and 60 per cent of the internally displaced persons are also women. This makes it clear that this conflict has an inescapable gender component. Ms. Patten shared the reports about Ukrainian women who were raped and subsequently murdered. It is a priority to carry out the investigations of alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of international humanitarian law. Her country follows closely the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s Office and by the Independent Commission of Inquiry by the Human Rights Council. Welcoming the signing of a cooperation framework between the United Nations and Ukraine on the prevention and response to sexual violence related to conflicts, she called for the continued collection of evidence and disaggregated data on sexual and gender-based violence., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said the “mountain” of horrific reports of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers in Ukraine is growing every day. Ukrainian authorities have reported rapes and the subsequent killings of Ukrainian women by Russian Federation troops, and imagery now confirms the presence of mass graves in the town of Bucha. There are also indications that individuals have been tortured and killed execution-style, and multiple reports by survivors show that such terrible acts were committed in front of children. “These are bone-chilling accounts,” she said, adding that women and girls are also particularly at risk of trafficking and other forms of sexual exploitation. “Council members, we cannot stay silent,” she stressed, calling for justice for victims. Responsibility starts first and foremost with the Russian Federation, which must ensure that its forces and proxy forces adhere to the terms of Council resolution 1820 (2008), which recognized that rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Meanwhile, the rest of the international community should support the framework agreement signed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Ukrainian authorities. The Commission of Inquiry launched by the Human Rights Council can also work “to ensure Russia does not get away with hiding atrocities”, she said, noting that all that support requires resources., DAI BING (China) said the conflict has taken a heavy toll on Ukrainian women and children, and all the parties must take measures to protect civilians and ensure that hospitals and other critical civilian facilities are protected from attacks. Welcoming the framework agreement signed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Ukrainian authorities in May, he said the use of sexual violence as a tool of war is a serious crime and any allegations should be investigated in an impartial manner that is based on facts. The growing numbers of cases of human trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse are disturbing, and more international action must be taken to investigate, prevent and address them. Meanwhile, United Nations agencies should strengthen their monitoring and analysis to combat such crimes against refugees. Only through a ceasefire and the restoration of peace can the trauma facing Ukrainian women and children be fully avoided, he said, calling on the international community to do more to bring the parties back to the path of peace. In that vein, he voiced his hope that the upcoming meeting between the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the United Nations and Türkiye will pave the way for a ceasefire, and warned that sanctions and the further strengthening of military blocs will not help ease the crisis., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said that the international community must ensure that prevention, accountability and a survivor-centred approach, which are at the heart of resolution 2467 (2019), are not reduced to mere rhetoric but are translated into real and tangible action on the ground. Condemning all acts of sexual violence and human trafficking in Ukraine, including as a weapon of war, she expressed support for all ongoing accountability efforts, including investigations by the Ukraine authorities, civil society groups and the International Criminal Court. She voiced support for global calls to designate such acts as war crimes and submit that conflict-related sexual violence and human trafficking should be treated as a basis for targeted sanctions against culpable actors., TRINE HEIMERBACK (Norway) stressed that Moscow’s war against Ukraine has a gendered impact, affecting women and men, girls and boys, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons (LGBTI) community. Attacks on health-care institutions and staff are denying people safe access to sexual and reproductive health services, she said, also pointing to the high number of survivor accounts of rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence as well as trafficking. Noting that her country has increased support to UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) and other humanitarian actors, she underlined the importance of gender and age differentiated responses to civilian populations, including Ukrainian internally displaced persons and refugees, and stressed the need to ensure child protection services. First and foremost is to prevent sexual and gender-based violence, including trafficking, from happening, she said, noting that engaging and supporting women human rights defenders and civil society is key. Emphasizing a survivor-centred approach, she underlined the critical importance of strong and independent human rights institutions and accountability mechanisms in Ukraine., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) took note with great concern of reports of alleged cases of sexual violence directed against women and girls in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. Reiterating his calls for urgent independent investigations, he said the use of gender-based violence as a weapon of war, as well as a tool of intimidation and social control in conflict situations, is unacceptable. Perpetrators — be they agents of the State or not — must be held accountable. Also noting that human traffickers and criminal networks may be taking advantage of the conflict to exploit women and children, he said States have a duty to prevent predatory individuals and criminal organizations from profiting from the situation. The international community should employ effective strategies to reduce unsafe and irregular routes, and to promote the sustainable and safe legal pathways for those in need of protection, he said, noting that Brazil has introduced special humanitarian visas for Ukrainian nationals and stateless persons affected by the conflict in Ukraine. “This Council has already failed in preventing the outbreak of the conflict and in ensuring the cessation of hostilities — it must not fail in repudiating sexual crimes and human trafficking,” he stressed., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India), stressing that national Governments have the important responsibility for prosecuting and deterring crimes such as sexual violence in conflict situations, noted that the United Nations must assist with capabilities development to strengthen national legal frameworks and related structures to that end. Noting his country’s support for effective cooperation and appropriate mechanisms to combat illegal migration and human trafficking, he also called for resumption of talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to end the conflict. He went on to note the broader regional and global implications of the conflict, pointing to the increasing oil prices and shortage of food grains and fertilizers. Noting that his country had announced some measures that allow for wheat exports based on approvals to those countries who are required to meet their food security demands, he highlighted the importance of equity, affordability and accessibility to food grains., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) expressed worries about allegations of sexual violence against women and children, also recognizing various efforts of the United Nations — including Ms. Patten’s office, UNFPA and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) — to support the victims and curb threats of human trafficking. All parties to conflict must abide by the obligation of protecting civilians. Sexual violence is a threat to security on its own right. Criminal networks must be cut off at the root. Noting that Africans fleeing Ukraine are being discriminated, he said ordeals suffered by them should not be forgotten. The most effective means to end sexual violence and human trafficking is to put an end to the conflict., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) condemned the violations of international law “and the most basic human decency” ongoing against women and children in Ukraine. All military commanders must ensure that those responsible for such atrocities are held to account, and soldiers should be subject to severe discipline for abusing civilians or captured combatants. Political leaders should also be aware that ideological labelling against entire populations increases the risks that rank-and-file soldiers will commit atrocities. He urged United Nations agencies and partners to do their utmost to deliver medical and psychosocial support to the survivors of sexual violence and trafficking, adding that more should also be done to ensure humanitarian corridors and safety from military targeting for the millions in besieged areas. He joined others in commending the signing of the framework agreement with Ukrainian authorities and praised the role of women as fighters and agents of change in that country. However, he also reiterated the plight of Africans trapped in the war, citing reports of discrimination against people of African descent who are seeking to flee to other European cities, and raised the issue of food insecurity stemming from the war that is seriously disrupting supply chains and impacting people in the global South., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said before the latest crisis in Ukraine, the world was already in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War. Some 28.7 million women and girls around the world were in a condition of forced labour, debt bondage, forced marriage and slavery, with millions of displaced persons in the Middle East at the epicentre of the crisis. “The conflict in Ukraine is therefore making an already horrifying global crisis worse,” she said. Commending the framework of cooperation signed recently, she also voiced support for the Special Representative’s plan to deploy an expert on trafficking to cooperate with authorities in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries and noted the call for a regional compact as well as the Council’s support. Initiatives like the “Rapid Gender Analysis”, carried out by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and CARE International, can guide a better and more tailored response to the needs of Ukrainian women and girls. The Council must also keep the knock-on effects of global food insecurity at top of mind and pursue the only true way to end conflict-related sexual violence and trafficking in Ukraine — namely, a diplomatic resolution of the conflict., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland), recalling the fallout of the war against Ukraine, including conflict-related sexual violence and human trafficking, noted that over 15 million people have now fled their homes, the vast majority of them being women and children. “This speed and scale of displacement is unheard of in modern times,” she said. Raising the alarm about human trafficking, she pointed out the increased vulnerability of marginalized groups, unaccompanied children and those with disabilities, calling for rigorous vetting and registration procedures in place to prevent exploitation and protection against trafficking. Ireland has sought to mitigate such risks in welcoming more than 30,000 Ukrainians to the country, she noted. Pointing to horrifying reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian Federation soldiers, she stressed that rape is not an inevitable by-product of war, but an act which may constitute a war crime. Calling on the international community to do more and ensure accountability, she stressed that survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and of trafficking deserve protection and assistance., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) criticized Ukraine and Western members of the Council for ratcheting up accusations that his country’s military service personnel were committing crimes of a sexual nature. It has become their favourite tactic since the start of his country’s special military operation. Russian soldiers were accused of sexual violence without evidence. In Kherson, for example, the authorities reported that there is no evidence that the Russian army committed sexual violence against 11 female residents, as was reported by several dubious Internet platforms. “The new hero who was reported by media as having been raped and killed by the Russian army,” he said, noting that she herself admitted that she was absolutely fine and said it was something to do with a strange photography session. While the opponents make baseless accusations, he said he will provide “concrete examples” of crimes by Ukrainian nationalists. Ukraine Senior Lieutenant Sergei Batynsky committed a monstrous crime. In Mariupol, Mr. Batynsky detained a civilian couple in the basement. Later, Mr. Batynsky, drunk, threatened to rape the wife in the presence of her husband. When the husband tried to stop it, Mr. Batynsky shot him in front of his wife. Mr. Batynsky personally confessed to this in a video interview, which is widely available. He went on listing several other examples., He said that in recent years, Ukraine has been among the top five countries in terms of the number of victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation in Europe. In Las Vegas, posters emerged, inviting Ukrainian strippers to a casting session. In Germany, fast food chain KFC in its advertising said that “we are happy to welcome all the chicks from Ukraine”. Obviously, this is just the tip of the iceberg. These show how big the threat of sexual exploitation is for Ukrainian refugees in the West. He insisted that upholding the norms of humanitarian law is a top priority for the Russian army. Taking note of the intention of the United States and the United Kingdom to supply long-range artillery and multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s statement that Kyiv will not use American multiple launch rocket systems against targets in the territories of the Russian Federation does not sound convincing. The Russian Federation reserves the right to move the line of threat from neo-Nazi posts in the republics of Donbas to include the distance of a possible range of ammunition, but also to strike at the centres where decisions about the use of such weapons are made., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), Council President for the month, speaking in his national capacity, cited reports that thousands of children had been deported to the Russian Federation and were being held in filtration camps. He called for full clarity and an independent investigation on this issue as international humanitarian law classifies the forced mass deportation of people during a conflict as a war crime. There have been multiple reports and accounts of Russian soldiers raping women after breaking down the doors of cellars and basements where they were sheltering with their families. Some of these despicable actions have taken place in front of their children. “What was discovered in Bucha and Irpin raises concerns for the safety of women and girls in other Russian occupied towns cut off from the outside world,” he said, reiterating his call for a detailed investigation on what amounts to a systematic element in attacks on civilians committed by soldiers. Conflict-related sexual violence is a despicable act, it is a war crime. Reports are showing that there is a high risk of trafficking for sexual exploitation at borders, especially for children and young women often not accompanied by other family members. Greater collaboration is needed with border agencies and Government partners to strengthen prevention mechanisms. “Let’s help Ukrainians, particularly women and girls, go from nightmares to normal lives, to dreams. Only Russian Federation tanks and soldiers stand in their way. This war should have never started. It must stop,” he concluded., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) reiterated the urgent need to resolve the problem of the Russian Federation’s continued “squatting” in the former permanent seat of the Soviet Union — “the sooner the better” — as Moscow’s latest aggression threatens the very international peace and security the Council is meant to protect. The savage cruelty of Russian invaders has turned the lives of countless Ukrainians into a nightmare, with nearly 12 million people now internally displaced. Voicing concern about the fate of some 1 million Ukrainians, including children, who have been forcibly removed to the Russian Federation, he said the decision to expedite their Russian citizenship defies international law and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Moscow refuses to provide any information on those forcibly transported to Russian territory, who are at real risk of trafficking or sexual exploitation and abuse. Calling on the international community to do more to protect them, he also drew attention to numerous allegations of crimes committed by the invaders — recorded in various Ukrainian cities and regions — with both minors and elderly persons falling victim to sexual crimes committed by Russian troops and the bodies of those tortured or raped burned to hide evidence., Welcoming the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry’s visit to several locations in Ukraine to meet with victims and witnesses and gather first-hand information, he went on to note that Ukraine is ready to resume food exports from the port of Odessa to the rest of the world. However, efforts must be taken to prevent the Russian Federation from exploiting those operations, he said, stressing that Moscow’s promises not to attack trade routes are as credible as his assurances that it would not invade Ukraine in the first place. As a first step, the Russian Federation must withdraw its naval forces from maritime waters around Ukraine. Meanwhile, he cautioned that any concessions advised by Ukraine’s well-meaning partners would only lead to more war, and noted that his country has been devastated multiple times by invasions and genocidal campaigns over the course of the last century. Millions of lives were lost in past wars for the world to realize that appeasement and concessions to the aggressor do not work. “[President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia must be defeated for the sake of international peace and security,” and for the sake of people throughout the world, he stressed., CHARLES MICHEL, President of the European Council, said the Russian Federation’s savagery today in Ukraine stands in sharp contrast to the heritage of its great artists and scholars. Citing reports of Russian forces wielding sexual violence as a weapon of war, he stressed that sexual violence is a war crime, a crime against humanity and a shameful act that must be prosecuted without impunity. The European Union stands committed to protecting all those that seek refuge outside Ukraine, who are largely women and children, and to providing them with education, health care and access to the labour market. Sadly, sexual and gender-based violence is a global threat faced by women across the world, in countries including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen., Noting his intention to host a second conference on Women in Conflict this week in Brussels alongside UN-Women, the Mukwege Foundation and Nadia’s Initiative, he went on to warn against Moscow’s attempts to use food supplies as a “stealth missile against developing countries”, as the dramatic impacts of the war spill over across the globe. “Russia’s war is solely responsible for this looming food crisis — Russia alone, despite the Kremlin’s campaign of lies and disinformation”, he said, emphasizing that the Union has “zero” sanctions on the Russian Federation’s agricultural sector and does not prevent it from transporting grain, food or fertilizers. The bloc will continue to support Ukraine and pressure Moscow “with the truth”, he said, noting that its aggression is also an attack on the core United Nations values of human dignity, tolerance, multilateral cooperation and international law., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy) said displaced and refugee children are less safe and more exposed to violence and trafficking. These considerations prompted Italy to include the issue of trafficking of persons in conflict among the priorities of its last Security Council term in 2017. His country’s efforts resulted in the unanimous adoption of resolution 2388 (2017) on combating trafficking of persons. That text emphasizes the urgency to strengthen protection and assistance for displaced persons falling prey to trafficking, especially women and children. Expressing support for the universal ratification and full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the related Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, adopted in Italy more than 20 years ago, he said: “We must confront the dire reality that it is still largely ‘cost-free’ to rape a woman in armed conflicts.” When investigations and prosecutions by national or international courts are impossible or ineffective, the General Assembly should consider creating international fact-finding mechanisms to conduct gender-sensitive investigations and ensure the collection and preservation of evidence., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), also speaking on behalf of Estonia and Lithuania, expressed deep concern about reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian armed forces in Ukraine and the increasing risk for trafficking in human beings in the region. He called on relevant United Nations entities to continue to closely monitor conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine and at its borders. Commending the creation of the EUROPOL taskforce to protect vulnerable Ukrainian refugees from human trafficking networks, he stressed the need to approach the situation carefully to avoid instances where predators can exploit the chaos., He went on to condemn in the strongest possible terms the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian residents, in particular forced deportation of unaccompanied children, to the Russian Federation, as well as the illegal adoption of Ukrainian children. Noting the importance of meaningful participation of women and girls, he reiterated the need for a survivor-centred approach in responding to sexual violence in conflict, including access to medical and psychosocial care. It is of utmost importance that the survivors of conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine have the opportunity to report cases as soon as possible and to receive proper assistance and essential services, he stressed, highlighting steps taken by the Baltic States to ensure accountability for atrocities in Ukraine., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said a multitude of reports indicates that the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war is present in the Russian Federation’s unjustified, unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. As reporting and monitoring are key to holding perpetrators accountable, Germany supports the Special Representative’s demands to reinforce the staff of the human rights monitoring mission and the Prosecutor General in Ukraine with staff specializing in conflict-related sexual violence. She commended the framework of cooperation as a vital condition for the Special Representative’s team to commence their work on-site and expressed Germany’s commitment to continuing its funding for the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. She also called for a survivor-centred approach as well as the strengthening of survivors’ rights and access to justice and services, and for more support to efforts to fight trafficking in persons. To protect the Ukrainian women coming to Germany, the Government has enacted public awareness campaigns and put in place police presence at train stations, and its feminist foreign policy considers the repercussions of conflict on those most vulnerable members of society., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) stressed that Ukrainian civilians, in particular women and children, have become targets of human trafficking and gender-based violence. Poland, as a neighbouring country and primary destination for Ukrainian refugees, is undertaking efforts to address the effects of conflict-related human trafficking and sexual abuse, including specialized and awareness-raising training for its officers, as well as information campaigns for existing and potential victims. On a 24/7 basis, any incident of possible human trafficking or sexual crime can be reported to police officers speaking Ukrainian and Russian. All reported incidents are subject to a prompt verification, he said. The Government also implemented new immigration measures for Ukrainians fleeing the war by adopting a special law in March, which stipulates that they can obtain a Polish ID number to work legally in the country and have free access to public services., RÓBERT CHATRNÚCH (Slovakia) noted that “the international community already made a commitment to help Ukraine in its reconstruction and recovery as soon as this nightmare is over.” Ukraine will undoubtedly flourish once again, but the “blood of victims of this senseless war will be forever dried on the palms of the hands of the Russian Federation”. Since the beginning of the Russian aggression, about 490,000 refugees — most being women and children — have entered Slovakia. His country adopted numerous legislative and administrative measures to help women in need and it will continue to do so. In this vein, he praised civil society and the people of Slovakia who have expressed solidarity with and provided much needed assistance to those fleeing Ukraine. There must be an “immediate cessation of Russian military activities in Ukraine and an unconditional withdrawal” of all its troops from the whole territory of Ukraine, he concluded., For information media.

Families who chose to remain have lived under heavy shelling and the security situation has only just started to improve. Many are still living in bomb shelters and are too scared to return to their homes., Almost 15 million Ukranians are now displaced, and of these 8 million have remained in the country wondering if and when they will see their families and homes again., Across the country, the World Food Programme has reached 2.2 million people in the past month alone. As conflict continues, levels of food insecurity are rising. One in three families don't have the food they need, and reaching highly vulnerable families has never been more important., Families who are living in hard-to-reach areas within Kharkiv have paid a heavy price for months of conflict. They are experiencing shortages of food, water and essential supplies. Since the war began, WFP has reached nearly 1.6 million people in Kharkiv and Kharkivska province by working with partners, including volunteers from the Ukrainian Red Cross., Luybov, Chuzhanova Nataliya and Ponomarenko are three mothers who have faced danger, fear and impossible choices since the war began. All three have chosen to live challenging lives underground while hoping that the war will end. With support from WFP, they are now able to ensure their families have enough food to eat while they face uncertain futures., Seventy-four-year-old Luybov left home with her daughter, who is in her fifties, and her grandson, who is in his thirties. Her daughter has a disability, which made escaping the shelling especially challenging., “The war started at night. We woke up to Kharkiv being bombed. We left our house in the morning, came to the bomb shelter and hid…it was scary,” says Luybov. The family have lived in the school's bomb shelter since., During the first week the family shared the underground space with about 100 other people. Half of them have now left as the situation has gradually improved after the heavy attacks decreased in mid-May., Most people in Kharkiv sought shelter in basements or subway stations, and these are now being cleared. However, some people continue to live in shelters as their houses have been destroyed, or are in north Kharkiv which remains too dangerous for families to return home., Outside the bomb shelter, children of all ages play as children normally would. However, they know it is not where or how they are supposed to be living. This is not their house or their playground., Four-year-old Kira and five year old Artem sing a song that dates back to the time of the Ukranian Cossacks. These were fierce warriors, much like the medieval knights of Western Europe or the Samurai of Japan., Kira’s mother, Chuzhanova Nataliya, worries about their future. “It is scary to go back home for now, because there is a lot of shelling, especially during the night,” she says. “We can hear explosions. If you stay in the apartment, the walls are trembling – glass, windows, everything. That’s why it is scary to stay at home with a child.”, Chuzhanova does not only have little Kira to worry about – her eldest son, who is 19, has been drafted into the military. “I’d like the war to end as soon as possible so that our children could play as they used to before the war,” says the 40-year-old mother who has been living underground since the war started., Mothers choke as they speak of what life had been like for them and their families. While they feel they are not alone and their needs are being met through WFP and partner organizations, this is not how they imagined their lives to be. And they do not see an end in sight. At least for now., Ponomarenko, Artem’s mother, is no different. She and her husband grabbed Artem and his eldest brother Nikita, nine, and ran to this shelter at the beginning of the war. They have been living there since., She goes to her house every day to cook for her family. She’s too scared to sleep in her house., “We can go back to our house now, but all the windows are broken. We hear shelling during the night, and I am scared to go back there with the children…if it weren't for the children then, maybe, we’d go back. But for now, we will stay in the shelter,” she says., The basement is not as crowded as it was at the beginning of the war. However, there are little comforts and no private space. Families share a living space, sleep on mattresses strewn against both sides of the shelter, and cook simple meals on an electric stove as there is no kitchen., Lyubov says that over the past months, laughter has been mixed with tears. Her son fled to Poland at the beginning of the war with his then-pregnant wife. She now has a new granddaughter in Poland and and does not know when they will ever meet. The couple’s home has been destroyed and have no life to return to in Ukraine., Lyubov has a dream: “I dream about peace on Earth. This should not be repeated. People should be living in harmony, and bring up their children and grandchildren (in peace).”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-three-months-three-mothers-three-generations-dreaming-peace

Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 Jun 2022,"Context, Since the Russian military offensive against Ukraine was launched on the 24th of February, over 8 million people have been displaced. A significant number of those who have fled their homes are older people (60+). While we do not yet know the full scale, according to International Organisation of Migration (IOM), 55% of displaced households contain at least one older person., Ukraine has the largest percentage of older people affected by conflict in a single country in the world. One quarter of the country’s population are over 60 years old, while in eastern Ukraine one in three of those needing assistance since the Russian invasion in 2014, have been over 60. This makes it the world’s oldest humanitarian crisis., Many older people in Ukraine face a range of heightened and specific challenges including being more likely to have health conditions and/or disabilities effecting their mobility, as compared to those who are younger. These challenges can be compounded during displacement as there is a greater likelihood of reduced access to their medication and/or the loss of essential items such as glasses and walking frames. However, older people also play an integral role in providing care to others, especially children. In Ukraine this is particularly the case as 64% of families have been separated, exacerbated by many men being conscripted into the army. Older people are often overlooked by the humanitarian sector and there is a risk that this also happens in Ukraine., To help ensure that HelpAge can implement programming tailored to the specific needs of older people, 569 displaced older adults alongside other displaced adults were interviewed between 6 to 11 May 2022 in the oblasts of Lvivska, Chernivetska in western Ukraine and Dnipropetrovska in central Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-rapid-needs-assessment-displaced-older-people-lvivska-chernivetska-and-dnipropetrovska-oblasts-3-june-2022

IRC: 100 days of war in Ukraine has destroyed civilian life and worsened global hunger,News and Press Release,IRC,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",4 Jun 2022,"New York, NY, June 4, 2022 — Civilians continue to bear the brunt of violence in Ukraine as the conflict passes one hundred days of war. Meanwhile, the ripple effect of conflict-driven food shortages threatens to worsen humanitarian crises across the globe., With almost 9,000 civilians killed or injured since 24 February, and over 200 attacks on health centers in just three months of war, the conflict in Ukraine has taken a shocking and devastating toll on the population, and been conducted with a blatant disregard for International Humanitarian Law. Humanitarian needs in the east of the country remain a profound concern amid the continued conflict. Safe access to civilians, including in Russian-controlled areas, remains a humanitarian priority. IRC partners, who are working around the clock to provide assistance to their communities, report that families arriving at their offices feel hopeless, unable to see the future or plan for the days ahead., Meanwhile, as the war drives shortages of wheat, grain and fertilizer, an additional 47 million people are projected to experience acute hunger this year. Those living in countries such as Yemen, which relies on Russia and Ukraine for 46% of its grain imports and where 19 million people are already on the verge of famine, or Somalia, which imports 92% of its supplies from the region, could see deterioration in already catastrophic situations over the next one hundred days., David Miliband, CEO & President of the International Rescue Committee, said,, “The 100-day mark since the start of the war in Ukraine is a time to mourn the lives lost, condemn the crimes committed, and face up to the dangers of a prolonged conflict. The invasion and subsequent war have become an avatar for the Age of Impunity. The fact that 100 million people are displaced worldwide today shows that Ukraine is far from an exception. There is system failure at all levels – states, diplomacy and the international legal regime., “Meanwhile, the global repercussions are potentially dire. As highlighted by the IRC’s recent report on the hunger fallout of the war in Ukraine, an additional 47 million people are projected to experience acute hunger this year. With Russia and Ukraine producing a quarter of the world’s wheat and grain supplies, global shortages will have a catastrophic impact on food insecurity in crisis-impacted regions and countries such as the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Afghanistan and Yemen., “What is happening in Ukraine is not an outlier in modern conflict. Besiegement of cities, targeting of civilian infrastructure, rape as a weapon of war, denial of aid access and targeting of aid workers have all become the hallmarks of this Age of Impunity, from Ethiopia to Yemen to Afghanistan. The last one hundred days have been a shocking indictment of human capacity for the inhuman; we cannot allow the next one hundred days to pass without calling out the impunity, and doing something to stem it.”, The IRC launched an emergency response to the crisis in Ukraine in February 2022 and has been working directly and with local partners to reach those most in need. We are in Poland, Ukraine and Moldova, delivering vital services including cash assistance, mental health support, medical supplies and equipment, and specialized social service support for women, children and survivors of violence., For more information or to schedule interviews, please contact Nancy Dent at Nancy.Dent@rescue-uk.org　　, MEDIA CONTACTS, Nancy Dent

Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Jun 2022,"by Arnold R. Grahl, Within a day of Russian troops entering Ukraine in February, Rotary clubs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia were using their connections to gain access to a strategic railway hub that has allowed them to shuttle critical supplies into Ukraine and help refugees get out., The city of Košice, Slovakia, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the border with Ukraine, is home to a rail terminus where east meets west. For decades, the terminus has received trains carrying raw materials out of Ukraine along wide-gauge rail lines. The cargo is then transferred onto train cars that run on the standard-gauge rail lines used elsewhere in Europe., A number of multinational shipping companies use the hub. Rotary members realized quickly that they needed to be able to use it as well., Martin Pitorák, president of the Rotary Club of Košice, is a former vice president of U.S. Steel Košice, which uses the hub. He and Michal Sláma, president of the Rotary Club of Pardubice, Czech Republic, were among Rotary members who were able to negotiate access., “We acted very quickly,” says Monika Kočiová, a member of the Rotaract and Rotary clubs of Košice. “We were making arrangements while others were still knocking at the door.”, The hub is important because Ukraine’s extensive rail network, one of the largest in the world, serves parts of the country that are difficult to reach by truck., Rotary was the first humanitarian organization to get permission to use the rail hub for relief supplies, Kočiová says, and clubs have sent trains full of medical supplies, nonperishable food, and hygiene products across the border. The Slovak government and the European Union have since designated the hub as a primary pathway for sending supplies by rail into Ukraine., Supplies that arrive in Košice are unloaded and sorted by Rotary volunteers into warehouses before being moved into Ukraine. The Rotary and Rotaract clubs have also used more than 60 trucks and buses to carry 740 tons of supplies into the western Ukrainian region of Uzhhorod, just across the border. From there, they are distributed to locations around the country., “It is great to see the power of Rotary at work in this time of need,” says Pitorák. “In addition to supplies, financial support is coming in from many parts of the world.”, In addition to the use of the wide-gauge rail network, the Rotary and Rotaract clubs are part of an initiative called Railway Helps. Started by the owner of Gepard Express, a Czech passenger transportation company, Railway Helps is using passenger trains to bring supplies into Ukraine and refugees out., So far, the initiative has brought more than 500 tons of supplies into Chop, a town in the Uzhhorod region. Trains returned to the city of Pardubice carrying more than 5,500 Ukrainian refugees., Rotary members have helped raise funds, which have come from a variety of sources including a public fundraiser, district funding, and a contribution by the owner of Gepard Express. The participating railways have also absorbed significant costs and other organizations have waived fees., Sláma continues to seek additional funds for Railway Helps, which is currently sending trains through Poland to Mostyska. The plan is to eventually build a waiting room and passenger station at Mostyska to speed up the flow of supplies and assist refugees leaving Ukraine., Coordinating with other entities has been crucial to the success of the efforts. The Rotary and Rotaract clubs have been working with Ukrainian government officials, including members of parliament, diplomats, and regional governors, as well as with hospitals in the cities of Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Uzhhorod, and Mukachevo., Kočiová and Ivana Lengová, both members of the International Fellowship of Healthcare Professionals, oversee the purchase of medical supplies and the processing of medical equipment donated by companies in Europe. Lengová, a member of the Rotary Club of Košice Classic, helped secured equipment worth more than $730,000 from Siemens Slovakia, including four mobile imaging units and three mobile X-ray units., “Because the fellowship includes members who work at Ukrainian hospitals, we have been able to react very quickly to changing needs,” Kočiová notes., The clubs are also in regular contact with officials and volunteers at several Slovak-Ukrainian border crossings, coordinating accommodations and transportation for refugees., Just four days after the war began, Kočiová spent time at the border., “You could feel a lot of pain and see tears,” she says. “The refugees are broken, but they are very strong and proud. They were not asking for anything. Even the small children were not complaining.”, Kočiová was away from home on a business trip when the war began, but when contacted by a Ukrainian friend and fellow Rotaractor, she arranged for her to stay at her home., “I arrived home a day later and saw her with just one small backpack containing all she had,” Kočiová says. “She is a high-level manager. Her mom was escaping along another route, and her sister yet another, and they were planning to meet up in Switzerland. When you imagine yourself in that situation, it becomes very real.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/czech-and-slovak-rotary-members-open-aid-corridor-ukraine

"Marking 100 Days Since Russian Federation Invasion of Ukraine, Secretary-General Renews Call for Immediate Halt to Violence",News and Press Release,UN SG,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",3 Jun 2022,"SG/SM/21307, The following statement by UN Secretary-General António Guterres was issued today:, Today marks 100 days since the start of the 24 February Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has already taken thousands of lives, caused untold destruction, displaced millions of people, resulted in unacceptable violations of human rights and is inflaming a three-dimensional global crisis — food, energy and finance — that is pummelling the most vulnerable people, countries and economies., From the first days of the war, the United Nations has been there to support the people of Ukraine in dealing with the humanitarian impact of the conflict, while also drawing attention to the dangers and long-term implications of continued fighting and potential escalation of hostilities for the country, the wider region and the world., As we mark this tragic day, I renew my call for an immediate halt to violence, for unfettered humanitarian access to all those in need, for safe evacuation of civilians trapped in areas of fighting and for urgent protection of civilians and respect for human rights in accordance with international norms., The United Nations is committed to the humanitarian effort.

Mental health needs grow in Ukraine after 100 days of war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,MSF,Health,2 Jun 2022,"Project Update, “I feel fear in my soul. My fingers and hands begin to get cold,” says Vira, an elderly woman who fled the Donetsk region and is now seeking shelter in Ivano-Frankivsk, in the southwest of Ukraine., “I’m worried about my relatives, who are still at home - my son is still living where there is fighting. I don’t feel heartache, what I feel is deep in my soul and it immediately brings me to tears. I can't describe how it is.”, In Ukraine, people escaping shelling, living with war wounds, or worrying about their loved ones in conflict zones usually don’t consider their mental health, say Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) psychologists. As a result, the psychological consequences of the current conflict can seem invisible, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there., After 100 days of the war in Ukraine, our mental health teams across the country are raising the alarm on the worrying psychological symptoms they are seeing., “Many children we’ve seen who have experienced bomb blasts suffer from insomnia, bed-wetting and nightmares,” says Oksana Vykhivska, MSF mental health supervisor in Kyiv. “The elderly, who often find themselves alone after being separated from loved ones, are constantly anxious and break down into tears.”, Our teams have been providing mental health support in shelters for displaced people, at mobile clinics in remote villages, and in urban metro stations., Between mid-April and mid-May, MSF conducted over 1,000 individual and group mental health sessions in Ukraine. We have observed that people suffer from intense fear, constant stress, persistent worry, hopelessness, and panic attacks., Normal reactions to an abnormal situation, Our teams have held consultations with displaced people in Berehove, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Uzhhorod, Kropyvnytskyi, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia., Many of the most vulnerable people, such as the elderly, are isolated; having been separated from their neighbours and relatives who were their support network. Meanwhile children often pick up on the stress that adults around them are feeling., “One issue we deal with is trauma-related stress,” says Vykhivska. “For example, people’s memories of hiding in basements during heavy shelling could be triggered by words, sounds, smells, or scenes that are reminiscent of the original trauma.”, “We also see people with a lot of anxiety-related symptoms, such as insomnia and constant worrying about the future,” she says. “People who normally are not affected are now stressed.”, “Struggling with the fear of death”, Kateryna had to flee her home in Irpin with her mother when their village was attacked. They were evacuated and are now living in a shelter in Mukachevo in the far west of Ukraine. Here, Kateryna sees an MSF psychologist becauseshe has suffered from panic attacks since escaping her village., “One of the things I’m struggling with is the fear of death,” she says. “I’m scared that I will fail to do something, or that I’ll do something wrong and won’t make it. I think about it again and again, and it prevents me from doing anything.”, These reactions are not unusual when living through war, says Lina Villa, MSF mental health activity manager in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. Our teams here visit shelters where hundreds of thousands of people have escaped the heavy fighting in the east and south of Ukraine., Here, psychologists try to stabilise patients by identifying the issues they are facing, and then help them find coping mechanisms., “We try to help our patients to regain some level of control in a very uncontrollable and uncertain situation, by understanding and expressing what they feel,” says Villa. “We try to reassure them that stress, fear, anxiety, sleeplessness are normal reactions to this abnormal situation.”, “It’s vitally important that people can express and exercise their feelings and emotions after facing traumatic situations,” she says. “If not addressed, these emotions can snowball and become more severe.”, Crafts and letters help calm children, In Berehove, MSF psychologists work with children who have been evacuated from conflict areas. Between 4 April to 20 May, 375 children participated in group and individual mental health sessions here., Children show symptoms from the trauma they have experienced both before and during their evacuation, including anxiety, low self-esteem, panic attacks and grief., “Many have trouble sleeping, some have started to stutter, some wet their beds,” says Kucheriaviy Valerii, MSF psychologist in Berehove., To help them cope, psychologists have different practical methods they work through with the children. One is making paper birds; children cut them out and fold the wings while putting their positive emotions and thoughts into this process., “I recommend they sleep with this bird; it can help calm them down,” says Valerii., Need for more mental health support, While MSF is providing mental health support and additional training to psychological staff in medical facilities across Ukraine, much more needs to be done., “We need to see an urgent increase in mental health services across the country,” says Vykhivska. “Both the national health system and other organisations need to ensure that the response to mental health needs and the resources behind it reach the most vulnerable people, especially in rural areas, where people are often cut off and lack access.”, It is crucial this support is provided to people where they are and that it involves close collaboration with communities so that everyone who needs help receives it., Between mid-April and mid-May, our mental health teams provided 839 individual mental health consultations and 156 groups consultations for adults and children across the country, including Uzhhorod, Berehove, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kropyvnytskyi, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Vinnytsia, and Zaporizhzhia. The most common symptoms our psychologists see are chronic stress, anxiety, panic attacks, sleeping problems, insomnia in adults, fear of loud sounds, loss of appetite, as well as bedwetting and nightmares for children. In addition, our teams have provided over 100 mental health trainings to healthcare providers across the country to support those who have been affected by the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mental-health-needs-grow-ukraine-after-100-days-war-enuk

Mine Action",1 Jun 2022,"OVERVIEW, The conflict in the east and south of Ukraine shows few signs of abatement. Limited humanitarian space for mine action activities exists beyond digitally delivered Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) messages to accessible populations, training of UN, NGO, and CSOs on EO risks when delivering humanitarian aid, and the monitoring of accidents and new contamination where feasible., In and around Kyiv, and to the north as well as northeast, the retreat of the Russian Forces has offered space for considerable explosive ordnance clear-up operations. Most clearance efforts are focused on urban centers in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Zhytomyr regions. As of this week, the State Emergency Services has cleared 127,393 explosive devices in Ukraine – on the territory of over 28,714km2. Plans are to increase this capacity by a further 80 teams. The OSCE-PCU together with NPA, DRC, HALO, and UNDP are procuring equipment for MOD and SESU to help maintain the on-going operations delivered by Ukrainian state entities., National capacities are now being complemented by the national NGOs such as UDA, and international INGO operations of the HALO Trust, DRC, and FSD who are restarting survey and clearance activities. Additional INGOs of HI, NPA, and MAG are seeking registration and accreditation to contribute to land release operations. EORE activities both digitally and physically are being conducted by ten organizations collaborating within an EORE working group chaired by UNICEF. Digital messaging alone has reached an estimated 17,973,076 million people.

Update 79 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (3 June 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Jun 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today concluded a mission to Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) and the surrounding Exclusion Zone after carrying out planned nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities there, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., This week’s mission – the IAEA’s second to the Chornobyl site in the past six weeks – was part of efforts to help ensure nuclear safety and security in Ukraine during the current military conflict. Ukraine, which also has four operating NPPs with a total of 15 reactors, has requested the IAEA’s technical assistance for this purpose., During their three-day stay at the Chornobyl NPP and the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident, IAEA experts provided support to their Ukrainian counterparts on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security, Director General Grossi said., In addition, IAEA safeguards staff conducted verification activities that had been planned as part of the annual implementation plan established by the Agency, he said., The Chornobyl NPP was controlled by Russian forces for five weeks before they withdrew on 31 March., “The IAEA has from the beginning of the conflict been focused on providing technical support to Ukraine and its nuclear facilities during these extremely difficult and challenging times for the country,” Director General Grossi said. “This week’s combined IAEA safety, security and safeguards mission succeeded in achieving all its objectives, despite the significant logistical challenges in travelling and working in Ukraine. It was the third such mission to Ukraine since the conflict began and it will be followed by others in the coming weeks and months.”, Director General Grossi personally led two previous safety, security and safeguards missions to Ukraine, travelling to the South Ukraine NPP in late March and to Chornobyl a month later. This week’s mission consisted of a team of seven IAEA staff members., During the mission, staff members of the IAEA Department of Safety and Security:, Separately, staff members of the IAEA Department of Safeguards:, The Director General is now also continuing his efforts to organize an IAEA mission to Ukraine’s largest NPP, Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya, to carry out important nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities at this site in the country’s south., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine said eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., With respect to safeguards, the transmission of remote safeguards data to IAEA headquarters from the Zaporizhzhya NPP stopped on 30 May. With the assistance of the operator, the IAEA is continuing technical attempts to re-establish the data transmission.

Ukraine: Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (May 2022) - Briefing Note: Focus on preferred communication channels & information needs,Assessment,REACH,Logistics and Telecommunications,3 Jun 2022,"Context and Methodology, Since the escalation of conflict on Thursday 24 February 2022, over 8 million people have been displaced internally across the country.
Since early April, further escalation was reported in the Eastern and Southern part of the country, causing more damages to infrastructure and disruptions in access to services in affected areas, as well as additional displacement. REACH has worked in Ukraine since 2015, primarily focusing on the East, and has collected data relevant to actors who seek to develop strategies to communicate with communities – both prior and after the escalation. This briefing note summarizes data on preferred communication channels and most reported information needs from REACH’s second round of Humanitarian Situation Monitoring data collection exercise.
Data collection was conducted between April 13th and April 20th through 223 telephone interviews with NGO and local authority key informants (KIs). 44 settlements (towns or villages) were selected for data collection. Settlement selection criteria included being the highest populated settlements within 100 km of conflict lines, along train evacuation routes, or with reported presence of IDPs. Enumerators aimed to interview 5 different KIs per settlement. KI responses were aggregated at settlement level. The findings are triangulated with secondary data sources from media or information-focused actors such as the CDAC network, Internews and the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster, and with historical data collected on preferred communication channels and information needs prior to the escalation, through REACH’s Multi Sector Needs Assessments.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-may-2022-briefing-note-focus-preferred-communication-channels-information-needs

"Ukraine: After 100 days of war, UN works to free up vital food and fertilizer exports",News and Press Release,UN News,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",3 Jun 2022,"One hundred days since the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine, UN humanitarians on Friday issued a fresh alert about the enormous needs there, as the Organization has continued to push to secure food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia, to the wider world, amid rising and alarming levels of food insecurity., Amin Awad, UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, confirmed that the Organization was making every effort to secure the release of grain stuck in Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Equally important for the world’s farmers is a secure supply of fertilizer from Russia, a major world producer., Leading the discussions are top UN officials Martin Griffiths – the Organization’s Emergency Relief Coordinator – and Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the UN Trade and Development agency, UNCTAD., “The negotiations are going on,” said Mr. Awad, speaking to journalists in Geneva from Kyiv. “There (are) a lot of details and shuttling between Moscow and other countries that have concerns and the negotiations continue. But there’s no clear-cut emerging solution right now because it’s a board of puzzles that they have to move it together.”, Highlighting the difficulties linked to international trade with Russia even though there are no sanctions on food and fertilizer humanitarian exports from the country, Mr. Awad explained that Ms. Grynspan was working “with other financial institutions and the West in general to see how Russia can really, as far as transactions are concerned, resume”., Around 1.5 billion people “are in need of that food and fertilizers” around the world, the UN official explained, adding that he hoped that the negotiations “really go in a smooth manner and be concluded as soon as possible so that the blockade of ports and the resumption of export of fertilizer and food takes place, before we have another crisis in hand.”, Today, at least 15.7 million people in Ukraine are now in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection, Mr. Awad said. Numbers are rising by the day as the war continues, and with winter around the corner, the lives of hundreds of thousands are in peril., “Today we mark 100 days from the Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative and Head of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine., Speaking from Lviv in the west of the country, he added that it was “100 days too many, and it has put the health system under huge stress…We have verified 269 attacks on health”, he said, and 76 deaths together with at least 59 injured during those assaults., Although humanitarians have explored different ways of transporting grain from Ukraine to the wider world, the only viable solution is by sea, given the huge amount of cereals and other essential foodstuffs produced., “The five million tonnes a month, that’s 100 ships a month,” said Mr. Awad, adding that rail transportation or trucking, could not manage the same volume and were fraught with logistical problems. “So, is really has to be a maritime movement…to export 50 to 60 million tonnes of food out to the world.”, Inside Ukraine, people’s everyday needs continue to grow, as the Russian advance in the eastern oblasts continues. Nearly 14 million people have been forced to flee, about one third of the entire population of Ukraine, and workers have lost their jobs and are queuing for food, UN humanitarians said., “Clearly our biggest challenges are getting aid into the hardest-to-reach areas of this country, the wartorn areas, the occupied areas, the areas around the front line,” said Matthew Hollingworth, Emergency Coordinator for WFP in Ukraine., Speaking from Lviv, he explained that “36 per cent of everything we’ve done in last three months has been to support those areas of the country. But it’s not enough, it’s nowhere near enough. And clearly, we need those continuous appeals to be heard for unimpeded humanitarian access into those areas of the country.”, He added: “We have returned to a breadbasket of the world where now sadly people are having to become significant recipients of humanitarian assistance. Where hungry people are standing in breadlines when this is the breadbasket of the world.”, Health needs are also critical for the country’s women, 265,000 of whom were pregnant before the Russian invasion., “We have received reports and heard testimonies from doctors about deliveries, including C-sections, taking place in the basements of maternity hospitals, in shelters, and even in metro stations,” said Jaime Nadal, the UN Population Fund’s (UNFPA) representative in Ukraine., Speaking from a railway station in Lviv, he added that other surgeries had taken place “in hard-to-reach areas with gynaecologists giving remote, online instructions during childbirth to save the lives of both the mother and newborn”., Displacement and multiple displacement continues to impact Ukrainians, particularly the most vulnerable, warned the UN refugee agency, UNHCR., “In Dnipro I saw buses with people who had evacuated from locations at Bakhmut arriving very visibly shaken,” said Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine., Speaking from Vinnitsya in central Ukraine, she explained that most of the arrivals she saw were elderly people “who had difficulties walking alone and came really with next to nothing in their hands. And for some, this was the second or even the third time that they have fled since 2014.”, UN migration agency IOM, has continued to track the movement of people displaced by the war – including returnees - since it began on 24 February., “Most of these returns have taken place to the north region of Ukraine including almost one million persons to Kyiv itself,” said Stephen Rogers, IOM Ukraine deputy chief of mission. “However, when those persons returned to northern and central regions…33 per cent in the central region (and) 21 per cent in the north, those people who returned found destruction of their property and will need to rebuild.”, In common with conflicts everywhere, vast swathes of Ukraine are now contaminated with unexploded ordnance or mines, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) warned., “Demining issues are of utmost priority for UNDP, we’re working with different government authorities to address this issue,” said Manal Fouani, acting UNDP Ukraine Resident Representative. “The estimation by the Government is that more than 300,000 square kilometres – that’s almost half the territory of Ukraine - are contaminated.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-after-100-days-war-un-works-free-vital-food-and-fertilizer-exports

Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Jun 2022,"Introduction, On June 3rd it will be 100 days since the Russian Federation launched a military offensive into Ukraine. While the whole country has been impacted by the conflict, settlements in the Eastern, Northern and Southern regions of Ukraine have experienced the most intense conflict. As of May 30th, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had recorded 8,900 civilian casualties inside Ukraine: 4,074 killed and 4,826 injured (since the incursion began), although the actual figure is assumed to be far higher (OHCHR 30/05/2022)., The conflict has also resulted in widescale destruction including damage to 12 airports, 40 million m2 of housing, 25,000 km of roads, 300 bridges and overpasses and 23% of the railway network (Interfax 25/05/2022). Approximately one third of Ukraine’s population has been displaced with 6.8 million people leaving Ukraine to neighbouring countries and currently an estimated 7.134 million are internally displaced (UNHCR accessed 01/06/2022, IOM 30/05/2022). The number of internally displaced persons has now dropped from a peak of just over 8 million (IOM 09/05/2022), however the majority (3.9 million) continue to be from, the east of the country, the main focus of the current Russian offensive. Even as fighting continues to lay waste to settlements along the front line in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts, people are returning to cities in north, the scene of intense fighting during the first three months of the war. IOM estimates that around 1.7 million people have returned to the north of the country and a further 941,000 to Kyiv and its environs (ISW 31/05/2022, IOM 30/05/2022)., Many settlements on the outskirts of Kyiv as well as the cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv have been devastated by the conflict with areas formerly occupied by Russian forces amongst the worst affected. Satellite imagery shows the extent of the damage around Kyiv (UNOSAT 26/04/2022, UNOSAT 12/04/2022), while a recent report from Amnesty international outlines a evidence of war crimes perpetrated in these areas (AI 06/05/2022). Many areas are contaminated by mines and UXO’s (as well as booby traps left by retreating Russian soldiers); this is impeding safe returns and also hampering logistics and aid distribution (France 24 20/04/2022, OCHA 14/04/2022). The physical damage to roads, bridges and railways as well as the supply of utilities such as electricity and water are also barriers to a return to normalcy., This brief analyses the impact of the fighting on populations in areas most affected by the conflict. This includes areas where active conflict is taking place, as well as areas that were contested but are now relatively far from the front line. The brief however does not analyse in detail the situation in areas currently controlled by Russian forces as information is limited and the sources available cannot always be verified.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/humanitarian-conditions-conflict-affected-areas-ukraine-31-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 Jun 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Hostilities, featuring at times the intense shelling of civilian areas, continued to rage in eastern Ukraine during the reporting period., WFP warns that acute hunger globally is expected to rise by 47 million people due to the war in Ukraine., As of 2 June, the UN and humanitarian partners have reached 7.8 million people across Ukraine, a 3 per cent increase compared with 26 May., Since 24 February, Ukraine Humanitarian Fund has allocated US$91 million to 55 humanitarian projects, targeting 4.9 million people., Situation Overview as of 12 p.m. on 8 June, General security and humanitarian situation. Hostilities, featuring at times the intense shelling of civilian areas, continued to rage in eastern Ukraine during the reporting period, especially in Luhanska and Donetska oblasts. Fighting was reported to continue to be focused on the administrative centre of Sievierodonetsk and other cities and towns in Government-controlled areas (GCA) of Luhanska oblast, but there were also many reports of shelling and multiple civilian casualties to the south in Donetska oblast up to Donetsk city located in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA). On 3 June, for example, there were continued reports of fighting within Sievierodonetsk and of residential houses being destroyed with civilian casualties there and in other settlements in Luhanska oblast, including Lysychansk. Also, once again during the week, there continued to be air and missile strikes in other oblasts across Ukraine. On 1 June, railway infrastructure in western Lvivska oblast was reportedly hit, with three civilians injured. On 4 June, shelling was reported in Odeska oblast in the south and Sumska oblast in the north-east. On 5 June, at least five missiles reportedly struck Kyiv city and the surrounding area in northern Ukraine for the first time in weeks. On both 5 and 7 June, shelling was reported in central Dnipropetrovska oblast, and, on 7 June, there were more missile attacks recorded in Kharkiv in eastern Kharkivska oblast. Other significant attacks and incidents included the reported repeated shelling of the historic Sviatohirska Lavra Orthodox monastery complex in Donetska oblast., UN Secretary-General António Guterres made a statement on 3 June, marking 100 days since the start of the 24 February Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine. He commented in part on how ""the conflict has already taken thousands of lives, caused untold destruction, displaced millions of people, resulted in unacceptable violations of human rights and is inflaming a three-dimensional global crisis -- food, energy and finance -- that is pummeling the most vulnerable people, countries and economies."" The Secretary-General also noted, however, that from the first days of the war, the UN has been there to support the people of Ukraine in coping with the humanitarian impacts while also drawing attention to the dangers and long-term implications of continued fighting and potential escalation of hostilities for the country, the wider region and the world.""As we mark this tragic day,"" Secretary-General Guterres continued, ""I renew my call for an immediate halt to violence, for unfettered humanitarian access to all those in need, for the safe evacuation of civilians trapped in areas of fighting and for urgent protection of civilians and respect for human rights in accordance with international norms."" He stressed that the UN is committed to the humanitarian effort while also saying that it stands ready to support all efforts at negotiations and dialogue to resolve the ongoing war. In his own statement on the 100-day milestone, Assistant Secretary-General and UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine Amin Awad also spoke about the unacceptable toll of the war on people, how it has engulfed virtually all aspects of civilian life, and how it would have no ""winner."", Civilian casualties and impact on civilian infrastructure. There continued to be accounts of civilians killed and injured daily. Along with the worst of the hostilities, most were reported in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, and most were a result of the shelling of civilian areas and civilian infrastructure, including schools. On 3 June, two Reuters journalists were reportedly injured, and their driver killed in shelling near Sievierodonetsk. Meanwhile, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has verified more than 9,400 civilian causalities in Ukraine since 24 February. According to OHCHR, as of 7 June, the number of civilian casualties stands at 9,444 in the country: 4,266 killed and 5,178 injured, according to OHCHR. More than half (5,412) of all casualties so far verified have been recorded in GCA and NGCA of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration., There have continued to be multiple reports of civilian infrastructure being damaged in the hostilities, especially in eastern Ukraine. On 2 June, for example, Donetska oblast authorities updated that the water supply had been disrupted for two weeks already in several cities -- including Sloviansk and part of Kramatorsk -- due to damaged electricity infrastructure. Meanwhile, water supply also reportedly remained limited in Donetsk city in the NGCA of Donetska oblast., Impact on health. It was reported on 6 June that quarantine had been imposed in the city of Mariupol, NGCA of Donetska oblast, to mitigate a potential outbreak of cholera and dysentery. It has also been reported that the movement of Mariupol's remaining residents was being tightly controlled. Several UN agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have previously voiced concerns about deteriorating conditions in Mariupol and a potential cholera outbreak., The war in Ukraine continues to impact the mental health of millions of Ukrainians. Ukraine's Ministry of Health estimates that 15 million people might require psychological support and treatment due to war-related trauma and stress, with 3 to 4 million potentially requiring medication-assisted treatment. Multiple UN agencies have also been raising the alarm about the long-term mental health impact of the war in Ukraine., Food security. Also acknowledging 100 days of the invasion, on 3 June, UN News Service reported how UN humanitarians issued a fresh alert about alarming and rising levels of food insecurity and how the UN has continued to push to secure food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and the Russian Federation to the wider world. Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine Amin Awad confirmed that the UN has been making every effort to secure the release of grain trapped in Ukraine's Black Sea ports, noting that a secure supply of fertilizer from the Russian Federation, a major world producer, is equally important for the world's farmers. The Crisis Coordinator said that some 1.5 billion people around the world are in need of the trapped food and fertilizers, adding that he hoped the negotiations ""really go in a smooth manner and be concluded as soon as possible so that the blockade of ports and the resumption of export of fertilizer and food takes place before we have another crisis in hand."" Mr. Awad added that, although humanitarians have explored different ways of transporting grain from Ukraine, the only viable solution is by sea, given the huge amount of cereals and other essential foodstuffs produced. ""The 5 million tons a month, that's 100 ships a month,"" he said, saying that rail or truck transport could not manage the same volume and would be fraught with logistical problems. ""So, this really has to be a maritime movement ... to export 50 to 60 million tons of food out to the world."", Separately, local authorities in the city of Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast south) reported on 5 June that shelling had destroyed two grain storehouses-- prompting EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrel Fontelles to comment that it was another example of a missile strike ""contributing to the global food crisis."" The Emergency Coordinator for the World Food Programme (WFP) in Ukraine, Matthew Hollingworth, in his statement marking 100 days of the war, noted that ""the war has transformed what is usually a 'breadbasket of the world' into a major humanitarian crisis."" He added that Ukrainian grain fed 400 million people around the world last year. Now, in more than 120 countries where WFP works, acute hunger is expected to rise by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine continues unabated -- that is a staggering 17 per cent jump -- with the steepest rises in sub-Saharan Africa., Impact on human rights. The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) on 3 June announced that members of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine would undertake their first mission to the country from 7 to 16 June. HRC said that the commissioners intend to visit several locations in Ukraine, including Kharkiv, Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north), Lviv( Lvivska oblast) and Sumy (Sumska oblast), ""to get first-hand information on alleged human rights violations and abuses, and international humanitarian law violations, and to meet with victims, witnesses and internally displaced persons."" HRC said that the three commissioners taking part in the mission are expected to meet with Government officials as well as members of civil society and UN agencies to discuss the situation in the country. It explained that the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine is an independent body mandated by HRC ""to, among other things, investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation; to establish the facts, circumstances and root causes of any such violations and abuses; and to collect, consolidate and analyze evidence of such violations and abuses, including their gender dimension, in view of any future legal proceedings."" The commissioners are to hold a press conference toward the conclusion of their mission on 15 June, and then the commission is to submit reports on its activities to the General Assembly in October and to the HRC next March., Impacts on older people. The NGO network HelpAge International on 3 June announced the results of a new survey, focusing on millions of older Ukrainians caught up in the war and who, HelpAge says, are being overlooked in the humanitarian response despite making up a quarter of the country's population. HelpAge said that the survey was conducted in western and central Ukraine and that it offers an insight into the challenges and specific needs of displaced people over 60. It said, among the findings, almost 9 out of 10older people (89 per cent) have a health condition-- including hypertension (57 per cent), heart problems (50 per cent), joint aches and pains (41 per cent) and gastrointestinal issues (20 per cent)-- and only 43 per cent have full access to medication while 12 per cent have no access at all. Also, 43 per cent of respondents said that they have at least one disability, with just over a third (34 per cent) saying they have mobility issues. Almost three-quarters (74 per cent) said their biggest need was cash-- to give them the freedom to access what they need most.When asked what their secondary needs were, 7in 10 (70 per cent) said medicine and healthcare and 6in 10(61 per cent) said hygiene items-- while 8 per cent said they have no access to safe drinking water.Meanwhile, only half of the respondents were formally registered as internally displaced persons (IDPs) and received social benefits. HelpAge said it is calling, in part, on humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, countries hosting Ukrainians and UN bodies to consider older people's specific needs when it comes to the health care they receive and their rights and making them central to the wider humanitarian response., Impacts on education. International NGOSave the Children, in its report marking 100 days of the war, pointed out the deeply concerning statistic that twice as many Ukrainian schools have so far been attacked since 24 February as during the first seven years of the conflict. Save the Children, citing Ukraine's Ministry of Education and Science, reported that at least 1,888 schools have been damaged or destroyed by shelling and bombardments since the conflict escalated in February-- or more than double the number of such attacks recorded in eastern Ukraine from 2014 to 2021, when about 750 schools were damaged, destroyed or forced to close.One devastating result is that the war has disrupted the education of all 7.5 million children who were living in Ukraine at the start of 2022., Displacement. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has reported that more than 4.8 million individual refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe, including over 3.2 million Ukrainians who have applied for protection. In addition, according to UNHCR, some 7.2 million border crossings from Ukraine have been registered since 24 February, while 2.3 million border crossings back to Ukraine have been registered since 28 February. The agency specified that these figures represent the number of cross-border movements rather than the numbers of individuals involved and that movements back into Ukraine may be ""pendular,"" back and forth, and do not necessarily indicate long-term returns of Ukrainians who previously fled their homes -- in part because the situation across the country remains highly volatile and unpredictable. The recorded figure of 4.8 million individual refugees from Ukraine is an estimate because potential further movements or returns could not be calculated. Out of 3.2 million Ukrainians who have registered for temporary protection or similar national protection schemes in Europe -- 1.15 million registered in Poland, 780,000 in Germany, over 366,000 in the Czech Republic, nearly 126,000 in Italy and over 118,000 in Spain., During the reporting period, more people evacuated or tried to evacuate from areas of active fighting. Ukraine's Joint Forces Task Force reported more than 6,100 people evacuated from areas of active hostilities in eastern Ukraine between 1 and 6 June. Separately, the local authorities in southeastern Zaporizka oblast reported that an evacuation of private vehicles to NGCA of the oblast planned for 3 June was blocked by the threat of shelling and a washed-out road near Kamianske. In Luhanska oblast, 98 people were reported to have been evacuated from Lysychansk on 5 June despite continuous shelling, while evacuations from Sievierodonetsk, where an estimated 15,000 people remain, were reportedly impossible that day. Then on 7 June, 56 people, including two people with low mobility, were reportedly evacuated from Lysychansk and Hirska hromada. Separately, the Russian Federation reported that, as of 8June, 1,730,556 people, including 278,939 children, had crossed to the Russian Federation from the territory of Ukraine after 24 February. Meanwhile, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that, as of 1 June, just over1 million people (1,041,095) had crossed into the Russian Federation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-9-jun-2022-enruuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items",3 Jun 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by Karolina Lindholm Billing, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today’s press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., I have spent the last weeks in Kyiv, Poltava, Dnipro, Zaporizhia, and now in Vinnytsya, meeting internally displaced people, local authorities, emergency services and volunteers in the host communities., The situation is very fluid, and the outlook for the innocent victims of this brutal and senseless war is fragile., People are still fleeing fighting, others remain in the places they fled to in the last 100 days; some are already returning to rebuild their homes. I also met some people who had returned, then decided it was unsafe and had to flee again., In Dnipro, I saw buses arriving with people who had evacuated from locations like Bakhmut. They were visibly weak and shaken. Most arrivals were elderly, had difficulty walking alone and needed help. These are people with next to nothing., For some, this is the second time they have fled for their lives since 2014. They need immediate, emergency humanitarian support: somewhere to sleep, clothes, hygiene items, food, cash assistance and - importantly - psychological first aid and counselling., UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has so far, with partners, assisted over 1.2 million people across Ukraine. That includes 233,000 reached with protection counselling and services; 500,000 with essential items such as mattresses, blankets and solar lamps in areas with no electricity; and 73,400 have received vital assistance through humanitarian convoys delivered to hard-hit areas, We have also scaled up the accommodation capacity of 182 reception and collective centres, so people who have just fled have a dignified and warm place to sleep for a short while., This week, I spoke with many IDPs living in temporary reception facilities. Tonight, they have somewhere warm to sleep, but they don’t know about tomorrow or the months to come. As one elderly displaced woman I met yesterday in Koziatin, Vinnytsya oblast, said: “Our main question is – where to go now?” She knew their stay in that reception centre would be temporary., In Dnipro, I met 60-year-old Iryna in the dormitory of the State Academy of Physical Education and Sports., She had fled with her husband, daughter, son-in-law and their two children from the shelling in Kharkiv. They have been trying to find an apartment to rent in Dnipro, but are struggling to afford one., Iryna said: “We all want to go home, but Kharkiv is still a dangerous area. And because of the children, we can’t go. One of my grandsons has already started to have neurological reactions to the stress – his face at times gets twisted.’’, At a dormitory in Poltava, I met people who had returned to Kharkiv, only to find that it was not yet possible to start rebuilding their homes or resume work, so they headed back – again - to Poltava., As we continue trying to reach those cowering in bomb shelters in areas under heavy shelling with emergency assistance, we are also scaling up support to help the displaced in the medium to longer-term; to lay the ground for recovery and durable solutions., Protection support must be at the centre of our response, as the risks and needs are mounting. Everyone is traumatized. Psychosocial counselling is essential for recovery. The needs are huge. Some have fled without their ID or civil documents and need help to receive new ones to access rights and services. Risks of exploitation, abuse and harmful coping strategies are also increasing, as destitution rises., Several people I spoke with told of people returning to their homes, even in areas in Luhansk oblast, as they simply cannot afford the expense of displacement., UNHCR is also ramping up programmes that will help people with damaged houses to repair roofs, windows, doors and walls. In Donetsk and Luhansk oblast, and in areas around Kyiv, we have provided emergency shelter kits to prevent the rain from pouring in. So far, 24,300 households have received shelter kits., We are also working to support the refurbishment and repurposing of buildings that can be turned into medium-term collective centres, for people who need to move from temporary reception centres but cannot afford to rent an apartment., But this will not be enough., Winter is coming. And winters in Ukraine are brutal. Having somewhere warm, safe and dignified to stay will be lifesaving. So UNHCR, as the shelter and NFI cluster lead, is preparing with partners an overview of the specific types of support vulnerable families will need this winter, to complement the other assistance that the national authorities, the UN and our humanitarian partners are providing., For more information on this topic, please contact:, In Uzhgorod, Victoria Andrievska, andrievs@unhcr.org; +380 50 413 8404 In Geneva, Shabia Mantoo, mantoo@unhcr.org; +41 79 337 76 50",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/after-100-days-anguish-unhcr-focused-protection-and-shelter-ukrainians

The scale of destruction in cities defies comprehension. Homes, schools and hospitals have been destroyed and civilians have suffered the horrors of conflict, with lives lost and families torn apart., Thousands of them are living with the anguish of not knowing what happened to their loved ones, including relatives of prisoners of war. The parties to the conflict under the Third Geneva Convention must allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit all prisoners of war wherever they are held. While we have been able to visit some prisoners of war, the parties are yet to give us access to them all. And some is not enough., It's also important to remember that some regions have suffered not 100 days of armed conflict, but eight years of it, and many people have endured multiple tragedies.

One hundred days of war has put Ukraine’s health system under severe pressure,News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Safety and Security",3 Jun 2022,"After one hundred days of war, Ukraine's health system is under severe pressure and the World Health Organization (WHO) has increased its presence, both in Ukraine and in those countries hosting displaced Ukrainians, to help meet the escalating health needs., """"This war has gone on for 100 days too many, shattering lives and communities, and imperilling the short- and long-term health of Ukraine's people,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""WHO is doing everything we can to support Ukraine's Ministry of Health and deliver essential medical supplies and equipment. But the one medicine that Ukraine needs most is the one that WHO can't deliver -- peace. We call on the Russian Federation to end the war."", The war has increased the need for health care while reducing the system's ability to provide services, particularly in areas of active conflict. As of June 2, there have been 269 verified attacks on health, killing at least 76 people and injuring 59., ""In 100 days of war, there have been over 260 verified attacks on health care in Ukraine. These attacks are not justifiable, they are never ok, and they must be investigated. No health professional should have to deliver health care on a knife edge, but this is just what nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, the medical teams in Ukraine are doing,"" said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., ""I have been privileged to meet many health workers during two visits to Ukraine since the war began. They are keeping vital services and hope alive in the face of unbelievable sorrow and suffering, and we salute them,"" he added., Some health facilities have been destroyed, while others have been overwhelmed by people seeking care for trauma and injuries resulting directly from the war. WHO has established hubs in areas close to the conflict, such as Dnipro, to rapidly reach the areas of greatest need., ""WHO is committed to being in Ukraine both now and in the longer term -- addressing immediate health challenges and supporting reconstruction of the heath system. We are redeploying teams throughout the country as access and security improves."" said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine. ""Health-mental and physical- must be at the centre of Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction plans""., To achieve this, WHO has launched an updated appeal for $147.5million, to support Ukraine's worsening humanitarian need, provide immediate healthcare delivery and help the health system stay resilient for the longer term. Of this total, $80million is needed for in-country support, such as distributing medicines and delivering vital healthcare services and a further $67.5m is required to assist refugee-receiving and hosting countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Moldova and Romania., The war has caused a massive increase in psychological harm and distress. Throughout the country, health care professionals report that the most common request now is help to deal with sleeplessness, anxiety, grief and psychological pain. WHO is working with the office of Olena Zelenska, First Lady of Ukraine to develop a nationwide mental health programme accessible by all., WHO has responded to the changed health needs in Ukraine by increasing numbers of staff and repurposing systems including our logistics system. This has enabled delivery of over 543 metric tonnes of medical supplies and equipment to the country which are being distributed mostly in the east, south and northern oblasts where need is currently greatest. Supplies provided include trauma surgery supplies, ambulances, Ukrainian-made ventilators able to continue function even when power fails, electric generators and oxygen equipment including building oxygen plants to help hospitals function autonomously., Another major need is training to deal with the effects of war- trauma surgery, mass casualties, burns and chemical exposure. Since February 24, WHO has trained more than 1300 healthcare workers on those topics., Along with this, WHO has been working with the Ukraine Public Health Centre to strengthen disease surveillance and laboratory diagnostics, and with local authorities to build back vaccination programmes and essential health services. To complement the health system, WHO is working with over 40 Emergency Medical Teams as well., Media Contacts

100 Days on: Millions of older people missing out in the response to the world's oldest humanitarian crisis,News and Press Release,HelpAge,"Food and Nutrition
Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Jun 2022,"Millions of older people caught up in the war in Ukraine are being overlooked in the humanitarian response, despite making up a quarter of the country's population, HelpAge International warns today (June 3)., A new survey from HelpAge International in western and central Ukraine offers an insight into the challenges and specific needs of displaced people over 60. Tomorrow marks 100 days since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine., The survey reveals:, Justin Derbyshire, HelpAge International's CEO, said: ***""This is a wake-up call for urgent action to address the very real, hard and desperate needs of older people in Ukraine. ***, ""The humanitarian system too often fails to respond to older people's specific needs. Failure to put older people at the heart of this response when so many older people are in this war, would be shameful. We must get this right and we need to see action now for Ukraine and other emergencies across the world where older people continue to be ignored and left behind."", Across the country, many older people remain within their homes, many in areas of intense fighting. They need access to shelter, food, water, medicines, emotional support and access to their pensions, even though these fall short in covering their basic needs., There are older people who are helping others, including other older people and children. But many are also among more than 8 million internally displaced, or the 6.6 million refugees, and require specific support for the long journeys, navigating new areas and accessing services they need., It is widely recognised that older people have specific needs that must be addressed as part of an inclusive and effective humanitarian response. But they are rarely prioritised., Even before the escalation of the war in February, a third of all people in Ukraine affected since it began in 2014 were over-60. And while there are many older people who are doing so much to help others, action to address the needs of others must be ramped up., Orla Murphy, Ukraine Humanitarian Response Manager for HelpAge, who was recently in Ukraine said: ""The level of trauma and need that so many older people have is beyond belief, particularly among those who have already endured eight years of war in the east of the country., ""As we approach 100 days of full-scale war, it's time the global community acknowledged the horrors and the challenges of the older generation and stopped putting them at the back of the queue."", HelpAge International has been operating in Ukraine since 2014 and its network of volunteers continues to provide emotional support to people isolated in their homes in eastern Ukraine. They have also helped with food distributions, as well as delivering hygiene items. The organisation is setting up programmes to support older people who are internally displaced and in care homes in Lviv, Dnipro and surrounding areas., In a new advocacy brief: No Time for Business as Usual, HelpAge International outlines how a humanitarian response without older people's needs being front-and-centre is unacceptable. It praises the working groups set up to support older people and those with disabilities in Ukraine. But the absence of disaggregated data on older people, disabilities and gender, gaps in leadership and a lack of commitment to prioritise older people means that efforts to support them are hampered., HelpAge International is calling on humanitarian organisations in Ukraine to prioritise older people so their needs are met whether at home, in care homes or internally displaced. Hosting countries must also ensure that older people's rights are upheld, including prioritisation at border and transit points and protection for those facing additional risks, such as older people with disabilities and older women., Meanwhile UN bodies must provide the leadership needed so older people are central to the wider humanitarian response. This includes increased staff capacity at OCHA and the UNHCR, and a commitment to collect new gender, age and disability data that is then analysed appropriately so the needs, perspectives, rights and challenges of older women and men are identified. Donors and governments must also prioritise the needs of older people, so funding is available to implement a more inclusive humanitarian response., ###\, Notes to editors, For more information or to arrange an interview, contact [Lucy Brinicombe](mailto:Lucy Brinicombelucy.brinicombe@helpage.org), +44 (0)7932 976478., ####, Content and interviews, Interview opportunities available (with pictures):, New content from Dnipro:, Additional content:, Related article:, The Rapid Needs Assessment survey is based on 569 interviews, 218 of which were with people over 60.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Jun 2022,"Ukraine, 3 June 2022 – Natalia was running through a field with her five-year-old son Tymofii and her mother Tamara, looking back at her house burning after an airstrike. “We spent a week in a cold basement hearing shelling. When we saw helicopters flying towards Borodianka, we realized it was either now or never. We grabbed a few things and ran out of the door,” she said., An embroidered icon of the Virgin Mary reminds Natalia of a home that does not exist anymore. The icon and a tiny backpack with superhero toys belonging to Tymofii travelled with them hundreds of kilometres, as they fled their hometown of Borodianka. Once a green suburb of Ukraine’s capital, it witnessed the most intense fighting since the Russian invasion., Local volunteers, two of whom were later killed, helped the family to get on one of the evacuation buses to western Ukraine. Since then, Natalia and her family have lived in several temporary centres for internally displaced persons (IDPs), and finally settled in a centre in Kolomyia in Ivano-Frankivsk Region. But a sense of impermanence persists. From here, Natalia, Tamara and Tymofii have nowhere to go and their need for long-term housing will increase as the war drags on., Since 24 February, when Russian forces attacked Ukraine from the air, sea and sent ground troops, IOM has supported about 475,000 people with food, hygiene items, cash assistance, mental health support, psychosocial support, and information to help prevent human trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse., The people in Ukraine are exhausted, scared, and lost without clear plans for their future. But they are also courageous, resilient, and convinced of their ability to rebuild their lives. During the first 100 days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we recorded the stories of Natalia, Tamara, Tymofii, Iryna, and Kostiantyn. They represent the fate of millions of people who grabbed what they could and fled while shells fell around them., Living in a classroom with two dogs, Iryna and Kostiantyn, both 65 years old, came from Kharkiv Region, the site of some of the worst horrors of the war and fierce shelling. After days of repeatedly climbing up and down the stairs from their 10th floor apartment to the shelter in the building’s basement, the elderly couple packed a few belongings and fled with their dogs to safer locations in western Ukraine., “The near-constant shelling and planes overhead – it was very scary. We packed at night and got into the first train. It took us 27 hours to get here,” the couple explains. “We were nervous that we would not be allowed to live in the dormitory with our dogs. But everyone enjoys playing with them. We were lucky.”, Since early March, they have been living in one of the dormitories in Stryi, Lviv Region, where several floors are designated for displaced families, among whom are the elderly, families with children and people with disabilities. Spare rooms on one of the floors were turned into a kindergarten and dorm rooms have become homes for people fleeing the war., Despite all the inconveniences, Iryna and Kostiantyn are not planning to return home as it remains unsafe., From emergency to recovery efforts, Most of the schools, dormitories and other buildings that opened their doors to internally displaced persons were not designed to host a large number of people. Leaking sewerage, old electrical systems and sanitation facilities, rotten wooden windows, damaged roofs, and a lack of privacy are the most common problems., In the western Ukrainian region of Zakarpattia, IOM has started rehabilitating old premises. Its mobile repair teams are working tirelessly to improve the living conditions for thousands of families in Ukraine, who face prolonged displacement., IOM also delivers washing machines, clothes dryers, and hygiene items, supplies kitchen kits, mattresses, pillows, blankets and bed linen and installs water treatment units., Three quarters of IDPs surveyed by IOM at the end of May identified cash as one of their priority needs. Since March, IOM has provided cash to over 72,000 vulnerable war-affected people in Zakarpattia, Chernivtsi and Vinnytsia., “As autumn and winter are not far away, there is a need to find sustainable solutions for the accommodation and integration of internally displaced people,” says IOM Ukraine’s Chief of Mission, Anh Nguyen. “In addition to the immediate humanitarian response in Ukraine, we will support resilience and recovery efforts.”, Spring of Hope, one of IOM’s long-term NGO partners, highlights the importance of socioeconomic support for internally displaced persons for their successful integration in host communities. According to the latest IOM displacement survey, 64 per cent of displaced people who were employed before the start of the war have lost their jobs and one in five has no income. To bolster economic recovery and contribute to job creation, IOM has recently launched a small grant programme to support micro-enterprises and self-employed people in Lviv, Zakarpattia, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, and a bigger grants initiative for businesses that relocated to Lviv and Zakarpattia., The provision of psychosocial support – primary care, individual or group counselling and training – remains a key concern. The IOM toll-free hotline 0 800 211 444 offers tailored and confidential support through calls by a team of 30 psychologists. Moreover, IOM mobile clinics also provide mental health services in Lviv Region and will be expanded to other locations., Written by IOM Ukraine Communication Team",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/scorched-dreams-100-days-war-ukraine

"Interview: ‘Any way you look at it, wars are evil’, UN Ukraine Crisis chief [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,UN News,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",2 Jun 2022,"Amin Awad was appointed the UN Crisis Coordinator in Ukraine by Secretary-General António Guterres in February, following the Russian attack on the country. Marking 100 days since the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine, UN News spoke exclusively and in-depth to Mr. Awad, who explained what the UN is doing to try to end the conflict, and provide support and protection to millions of Ukrainian civilians caught in the crossfire, especially in light of the bitterly cold winter months which lie just a few months ahead., UN News: The Russian war in Ukraine has reached a tragic milestone. Are there any hopes that this war will end anytime soon?, Amin Awad: “There is optimism that the war will end, because neither Ukraine nor Russia can afford it. Ukraine is suffering from the loss of life, the destruction of hospitals, schools, homes, railway stations and tracks, and the transport sector. And the sanctions on Russia are severe., It is also destructive for the world. Ukraine supports about 15 to 20 per cent of the world’s food needs. This food is trapped, and we have another harvest season coming up: we have an impeding disruption of food pipelines and supply chains., We’re also seeing inflationary problems and countries defaulting on their debt: Sri Lanka, for example, is unable to pay its loans. The world is not in a good place., UN News: Civilians are paying the highest price for this invasion. Many were killed, while millions have sought refuge in neighboring countries. What is the situation like for those who are still in the country?, Amin Awad: There is a sense of despair. There are almost eight million people displaced internally, and another six million abroad. Around 15 million did not leave their homes, but they're impacted by the loss of their livelihoods, and have lost access to services like education, health, and other amenities. Millions of children are not going to school., The social security system is strained. Government services are stretched. So is the humanitarian community. It's a really bad situation., UN News: The UN and Red Cross (ICRC) facilitated the evacuation of desperate civilians trapped in the Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Are there any similar operations the UN is involved in right now, to evacuate those who are trapped in the hostile zones?, Amin Awad: We haven't received requests for evacuations, such as the one in Mariupol, but we have been putting requests forward for access to areas where populations are in need of food, medical supplies, and other kind of support., Moreover, I think now we have to really concentrate on winter: we are already in June, and winter is around the corner and, in this part of the world, temperatures are sub-zero. With the destruction of many of the power energy plants, and the loss of alternative energy supplies, we need to quickly come up with a strategy to support millions of people during this winter., UN News: You have been in Ukraine for a while now, and you’ve seen the ugly face of this war. Can you tell us a human story that touched you deeply?, Amin Awad: There's a lot of suffering. Driving through some of these areas of destruction, I see children who have escaped the destruction of their homes or apartment building, and find themselves alone on the road, with no parents, no guardians, and nowhere to go., I think this is one of the ugly faces of war that we have to stop., UN News: Regarding the safety of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, is the UN working with parties to address any possible threats?, Amin Awad: The International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) has been here many times. They went to all the plants. Zaporizhzhya is under Russian control, and I believe that there's a negotiation underway to provide access to the agency., Nuclear plants could pose a danger, not only to Ukraine, but to the whole continent. So, they need the utmost attention, and security procedures and protocol have to be followed., UN News: There were many attacks on schools across Ukraine. You’ve been calling on warring parties to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure and you stressed that these obligations under international humanitarian law are non-negotiable. Are there any signs that Russia is listening to these calls?, Amin Awad: We continue to call on Russia to really spare what we call civilian infrastructure, which is sources of water, electricity, schools and hospitals., We will continue to make these calls, because the number of people who fled because of these attacks is huge and unacceptable., UN News: Do you have any final message?, Amin Awad: My final message is really for this war to stop. The world will gain a lot., Around 69 countries could be affected by food shortages, inflation, the collapse of supply chain, the impact of unemployment, and many other elements., The world is already facing many challenges. One of them is climate change, which is also affecting agriculture and other livelihood sources., So, any way you look at it – strategically, politically, or economically – wars are evil., There are no gains in any war. Everybody loses.”, The text of this interview has been edited for clarity and length.

This included:, a total of 4,169 killed (1,580 men, 1,038 women, 99 girls, and 102 boys, as well as 67 children and 1,283 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 4,982 injured (992 men, 681 women, 115 girls, and 140 boys, as well as 168 children and 2,886 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

Teams mobilized to provide emergency healthcare services, food, hygiene products, psychosocial counselling, cross-border transportation and temporary accommodation and shelter to those fleeing the country., To date the UN, along with partners, have reached more than 7.6 million people across Ukraine with life-saving assistance., At the 49th Session of the Human Rights Council, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner echoed the UN Secretary-General in calling for the violence in Ukraine to end., ""People's lives, their dignity and human rights must be protected, and international human rights law and international humanitarian law must be respected."", For three decades in Ukraine, UNDP has worked with local communities, helping them to exercise their rights, including in conflict-affected areas., The war has caused the fastest forced population movement since the Second World War. Nearly one third of the population of Ukraine -- close to 14 million people -- have now fled their homes. Of this total, over 6.5 million Ukrainians have crossed the borders and are living as refugees abroad, while over 8 million are internally displaced within the country., This means millions of people -- men and women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities -- all leaving the communities they considered home to travel to the unknown across the country in search of safety and security for their families., UNDP has a long-standing partnership with the Government to support the digitization of essential services, and this work has been rapidly expanded to help reach people affected by the war. Not long after the war began, the Government of Ukraine used a mobile application to reach out to Ukrainians who were displaced from their homes. In its first few weeks of operation, nearly half a million people self-registered as internally displaced and accessed the online services to receive cash transfers and other forms of assistance., According to government estimates, at least $100 billion worth of infrastructure, buildings, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and other physical assets have been destroyed. It is also estimated that nearly 5 million jobs have been lost since the start of the war., Early projections released by UNDP show that in the event of a continuing, protracted war in Ukraine, 18 years of socio-economic achievements could be lost, with almost one third of the population living below the poverty line and a further 62 percent at high risk of falling into poverty within the next 12 months., Even as the war continues, UNDP is working with the Government to put in place the foundations for recovery and reconstruction. UNDP is providing technical support to the new Government Recovery and Development Plan, developed by the Office of the President, Parliament and other government bodies. Support is also being provided in the assessment of war induced damages and coordination of reconstruction and recovery efforts. The focus is on laying the groundwork for Ukraine's social and economic recovery, alongside the humanitarian response, so that the country's hard-won development gains can be preserved., Landmines, debris and explosive ordnance put Ukrainian lives in danger and hamper the emergency response. UNDP leads the coordination of the UN's work on mine action in Ukraine, and our experts are urgently working with national and local authorities to map, assess and help Ukraine remove explosive ordnance and debris containing hazardous materials. This vital work has started and will continue to scale up into new areas, as security allows., The war in Ukraine, in all its dimensions, is producing alarming cascading effects to a world economy already battered by COVID-19 and climate change, with particularly dramatic impacts on developing countries., According to a recent UNDP report, some of the direct impacts of the crisis in Africa include trade disruption, food and fuel price spikes, macroeconomic instability, and security challenges. African countries are particularly affected due to their heavy reliance on imports from Russia and Ukraine., As we reach the grim milestone of 100 days of war, the people of Ukraine are enduring unimaginable suffering. This crisis will also deepen existing vulnerabilities and inequalities across the region and beyond., UNDP has worked with local communities in Ukraine for decades, and we are now focused on scaling up support in demining, recovery of critical infrastructure and livelihoods., Most importantly, we continue to work closely with the Government, to help preserve development gains and achieve a green and inclusive recovery in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/100-days-war-ukraine

Ukraine: Twice as many schools attacked in the past 100 days as during the first 7 years of conflict,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",2 Jun 2022,"KYIV 2 June 2022 – More schools in Ukraine were damaged and destroyed in the past 100 days than in the first seven years after fighting broke out in 2014, Save the Children said today., At least 1,888 schools have been damaged and destroyed by shelling and bombing since the conflict escalated on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science. That is more than double the number of such attacks recorded in eastern Ukraine from 2014 to 2021, when about 750 schools were damaged, destroyed or forced to close., The war has disrupted the education of all 7.5 million children who were living in Ukraine at the beginning of this year., “The fact that Ukraine is facing record high attacks on schools should outrage everyone. With each day that passes in this war, children’s lives and futures are put at greater risk,” said Onno van Manen, Save the Children’s acting Country Director in Ukraine. “This war must end now.”, The relentless bombardment in Ukraine has forced more than 6.7 million people to flee the country in the past 100 days—around half of them children. On average, that’s approximately 33,500 children every day., However, many thousands of children like Mariia*, 13, have been displaced inside Ukraine and some are using the remaining schools as shelters from the violence., Mariia fled the eastern Donetsk region with her mother, six-year-old brother and their cat when fighting intensified near their home town. The family travelled for two days by train to L’viv. From there, they went further until they found a school where they could safely shelter., “When we left our home region, I was glad that we would not hear those explosions [anymore]. But I was sad that we were leaving home, our apartment,” said Mariia. “Now, we live in a different atmosphere, there are a lot of people here. Everything has changed.”, Mariia and her family have been living in a classroom and sharing bathrooms with 60 other people in the school in Chernivtsi, western Ukraine, since April., “Physically, I feel okay, but emotionally it’s been difficult,” said Mariia. “However, I do hope we can go back home. And if not, we will settle here. I hope that all the people will be fine and have a peaceful sky.”, Mariia’s mother, Olena*, explained that the conflict is taking a serious toll on Mariia’s physical and mental health. Save the Children is providing the family with cash assistance to help them buy medicine, food and other basic necessities., “My daughter has a chronic disease that gets worse because of the stress. And, of course, in all the current circumstances, her condition has deteriorated significantly,” said Olena. “During the war at home, we could not control our daughter's condition, so as soon as we received financial aid, we were able to resume treatment and get results.”, One in every 10 schools that came under attack this year were completely destroyed, and more than half of the 1,708 schools that were damaged were located in eastern Ukraine., If attacks on schools continue, children like Mariia will continue to bear the brunt of the war. A single attack can not only cause devastating injuries to children, physical and emotionally, but also deprive hundreds of students of the chance to receive a good-quality education. Sometimes, a community’s only place of learning is destroyed., Although education is a top priority for children and parents in crisis, it is all too often the first service to be suspended and one of the last to resume. A Save the Children report published in 2019 for which more than 1,200 children across six crisis-affected countries were interviewed found that nearly one in three children (29%) wanted the chance to go to school above all else., Currently, all schools in Ukraine are closed. However, Save the Children has helped the Ukrainian authorities improve the country’s online learning system so that children like Lev*, 11, still have access to engaging digital learning., Lev now lives in a shelter in Chernivtsi, about 1,000 kilometres from his home in Kharkiv. He has not seen the inside of a classroom since the outbreak of war. Instead, he is continuing his studies online., “I haven’t seen my school in a long time. I wanted to go to school that Thursday (February 24), but I couldn’t,” said Lev, who started online learning two days before the war began., While some children in Ukraine like Lev are keeping up with school through online learning, others have had to put their education on hold, especially those living in areas with active fighting and limited access to internet or devices, and those fleeing the country., “The fact that schools in Ukraine have been bombed and shelled twice as often in the past 100 days than in the seven-year conflict prior to this escalation is utterly despicable,” van Manen continued. “Every attack on a school is an attack on children, just as every war is a war on children.”, The recent fighting has exacerbated an already dire humanitarian situation, especially in the eastern areas of the country. Prior to the escalation of violence, many children in eastern Ukraine were already too scared to attend class and distressed by the presence of armed soldiers in and around their schools., Save the Children is calling on all parties to the conflict to cease attacks on - and threats against - schools, and refrain from any military-related use of educational facilities. The presence of military forces or other armed groups in schools damages facilities, disrupts students’ education and can provoke attacks from opposing forces. Schools must be protected as safe spaces that provide shelter from harm and the opportunity to learn and play., In Ukraine, Save the Children is delivering education kits to keep children learning wherever they can as well as distributing bunker kits with toys and educational tools to children sheltering in railway stations and underground to stay safe from the conflict. The aid organisation is also working with the Ministry of Education and Science, local authorities and partners to establish Digital Learning Centres in shelters across the country. These centres provide safe spaces for children to access devices or use their own to continue learning., With the help of local partners, Save the Children is providing shelter, food, cash, fuel, psychological support, baby and hygiene kits to displaced families. It is on the ground, distributing essential household kits to families affected by the conflict., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering humanitarian aid to children and their families. It is now supporting refugee families across Europe and helping children to get access to the services they need, including education through digital platforms., ENDS, Notes to editor:, - According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science, as of May 28, 1,888 education institutions have suffered bombing and shelling, with 1,708 damaged and 180 (10.5% or one in 10) destroyed. These figures have not been verified by the UN., In eastern Ukraine – where 57% of all school attacks in Ukraine this year have taken place, the number of schools damaged in each area as of May 28 is listed as follows:, Situation Ukraine Refugee Situation (unhcr.org), Education against the Odds: Meeting marginalised children’s demands for a quality education | Save the Children’s Resource Centre, Schools in Ukraine were closed at the start of the conflict, resulting in all children experiencing some form of disruption to their education.

Education site launches for students and teachers shattered by war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Education,25 May 2022,"A new online platform will provide parents, children and teachers with information about education during wartime., An online portal designed to help Ukrainians with questions about education during wartime has been launched by the non-profit Osvitoria., OSVITANOW.ORG, which has been launched in partnership with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, aims to become a hub for parents, teachers and children seeking answers to questions such as how to study abroad or how to enroll a child in kindergarten., “For children affected by crisis, education is critical - providing them with a safe space and a semblance of normality in the most difficult of times. It is estimated that 3.7 million children in Ukraine and abroad are using online and distance learning options . We must ensure creative, multi-faceted, and flexible solutions to reach all children, parents and educators and minimize disruptions to their learning. Together with the Ministry of Education and Science and partners we are doing everything possible to reach Ukrainian children, including supporting online education from Kindergarten through grade 11. By creating this platform we can help to ensure the continuity of children’s learning and support their completion of the school year,” said UNICEF Representative in Ukraine Murat Sahin., The platform also provides lists of schools in Ukraine and abroad, information about higher education, psychosocial support, teaching vacancies and help with obtaining educational documents., ""This platform, created by Osvitoria and UNICEF, is going to be useful for teachers and children who were forcibly displaced within Ukraine or abroad,” added Minister of Education and Science Serhiy Shkarlet. “On the platform, in addition to the educational component, teachers will find a list of professional opportunities and vacancies, as well as an opportunity to ask questions.”, The platform also includes information on wartime labor relations, how to work in temporarily occupied territories and free teaching tools for distance learning., ""We keep saying that education is the strongest weapon,” said Zoya Lytvyn, a Ukrainian educator and head of Osvitoria. “And the main purpose of the educational frontline is not to allow the enemy to leave Ukrainian children without learning. Our portal about education during the war will help all participants in the educational process.”, The platform will be regularly updated and supplemented with expert materials., Media contacts, Olga Pustovit, Communications Consultant, UNICEF Ukraine, Email: opustovit@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/education-site-launches-students-and-teachers-shattered-war-enuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Jun 2022,"Global Day of Parents is celebrated each year on June 1, (MissionNewswire) Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco, joins humanitarian organizations and the international community in celebrating Global Day of Parents, which was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2012. The day, celebrated each year on June 1, honors parents throughout the world and provides an opportunity to appreciate all parents for their commitment to children., In their work in more than 130 countries around the globe, Salesian missionaries provide support to the parents of the children in their programs. Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions, said, “There are many ways Salesian programs support parents. Whether it’s education that we are providing so young single mothers can learn a skill for employment or providing feeding programs to ensure children have at least one meal a day at school or even providing health clinics, Salesians are not only taking care of youth but the whole family.”, In honor of Global Day of Parents, Salesian Missions is proud to share programs around the globe that provide support for parents and their children., UKRAINE, Salesian missionaries have been working in Ukraine providing education and social development services in cities across the country including Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and Lviv. On the eastern front in Dnipro, Salesian Father Oleh Ladnyuk has been military chaplain to Ukrainian troops since 2014, when the Donbas conflict broke out. He also normally travels between villages in the area to offer Salesian youth ministry courses in Greek Catholic parishes. The invasion has changed Fr. Ladnyuk’s work. He is now working on evacuations and providing safety and support to children and families., In the hours immediately following the invasion, Fr. Ladnyuk saw people stunned in the streets, lines of cars in search of fuel and people at ATMs to withdraw as much cash as possible. He heard of the first bombings and saw the first deaths. Then he left once again for Lysychansk, accompanied by Father Igor Opafsky. Everything had already been organized., Fr. Ladnyuk has rescued 12 people including women and Tymofij, just two weeks old. “These are not whole families, but pieces of families that split up. Fathers and mothers ensure their children are safe, then decide to stay behind — at home, under the bombs.”, After the trip, Fr. Ladnyuk returned to Dnipro. There are many people in need there that Salesians can still help. Salesians in Ukraine will continue to provide support to children and families while Salesians around the globe work to provide humanitarian relief to those in need., PAKISTAN, Don Bosco Lahore distributed humanitarian aid to 200 Afghan refugee families in the community of Peshawar, Pakistan, thanks in part to donor funding provided by Salesian Missions. The Salesian community offered shelter and basic necessities to 1,500 people, who are mostly children., Mr. Vincent, who coordinated the distribution, said, “The Christian community of Peshawar has rallied around the value of solidarity. We felt proud that we could selflessly help people of other religions in a spirit of universal brotherhood.”, Salesian centers in Quetta and Lahore offer quality education and an innovative teaching style. More than 1,000 students from disadvantaged families attend Salesian schools. Salesians first started providing education in Pakistan in 1998, and today, their centers are considered some of the best education in the country., SOUTH SUDAN, Salesian missionaries have been working in Gumbo, South Sudan, helping thousands of people over the last several years. Salesians operate a parish, an elementary school for 1,800 students, a high school with 450 students, a technical school, an oratory and a camp for those who have been internally displaced that is home to 9,500 people. Salesians also work in collaboration with the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, who run another elementary school, and the Sisters of Charity of Jesus, who provide a health dispensary., Most recently, the Salesian Missionary Foundation, based in Warsaw, Poland, built a school in Gumbo for poor children in the area. Father Piotr Gozdalski, president of the foundation, said, “In the elementary school, we have 140 students per class. The school was in dire need of new spaces. The four classrooms built are helping to divide the groups and have fewer students per class, which benefits the safety of everyone and the quality of education offered.”, Last year, the Salesian Missionary Foundation also paid for meals for 700 elementary school students and provided food for 700 of the neediest families in the camp. The foundation also supplied the dispensary with medicines and products for hygiene and personal care. Educational sessions were held to encourage the adoption of healthy habits., ITALY, The Salesian Circumscription of Central Italy and the banking institution Intesa Sanpaolo have signed an agreement in support of families with school-age children who attend Salesian schools and vocational training centers in Abruzzo, Lazio, Liguria, Marche, Sardinia, Tuscany, and Umbria., As part of an initiative of the environmental social governance sector of Intesa Sanpaolo, impact loans will provide families with a line of credit of 2,000 or 3,000 euros per year for a period ranging from one to five years., The goal is to help families with financial sustainability while their children are in school.

"Three Months Into Ukraine Crisis, More Than 650 Tons of Medical Aid and $14.7 Million in Direct Financial Assistance Provided",News and Press Release,Direct Relief,Health,1 Jun 2022,"During the first three months of the war, Direct Relief was one of the largest providers of charitable medicines to Ukraine., By Susan Fowler, n the three months since the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces on February 24, 2022, Direct Relief has emerged as one of the largest charitable providers of medical aid to Ukraine, delivering more than 650 tons (1.3 million pounds) of medicines and supplies and providing over $14.7 million in direct financial assistance to other organizations in the region. The cash assistance has included direct payments for refugees to cover prescription medication costs, as well as operating funds for health facilities providing care in Ukraine., As the war continues, Direct Relief is approaching the response along two parallel tracks – support for those experiencing the conflict in Ukraine, and for those fleeing Ukraine to neighboring countries., FINANCIAL SUMMARY, The information included in this report by necessity includes unaudited figures because the organization’s formal audit coincides with its fiscal year, which is from July 1 to June 30. Audited figures for this period will be included when that audit and report are completed., Numbers are as of May 24, 2022, Who donated to the response?, In response to the crisis, Direct Relief received 117,611 Ukraine-designated financial contributions from 91,822 donors totaling $79,624,504 from individuals, foundations, businesses, and organizations located in 79 countries (including Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus as well as all U.S. states and territories)., Note that the number of donors is vastly under-reported, as donations were aggregated by several sources and given in one lump sum (e.g. millions of individuals who play Fortnite contributed to these efforts through in-game purchases and subscriptions, and these were aggregated and donated to Direct Relief by Epic Games)., Of the total amount of Ukraine-designated contributions —, How were the funds used?, Of the total Ukraine-designated cash contributions received to date, Direct Relief has expended or committed $21.1 million to improve the health and lives of people affected by the war., This includes:, Consistent with Direct Relief’s Donation Policy, 100 percent of funds received for specific emergency events are devoted entirely to those events and none of the funds donated for Ukraine have been used for fundraising., (As explained here, all Direct Relief’s fundraising expenses are paid by the Direct Relief Foundation, which uses earnings on previously received bequests to the organization for this purpose and other nonprogrammatic costs.), MEDICAL MATERIAL ASSISTANCE, Direct Relief’s main objective in any large-scale disaster response is to safely and securely deliver emergency medical resources – that are requested, approved by the responsible government authority, and appropriate for the circumstances – where they are most needed, as fast and efficiently as possible., Direct Relief’s support in response to the crisis in Ukraine can be divided into three categories: medical material assistance, direct financial assistance and information assistance., In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Direct Relief began to work with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and its long-term local organizations to determine real-time needs across the country’s health system and to determine and coordinate logistics in order to meet as many needs as possible., In direct response to the expressed needs of the MOH, Direct Relief’s initial emergency shipment consisted of 360 field medic backpacks for first responders dealing with injuries, infections, and other acute medical needs., That donation was immediately followed by a shipment containing specifically requested Combat Application tourniquets, critical care medicines intended for ICU settings, IV fluids, antibiotics, and other urgently needed goods. Subsequent shipments also focused on chronic care and disease-specific medications and supplies that are often forgotten when people leave their homes in haste., Direct Relief has since mobilized and delivered an ongoing series of emergency shipments to healthcare partners in Ukraine with more on the way. The medical product donations originated in locations in the U.S. and Europe as well as within Ukraine itself and are a result of working in partnership with leading pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturers and distributors that stepped up in a historic manner to assist the besieged country., This generosity, as well as in-kind donations from logistics and transportation companies, such as FedEx, enabled Direct Relief to avert what would have been significant costs (and expenditure of donor funds)., Over the past three months, Direct Relief’s close relationships with Ukrainian healthcare facilities and agencies, its strong partnership with corporate donors, and its ability to securely deliver large quantities of medical goods – including temperature-sensitive products that require the use of cold-chain supplies and technologies – have resulted in the organization becoming the main channel for the delivery of medical goods to benefit the people of Ukraine., As of May 31, 2022, Direct Relief’s Ukraine crisis response efforts have resulted in the delivery of over 650 tons of emergency medical goods, with a wholesale value of more than $315 million., This humanitarian assistance was furnished through 76 specific donations to recipient facilities and organizations in three countries for which Direct Relief arranged for and managed the logistics, transport, and physical delivery to where they were most needed throughout the affected regions., In Ukraine, Healthcare facilities and organizations in Ukraine that have received medical goods include:, Supporting Ukrainian Refugees, In the months since Russia invaded Ukraine, 6.4 million of the country’s 44 million residents have fled the country seeking safety and assistance. The rate and scale of this exodus are unprecedented in recent history and have created a refugee crisis in neighboring countries., Direct Relief quickly established contact with the Ministries of Health of Moldova, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia, as well as nonprofits in these countries, in order to provide support for the health-related needs of refugee populations., An initial eight-ton shipment of medical aid was delivered to Moldova’s capital city for distribution to healthcare facilities and shelters, and a shipment of emergency medical kits and family hygiene packs was delivered to the Polish Red Cross., Healthcare facilities and organizations located in surrounding countries that have received emergency shipments of medical material resources to assist Ukrainian refugees include:, Moldova, Ministry of Health, Republic of Moldova, Poland, Polski Czerwony Krzyz (Polish Red Cross), Medical products provided to healthcare facilities, organizations, and agencies included:, Antibiotics– 538,266 bottles and vials, Insulin – 61,148 vials and pens, Diabetes medications – 78,976 bottles, Hypothyroid agents – 347,234 bottles, Asthma inhalers – 61,493, Mental Health medications – 72,034 bottles, Oncology agents – 60,067 bottles and vials, Prenatal Vitamins – 16,200 bottles, Chemical Warfare antidote – 289,336 vials, COVID-19 tests – 99,000, COVID treatment –250,271 courses, Field Medic Backpacks – 682, Field Hospital Content Kits – 7, Wound care bandages and dressings – 3,749,094, Oxygen concentrators – 987, PPE items – 4,524,994 (masks, shields, goggles, gloves), The number of Defined Daily Doses of medicine contained in the shipments totals** 101 million.**, DIRECT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, Thanks to the outpouring of financial support from donors, Direct Relief is providing cash assistance to help facilities and organizations effectively respond to the huge surge of patients at a time when many healthcare facilities have been damaged., Consistent with Direct Relief’s focus on supporting persons who are most vulnerable, financial assistance was directed to groups including the Ukrainian Diabetes Foundation and the Society of Critical Care Medicine., To date, Direct Relief has identified, vetted, and awarded emergency financial support totaling $14.6 million to the following facilities and organizations to help sustain and bolster the provision of health care in Ukraine and to support healthcare services for Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Moldova., INFORMATION ASSISTANCE, In addition to the provision of medical material and financial aid in response to the crisis, Direct Relief has been a critical supplier of information. Working with software company partners, academic institutions, and medical centers, Direct Relief has used crowdsourced data, geospatial analysis, and other data collection and analytics instruments to help understand key issues in the war., Within Ukraine, Direct Relief has focused mainly on assisting with crowdsource data collection on the needs of internally displaced persons, including their origins and destinations, access to key services and goods including health care, food, water, shelter, and livelihoods, and their sentiment in terms of subjective concerns., At the same time, Direct Relief has also collected data on the needs and goods availability of over 950 private pharmacies throughout Ukraine over the past 2.5 months, including many located in areas of significant conflict. The pharmacy data has been incorporated into the cross-validation of MOH needs lists. Important insights were shared with first responders, healthcare partners, and Ukrainian health officials, as well as with United Nations agencies and international assistance organizations to help them determine how to best prioritize and deploy their respective resources., Supporting Ukrainian Refugees, Direct Relief’s principal role in providing information assistance for the refugee crisis in the European Union and Moldova comes through the analysis of human mobility data. Analysis of this data allows for an improved understanding of refugee movements at granular time and space scales for the sake of resource planning and allocation across several different sectors of activity. This analysis has been performed through Direct Relief’s CrisisReady partnership with Harvard University School of Public Health and shared broadly with a range of agencies who have requested specific types and locations of analysis., Key analysis sharing partners include the World Bank, UNICEF, UNHCR, IOM, the Health Cluster, Mercy Corps, and others. In partnership with Meta, Direct Relief is in the process of assembling an EU-based research network that is capable of supporting municipal level analyses, with the immediate focal point of that effort being support for a collaboration between UNHCR and the city government of Budapest which aims to understand changes in refugee clustering throughout the city for the sake of housing retrofits for long-term refugees., CORPORATE SUPPORT, Direct Relief’s ability to furnish a large portion of the extensive medical material support without the expenditure of donor funds was due to the in-kind donations from healthcare manufacturers and distributors, many of which Direct Relief works with on an ongoing basis., Healthcare company donors responded expansively to requests for their participation. Included among them are 3M, Abbott, AbbVie, Accord Healthcare, Ajanta Pharma, Alvogen, Amgen, Apotex, AstraZeneca, Baxter International, Bayer, Becton Dickerson, Boehringer Ingelheim Cares, Covidien, Eli Lilly & Company, GSK, Hikma, ICU Medical, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, LifeScan, McKesson Medical-Surgical, Medtronic, Merck & Co., Merck KGaA, MSD, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Sanofi, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Unilever, and Viatris., In addition, the State of California Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) donated seven Field Hospital Content Kits. Each kit contains the equipment needed to set up a 50-bed field hospital, and the hospitals have been deployed to high conflict areas., LOOKING FORWARD, Direct Relief will maintain its commitment to bolster and sustain existing healthcare organizations and systems in Ukraine as well as support the healthcare workers that run them, by ensuring the flow of medical materials, funding, and information., Direct Relief was able to provide the assistance detailed in this report as a result of its existing strong relationships with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and non-governmental organizations that were already receiving Direct Relief medical product shipments, ongoing work with clinical experts in the field to guide distribution and procurement decisions, existing partnerships and contracts in place to quickly request and receive high-quality medications from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, and strong track record of shipping large volumes of product, including those requiring cold chain packaging and storage, to difficult-to-access places to reach the most vulnerable patients., Direct Relief will continue to provide assistance to the Ukrainian people, both those who remain in Ukraine as well as those who have fled the country and may be unable to return for years to come.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/three-months-ukraine-crisis-more-650-tons-medical-aid-and-147-million-direct-financial-assistance-provided

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (21-27 May 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jun 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued into its fourth month. In Russia, state authorities tightened security in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine and introduced measures to encourage military enlistment. In Tajikistan, the government cracked down on demonstrations against local authorities in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO). Demonstrations in support of Ukraine, the LGBT+ community, and against climate change continued across the region. Demonstrations marking the second anniversary of George Floyd’s death on 25 May were recorded in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, fighting continued on the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued to center on the eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv last week. Half of all political violence recorded last week occurred in the Donetsk region, where Russian and Russian-led forces claimed advancements in the Lyman area. With the Luhansk region almost entirely occupied by Russia, Russian forces continued their attempts to encircle Severodonetsk and cut off Ukrainian forces in the city (ISW, 6 May 2022; The Washington Post, 29 May 2022)., Dozens of civilians1 were reportedly killed by Russian shelling and airstrikes in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. On 26 May, Russian forces fired multiple rockets at civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, reportedly killing nine civilians and injuring 19 (BBC, 26 May 2022). Additionally, Russian forces continued to abduct civilians, including government officials and their family members, from occupied territories in the Zaporizhia, Kherson, and Kharkiv regions. The Russian military also forcibly deported hundreds of civilians from the Donetsk region to Russia (24 Channel, 22 May 2022)., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine took place in** Belarus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, and Sweden **last week., In Russia, authorities of the Belgorod border region introduced new security measures, banning entry to several villages in the border area due to shelling of the region in recent weeks (Kommersant, 26 May 2022). Authorities in several Russian regions announced voluntary recruitment drives to fight in Ukraine (RFE/RL, 25 May 2022). Meanwhile, human rights organizations report that Chechen authorities abducted and tortured dozens of young men, forcing them to join the Russian armed forces in Ukraine as contracted soldiers (RFE/RL, 25 May 2022)., In Tajikistan, the government continued its crackdown against organizers and participants of demonstrations against local authorities in the GBAO last week. In the Rushan district of the GBAO, 46 demonstrators were arrested on charges of membership in “criminal and extremist-terrorist groups” (RFE/RL, 24 May 2022). In Khorugh, an unidentified armed group killed one of the demonstration organizers, who was also an informal leader of the region (RFE/RL, 22 May 2022). Demonstrations first broke out in the GBAO during the week prior after local officials rejected requests calling for their resignation over, among other things, the failure to investigate the death of a local resident during an arrest in November 2021., LGBT+ pride marches and demonstrations in solidarity with the LGBT+ community continued across Europe last week, including in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Latvia, hundreds of people demanded the adoption of a draft law on civil unions, which will allow the registration of same-sex partnerships in the country (Diena, 26 May 2022). In the United Kingdom, transgender rights activists marched through Hereford to demand that a government proposal for a ban on gay and bisexual conversion therapy be extended to cover transgender people (Hereford Times, 24 May 2022)., Anti-racism protests were recorded across the United Kingdom last week, including some marking the second anniversary of the police killing of George Floyd on 25 May. Black Lives Matter supporters organized demonstrations in Nottingham and several neighborhoods in London. Elsewhere, anti-racism campaigners held a protest against institutional racism in the Scottish police force outside the Capital House in Edinburgh to coincide with an inquiry into the 2015 death of Sheku Bayoh during a police arrest (The National, 24 May 2022)., Meanwhile, environmental and climate activists demonstrated across Europe last week, demanding more climate action and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. Demonstration activity was recorded in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, **the United Kingdom, Sweden, Romania, Finland, **and **Denmark. **In Switzerland, the World Economic Forum, held in Davos between 22 and 26 May, brought climate and social activists to the streets in Davos and the surrounding region. In the Netherlands, Extinction Rebellion activists demonstrated at several locations in and around Rotterdam as part of their anti-fossil fuel industry initiative. Amid the demonstrations, Dutch authorities arrested 175 activists (NRC, 24 May 2022)., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued last week, including in the Shahumyan province. These trends contribute to the 175% increase in violence in Shahumyan last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in Shahumyan in the past month. While claimed by the de facto state of Artsakh, Shahumyan is controlled almost entirely by Azerbaijan following gains in the war of 2020.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-21-27-may-2022
Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 31 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jun 2022,"Date: 1 June 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 31 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 9,094 civilian casualties in the country: 4,149 killed and 4,945 injured. This included:, a total of 4,149 killed (1,569 men, 1,034 women, 98 girls, and 100 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,279 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 4,945 injured (986 men, 671 women, 115 girls, and 140 boys, as well as 168 children and 2,865 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 5,196 casualties (2,371 killed and 2,825 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 4,467 casualties (2,225 killed and 2,242 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 729 casualties (146 killed and 583 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,898 casualties (1,778 killed and 2,120 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 30 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 31 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 31 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-31-may-2022-enruuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Jun 2022,"Witnessing the impact of a humanitarian disaster is always profoundly challenging. But seeing so many older people affected in what is the world’s ‘oldest’ crisis is particularly confronting., In a country where one quarter of the population is over 60-years-old, it is not surprising that there are so many older people needing support. What is striking though, is the way so many older people are themselves caring for others, their families and friends, as well as those they have only recently met: thrust together as a result of war., For those who do need our support, there is a lot to do. Three months after full-scale war began, it is important that the global humanitarian response looks at how it can better prioritise the specific needs of older people., There are those who remain in their homes in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting has recently intensified. For many, leaving is not an option because of mobility difficulties or a lack of money. For others, their strong sense of belonging means that leaving the familiarity of home to go into the unknown is not a choice they feel they can make., At the same time, many others have fled their homes, particularly over recent weeks. Dnipro is the first city of sanctuary for those fleeing the Donbas region or other stricken areas, like Mariupol. Consequently, there are huge numbers in need of support, and significant help required., Many care homes for older people and those with disabilities in eastern Ukraine have evacuated their residents to Dnipro. Public buildings have been adapted to provide shelter to internally displaced people, such as a church that now runs a soup kitchen and has a dormitory to shelter people upstairs. People across the city and beyond are opening their doors to others., But the story doesn’t end there., Many of the newly arrived older people I met in Dnipro are deeply traumatised. People have often endured shelling, sometimes spending long periods underground, often with little or no food and water. People’s journeys to Dnipro were commonly long and difficult and for many the isolation and the sense of separation has impacted them profoundly., The pain and suffering I encountered was noticeably raw. Many older people burst into tears as they began telling me what had happened to them. Most told me they had only left when things had become absolutely untenable., The lack of medical supplies came up in many of my conversations with older people. Most often, this is regular medication for everyday health conditions, like heart problems and hypertension. But the lack of supplies and high costs mean people are running out. Many with diabetes do not have insulin., The local charities I visited in Dnipro and Kharkiv were stretched before February, struggling to provide for people’s needs. Now they are stretched even further., The small community group, ‘Mercy in Dnipro Oblast’ was set up by people who were displaced from the Donbas region in 2014. They have now moved longer-term residents upstairs to make way for new arrivals. One area is designated for those from Mariupol, a common approach in centres so people from the same area are together. But the increasing need means that rooms are often crammed full., Despite the tragic circumstances, I will never forget the resilience, humour and comradery shown as we regularly made our way to the air raid shelters in the middle of the night., Nor will I forget the love and care shown by those affected not only for one another but also for their pets. These pets have not been abandoned, but taken with them on these journeys, and will stay by their side, whatever challenges this war should bring., We will work alongside our partners, supporting care homes and older displaced people. This includes providing food and hygiene supplies, bathroom facilities and beds, emotional support and care so they can lead more dignified lives. This is part of a wider response to support older people, including refugees in Moldova and those who remain in eastern Ukraine., We will also continue to amplify the voices of older people caught up in the war in Ukraine, so their experiences, challenges and needs are not forgotten.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dnipro-love-resilience-hardship-and-tragedy

Protection and Human Rights",1 Jun 2022,"Desde el 24 de febrero, al menos 262 niños y niñas han muerto y 415 han resultado heridos en los ataques, NUEVA YORK/GINEBRA/KYIV, 1 de junio de 2022 – Casi 100 días de guerra en Ucrania han tenido consecuencias devastadoras para la infancia a una escala y una velocidad que no se veían desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial, según ha declarado hoy UNICEF. Tres millones de niños y niñas que se encuentran en Ucrania y más de 2,2 millones que se han marchado a los países que están acogiendo a los refugiados necesitan asistencia humanitaria. Casi dos de cada tres niños y niñas se han desplazado a causa del conflicto., Según los informes verificados por la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de las Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos (ACNUDH), un promedio de más de dos niños y niñas mueren y más de cuatro resultan heridos cada día en Ucrania, la mayoría en ataques con armas explosivas en zonas pobladas. Además, la infraestructura civil de la que dependen los niños y las niñas sigue sufriendo daños o ha sido destruida; hasta el momento, esto incluye un mínimo de 256 instalaciones de salud y una de cada seis “escuelas seguras” establecidas con ayuda de UNICEF en el este del país. Cientos de otras escuelas del país también han resultado dañadas. En el este y el sur de Ucrania, donde el conflicto se ha intensificado, las condiciones de los niños y las niñas son cada vez más desesperadas., “El 1 de junio es el Día Internacional para la Protección de la Infancia en Ucrania y en toda la región”, afirmó Catherine Russell, Directora Ejecutiva de UNICEF. “En lugar de celebrar esta ocasión, nos acercamos solemnemente al 3 de junio, el 100º día de una guerra que ha destrozado la vida de millones de niños y niñas. Si no se declara urgentemente un alto el fuego ni se negocia la paz, los niños y las niñas seguirán sufriendo y las consecuencias de la guerra afectarán a los más vulnerables del mundo”., UNICEF también advierte que la guerra ha provocado una grave crisis de protección de la infancia. Los niños y las niñas que huyen de la violencia corren un elevado riesgo de separarse de sus familias y ser víctimas de la violencia, el abuso, la explotación sexual y la trata, y la mayoría han presenciado acontecimientos traumáticos. Estos niños y niñas necesitan urgentemente seguridad, estabilidad, servicios de protección de la infancia y apoyo psicosocial, especialmente los que no van acompañados o han tenido que separarse de sus familias. Por encima de todo, necesitan paz., Al mismo tiempo, la guerra y los desplazamientos masivos están arruinando los medios de subsistencia y las oportunidades económicas de la población. Como consecuencia, muchas familias no cuentan con ingresos suficientes para satisfacer sus necesidades básicas y no pueden proporcionar un apoyo adecuado a sus hijos., UNICEF mantiene su llamamiento a un alto el fuego inmediato en Ucrania y pide que se proteja a todos los niños y niñas de cualquier peligro. Para ello, es necesario poner fin al uso de armas explosivas en zonas pobladas y a los ataques a la infraestructura civil. Asimismo, UNICEF pide un acceso humanitario sin restricciones que le permita llegar a todos los niños y niñas que lo necesitan de forma rápida y segura, sin importar dónde estén., UNICEF y sus aliados trabajan en el terreno en Ucrania y en los países vecinos para prestar asistencia humanitaria a los niños, las niñas y sus familias, mediante, entre otros, servicios de protección de la infancia, agua y saneamiento, salud, nutrición y educación., En Ucrania, UNICEF y sus aliados han distribuido suministros médicos y sanitarios que salvan vidas para casi 2,1 millones de personas en zonas afectadas por la guerra; han facilitado el acceso al agua potable a más de 2,1 millones de personas que viven en zonas donde las infraestructuras están dañadas o destrozadas; han brindado apoyo psicosocial y atención de la salud mental a más de 610.000 niños, niñas y cuidadores; y han proporcionado materiales de aprendizaje a casi 290.000 niños y niñas. Además, cerca de 300.000 familias vulnerables se han inscrito en un programa humanitario de asistencia en efectivo impulsado por UNICEF y el Ministerio de Política Social., En los países que acogen a los refugiados, UNICEF apoya los sistemas nacionales, municipales y locales que prestan servicios esenciales y ofrecen protección, especialmente para los niños y niñas más vulnerables. Entre ellos cabe destacar la capacitación contra la trata de personas para la guardia fronteriza; la ampliación de las oportunidades de aprendizaje y la integración de los niños y las niñas refugiados en las escuelas; la adquisición de vacunas y suministros médicos; y la creación de centros de juego y aprendizaje que proporcionan a los niños y las niñas la sensación de normalidad y respiro que tanto necesitan. Asimismo, UNICEF y ACNUR han establecido 25 puntos azules (espacios seguros que permiten a las familias en tránsito hacer una parada para recibir ayuda y servicios) a lo largo de las principales rutas migratorias de Moldova, Rumania, Polonia, Italia, Bulgaria y Eslovaquia. En Moldova, un programa de asistencia en efectivo con fines múltiples, creado por UNICEF y ACNUR, ha beneficiado a más de 52.000 refugiados, la mayoría en hogares encabezados por mujeres., UNICEF ha hecho un llamamiento de financiación de 624,2 millones de dólares para fortalecer su respuesta humanitaria dentro de Ucrania, y 324,7 millones que destinará a su respuesta en los países de acogida de refugiados., Notas a los editores:, Materiales multimedia disponibles aquí: https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4080ZGVFH, Para obtener más información sobre la labor de UNICEF en Ucrania, sírvase visitar este enlace: https://uni.cf/guerra-ucrania, Contactos de prensa, Marixie Mercado, UNICEF Geneva, Teléfono: +41 79 559 7172, Correo electrónico: mmercado@unicef.org, Christopher Tidey, UNICEF Nueva York, Teléfono: +1 917 340 3017, Correo electrónico: ctidey@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/despues-de-100-dias-de-guerra-en-ucrania-52-millones-de-ninos-y-ninas-necesitan-asistencia-humanitaria

Protection and Human Rights",1 Jun 2022,"Au moins 262 enfants ont été tués et 415 blessés lors d’attaques perpétrées depuis le 24 février, NEW YORK/GENÈVE/KYÏV, le 1er juin 2022 – La guerre en Ukraine, qui a débuté il y a maintenant près de 100 jours, fait payer un lourd tribut aux enfants, semant la dévastation à une échelle et à une vitesse sans précédent depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale, a déclaré l’UNICEF aujourd’hui. Trois millions d’enfants en Ukraine et plus de 2,2 millions d’enfants supplémentaires réfugiés dans les pays d’accueil ont actuellement besoin d’une aide humanitaire. Près de deux enfants sur trois ont été déplacés en raison des combats., D’après les signalements vérifiés par le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l’homme, l’Ukraine déplore en moyenne chaque jour plus de deux enfants tués et plus de quatre blessés, principalement lors d’attaques à l’arme explosive dans des zones habitées. Les infrastructures civiles dont dépendent les enfants continuent d’être endommagées ou détruites, dont, à ce jour, au moins 256 centres de santé et une des six écoles relevant du programme sur la sécurité dans les écoles soutenu par l’UNICEF dans l’est du pays. À ce bilan s’ajoutent des centaines d’établissements scolaires endommagés ailleurs sur le territoire. La situation des enfants est en outre de plus en plus préoccupante dans l’est et le sud de l’Ukraine, où les combats s’intensifient., « Le 1er juin, date de la Journée internationale de l’enfance, ne sera pas placé sous le signe de la célébration en Ukraine et dans la région, alors que le 3 juin marquera le 100e jour d’une guerre qui a brisé la vie de millions d’enfants », a déclaré Catherine Russell, Directrice générale de l’UNICEF. « Sans cessez-le-feu immédiat et pourparlers de paix, les enfants d’Ukraine continueront de souffrir – tout comme les enfants vulnérables du monde entier qui pâtiront des retombées négatives de la guerre. », Cette guerre a provoqué une grave crise en matière de protection de l’enfance, avertit l’UNICEF. En effet, les enfants en fuite courent un risque élevé d’être séparés de leur famille et d’être victimes de violence, de maltraitance, d’exploitation sexuelle et de traite des êtres humains. La plupart d’entre eux ont vécu des événements profondément traumatisants. Si ces enfants, en particulier ceux qui ne sont pas accompagnés ou qui ont été séparés de leur famille, ont un besoin immédiat de sécurité, de stabilité, de services de protection de l’enfance et de soins psychosociaux, ils ont par-dessus tout besoin de paix., Dans le même temps, la guerre et les déplacements de masse sont en train d’anéantir les moyens de subsistance et les possibilités économiques de nombreuses familles, qui n’ont plus un revenu suffisant pour satisfaire aux besoins élémentaires de leurs enfants et ne sont pas en mesure de leur offrir un soutien approprié., L’UNICEF continue d’appeler à un cessez-le-feu immédiat en Ukraine et à la protection de tous les enfants, notamment contre l’utilisation d’armes explosives dans les zones habitées et contre les attaques visant les infrastructures civiles. L’organisation demande également qu’un plein accès humanitaire soit garanti afin d’apporter une aide rapide et sûre aux enfants dans le besoin, où qu’ils se trouvent., L’UNICEF et ses partenaires œuvrent sur le terrain, en Ukraine et dans les pays voisins, pour fournir aux enfants et aux familles des services de protection de l’enfance, d’approvisionnement en eau et d’assainissement, de santé, de nutrition et d’éducation, entre autres interventions humanitaires., En Ukraine, l’UNICEF et ses partenaires ont distribué des produits de santé et des fournitures médicales d’importance vitale à près de 2,1 millions de personnes dans les zones sinistrées ; assuré un accès à de l’eau potable à plus de 2,1 millions de personnes vivant dans les zones où les réseaux ont été endommagés ou détruits ; offert des services de santé mentale et de soutien psychosocial à plus de 610 000 enfants et personnes ayant la charge d’enfants ; et fait parvenir des fournitures scolaires à quelque 290 000 enfants. En outre, près de 300 000 familles ont pu s’inscrire au programme humanitaire d’aide en espèces mis en place par l’UNICEF et le Ministère ukrainien de la politique sociale., Dans les pays d’accueil des réfugiés, l’UNICEF soutient les systèmes nationaux, municipaux et locaux qui assurent des services essentiels et veillent à la protection des enfants, en particulier des plus vulnérables. Cette démarche comprend une formation de lutte contre la traite des êtres humains à l’intention des gardes-frontières ; l’élargissement des possibilités d’apprentissage pour les enfants réfugiés et leur intégration dans les écoles ; l’achat de vaccins et de fournitures médicales ; et l’installation de centres permettant aux jeunes enfants de jouer et d’apprendre tout en retrouvant un semblant de normalité et d’apaisement. Vingt-cinq centres « Point bleu » coordonnés par l’UNICEF et le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR) ont ouvert leurs portes en Bulgarie, en Italie, en République de Moldova, en Pologne, en Roumanie et en Slovaquie. Ces centres d’accueil multiservices proposent un soutien aux familles le long des routes de migration les plus empruntées. En République de Moldova, plus de 52 000 réfugiés, principalement des familles dirigées par des femmes, ont bénéficié d’un programme d’aide en espèces à usages multiples mené conjointement par l’UNICEF et le HCR., L’UNICEF a lancé un appel de 624,2 millions de dollars des États-Unis pour soutenir son action humanitaire en Ukraine et un appel de 324,7 millions de dollars É.-U. au titre de son intervention dans les pays d’accueil des réfugiés., Note aux rédactions :, Ressources multimédia disponibles ici : https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4080ZGVFH, Pour en savoir plus sur l’action de l’UNICEF en Ukraine, veuillez consulter : Guerre en Ukraine : soutenir les enfants et les familles, Contacts presse, Marixie Mercado, UNICEF Geneva, Tél: +41 79 559 7172, Adresse électronique: mmercado@unicef.org, Christopher Tidey, UNICEF New York, Tél: +1 917 340 3017, Adresse électronique: ctidey@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/apres-100-jours-de-guerre-en-ukraine-52-millions-denfants-ont-besoin-dune-aide-humanitaire
One hundred days of war in Ukraine have left 5.2 million children in need of humanitarian assistance [EN/AR],News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",1 Jun 2022,"At least 262 children have been killed and 415 injured in attacks since 24 February, NEW YORK/GENEVA/KYIV, 1 June 2022 – Nearly 100 days of war in Ukraine have wrought devastating consequences for children at a scale and speed not seen since World War II, UNICEF said today. Three million children inside Ukraine and over 2.2 million children in refugee-hosting countries are now in need of humanitarian assistance. Almost two out of every three children have been displaced by fighting., Based on reports verified by OHCHR, on average more than two children are killed and more than four injured each day in Ukraine – mostly in attacks using explosive weapons in populated areas. Civilian infrastructure on which children depend continues to be damaged or destroyed; this so far includes at least 256 health facilities and one in six UNICEF-supported ‘Safe Schools’ in the country’s east. Hundreds of other schools across the country have also been damaged. Conditions for children in eastern and southern Ukraine where fighting has intensified are increasingly desperate., “June 1st is International Day for the Protection of Children in Ukraine and across the region,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Instead of celebrating the occasion, we are solemnly approaching June 3 – the 100th day of a war that has shattered the lives of millions of children. Without an urgent ceasefire and negotiated peace, children will continue to suffer – and fallout from the war will impact vulnerable children around the world.”, UNICEF is also warning that the war has caused an acute child protection crisis. Children fleeing violence are at significant risk of family separation, violence, abuse, sexual exploitation, and trafficking. Most have been exposed to deeply traumatic events. These children urgently need safety, stability, child protection services, and psychosocial support – especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families. More than anything, they need peace., At the same time, the war and mass displacement are devastating livelihoods and economic opportunities, leaving many families without sufficient income to meet basic needs and unable to provide adequate support for their children., UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and to protect all children from harm. This includes ending the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and attacks on civilian infrastructure. UNICEF is appealing for full humanitarian access to safely and quickly reach children in need wherever they may be., UNICEF and its partners are on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, working to provide children and their families with humanitarian assistance, including child protection, water and sanitation, health, nutrition and education services., In Ukraine, UNICEF and partners have distributed life-saving health and medical supplies for nearly 2.1 million people in war-affected areas; enabled access to safe water for over 2.1 million people living in areas where networks have been damaged or destroyed; reached over 610,000 children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support; and provided learning supplies to nearly 290,000 children. Almost 300,000 vulnerable families have registered for a UNICEF-Ministry of Social Policy humanitarian cash assistance programme., In refugee-hosting countries, UNICEF supports national, municipal and local systems that deliver essential services and protection, particularly for the most vulnerable children. This includes anti-trafficking training for border guards; expanding learning opportunities and integrating refugee children into schools; procuring vaccines and medical supplies; and establishing play and learning hubs that provide young children with a much-needed sense of normalcy and respite. Twenty-five UNICEF-UNHCR Blue Dots – one-stop safe havens that provide support and services for families on the move, have been established along major transit routes in Moldova, Romania, Poland, Italy, Bulgaria and Slovakia. In Moldova, over 52,000 refugees, mostly in female-headed households, have been reached through a UNICEF-UNHCR multi-purpose cash assistance programme., UNICEF has issued a US $624.2M appeal for funds to support its humanitarian response inside Ukraine and a US $324.7M appeal for its response in refugee-hosting countries., Notes to editors:, Multimedia materials available here: https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4080ZGVFH, Find out more about UNICEF's work in Ukraine here: www.unicef.org/ukraineconflict, Media contacts, Marixie Mercado

Update 78 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (31 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,31 May 2022,"An expert mission sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is this week carrying out nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities at Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The mission – the IAEA’s second to the Chornobyl NPP in the past six weeks – is part of efforts to help ensure nuclear safety and security in the country during the current military conflict. Ukraine, which also has four operating NPPs with a total of 15 reactors, has requested the IAEA’s technical assistance in this regard., During their three-day stay at the Chornobyl NPP and the Exclusion Zone around the facility, the team of IAEA specialists will provide support on radiation protection, safety of waste management and nuclear security, Director General Grossi said. They will also conduct verification activities at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located following the 1986 accident, he added., One of the team’s priorities is to provide technical advice on re-establishing the automated radiation monitoring system in the Chornobyl NPP’s Exclusion Zone, which was interrupted early in the conflict and has not been providing such monitoring data since 24 February. The experts will also assess the status of the facilities at the site and provide training on radiation monitoring equipment delivered by the IAEA in April., In addition, IAEA inspectors and technicians will verify declared nuclear material and activities and confirm the functioning of remote safeguards data transmission from the Chornobyl NPP to IAEA headquarters which was re-established last month., Director General Grossi personally led two previous safety, security and safeguards missions to Ukraine, travelling to the South Ukraine NPP in late March and to Chornobyl about a month later. The current mission consists of a team of seven IAEA experts., The Director General is now also continuing his efforts to organize an IAEA mission to Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, to carry out important nuclear safety, security and safeguards activities at this site in the country’s south., Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s operational reactors, Ukraine said eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, IAEA headquarters is continuing to receive remote safeguards data from the Chornobyl NPP as well as from the four operational plants in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-78-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-31-may-2022

Between 17 and 23 May, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted the fifth round of a rapid representative assessment of the general population in Ukraine to gather insights into internal displacement and mobility flows, and to assess local needs. This general population survey serves as a preliminary source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war-affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula.
The general population survey was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,001 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. For further notes on method and limitations, including IOM’s definition of internally displaced persons used for the purpose of this assessment, see page 11. In addition to this General Population Survey, data on recorded IDP presence at hromada level in Ukraine are available from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix – Baseline Assessment (Round 3, May 15 2022, HDX – registration required).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-5-23-may-2022-enuk

Protection and Human Rights",31 May 2022,"Kyiv (ICRC) – A video filmed in our Mariupol office now circulating in some media is filled with false claims and baseless assumptions about the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)., One of the ICRC's main objectives is to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in armed conflict. Given this, a core ICRC programme is to increase awareness on the risks caused by mines and other explosive remnants of war, as well as to provide support to local authorities who mark hazardous areas and remove such weapons. In order to properly identify and dispose of unexploded ordnance, the ICRC prints and distributes manuals to explain the threat such weapons pose to civilians living in contaminated areas., These ICRC manuals are not confidential. In fact, our reference material is publicly available online in multiple languages. Another manual that appears in the video is commonly used by teams working to neutralize dangerous items to avoid accidents., The ICRC also runs programmes to help people become more financially self-sustainable in the face of economic challenges due to armed conflict. We have in recent years distributed incubators as part of our agro-economic programs, to help families raise poultry, in full transparency with the authorities. Any suggestion that these incubators would be used for anything else is preposterous., The video also alleges that the ICRC has a stack of medical records of children. The ICRC has not collected any such records. The video also insinuates that the ICRC is involved in organ trafficking. This is another unequivocally false allegation., The ICRC's goals are purely humanitarian in nature. We face challenges operating in areas affected by armed conflict, yes, but our work is designed to alleviate suffering, nothing more. We have faith that most people will recognize false and hasty claims when they see them,"" said Jason Straziuso, an ICRC spokesman., The ICRC carries out its activities in full transparency with the authorities., For more information please contact:, press@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-online-video-mariupol-filled-false-claims-enru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 May 2022,"Statement by Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council:, “I am horrified to see Severodonetsk, the thriving city where we had our operational headquarters, become the epicentre of yet another chapter of the brutal war in Ukraine. We fear that up to 12,000 civilians remain caught in crossfire in the city, without sufficient access to water, food, medicine or electricity. The near-constant bombardment is forcing civilians to seek refuge in bomb shelters and basements, with only few precious opportunities for those trying to escape., “Working with local partners, we have provided thousands of monthly food and hygiene parcels to civilians remaining in Severodonetsk and the wider Luhansk region in the past week. But now the intensified fighting makes aid delivery impossible., “We cannot save lives under the hail of grenades., “We call on parties to the conflict to immediately allow all humanitarian organisations to access Severodonetsk with lifesaving assistance and to enable safe evacuations of civilians who wish to leave the city., “I visited Severodonetsk just weeks before the escalation of the war in February. Back then, I witnessed positive changes in the area, which our team and partners had worked tirelessly to achieve since 2014. We were rebuilding villages and helping the displaced families to start over. This progress now lies in ruins. The elderly pensioners I met in cut-off villages were devastated by the past eight years of insecurity and shelling. It is unimaginable that they have to endure this nightmare of modern warfare all over again., “Almost one hundred days since the war in Ukraine escalated, we have seen bombs destroy critical infrastructure across the country and reduce entire cities like Severodonetsk to rubble. More than 14 million men, women and children are displaced within Ukraine or sheltering in other countries with no idea when they will be able to safely return to their homes.”, Facts and figures:, NRC has been operational in Ukraine since 2014, serving people affected by conflict in Luhansk and Donetsk regions., NRC Ukraine had 84 national and three international staff members at the end of 2021. Before February 2022, most of NRC Ukraine’s staff were based in Severodonetsk., About 800,000 people were displaced by the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014, while thousands of vulnerable pensioners remained in remote villages near the frontline in Donbas with minimal access to essential services., NRC reopened its Ukraine Country Office in Kyiv in May 2022. Since the war escalated, NRC has also opened two field offices in Dnipro and Ternopil and a larger area office in Lviv. Together with our local partners, we delivered 3,300 monthly food parcels in the Luhansk region, including Severodonetsk, in April 2022. In May 2022, we delivered 480 hygiene kits together with 480 monthly food parcels in the Luhansk region, including Severodonetsk. In western Ukraine, NRC is also scaling up, focusing on supporting internally displaced people through legal aid, shelter materials, cash assistance and support provided to communal shelters. In early 2022, NRC launched its country programmes in Poland, Romania and Moldova to support refugees seeking safety in the neighbouring countries.

Joint Statement on environmental crimes in Ukraine,News and Press Release,APHR,Climate Change and Environment,30 May 2022,"The Russian military invasion of Ukraine is soon passing its fourth month. During this time, we have witnessed appalling violations of humanitarian law, international law and the international order. This invasion has come with not only grave humanitarian consequences but also long-term environmental costs., Since the start of the invasion, we have witnessed a range of reports on the attacks on civilian infrastructure, such as water, energy, industry and transport, some of them likely to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment. Many of these attacks appear to have lacked a definite military target, and may thus violate the laws of war. Academic researchers and civil society have highlighted the environmental destruction in Ukraine, as demonstrated in the joint statement to the UN Environmental Assembly and the open letter from Environmental Peacebuilding Association with co-signees. Criminal accountability for Russia’s actions is now being investigated by the Ukrainian Prosecutor, by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and multiple national prosecution offices under the principle of universal jurisdiction., We, the members of Ecocide Alliance, an international parliamentary alliance for the recognition of ecocide, are dedicated to building peace through protecting ecosystems and biological diversity. We strongly maintain that environmental security is a precondition to ensuring national and international security., However, pursuing individual criminal responsibility for environmental atrocities has been largely ignored and under-prosecuted at both the national and international level. For instance, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) has never prosecuted war crimes under Article 8(2)(b)(iv) of the Rome Statute, which explicitly protects the natural environment. Nor has the OTP pursued crimes against humanity allegations in the context of mass environmental harm, relating to countries such as Cambodia or Brazil. This is, despite the fact that the OTP issued their Policy paper on case selection and prioritisation in 2016, undertaking to prioritise such cases., Therefore, we call on the international community to: support local efforts to monitor environmental damage (e.g. Ecoaction, or other agencies); set up mechanisms to collect and share data, which could serve as evidence in potential cases concerning environmental crimes; and support organisations to analyse and build criminal cases based on such data, such as the Climate Counsel., Ukraine is one of many countries where armed conflicts are destroying the natural environment in a severe and widespread manner. The horrific invasion of Ukraine serves as a pivotal moment when international and national institutions have the opportunity to address international crimes associated with environmental destruction., The most effective way to enforce criminal accountability long-term, however, is to amend the Rome Statute to explicitly include ecocide as a fifth crime against peace – not limited only to war time. This would enable the ICC and national justice systems to address the most serious environmental crimes and to reduce one of the roots of conflicts, namely, the scarcity and inequitable distribution of natural resources following exploitative land-grabbing. Now, if ever, would be the time for the international community to finally draw a global moral red line concerning environmental atrocities, and put an end to impunity for ecocide., Signatories:, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights and Ecocide Alliance, along with the following Members of Parliament:, Rodrigo AGOSTINHO, deputy at the Federal Assembly (Câmara Federal), Brazil, Alejandro AGUILERA, Deputy of the National Assembly, Venezuela, Alexandra ATTALIDES, Member of the House of Representatives, Cyprus, Natalie BENNETT, Member of the House of Lords, United Kingdom, Saskia BRICMONT, Member of the European Parliament (Belgium), Samuel COGOLATI, Federal Deputy, Belgium, Eufemia CULLAMAT, Member of the House of Representatives, Philippines, Rosa D’AMATO, Member of the European Parliament (Italy), Eleonora EVI, Member of the European Parliament (Italy), Leah GAZAN, Member of Parliament, Canada, Simon HOLMSTRÖM, member of the Åland parliament, Finland, Andrés Ingi JÓNSSON, Member of Alþingi, Iceland, Rebecka LE MOINE, Member of Parliament, Sweden, Monica LENNON, Member of the Scottish Parliament, Scotland, Caroline LUCAS, Member of the Parliament, United Kingdom, Raphaël MAHAIM, Member of the Parliament of the canton of Vaud, Switzerland, Elizabeth MAY, Member of Parliament, Canada, Patrick McHEFFEY, Trustee, Patchogue, New York, USA, Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN, Member of the European Parliament (Finland), Josep PUIG I BOIX, Member of the Catalan Parliament, Spain, Janet RICE, Senator, Australia, Caroline ROOSE, Member of the European Parliament (France), Inés SABANÉS, Deputy, Spain, Lindsey SCHROMEN-WAWRIN, City Councilmember, Port Angeles, Washington State, USA, Marie TOUSSAINT, Member of the European Parliament (France), Lammert VAN RAAN, Member of Parliament, Netherlands, Larissa WATERS, Senator, Australia, Susanne ZIMMER, Member of Parliament, Denmark",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-environmental-crimes-ukraine

There have been reports of critical shortages of medicines, harassment from Russian Federation troops, disappearances and violence against those who remain in the region, and convoys of cars have been blocked for days at a time and occasionally fired upon. Following a Russian Federation airstrike on residential areas and privately owned businesses on 24 May, the mayor of Kramatorsk, Oleksandr Honcharenko, urged residents not to return to the city., Meanwhile, on 25 May, Russian Federation forces launched four cruise missiles on the city of Zaporizhzhia, reportedly killing one person, injuring three others, and damaging 62 buildings in residential areas. That same day, three missiles were fired at Kryvyi Rih, resulting in severe damage to an industrial enterprise, with casualties still being confirmed.
OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 24 May, there have been 8,628 civilian casualties, including 3,974 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA). Although civilians in conflict-affected areas remain in dire need of basic goods and social services, ongoing fighting continues to deter evacuations., During a meeting with media representatives on 21 May, Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy reported that 22 million tons of grain could not be exported as a result of Russian Federation troops blocking Ukrainian ports. President Zelenskyy also stated that if the routes cannot be unblocked, there will be a food crisis around the world, a statement that was affirmed by WFP, as it buys almost half of its wheat from Ukraine every year., Alongside the unfolding grain shortage, as of 24 May, a total of 708 settlements in Ukraine remain without electricity due to damage caused by the war. In total, approximately 639,200 consumers have been cut off from electricity. Regions particularly affected have been Donetsk region (330,700 consumers), Luhansk region (128,200), and Kharkiv region (90,200), leaving most communities in Donetsk and Luhansk regions disconnected.

With over $1.6 million in funding from the government of Japan through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNOPS will provide the logistical support required for the transportation of the supplies., “Amid the devastating damage to infrastructure in Ukraine caused by the armed attacks, we hope that the goods provided will be utilized by people fighting fires, or supporting other government activities,” said Yasushi Kaneko, Japan's Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications., Work is set to begin immediately and will move fire-fighting equipment donated by the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

Protection and Human Rights",27 May 2022,"UNITED NATIONS, New York – The European Commission has announced a €1.5 million contribution to UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, to ensure that women and girls in Ukraine have immediate access to sexual and reproductive health services, including survivors of sexual and gender-based violence., Since the beginning of the war, more than 8 million people have been internally displaced within Ukraine. The majority are women and girls, including pregnant women who urgently need access to medical care and assistance., Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by natural and human-made crises as access to essential, life-saving services diminishes and vulnerabilities to gender-based violence increase. “History has shown time and time again that women bear the brunt of wars and conflicts, and the war in Ukraine is no different,” said Janez Lenarčič, European Commissioner for Crisis Management. “The support to UNFPA will fund the immediate humanitarian response for women and girls, including survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, with access to sexual and reproductive health response services. This also includes life-saving medical care,” Lenarčič added., The grant will also support the establishment of two mobile healthcare units for emergency obstetric and newborn care in war-affected regions, and the procurement and distribution of essential medical supplies and equipment to health facilities, particularly to meet the needs of pregnant women., Since the beginning of the war, UNFPA has been working around the clock to scale-up the delivery of essential, life-saving services for women and girls, and ensure robust mechanisms are in place to protect them from violence, exploitation and abuse. Reproductive health supplies and equipment, including for obstetric emergencies and the clinical management of rape, have been distributed to mobile health teams and hospitals in war-torn cities across the country. Mobile units, staffed by psychologists and social workers, have also been deployed to 12 cities, providing psychosocial support to women experiencing violence and trauma. Crisis rooms, which provide a temporary, but safe haven for women and children fleeing bullets and bombs, also continue to operate., “For pregnant women, the crisis in Ukraine is devastating. What should be a time of joy, giving birth, has become very dangerous, especially in areas of active hostilities,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “Thanks to the European Union’s contribution, UNFPA will increase its provision of life-saving reproductive health services and help equip health facilities with much-needed supplies.”, UNFPA’s teams are on the ground, working with donors, local partners and the governments of Ukraine and neighbouring countries to save lives, alleviate suffering and help the most vulnerable first.

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 25 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 26 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",23 May 2022,"With ongoing peace talks failing to make any significant progress, Russia continues its offensive in the east, leading to the surrender of the Ukrainian troops in Mariupol. However Ukrainian counter-offensives have pushed back Russian forces from Kharkiv. Across Ukraine, air strikes and missile attacks have targeted key infrastructure, notably the railway network which has lost 23% of its tracks since the start of the invasion in February. This large-scale destruction is limiting both evacuations of civilians from conflict-affected areas and transport of relief items. Insecurity and logistic challenges also hamper humanitarian efforts, particularly in the East, South and the North-East of the country., The most recent figure for internally displaced persons within Ukraine was just over 8 million (May 03), with some cities and towns being emptied of over half of their populations in conflict-affected areas on both sides of the line of control.
In addition, approximately 6.55 million people have fled to neighbouring countries. Yet, with more than 2 million border crossings registered into Ukraine, there may also be significant numbers of Ukrainians returning, (although where these returns are temporary or definitive is not yet known). Many refugees intend to remain in the neighbouring countries until the war ends, and concerns are rising from both host governments and host communities regarding the potential impact of the refugee influx on livelihoods and access to essential services as well as what long-term solutions for local integration are possible., Southern and Eastern oblasts have the highest levels of insecurity and highest percentage of households adopting consumption-based mechanisms such as reducing portion sizes, cutting down on meals, or eating less preferred or less expensive food. According to data collected by WFP, (in March and early April), close to half of the populations in Donetsk, Khersonska and Luhanska were food insecure., This situation can be partly explained by the lack of access to these areas (restricting the influx of goods) but also by the lack of income and cash, restricting households to access essential items and services. Needs differ somewhat between conflict-affected areas and the other parts of the country. The lack of products’ availability is pushing people to prefer in-kind assistance in conflict-affected areas rather than cash, which is the preferred type of assistance of people residing in the west. Access to food and essential goods is also an issue for the displaced people inside and outside of Ukraine with higher prices due to inflation and a lack of income resulting from barriers to employment. By mid-April one in two IDP households in Ukraine were food insecure.
Destruction of health facilities coupled with the lack of essential medications are restricting access to healthcare, notably in the conflict-affected areas. The numerous injuries and trauma caused by the ongoing conflict are adding additional burden on health facilities and increasing short and long-term needs. This is pushing the health sector into a particularly grave situation in conflict-affected areas., According to the WFP survey, around 40% of respondents in Luhanska, Chernihivska, Khersonska, and Donetska reported that in the previous two weeks they did not have access to health care when they needed to. Health services in areas hosting IDPs and in neighbouring countries are also getting overstretched with a lack of capacities and resources. GBVrelated services and mental health provision are particular gaps despite very high needs., Protection threats continue to be flagged across Ukraine and within countries hosting refugees. The main challenge underlined these past weeks is the lack of protection support for the population. This is the case for elderly, children and people with disabilities who could not evacuate from conflict-affected areas but also for children (notably separated and unaccompanied), women, minorities and third-country nationals within the displaced population. The unknown situation of Ukrainian civilians deported to the Republic of Russia is also of concern as they may face various protection risks. However, judicial response to human rights violations shows its first steps as the first war crime trial of the conflict was held in Ukraine., Access to accommodation in areas hosting IDPs and in host countries faces particular issues with rent increases and lower housing availability. Accommodation remains as one of the most urgent needs of both IDPs (92% of respondents citing it as a priority according to REACH) and refugees.
Long-term solutions are not yet implemented, and concerns are rising on the sustainability of the current situation., Education facilities continue to be damaged or destroyed and access to education is a challenge across all affected groups. Those in conflict-affected areas may not have access to online learning or places conducive to learning. Displaced children also face difficulties although provisions for refugee children to enrol in local education systems and for displaced children to access online schooling are being stepped up.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-23-may-2022
New online service to help displaced Ukrainians find shelter and employment abroad [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,27 May 2022,"UNDP and Government of Ukraine launch new virtual centre with information on legalizing one’s stay abroad and registering a business in European countries, KYIV, 27 May 2022 -- The Entrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office, together with Diia.Business, has launched an innovative hotline -- a virtual Diia.Business centre. The centre aims to provide displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries with all the information they need about the rules and procedures for legalizing their stay, registering a business, finding employment or getting assistance. The project was initiated by the Office for Entrepreneurship and Export Development, along with the national Diia.Business project, and implemented by the NGO ""Small And Medium Business Support Consulting Centre"" with assistance from the UN Development Programme in Ukraine with financial support from Sweden., Valeriya Ionan, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation for European Integration, said the Government has adapted to the realities of war and is launching the types of services that people need most at the moment. ""We've launched the first virtual Diia.Business centre to provide Ukrainians abroad with quick and high-quality support in a convenient and innovative format,"" she said., Manal Fouani, acting UNDP Ukraine Resident Representative said the war is wreaking unprecedented socio-economic calamity on all Ukrainians, from forced displacement to the loss of income and livelihoods. ""The unfolding economic crisis requires urgent action,"" she said. ""The Government of Ukraine is acting swiftly and efficiently to address the needs of its citizens relying for the most part on digital solutions and existing institutional mechanisms. This new hotline will be an important instrument to support war-affected and relocated businesses and displaced persons. It will mainly avail information about shelters that could host those in need and connect them to the right service provider."", The Virtual Diia.Business Centre will provide professional advice on employment, entrepreneurship and temporary registration in EU countries. During the pilot phase of the project, specialists will advise Ukrainians residing in seven countries, including Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The Centre will also provide necessary advice to internally displaced persons in Ukraine. After obtaining consultations, people will be given a tailor-made road map with a list of useful materials, information about contact centres, and other recommendations., Tobias Thyberg, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Sweden to Ukraine said Sweden is strongly committed to supporting Ukraine to tackle the humanitarian crisis caused by war.

The lack of understanding of what steps to take next is often another painful shock. By creating a hotline and a support chatbot, we mainly aim to make the process of adapting to new realities as simple as possible for our citizens. After all, it's extremely important to know where one can get support to develop an action plan to stay abroad and then return to Ukraine."", Background, The initiative was implemented in the framework of the project ""Digital, Inclusive, Accessible: Support to Digitalisation of Public Services in Ukraine Project"" (DIA Support Project), which is implemented by UNDP in Ukraine with the financial support of Sweden. The DIA Support Project was launched in 2021 and aims to bridge the digital divide between different generations and different social groups.

Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",25 May 2022,"Highlights, In May, WFP assisted over 1.7 million displaced and conflict-affected people with food and cash thus far throughout Ukraine.
WFP cash assistance increased six-fold this month with around USD 68 million cash transfers provided to up to one million IDPs across Ukraine since the onset of the crisis.
WFP’s Ukraine emergency response faces a net funding shortfall of USD 319 million to sustain its operations through the month of August 2022., Situation Update, Humanitarian needs continue to grow day by day in Ukraine, sparked by three months of ongoing conflict and mounting violence. Fighting remains focalized in eastern Ukraine, slowing in pace but prolonging in time. Sporadic and heightened tensions are taking place in the adjacent areas fuelling constant displacement throughout the country.
Needs are the most acute in contested and encircled areas suffering from massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, where humanitarian access and delivery of life-saving aid to stranded civilians is hampered by hostilities. Local capacities are overstretched in relatively peaceful areas hosting growing flows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and suffering of shortages of services and commodities., In this respect, Ukraine’s protracted conflict undermines the food security and wellbeing of many people inside the country in diverse ways as crops, livestock and agricultural infrastructure are destroyed and markets are disrupted, creating fear and uncertainty over fulfilling future needs.
Insecurity deprives civilians of access to food, water, medical care, fuel, and livelihoods. Normal food supply chains are interrupted from production and harvesting to processing and transport, preventing the movement of goods and people. The lack of fuel and disruption in commercial transportation, limit the farmers ability to deliver their produce to markets. Hence, people, unable to find improved livelihood prospects, resort to coping strategies to feed themselves., The conflict is also exacerbating vulnerabilities to hunger for large segments of populations in protracted crises situations who have been wrestling with either crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity. It hinders humanitarian efforts to reach those in need and eradicate food insecurity and malnutrition worldwide, in an already challenged global food system., The World Food Programme (WFP) calls for unconditional, unimpeded, and sustained access to all civilians in need in Ukraine. It also urges for swift action to establish peace and build people-centred and resilient food systems around the world, able to react and adapt to shocks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-situation-report-18-25-may-2022

International delegate returns from Ukraine,News and Press Release,New Zealand Red Cross,Safety and Security,26 May 2022,"New Zealand Red Cross international delegate and security expert John Dyer has just returned from a five-week deployment to Ukraine. He was based in Western Ukraine where he saw a different view of the country to what many of us understand., John Dyer joined around 40 other Red Cross delegates from around the world in Ukraine to assist the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) in their work supporting victims of the conflict., John says one thing that immediately struck him, was how Western Ukraine was a different world to Eastern Ukraine — which stretches down to Mariupol and is where most of the conflict is taking place., He says in Western Ukraine, on the surface and for the moment at least, many people are going about their daily lives as usual. Local economies continue to function and he even saw tourist groups being led around one of the cities he worked in., “People get the impression the whole of Ukraine is in war, however the conflict to date has mainly been focused in the east. The whole country and particularly the east is undoubtedly suffering greatly, but much of Western Ukraine is still relatively secure.”, Different challenges, That’s not to say the West is unaffected — fuel is hard to come by and the millions of people who have arrived after fleeing from the east have created huge strain on facilities and services. John says the population of the small city of Uzhorod, where he stayed, had swelled from 110,000 to over 200,000 in just a few weeks., Many people are living in temporary shelters such as schools or kindergartens, and making do. “You can imagine the size of the bathroom facilities and furniture available in a kindergarten, but these challenges are small when people are at least feeling safe.”, The Western cities have not escaped missile attacks, and John had some of his own brushes with bombs. “There were strikes the day after I left Lviv, and when in Vinnytsia we had a whole night of alarms. We heard that a number of missiles were intercepted by the Ukrainian defence systems — Vinnytsia is a big city and we were not close to likely targets if any did land so we felt Ok.”, Although there have been fewer strikes in the west, the humanitarian needs are great with the millions of displaced people now living there., From the relative safety of the west, John was able to carry out his role as IFRC security coordinator., “I was there to develop a security framework to enable Red Cross teams to operate in as safe and secure manner as possible.”, The IFRC has been working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross and John says it has been a privilege to support people whose own friends and families are affected by the crisis. “What I have seen the Ukrainian Red Cross doing over there is just heroic.”, Unexpected risks, John’s risk assessments showed the greatest threats to Red Cross staff and the people they were supporting were not always as one might expect in a conflict zone., Some of the biggest safety risks were traffic accidents, which were common, missile strikes on chemical stores and the resulting contamination, and risks to staff over other’s misuse of the Red Cross symbol., “People would tape a Red Cross to their vehicle, just to try and help them move about, but this can lead to some distrust in the emblem and as a consequence create a threat to our own staff.”, A security plan, John developed a plan to help mitigate these risks to staff, as well as the more obvious ones of missile strikes on civilian targets. The security framework was first implemented in Uzhorod, the city where John was initially working, and then developed to incorporate the wider area where the IFRCS is working in including Lviv, Vinnytsia and Chernivtsi and the Oblasts (regions) in between these cities., John completed this work at the beginning of May and is now back in Wellington. He’s confident the framework has made a difference., “It’s about ensuring our people can help the people in need in Ukraine in a safe way. We’ve put that plan in place and I’ve left capable people to work through it. Sadly, this is going to be a long-term operation — we will be there for some time and safety will be an ongoing issue that will need to be managed.”, Find out more about our response to the Ukraine conflict, Read about our international delegate programme",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/international-delegate-returns-ukraine

HIV/Aids
Protection and Human Rights",19 May 2022,"Kyiv, 19 May 2022. UNICEF announces a further extension of its partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) to provide vital medicines and health services in Ukraine through the signature of an Emergency Fund grant., This extension is an important part of UNICEF’s broad and growing support for the Ukrainian government and the people of Ukraine in the face of the ongoing war’s devastating impacts on their health, security and well-being. Attacks on civilians and non-military facilities such as hospitals, clinics, schools and apartment buildings have caused tens of thousands of deaths and injuries, forced millions to flee, and severely disrupted the delivery of, and access to, physical and mental health services, education, and food and nutrition., As is always the case in conflicts, the most vulnerable people, including those who rely on a steady supply of medicines to stay healthy and alive, are in the most precarious position. UNICEF is committed to maintaining and expanding its contributions to confront the cruel and indiscriminate depredations against them by supporting the health care system to continue delivering the drugs and other services needed by people with chronic health conditions. They include people across Ukraine who are living with HIV and/or tuberculosis (TB), two potentially deadly infections that the Global Fund and UNICEF have supported the government and its civil society partners in confronting and controlling for many years., UNICEF is a pre-qualified Emergency Fund principal recipient for the Global Fund and has deep and extensive expertise in the logistical arrangements needed to identify and overcome service delivery gaps. With the extension of the grant, it is prepared to use all its best efforts and opportunities to deliver lifesaving antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), TB medications and other indispensable commodities and support to the people of Ukraine across the areas of HIV and TB. These efforts will complement other activities UNICEF is supporting directly and indirectly in Ukraine to mitigate the war’s debilitating social and economic effects., UNICEF’s provision of support and commodities through the grant will be done in close coordination with other partners including the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and local civil society groups that have long played a central role in identifying, reaching and supporting people living with and affected by HIV and TB across the country. To the fullest extent possible, UNICEF will be guided by the examples and lessons learned from the heroic efforts of thousands of people working with and in support of these groups since the war began. This includes responding quickly, efficiently and flexibly to requests from in-country partners – and especially the three main Global Fund principal recipients – for the medicines and services needed to avoid stock-outs., Separately, UNICEF is also providing support for HIV and TB programmes, and the people who rely on them, in neighbouring countries that do not fall under this Global Fund emergency grant. The war has had a severe impact on health and social service sectors in many of them due to reasons such as large influxes of refugees from Ukraine and economic pressures resulting from uncertainties regarding energy and food prices and access. In these countries as well as Ukraine, UNICEF is using its multisectoral footprint to ensure continuity of services, with the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized at the forefront., Media contacts, Nina Sorokopud, Chief of Communication, UNICEF in Ukraine, Email: nsorokopud@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-extends-partnership-global-fund-fight-aids-tuberculosis-and-malaria-ukraine

Eurojust: Council adopts new rules allowing the agency to preserve evidence of war crimes [EN/RU],News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,25 May 2022,"To help ensure accountability for crimes committed in Ukraine, the Council today adopted new rules allowing Eurojust to preserve, analyse and store evidence relating to core international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The text is due to be signed by the European Parliament and the Council on 30 May and promptly published in the Official Journal. It will enter into force on the day following its publication., The new rules will allow Eurojust to:, store and preserve evidence relating to war crimes, including satellite images, photographs, videos, audio recordings, DNA profiles and fingerprints, process and analyse this evidence, in close cooperation with Europol, and share the information with the relevant national and international judicial authorities, including the International Criminal Court, Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, numerous reports from Ukraine have sadly indicated that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been and are being committed in Ukraine., At the beginning of March, all EU member states, together with other partner states, decided to collectively refer the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 4 March, ministers encouraged Eurojust to fully exercise its coordinating role and to make itself available as required to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court., In addition to the investigation by the ICC prosecutor, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has opened an investigation, as have the authorities of several member states. A joint investigation team has also been established by the judicial authorities of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, with the support of Eurojust and the participation of the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC and shortly of the judicial authorities of Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia., Coordination and exchange of evidence between the different competent authorities is important to ensure the effectiveness of these investigations. In addition, owing to the ongoing hostilities there is a risk that evidence relating to war crimes or crimes against humanity cannot be safely stored on the territory of Ukraine and therefore it is appropriate to establish central storage in a safe location., Amendment to regulation 2018/1727 as regards the collection, preservation and analysis by Eurojust of evidence relating to war crimes, EU solidarity with Ukraine (background information), Press contacts, Verónica Huertas Cerdeira

HIV/Aids",26 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, As of 2022 2022, USAID health programs are investing more than $40 million each year to strengthen Ukraine’s health systems; combat infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS; address vaccine-preventable diseases; and expand access to mental health, psycho-social, and rehabilitation services. In 2021, USAID also committed $10.1 million in additional funding to support COVID-19 response and vaccination efforts - part of more than $74 million in U.S. Government COVID-related support to Ukraine since the pandemic began., In the context of Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022, USAID has continued to partner with the Government of Ukraine (GOU) to improve essential health services and build the resilience of health systems and institutions to continue serving the Ukrainian people. USAID health activities have continued to operate inside Ukraine, pivoting assistance to ease strains on Ukraine’s health system and address the direct human costs of the war, interruptions to services, and the health needs of the large number of internally displaced persons (IDP) inside the country. During the war, USAID’s network of implementing partners have continued working on the ground to meet immediate needs and support long-term strengthening of Ukraine’s health system., OBJECTIVES, USAID assistance helps Ukraine build a health system that is transparent, efficient, free from corruption, and responsive to the needs of the Ukrainian people. Programs aim to strengthen and rebuild the country’s capacity to respond to high burdens of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection, and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB); improve Ukraine’s immunization programs; advance health reforms to ensure that more Ukrainians have access to high-quality and affordable health care; and expand access to mental health and rehabilitation services. These objectives remain central to supporting an efficient and effective response to the health impacts of the war., OUR PROGRAMS, I. COMBATING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMPROVING HEALTH SECURITY, HIV/AIDS: With funding from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), USAID partners with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, local government, healthcare facilities, and civil society organizations to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat. USAID technical assistance improves HIV service quality, ensures that more Ukrainians know their HIV status, links people living with HIV/AIDS to treatment and care, retains people on treatment, and reduces stigma and discrimination. Since the invasion, activities continue to provide support to facilities providing services to people living with HIV in PEPFAR-priority regions of Ukraine which remain in GOU control. Outreach efforts now include services to internally displaced populations and an additional a focus from new HIV case identification to sustaining access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV through activities such as home delivery of antiretroviral medication (ARVs) and providing counseling and adherence support. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion, USAID supported the delivery of more than 18 million doses of PEPFAR-funded antiretrovirals in April 2022. The antiretrovirals are now being distributed around the country, including in liberated areas such as Chernihiv and in the frontline oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia., TUBERCULOSIS: USAID supports Ukraine’s TB control program to mitigate the TB epidemic in Ukraine through early detection, appropriate care, and prevention for people living with TB, drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and TB/HIV. Amid Russia’s full-scale invasion, USAID has supported the continuity of treatment in 12 oblasts in areas that remain under Ukrainian control. USAID collaborates with the MOH Center for Public Health (CPH) to provide more effective TB services as Ukraine transitions to increased use of primary healthcare centers. TUSAID’s Support TB Control Efforts in Ukraine program continues supporting efforts to sustain TB services in focus oblasts and assisting central level authorities maintain continuity of TB diagnostics, treatment and support. With large numbers of Ukrainians relocating due to the fighting, additional assistance is being provided to help track and support TB patients to prevent interruption of treatment, through social, medical and nutritional patients’ support including food assistance. USAID continues to support transportation of essential TB medicines and diagnostics in most of the supported regions, with the expansion to health workers transportation where safety allows., HEALTH SECURITY AND COVID-19: USAID provides technical assistance and support for Ukraine’s response to COVID-19, including support for active case-finding, clinical case management, risk communications, and oxygen supply for hospitals. USAID programs also support laboratory systems, and procure essential commodities, medical equipment and supplies. To support the continuation of COVID-19 vaccinations, USAID still provides support and technical assistance for national pandemic planning and readiness, vaccination coverage, communications and demand generation, and logistics shipments of vaccines (both into and within the country). Beyond COVID-19, USAID’s new Public Health System Resilience & Recovery (PHS R&R) activity, awarded in May 2022, is supporting Ukraine’s public health system and regional to improve preparedness, detection and response capacity to address public health threats., IMMUNIZATION: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, routine immunization coverage was improving in Ukraine due to increased access to primary health care. The pandemic led to new challenges in reaching full vaccination coverage, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has made routine vaccinations far more difficult. In partnership with UNICEF, the World Health Organization and CDC, USAID continues supporting vaccination efforts by combating misinformation about vaccines, reducing vaccine-hesitancy, developing technical capacity of health providers, and supporting the MOH in building strong procurement and supply chain systems., II. SOCIAL SERVICES, MENTAL HEALTH: USAID/Ukraine is working with the MOH, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs (MVA), and veterans’ organizations to broaden access to community-based, non-medicalized mental health services to veterans, members of their families, and IDPs. In addition, USAID’s new Public Health System Resilience and Recovery Activity includes assistance to increase access to and the sustainability of mental health services for conflict-affected populations at the community level., PHYSICAL REHABILITATION: USAID collaborates with the WHO, the MOH, the Ministry of Social Policy and selected health care facilities to expand access to physical rehabilitation services, introduce international best practices for neurorehabilitation, promote a physical therapist profession, and increase information about available rehabilitation services and assistive technologies. USAID is supporting the GOU and its partners to introduce rehabilitation services at the primary healthcare level and expand the availability of assistive technologies for people with disabilities and persons injured from the current fighting., III. HEALTH REFORM AND SYSTEM RECOVERY, USAID has supported Ukraine to undertake major healthcare system reforms since 2016 to eliminate corruption and informal payments, and make healthcare services more accountable to patients. USAID supported the establishment of the National Health Services of Ukraine in 2017, which today contracts more than 95 percent of all public health facilities to provide government-covered health services, covers more than 32 million Ukrainians (78% of the population), and has helped reduce the prevalence of informal payments for primary healthcare by 65 percent in just three years. USAID also supports Ukraine’s medical Central Procurement Agency, which has saved hundreds of millions of dollars in Ukrainian state funds through transparent, accountable procurement since 2019., USAID’s ongoing health reform activities have helped Ukraine’s health sector to respond to significant new strains related to the war and ensure continuity of services. USAID’s Health Reform Support (HRS) activity helped the Ministry of Health rapidly adapt its financing systems to help facilities respond to emergency needs, protect information systems against cyber threats, and support data-driven national recovery planning. USAID’s SAFEMed program has helped to adapt supply chains and manage incoming humanitarian donations to keep medicines flowing to facilities, and avert drug shortages.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/health-fact-sheet

Logistics and Telecommunications",26 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, Cyber is a critical frontline as Ukraine defends its security, independence, and democracy from Russia’s aggression. In recent years, USAID has made major investments in Ukraine’s ability to respond and recover from cyberattacks emanating from Russia, including attacks targeting the Government of Ukraine and critical infrastructure operators. USAID cybersecurity assistance is part of our overall effort to strengthen Ukraine’s resilience to Russia’s aggression and to promote economic growth and effective democratic governance. Our programming strengthens the capacity of Government of Ukraine agencies, ministries, and parliamentary committees; helps secure democratic elections; and raises awareness among civil society, the private sector, and the general public about the importance of cybersecurity. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, we have expanded our programming to protect public communications networks by repelling cyberattacks and repairing systems following attacks, as well as by ensuring continued voice and data connectivity., PROGRAM OBJECTIVE, To enhance Ukraine's overall security by strengthening its ability to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks, and to quickly recover and restore critical infrastructure after an attack has occurred., OUR PROGRAMS, CYBERSECURITY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN UKRAINE, USAID launched the four-year, $38 million Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine activity in May 2020 and to strengthen Ukraine’s cyber preparedness and protect critical infrastructure through assistance in three key directions: 1) strengthening the cybersecurity enabling environment; 2) developing Ukraine’s cybersecurity workforce; and 3) building a resilient cybersecurity industry. The activity improves cybersecurity products and services through increased public-private sector collaboration and expands market opportunities for Ukrainian cybersecurity firms by opening access to capital and new local and international markets. The activity has a strong component to build the cyber resilience of Ukraine’s energy sector. Under the activity, participating electricity utilities are developing five- and ten-year network development plans and receiving training on how to improve organizational structure, operations, and procurement standards. Participating energy regulatory agencies are developing strategies to address energy sector cybersecurity, and are receiving training on cyber-hardened electricity network upgrades. They are also facilitating dialogue between utilities and regulators to ensure that appropriate upgrades are made to the network in a financially sound manner., Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the activity funded technical experts to provide hands-on support to essential service providers within the Ukrainian government including government ministries and critical infrastructure operators to identify malware and restore systems after an incident has occurred. This support builds on long standing USAID support building cyber resilience among regional utilities, particularly in the energy sector. Amid Russia’s invasion, USAID has also provided more than 6,750 emergency communications devices, including satellite phones and data terminals, to essential service providers, government officials, and critical infrastructure operators in key sectors such as energy and telecommunications., UKRAINE RESPONSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNANCE PROGRAM, In 2016, USAID launched the nine-year, $81 million Ukraine Responsive and Accountable Governance Program to promote citizen-centered elections and political processes in Ukraine. Under the activity’s cybersecurity component, USAID partners with Ukraine’s Central Elections Commission (CEC) to strengthen its cybersecurity capacity and counter growing online threats to electoral systems. The activity conducted an electoral cybersecurity needs assessment and worked with key elections and cybersecurity actors to provide critical improvements to electoral cybersecurity infrastructure. URAP conducted cyber hygiene training for election commissioners at all levels, as well as for civil society, political parties, and the Parliament, training 642 individuals nationwide in 2019. In doing so, the activity developed and conducted cybersecurity training courses for IT professionals in Ukraine and beyond. The activity strengthened the cybersecurity resilience of Ukraine’s electoral results management system and voter registry, enabling Ukraine’s Central Election Commission to combat cyberattacks during the country’s 2019 presidential and snap parliamentary elections – safeguarding confidence in electoral processes., USAID/WASHINGTON AND REGIONAL PROGRAMS, REGIONAL ENERGY SECTOR CYBERSECURITY ACTIVITY, The United States Energy Association and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners are cooperating to improve energy-sector cybersecurity. This $1 million regional program is working to establish mechanisms for sharing knowledge and best practices across energy sector entities in Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, and Georgia, focusing on strengthening cybersecurity capabilities among energy sector regulators and electricity transmission and distribution companies.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/cybersecurity-fact-sheet

Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",26 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, Ukraine’s agriculture sector is an important source of livelihoods for the roughly 13 million Ukrainians living in rural areas. It is also a major provider of food for both domestic and international markets. Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s agriculture sector accounted for 11 percent of the country’s GDP, nearly 20 percent of its labor force, and nearly 40 percent of total exports, with Ukraine being the world’s fifth-largest exporter of wheat, fourth-largest exporter of corn, and third-largest exporter of rapeseed. A strong and stable agriculture sector in Ukraine is thus critical for global food security. According to a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global food prices increased by 12.6 percent during roughly the first month of the war, a clear indicator of Ukraine’s status as a global breadbasket., PROGRAM OBJECTIVE, Prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, USAID assistance focused on modernizing production methods, creating more job opportunities in rural communities, and helping Ukraine build and strengthen market links with the European Union. Amid Russia’s invasion, USAID is helping Ukraine’s farmers deliver a sufficient harvest to ease domestic food insecurity and maintain the productive capacity necessary to drive a strong post-war economic recovery., OUR ACTIVITIES, USAID partners with Ukraine’s farmers, the private sector, and policymakers to upgrade productive capacity and employment opportunities and, amid Russia’s full-scale invasion, provide farmers with the critical supplies and services they need to continue operating. In the longer term, USAID promotes critical reforms including the introduction of a full-fledged and transparent agricultural land market, improved irrigation policies, better access to finance for farmers, and broader implementation of international food safety standards to diversify Ukraine’s export opportunities., USAID’s Agriculture Growing Rural Opportunities (AGRO) is a five year, $35 million activity (ending in 2024) designed to strengthen agriculture in Ukraine’s rural communities with the greatest need. The activity has a particular focus on Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Kharkiv, Poltava, Odesa, and Cherkasy Oblasts. The activity works in three main directions: 1) increase revenues for agricultural small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through greater productivity and market access; 2) increase access to critical support services (financing, irrigation, advisory support) for agricultural SMEs; and 3) create a better enabling environment through fair and transparent policies and regulations in the agricultural sector. In July 2021, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, with USAID support, passed legislation to lift a two-decade-old moratorium on agricultural land sales. This reform opens the land market, unlocking private investment, which will economically revitalize rural communities, primarily through the growth of agricultural-focused SMEs. The reform will benefit the 30 percent of Ukrainians who live in rural communities., Amid Russia’s invasion, USAID redirected the activity to provide roughly 5,000 farmers (10 percent of Ukraine’s total small farmers) with inputs and services needed to deliver a successful harvest. Notably, the activity is providing high quality seed potatoes along with agronomic support to 3,000 farmers in 13 oblasts, including in the hard-hit regions of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kyiv, and Zaporizhzhia. The seed potatoes are enough to produce food for 25,000 people. The activity also supports three mobile match-making applications that make it easier for farmers to obtain bank loans and state subsidies., Credit for Agricultural Producers (CAP) is a seven-year, $8.9 million activity ending in 2023 to help Ukraine build a strong network of credit unions capable of financing growth in the country’s agricultural SME sector. The activity improves the regulatory and legislative environment surrounding credit unions, including by building the National Bank of Ukraine’s capacity to effectively regulate the country’s credit unions. By promoting greater and more efficient agricultural lending, USAID assistance is helping increase employment and income opportunities in Ukraine’s rural communities., Seven out of 22 partner credit unions are either based in areas temporarily occupied by Russia or in active combat zones, making credit union operations virtually impossible in many areas amid Russia’s full-scale invasion. Amid the war, however, CAP has helped 15 credit union partners issue 341 new loans to small farmers for a total of UAH 27.73 million (approximately USD 942,000). Also amid Russia’s invasion, CAP has lobbied the National Bank of Ukraine to launch temporary regulatory relief for credit unions. As a result of CAP support, the regulator deferred some of the more stringent regulations. Additionally, CAP is helping partner credit unions back up and store data outside of Ukraine to prevent the loss of data amid infrastructure damage caused by Russia’s invasion. This is helping preserve critical credit union data that can later be used to restore operations., CREDIT UNION LIQUIDITY ACTIVITY launched in 2021 as a partnership between USAID and the Worldwide Foundation for Credit Unions (WOCCU Foundation, USA) to establish a Liquidity Fund for Credit Unions. Since February 24, thanks to this Activity, 115 small Ukrainian agribusinesses received loans from credit unions totaling UAH 12,6 million ($430,770). More than half of these loans have gone to implementing Ukraine’s current sowing campaign.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/agriculture-fact-sheet-enuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",26 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, USAID promotes participatory, transparent, and accountable democracy in Ukraine through a bottom-up approach that focuses on strong local democratic governance. Local governance has become even more important as Ukraine’s communities respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Amid Russia’s invasion, USAID is supporting emergency response efforts in 36 communities in eight oblasts in western, central, and southern Ukraine (Lviv, Volyn, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Chernihiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia), delivering supplies and providing technical assistance to help local governments deliver critical services to local residents and internally-displaced persons (IDPs)., At the local level, USAID assistance: (1) empowers government officials, civil society, and the private sector to work together toward effective and accountable local governance; (2) strengthens the legislative and constitutional framework for the decentralization of governance; (3) stimulates local economic development; (4) improves public service delivery; (5) promotes independent and transparent financial planning and management strategies; and (6) increases revenue and resources for Ukraine’s cities, towns, and villages., Nationally, USAID also works with Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, to expand public representation in the legislative process; expand the role of citizens in monitoring the work of the parliament; and strengthen the legislature’s role in providing independent oversight of the Presidential Administration, the Cabinet of Ministers, and other public institutions., PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, Continued decentralization and territorial reorganization of Ukraine. Strong local governance systems, processes, and institutions that are self-reliant, accountable to citizens, inclusive, and capable of providing effective public services. Local governments that effectively use their increased authority, resources, and responsibilities. A more open and representative parliament with enhanced capacities to make laws and oversee the executive branch. Increased citizen engagement in, and oversight of, local government and parliament., OUR ACTIVITIES, USAID GOVERNANCE AND LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACTIVITY, USAID’s Governance and Local Accountability Activity (HOVERLA) is a five-year, $74 million activity to support the Government of Ukraine’s decentralization reforms. The activity helps create and strengthen local governance systems, processes, and institutions that are more self-reliant, inclusive, effective, and accountable to citizens. HOVERLA also supports the development of a strong legal framework for local governance to ensure an appropriate balance of authority and responsibility between local government institutions, primarily at the consolidated community level and on a more limited basis at the rayon (county) and national executive levels. The activity supports sectoral and fiscal decentralization., Amid Russia’s invasion, HOVERLA is supporting emergency response efforts in 36 communities in eight oblasts in western, central, and southern Ukraine (Lviv, Volyn, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Chernihiv, Poltava and Zaporizhzhia). The activity is procuring laptops, printers, Wi-Fi routers, power generators, firefighting equipment and uniforms, public warning systems, beds, kitchen and laundry equipment, and hygiene kits to help local governments deliver critical services to local residents and IDPs. In addition to providing emergency assistance, USAID continues to build the governance capacity of more than 500 communities in 14 oblasts, providing training on land management, spatial planning, human resource management, budgeting, and legislative reforms, including local regulations. USAID also continues to support the implementation of local service improvement and local economic development projects in partner communities., DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE EAST, USAID’s Democratic Governance East (DG East) is a five-year, $57 million activity launched in 2018 to promote an inclusive civic identity, democratic civic values, and a more unified Ukraine by addressing the divisive impacts of Russia’s aggression on communities in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. In partnership with local governments and communities, DG East strengthens connections and trust between government and citizens and fosters citizen participation in community development and local decision-making, thus building support for reform processes, European integration, and Ukraine’s democratic transition. DG East has provided a range of capacity building assistance to 23 departments of social protection and administrative service centers in the government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Supported communities have improved service delivery to citizens, with a focus on support for IDPs and persons crossing the line of contact. DG East also works with civic groups and activists to foster greater acceptance of a shared civic culture and stronger relations between citizens and government., Amid Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, DG East pivoted to providing emergency assistance to war-affected communities. Notably, the activity provided Bakhmut City Council in Donetsk Oblast with washing machines for its residence center, which has operated as a transit center for IDPs since 2014. The activity provided IT equipment to Zaporizhzhia City Council to help it better coordinate assistance to an influx of roughly 1,400 IDPs per day following Russia’s invasion., DECENTRALIZATION OFFERING BETTER RESULTS AND EFFICIENCY, USAID’s Decentralization Offering Better Results and Efficiency (DOBRE) is a six-year, $67 million local government activity launched in 2016 to help 100 local communities build effective and responsible local governance processes that better serve citizens. The activity promotes the effective implementation of decentralization reform and territorial reorganization in all of Ukraine’s oblasts. During Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, the activity has supported local governments in six recently-liberated communities, three in Chernihiv oblast, two in Kherson oblast (which is partially liberated from Russia’s forces), and one in Kharkiv Oblast. All liberated communities have received assistance in the following areas: service delivery, local economic development, financial management, civic engagement, and emergency assistance. In terms of emergency assistance, two communities in Chernihiv oblast have received humanitarian assistance such as food kits and hygiene items. Three communities (two in Kherson oblast and one in Kharkiv oblast) have received Starlink satellite Internet terminals., RADA NEXT GENERATION, USAID’s Rada Next Generation is a five-year, $10 million activity launched in 2021 to advance the “next generation” of reforms in the Verkhovna Rada. The activity supports the Rada to become a modern, effective institution advancing accountability and democratic development in Ukraine. The activity is focused on expanding public participation in legislative processes, including stronger engagement between MPs and their constituents. The activity also strengthens the Rada’s analytical and oversight capacity. Amid Russia’s invasion, RADA Next Generation has provided legal and expert advice to the Rada in the development of emergency legislation during wartime, and has supported a public information campaign to explain requirements under martial law. The activity also provided the Rada with 15 satellite Internet terminals to ensure its continued work during the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/governance-and-decentralization-fact-sheet

Ukraine Refugee Situation, BACKGROUND, Since the onset of the Russian invasion, one-third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes. This is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. Some 8 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine and some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., As of today, more than 6.5 million refugee movements have been recorded out of Ukraine. At the same time, authorities have reported more than 2 million movements back into the country. UNHCR estimates that as of last week, some 2.9** million refugees had moved beyond countries neighbouring Ukraine., Inside Ukraine, many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys., Key figures - UKRAINE - a total of 1.01 million people reached with assistance to date, As of 23 May:, *Estimate based on most recent data available as of 18 May

Ukraine Crisis: Week of 14-20 May 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,26 May 2022,"By Olha Polishchuk and Adam Miller, Fighting was concentrated in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv regions last week. In Donetsk, Russian forces gained full control of Mariupol following the surrender of remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal plant. Under an agreement with Ukraine, Russian forces transported hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers to medical facilities in occupied territories on 16 May (The Guardian, 17 May 2022). Mariupol had been under siege since the beginning of March. With the final capture of Mariupol, Russian forces intensified offensive operations in the rest of the Donetsk region but failed to secure any further significant territorial gains (ISW, 21 May 2022). In the Luhansk region, Russian forces reportedly suffered heavy losses during continued attempts to advance in the area of Severodonetsk (24 Channel, 19 May 2022)., Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure across Ukraine with shelling and missile attacks. In the Chernihiv region, Russia fired missiles at Desna on 17 May, destroying a residential building; 87 people were found dead under the rubble (Unian, 23 May 2022).

This included:, a total of 3,998 killed (1,507 men, 989 women, 92 girls, and 99 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,242 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 4,693 injured (948 men, 620 women, 109 girls, and 131 boys, as well as 164 children and 2,721 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 May 2022,"Executive Summary, As of May 6, 2022, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) resulting from the war in Ukraine was 7.7 million, with another 5.7 million refugees and asylum seekers residing in neighboring countries.1 The lack of humanitarian corridors has created a situation where people are either trapped in Ukraine or subject to a myriad of protection risks while in flight or in temporary shelter elsewhere., While there has been an outpouring of public and private support for Ukraine, the largely ad hoc and gender-blind response cannot meet the basic needs and protection concerns of IDPs—mostly women and children—and others affected by the war in Ukraine. Duty-bearers—including international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and the United Nations (UN)—have so far failed to adhere to their own global commitments to localization of the humanitarian response. This includes systematically creating ways for women and girls to design and lead responses, incorporating their views into all phases of the operational management cycle. With few exceptions, dedicated funding for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and services for violence against women and girls (VAWG) has failed to materialize.
Instead of the multi-year flexible funding that local women- and girl-led organizations need, these overworked frontline groups find themselves chasing grants that may only cover one to three months of total costs. They are taking on underfunded humanitarian work that they are not necessarily trained for, which ultimately derails their core missions., In every armed conflict, men’s violence against women and girls increases rapidly and stays elevated long after the fighting stops. Ukraine and the surrounding region are currently facing an unprecedented crisis of women and children displaced by the war, but urgently needed, gender-sensitive violence prevention measures are trailing behind the response. In Ukraine, and in surrounding countries, women’s rights organizations (WROs) were already responding to the needs of women and girls prior to the war, and are now working to support women and girls displaced or otherwise impacted by the conflict. Because of their extensive experience and localized knowledge, these groups are best-positioned to build the solutions girls and women need now. These organizations are asking for recognition of their expertise and for the requisite funding to utilize their knowledge in continued response to this crisis., Instead, a familiar structure is developing: a top-down, unequal relationship between capable local actors and international humanitarian agencies. This arrangement always fails women and girls, even by these agencies’ own standards. Women and girls are not consulted in the design of the aid that is being developed for them, and WROs are alienated from humanitarian coordination structures. They are expected to do more than ever, with little or no extra funding. VOICE witnessed this familiar scenario play out in relation to the international humanitarian community’s response to COVID-19, where yet again the humanitarian aid sector—despite its commitments to crisis-affected populations— contributed to denying women and girls their rights to participation, consultation, and services, and in some cases subjected them to its own types of violence.25, In addition, there are a number of actors and organizations playing a vital role in the humanitarian space that may not have traditional humanitarian or crisis experience, and therefore do not or may not have the more nuanced gender-based violence (GBV) and broader protection experience. These entities are strongly encouraged to engage expertise to navigate and implement GBV and other protection regulations, policies, and strategies, and to strongly consider and integrate the related assessment recommendations included in this report., Through a new partnership between VOICE and HIAS, and as part of a six-country assessment in the region, VOICE conducted a three-week remote rapid assessment in Ukraine to assess the needs of women and girls affected by the war, and the needs of WROs and groups responding to the emergency. The assessment revealed that the top concerns for women and girls include threats to physical safety from active conflict and continual bombardment; food insecurity; and lack of access to healthcare, including the full range of reproductive health services, care for survivors of rape, and mental health. The assessment notes a range of GBV risks, including an increase in domestic violence, and an extreme lack of safe and sustainable housing and shelter options. Additionally, transgender people are unable to access appropriate health care and face extreme risk when trying to cross the border. As noted above, the WROs best placed to address these concerns are excluded from humanitarian coordination structures and, if able to locate funding at all, struggle with overly burdensome and restrictive funding structures., Women and children are the face of this crisis and remain on the front lines of the conflict.

On 24 May, the war in Ukraine entered its fourth month. As hostilities continue unabated in eastern Ukraine and other parts of the country are targeted by airstrikes almost daily, the fears of a prolonged war mount. On 22 May, the Parliament of Ukraine extended the martial law introduced on 24 February for another 90 days. The President of Ukraine also warned that the upcoming few weeks would likely be the most difficult yet.
Meanwhile, on 25 May, the President of the Russian Federation signed a decree allowing Ukrainians residing in southern Khersonska and southeastern Zaporizka oblast to receive Russian citizenship under a simplified procedure. The simplified procedure for eastern Donetska and Luhanska oblasts residents has already been in place since 2019., During the reporting period, heavy fighting continued in eastern Ukraine, mainly in Luhanska and Donetska oblasts, while there were also daily reports of airstrikes, missile strikes and bombardments across Ukraine. Hostilities in Luhanska oblast were concentrated around its administrative centre, Sievierodonetsk, where the shelling of residential buildings on 19 May reportedly resulted in at least 12 people being killed. On the same day, shelling was reported to have destroyed a residential building, house and office in Bakhmut in the Government-controlled-areas (GCA) of Donetska oblast, where the remaining 20,000 residents have also reportedly suffered constant bombardment, and the humanitarian situation has been described as dire. Widespread missile strikes were also reported in 18 settlements in GCA of Donetska oblast on 24-25 May. And there were also damages and casualties reported in non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of both Donetska and Luhanska oblasts., Elsewhere, on 20 May, a missile strike was reported to have damaged a cultural centre, residential buildings, health-care and educational facilities in Lozova in Kharkivska oblast (east), injuring eight people, including a child. On the same day, there were reports of missile strikes in Odeska oblast (south), resulting in, at least briefly, concerns of an ammonia leak. There were reports of repeated missile attacks between 20 and 23 May, evidently targeting railway infrastructure in Zhytomyrska oblast (north) but with residential and commercial buildings also being hit and with at least one Ukrainian Railways employee killed and three others and a local resident injured. Also, on 20 May, there were reports of missiles striking infrastructure in Poltavska oblast (centre). On 22 May, Mayor Alexander Senkevich reported that the city of Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast, south) was being shelled with cluster bombs, warning residents to take shelter. On 23-24 May, there were reported missile attacks on railway infrastructure in Dnipropetrovska oblast (centre), also destroying several houses. On 24 May, mortar shelling was reported in Sumska oblast (north-east). On 25 May, missiles were reported to have killed at least one person, injured three others and damaged 62 houses in Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast)., The humanitarian situation has been described as particularly concerning in a number of areas of Ukraine. On 20 May, it was reported that some 15,000 were sheltering in Sievierodonetsk where water and electricity had already been cut off for several days. A city hospital was reported to have suffered repeated attacks and, as a result, is only able to provide limited health-care services – at a time of increasing demand. And on 21 May, a bridge leading to Sievierodonetsk was destroyed, leaving the partially encircled city reachable by only one road. This is expected to further complicate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the city and the evacuation of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-26-may-2022-enruuk

Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 May 2022,"Executive Summary, Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, a staggering 12.8 million people have been displaced. Over 5 million have fled the country, and almost 8 million are internally displaced inside the borders of Ukraine. This is the region’s largest displacement crisis since World War II., In every armed conflict, men’s violence against women and girls (VAWG) increases rapidly and stays elevated long after the fighting stops. As the war in Ukraine rages on, the region faces an unprecedented crisis of displaced women and children. Like all wars, this one is being fought on the bodies of these women and girls. Conflictrelated sexual violence has been documented in the form of Russian soldiers raping Ukrainian women, and women’s organizations inside Ukraine report that domestic violence is on the rise as well. Alongside an increasing push for the documentation of war crimes is the need to make sure all survivors of war crimes, domestic violence, and other forms of violence against women and girls get the medical and psychosocial support they need. Gender-sensitive violence prevention measures are urgently needed, but they are trailing behind the response. The strategic erasure of women’s rights over time in Eastern Europe created a crisis for women and girls long before the war started, and is now exacerbating the risks they face during the war., An indomitable network of women’s rights organizations (WROs) and civil society organizations (CSOs) exists throughout the region. Struggling to maintain advances in gender equality against increasingly overt attacks on women’s rights, these organizations have long been responding to the needs of women and girls. The war has seen these organizations spring into action to support internally and forcibly displaced persons (FDPs), once again woefully underfunded., Because of their deep expertise and experience, these organizations and groups are bestpositioned to build the solutions girls and women urgently need. This has put immense pressure on many WROs who are concerned about their capacity to continue supporting their primary caseload —women and vulnerable populations from their own country— in addition to those displaced by the war., Local non-government organizations (NGOs) and WROs need sustained, flexible, and long-term funding to increase their capacity and continue working in the region. Instead, a top-down, unequal relationship between capable local actors and international humanitarian agencies is developing, despite standards such as the World Humanitarian Summit’s Grand Bargain and its commitments to ‘localization,’ the Core Commitments to Women and Girls, and the IASC GBV Guidelines. This inequitable approach alienates WROs from humanitarian coordination structures and ultimately fails women and girls, who are not consulted in the design of the aid that is being developed., As part of a partnership with HIAS, VOICE conducted a four-week rapid assessment of Ukraine and five bordering countries (Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) to assess the needs of women and girls affected by the war in Ukraine and the needs of WROs and groups responding to the emergency., This assessment was conducted from March 25 through April 15, 2022. During the assessment the VOICE Team held 171 key informant interviews including 33 WROs and CSOs inside Ukraine, 22 focus group discussions with over 167 women FDPs, and over 55 site observations at formal, informal and private shelters, train and bus stations, 72-hour transit camps, border crossings and organizational service points., A critical piece of the assessment validation process, was the review and validation of the findings and recommendations by regional and country-based WROs, CSOs, UN personnel and coordination working group members., The assessment revealed high risks of trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), as well as conflict-related sexual violence, domestic violence, and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV). It revealed further protection concerns related to shelter and unsustainable housing (often heightening the risk of exploitive labor); a lack of access to livelihoods and cashbased assistance; and inconsistent access to reliable information. Overall, displaced persons throughout the region lack access to GBV services, reproductive healthcare, and psychosocial support services, and Roma and LGBTQIA+ communities face additional discrimination and protection concerns., In order for any humanitarian interventions to be effective, they must center the needs of women and girls and the security risks they face. Detailed recommendations for region-wide action are provided at the end of this report. Top priorities include the following:, Ensure a gender-sensitive humanitarian response by supporting women’s movements across the region. A commitment to sustaining the gains for women and girls made in previous decades must underpin all programming for internally displaced persons in Ukraine and FDPs in all border countries, with robust challenges to the inevitable patriarchal backlash., Fulfill commitments to localization by shifting power to women-led organizations. The localization agenda is focused on increasing local actors’ access to international humanitarian funding, partnerships, coordination spaces, and capacity building.3 Localization is one key to upholding the rights of women and girls in emergencies, as local women’s responses are often more relevant and effective than external ones., Address gaps in the protection of women and children. Given the unparalleled levels of funding that have gone into this response, along with the high level of humanitarian access to the border countries, it is paramount that essential life-saving protection interventions—detailed further in the report—are prioritized and strengthened., Improve access to essential services. As lack of access to essential and life-saving services is directly correlated with safety and security risks, all actors must take action to meet reception and integration needs for FDPs—including needs for healthcare, psychosocial support, safe accommodation, cash and voucher assistance, livelihoods support, and education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/regional-assessment-report-ukraine-crisis-response-waiting-sky-close-unprecedented-crisis-facing-women-and-girls-fleeing-ukraine

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (14 - 20 May 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,26 May 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued. In Tajikistan, police used lethal force against anti-government demonstrators. Meanwhile, demonstrations against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the killing of a journalist in Palestine, and LGBT+ discrimination took place across the region. In Russia, unidentified groups continued to target military enlistment offices with Molotov cocktails for the second consecutive week. Meanwhile, fighting continued on the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued last week, primarily in the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kharkiv regions. Russian forces gained full control of Mariupol, which had been under Russian siege since the beginning of March. Under agreements with Ukraine, Russian forces transported hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, many heavily wounded, from Mariupol to medical facilities in occupied territories on 16 May (The Guardian, 17 May 2022). On 21 May, the last group of Ukrainian soldiers trapped in the Azovstal plant in Mariupol surrendered to Russian forces (ISW, 21 May 2022). With the final capture of Mariupol, Russian forces intensified offensive operations in the rest of the Donetsk region but failed to secure any further significant territorial gains (ISW, 21 May 2022). In the Luhansk region, Russian forces reportedly suffered heavy losses last week during continued attempts to advance in the area of Severodonetsk (24 Channel, 19 May 2022). Meanwhile, following successful Ukrainian counterattacks around Kharkiv last week, Russian forces focused on maintaining their positions and strengthening defenses in the region (Unian, 17 May 2022)., Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure across Ukraine with shelling and missile attacks last week. On 17 May, Russia fired missiles at Desna in the Chernihiv region, destroying a residential building; 87 people were found dead under the rubble (Unian, 23 May 2022). This contributed to the 146% increase in violence in the Chernihiv region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker, which first warned of increased violence to come in Chernihiv in the past month. At least 22 more civilians were killed and 40 were wounded in Russian shelling of Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region on 16 and 19 May (24 Channel, 16 May 2022; Hromadske Radio, 19 May 2022). Deadly Russian shelling of residential areas was also recorded in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhia regions., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Austria, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Sweden last week. In Italy, anti-invasion activists occupied the headquarters of V-A-C Foundation in Venice, a contemporary art foundation founded by Leonid Mikhelson, a Russian oligarch and CEO of the Russian gas company Novatek (Artnet, 16 May 2022)., In Russia, unidentified individuals threw Molotov cocktails at four military enlistment offices across the country and shot at another one with a pneumatic weapon. This marks the second consecutive week of Molotov cocktail attacks on military enlistment offices. These trends contribute to the 142% increase in violence in Russia last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map; the tool first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., In Tajikistan, demonstrations against local authorities broke out in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) after authorities rejected a series of requests lodged by local residents calling for the resignation of the head of the region and the mayor of Khorog (IWPR, 20 May 2022). Hundreds of people participated in several demonstrations in Khorughi Bolo and Rushan, demanding the resignation of the officials over a number of mishaps, including their failure to investigate the death of a local resident in police custody in November last year (RFE/RL, 16 May 2022; RFE/RL, 25 November 2021). On 16 May, police used rubber bullets and tear gas against demonstrators, killing one person and injuring three. The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan denounced demonstrators as an organized criminal group and launched a “counter-terrorist operation” (RFE/RL, 18 May 2022), which led to the killing of more than 20 people in the following days. The violent police crackdown mainly targeted the Pamiri ethnic minority, which has suffered human rights abuses and discrimination by the Tajik regime for decades (The Guardian, 19 May 2022). Amid the violence, the government banned the media from covering events in the region and shut down internet and telecommunication services (Crisis24, 23 May 2022; Asia Plus, 17 May 2022)., The ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict prompted demonstrations across several countries in the region last week. The killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while she covered an Israeli military raid in the West Bank on 11 May, prompted demonstrations in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, and the United Kingdom last week. On 15 May, demonstrations commemorating Nakba Day — marking the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948 — were recorded in Germany and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, members of Palestine Action threw red paint and damaged property of defense company Elbit Systems in Bristol during a demonstration denouncing the company’s production of military hardware for the Israeli military., Meanwhile, pride parades and peaceful protests were held across multiple countries to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia on 17 May. Demonstrations denouncing discrimination against members of the LGBT+ community were observed in Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued last week, with fighting recorded mainly in the Shahumyan province. These trends contribute to the 400% increase in violence in Shahumyan over the past week relative to the past month, as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker. While claimed by the de facto state of Artsakh, Shahumyan is controlled almost entirely by Azerbaijan following gains in the war of 2020.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-14-20-may-2022

Safety and Security",26 May 2022,"Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a wide range of responders, both established organisations and first-time relief providers, have emerged to address the growing needs. At the national level, the Government of Ukraine (GoU) is attempting to centralise the reception and coordination of aid. At the oblast and local levels, the GoU, Oblast Military Administrations (OMAs), and hromadas (municipalities), alongside national and local NGOs and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, have been distributing and providing aid to the affected population. With the networks and connections they have previously built, especially with public administrations, national NGOs present prior to the 2022 invasion may have considerable capacity to engage in the response. Insecurity has disrupted the activities of some of those NGOs, however, and led their staff to evacuate, particularly in the conflict-affected areas., At the same time, civil society organisations (CSOs), faith-based networks, and a considerable amount of newly emerged volunteers and volunteer networks are providing vital humanitarian response, particularly at the local level. While their capacity may be limited, they are more agile in their ability to reach the affected population even in the most hazardous areas and may have a better understanding of local needs. Civil society sees their contributions to the humanitarian response as a way of participating in the national effort., The international response, consisting of UN agencies and INGOs, considerably scaled up its presence since February, but a strong national response with its own coordination, processing, and delivery procedures characterises the environment it operates in. Population displacement, conflict dynamics, and differing local implementations of national directives mean that international organisations juggle supporting government entities, operating with established humanitarian responders, and establishing new relationships with more fluid ad hoc networks., The multitude of different responders involved at the local level, both new and established, has led to a number of issues, including parallel structures and a lack of respective understanding of how different levels of response are working to address needs. The ways in which the response operates (in terms of the coordination and delivery of assistance) considerably vary by oblast and even hromada. It has been impossible to quantify the impact and reach of the response of local formal and informal organisations, networks, and volunteers., These challenges make it difficult for local and international responders to effectively work together and create cohesion between the different levels of response. Regardless of the challenges, the GoU, NGOs, the international humanitarian system, and informal structures all play an important role in the response, demonstrating a need to enhance relationships, collaboration, and information-sharing between local and international levels of response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-ukraine-bridging-humanitarian-response-25-may-2022

Health",2 May 2022,"UNICEF, UNHCR, the Global Nutrition Cluster, the IFE core group, and partners call for ALL involved in the response to the Ukraine Crisisto protect, promote, and support the feeding and care of infants and young children and their mothers as well as pregnant women.This is critical to support maternal and child health and survival, growth, and development and to prevent malnutrition., This joint statement has been issued to help secure immediate, coordinated, multi-sectoral action on infant and young child feeding (IYCF)., The expansion of the conflict is projected to deepen and increase humanitarian needs for millions of Ukrainians. Refugees, families displaced within Ukraine, and those affected by conflict in their place of residence are likely to be in an extremely difficult situation facing high levels of stress and uncertainty, food shortages, unsanitary conditions, risk of communicable diseases, and significant protection threats., Globally Recommended Maternal, Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices, Early initiation of breastfeeding (uninterrupted skin to skin contact immediately after birth and putting baby to the breast within 1 hour of birth), Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months (no food or liquid other than breastmilk, not even water unless medically indicated), Introduction of age-appropriate, safe, and nutritionally adequate complementary feeding from 6 months of age onwards; and, Continued breastfeeding for 2 years or beyond., Ensure pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, have priority access to food and non-food items., In all emergencies, the youngest children are at the highest risk of illness and mortality. Infants who are not breastfed are especially vulnerable, as the normal environment for accessing and hygienically preparing infant formula is disrupted. This is a concern in Ukraine, where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are low, and a high percentage of infants are partially or fully dependent on infant formula., Interventions to support pregnant women, mothers, and their children should consider:, Support mothers to initiate and continue breastfeeding as a priority to help protect their health and well-being and that of their infants. Although stress can temporarily interfere with the flow of breast milk in some women, it is not likely to inhibit breast milk production provided mothers and infants remain together and are supported to initiate and continue frequent breastfeeding. This support entails practical support with attachment and positioning for breastfeeding, confidence building, facilitating skin to skin contact and keeping mother and infant together (e.g., provide baby carriers/slings). It is recommended to draw upon existing breastfeeding support organizations and individual lactation specialists from Ukraine and surrounding countries for additional guidance., Keep mothers and babies together, even if ill with COVID-19 or variant. Mothers can breastfeed even if they are pregnant or if they become ill, including with COVID-19. If ill, antibodies in their milk will help protect their babies. Anyone who is holding or feeding a baby (whether breastfeeding or feeding with a breastmilk substitute) should wear a mask and wash their hands before feeding the child., Support and protect the nutritional needs of infants and young children who are not breastfed and minimise the risks they are exposed to. Infants who are exclusively dependent on infant formula are highly vulnerable in conflict situations and should be urgently identified, assessed, and supplied with a package of essential support. This package should include adequate breastmilk substitute (powdered infant formula or ready to use infant formula) supplies, equipment and supplies for hygienic storage, preparation and cup feeding, practical training on hygienic preparation and storage, and counselling on responsive feeding. The support should also provide for regular follow-up at designated transit centres, reception centres, UNHCR-UNICEF Blue Dot Hubs and congregation areas within host countries, as well as at Blue Dot Hubs, Red Cross, and other service providers within Ukraine. Mothers who are mixed feeding should be encouraged and supported to increase their breastmilk supply and/or return to exclusive breastfeeding., In accordance with Ukraine and EU regulations as well as those of other host countries, do not call for, support, accept or distribute donations of Breast Milk Substitutes (BMS), including infant formula, other milk products, commercial complementary foods, and feeding equipment (such as bottles, teats, and breast pumps). Required BMS supplies should be purchased (by the caregiver, procured by UNICEF or other partners in line with the WHO International Code of Marketing and Breast Milk Substitutes, ‘the Code’, and subsequent WHA resolutions) and provided as part of a sustained package of coordinated care based on assessed need and should be Code-compliant. Donor human milk should not be sent unless based on an identified need and in coordination with state/local medical authorities or UN agencies coordinated intervention that must include a functional cold chain. For infants 6–23 months of age, acceptable milk sources include full-cream animal milk (cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, camel), Ultra High Temperature (UHT) milk, reconstituted evaporated (but not condensed) milk, fermented milk, or yogurt, and expressed breast milk. Any animal milk given to infants <12 months should be boiled and left to cool before giving the milk., Ensure the availability and continuity of nutritious, appropriate, and fresh food for children, pregnant women, and postpartum and breastfeeding women. Where there are identified shortfalls in local access and availability of foods, facilitate access to age-appropriate and safe, complementary foods for children 6–23 months, older children, and for their caregivers, with particular attention to pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women. In all contexts, promote access through inclusion of women and children into national social safety nets and, where access is limited, through direct cash support., Ensure pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, and other caretakers of young children have priority access to food and non-food items including appropriate clothing, water, protection, accommodation, psychosocial support, and other interventions to meet their essential needs. Consider how women in transit can be supported to minimize distress during their journey. At all service points, provide safe and comfortable spaces for mothers and caretakers to feed and care for their infants., Identify higher risk infants, children, and women and respond to their needs. These include (but are not limited to) pregnant women; newborns, low birth weight infants; malnourished children, including infants under 6 months of age; children with disabilities; children experiencing issues with feeding; HIV exposed infants; orphaned infants; in addition, promote the identification of institutionalized children; women who are malnourished or severely ill; women who are experiencing stress and anxiety; instances where mothers are separated from their children., We encourage you to orientate your staff to raise awareness of the contents of this position statement If you would like to translate this document, please contact: ife@ennonline.net, For more information:, In Ukraine: Kateryna Bulavinova — kbulavinova@unicef.org, Refugee hosting countries: UNHCR Public Health & Nutrition: hqphn@unhcr.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-protecting-infant-and-young-child-feeding-practices-ukraine-conflict-and-refugee-crisis-enuk

Health",2 May 2022,"UNICEF, UNHCR, the Global Nutrition Cluster, the IFE core group, and partners call for ALL involved in the response to the Ukraine Crisisto protect, promote, and support the feeding and care of infants and young children and their mothers as well as pregnant women.This is critical to support maternal and child health and survival, growth, and development and to prevent malnutrition., This joint statement has been issued to help secure immediate, coordinated, multi-sectoral action on infant and young child feeding (IYCF)., The expansion of the conflict is projected to deepen and increase humanitarian needs for millions of Ukrainians. Refugees, families displaced within Ukraine, and those affected by conflict in their place of residence are likely to be in an extremely difficult situation facing high levels of stress and uncertainty, food shortages, unsanitary conditions, risk of communicable diseases, and significant protection threats., Globally Recommended Maternal, Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices, Early initiation of breastfeeding (uninterrupted skin to skin contact immediately after birth and putting baby to the breast within 1 hour of birth), Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months (no food or liquid other than breastmilk, not even water unless medically indicated), Introduction of age-appropriate, safe, and nutritionally adequate complementary feeding from 6 months of age onwards; and, Continued breastfeeding for 2 years or beyond., Ensure pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, have priority access to food and non-food items., In all emergencies, the youngest children are at the highest risk of illness and mortality. Infants who are not breastfed are especially vulnerable, as the normal environment for accessing and hygienically preparing infant formula is disrupted. This is a concern in Ukraine, where rates of exclusive breastfeeding are low, and a high percentage of infants are partially or fully dependent on infant formula., Interventions to support pregnant women, mothers, and their children should consider:, Support mothers to initiate and continue breastfeeding as a priority to help protect their health and well-being and that of their infants. Although stress can temporarily interfere with the flow of breast milk in some women, it is not likely to inhibit breast milk production provided mothers and infants remain together and are supported to initiate and continue frequent breastfeeding. This support entails practical support with attachment and positioning for breastfeeding, confidence building, facilitating skin to skin contact and keeping mother and infant together (e.g., provide baby carriers/slings). It is recommended to draw upon existing breastfeeding support organizations and individual lactation specialists from Ukraine and surrounding countries for additional guidance., Keep mothers and babies together, even if ill with COVID-19 or variant. Mothers can breastfeed even if they are pregnant or if they become ill, including with COVID-19. If ill, antibodies in their milk will help protect their babies. Anyone who is holding or feeding a baby (whether breastfeeding or feeding with a breastmilk substitute) should wear a mask and wash their hands before feeding the child., Support and protect the nutritional needs of infants and young children who are not breastfed and minimise the risks they are exposed to. Infants who are exclusively dependent on infant formula are highly vulnerable in conflict situations and should be urgently identified, assessed, and supplied with a package of essential support. This package should include adequate breastmilk substitute (powdered infant formula or ready to use infant formula) supplies, equipment and supplies for hygienic storage, preparation and cup feeding, practical training on hygienic preparation and storage, and counselling on responsive feeding. The support should also provide for regular follow-up at designated transit centres, reception centres, UNHCR-UNICEF Blue Dot Hubs and congregation areas within host countries, as well as at Blue Dot Hubs, Red Cross, and other service providers within Ukraine. Mothers who are mixed feeding should be encouraged and supported to increase their breastmilk supply and/or return to exclusive breastfeeding., In accordance with Ukraine and EU regulations as well as those of other host countries, do not call for, support, accept or distribute donations of Breast Milk Substitutes (BMS), including infant formula, other milk products, commercial complementary foods, and feeding equipment (such as bottles, teats, and breast pumps). Required BMS supplies should be purchased (by the caregiver, procured by UNICEF or other partners in line with the WHO International Code of Marketing and Breast Milk Substitutes, ‘the Code’, and subsequent WHA resolutions) and provided as part of a sustained package of coordinated care based on assessed need and should be Code-compliant. Donor human milk should not be sent unless based on an identified need and in coordination with state/local medical authorities or UN agencies coordinated intervention that must include a functional cold chain. For infants 6–23 months of age, acceptable milk sources include full-cream animal milk (cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, camel), Ultra High Temperature (UHT) milk, reconstituted evaporated (but not condensed) milk, fermented milk, or yogurt, and expressed breast milk. Any animal milk given to infants <12 months should be boiled and left to cool before giving the milk., Ensure the availability and continuity of nutritious, appropriate, and fresh food for children, pregnant women, and postpartum and breastfeeding women. Where there are identified shortfalls in local access and availability of foods, facilitate access to age-appropriate and safe, complementary foods for children 6–23 months, older children, and for their caregivers, with particular attention to pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women. In all contexts, promote access through inclusion of women and children into national social safety nets and, where access is limited, through direct cash support., Ensure pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, and other caretakers of young children have priority access to food and non-food items including appropriate clothing, water, protection, accommodation, psychosocial support, and other interventions to meet their essential needs. Consider how women in transit can be supported to minimize distress during their journey. At all service points, provide safe and comfortable spaces for mothers and caretakers to feed and care for their infants., Identify higher risk infants, children, and women and respond to their needs. These include (but are not limited to) pregnant women; newborns, low birth weight infants; malnourished children, including infants under 6 months of age; children with disabilities; children experiencing issues with feeding; HIV exposed infants; orphaned infants; in addition, promote the identification of institutionalized children; women who are malnourished or severely ill; women who are experiencing stress and anxiety; instances where mothers are separated from their children., We encourage you to orientate your staff to raise awareness of the contents of this position statement If you would like to translate this document, please contact: ife@ennonline.net, For more information:, In Ukraine: Kateryna Bulavinova — kbulavinova@unicef.org, Refugee hosting countries: UNHCR Public Health & Nutrition: hqphn@unhcr.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-protecting-infant-and-young-child-feeding-practices-ukraine-conflict-and-refugee-crisis-enuk
"Atrocity Alert No. 302: Ukraine, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Food Insecurity",News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",25 May 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., FIRST TRIALS BEGIN AMIDST MOUNTING EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE, On 23 May Russian Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin was convicted of shooting and killing a civilian, Oleksandr Shelipov, in the Sumy region of Ukraine on 28 February, and sentenced to life in prison in the first trial for abuses committed since the Russian invasion started three months ago. According to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, Shishimarin and other Russian troops encountered Shelipov and shot at him to prevent him from relaying their position to Ukrainian authorities. Shishimarin’s defense claimed he shot at Shelipov after refusing multiple orders to do so, fearing for his own safety., This inaugural trial takes place as evidence continues to mount of atrocities being committed in Ukraine. Prosecutor General Venediktova indicated that her office is preparing cases against 41 Russian soldiers for various offenses that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including targeting civilian infrastructure, targeted killings of civilians, rape and sexual violence, and looting. The prosecutor’s office announced it is investigating over 13,000 possible war crimes that involve over 600 suspects, including Russian military and government officials., Evidence of abuses continues to be gathered by the UN and non-governmental organizations. On 18 May Human Rights Watch released a report documenting apparent war crimes carried out by Russian soldiers in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, including summary executions, unlawful killings, enforced disappearances and torture between 27 February and 14 March. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also documented the apparent use of indiscriminate weapons by Ukrainian forces causing civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects in eastern Ukraine. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has confirmed at least 3,900 civilians have been killed, including 250 children, while acknowledging the real toll is likely much higher., Fighting remains ongoing in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russian forces seemingly aim to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks in Donbas have utterly devastated the area, stating that “it’s hell there, and that’s no exaggeration.”, Since 24 February the conflict has internally displaced 8 million people and forced an additional 6 million to flee across the border. According to the UN Refugee Agency, “the Ukraine warand other conflicts pushed the number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution over the staggering milestone of 100 million for the first time on record.”, Ensuring accountability and justice for crimes committed in Ukraine is paramount to ending further violations. The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect’s expert on the situation in Ukraine, Sarah Hunter, said “while we should commend these early trials, as well as the extensive evidence collected by international mechanisms that may be used in future accountability proceedings, both parties currently seem committed to military gains and civilian harm has not subsided. International efforts should focus on restarting communication towards peace.” The international community must support efforts to ensure trials are impartial and include all perpetrators, regardless of rank, nationality or affiliation., OVER 1,000 PALESTINIANS FACING IMMINENT RISK OF FORCIBLE TRANSFER, On 4 May the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected appeals against eviction orders issued to Palestinian inhabitants of a collection of villages known as Masafer Yatta in the occupied West Bank. The ruling ends two decades of legal proceedings and allows the Israeli government to forcibly evict the 1,200 Palestinians, including 500 children, in Masafer Yatta in order to repurpose the land for military use. Demolitions of Palestinian homes and workshops in Masafer Yatta have already begun. Forced evictions, arbitrary displacement and forcible transfer of Palestinian communities are serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law., UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), Lynn Hastings, called on Israel to cease all demolitions and evictions in line with its international law obligations. A group of UN Special Rapporteurs also raised alarm, stating that, “by upholding this policy to drive Palestinians out of Masafer Yatta, the Israeli judicial system has given carte blanche to the Israeli Government,” emphasizing that a judiciary “that perpetuates the violations of fundamental human rights of people who have been under military occupation for 55 years, becomes itself part of the structural system of oppression.”, According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least 911 Palestinian-owned structures were demolished or seized by Israeli government authorities in 2021, forcibly displacing over 1,200 Palestinians. An additional 257 structures have been demolished in 2022 so far. Many of these demolitions take place in order to make way for illegal Israeli settlements., The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the OPT determined in July 2021 that Israel’s illegal settlement expansion aims to permanently alter the ethnic demographics of occupied Palestine and amounts to a war crime. Israel’s plans to expand Jewish settlements on occupied land also involves increasingly harsh methods of subjugation of Palestinians. In 2021 violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers against Palestinians reached the highest level ever recorded, with over 490 violent attacks directed against rural Palestinian families., The international community must impose accountability measures on Israel as an occupying power that is perpetrating possible atrocity crimes, including forcible transfer. UN member states must also use all available diplomatic, political and economic measures prescribed by the UN Charter to halt Israeli violations. The government of Israel must immediately comply with international law obligations and cease demolitions and evictions targeting Palestinians., WORLDWIDE HUNGER CATASTROPHE FUELED BY CONFLICT AND ATROCITIES, According to the World Food Programme (WFP), over 276 million people are facing acute hunger around the world and the conflict in Ukraine may push an additional 46 million people to severe food insecurity. The conflict has global implications resulting from economic sanctions and Russia and Ukraine’s role as major exporters of grain and cooking oils., On 19 May the UN Security Council (UNSC) held a debate on conflict and food insecurity in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, which has added a “frightening new dimension” to global hunger. Marking the fourth anniversary of UNSC Resolution 2417 on 24 May, Margot van der Velden, Head of the Emergencies Department at the WFP, asserted that, “the Ukraine conflict has caused upheaval in global food and energy markets, with soaring food and fuel prices putting millions at risk of hunger across the world.”, Food security inevitably deteriorates when communities are forcibly displaced from their homes, land and jobs due to fighting. Similarly, hunger can exacerbate conflict, as food shortages deepen existing grievances, fueling tensions that may incite violence. According to the WFP, 60 percent of the world’s hungry people live in conflict zones, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In all of these countries, populations are also facing atrocity crimes. According to the International Rescue Committee, the current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan – which has deepened since the Taliban takeover in August 2021 – could result in more deaths “than twenty years of war.”, Parties to conflicts around the world have also used deliberate starvation as a tactic of war. Throughout the conflict in northern Ethiopia, there have been widespread reports of the deliberate burning of crops, looting of warehouses and aid convoys, and slaughtering of livestock. UN officials have asserted that access to food has been used as a weapon of war. In Yemen humanitarian aid has been systematically blocked, resulting in the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, and UN experts have reported that parties to the conflict may have used starvation of civilians as a military tactic. Starvation as a weapon of war may constitute a war crime and is prohibited under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and customary law., Food should never be weaponized. Under IHL access to humanitarian relief and lifesaving goods are protected. The international community must support more long-term investment in development to break the deadly cycle of hunger and conflict by providing additional resources towards political solutions to end conflicts and prevent their occurrence, as well as strengthening sustainable food systems to protect them from future shock.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-302-ukraine-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory-and-food-insecurity

Ukraine/Russia: Violations of cultural rights will impede post-war healing – UN expert,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",25 May 2022,"GENEVA (25 May 2022) – The multi-layered violations of cultural rights in Ukraine will have devastating effects in the post-war era, a UN human rights expert warned today., “As in other conflicts, we currently witness the unfolding of suffering in Ukraine that does not seem to end and we cannot stop,” said Alexandra Xanthaki, Special Rapporteur on cultural rights. “The questioning and denial of the Ukrainian identity and history as a justification for war, is a violation of the Ukrainians’ right to self-determination and their cultural rights., “Self-identification is the paramount expression of these rights and all discussions, by States and in social media, should respect this.”, The expert said that the considerable loss of cultural heritage and destruction of cultural artefacts was worrying for the identity of both Ukrainians and minorities within Ukraine, and would impact the establishment of a peaceful multicultural society after the end of the war., Xanthaki expressed her concern over the damage of city centres, cultural sites and monuments and museums housing important collections. “These are all part of the identity of people in Ukraine; their loss will have a lasting effect,” the expert said. She shared UNESCO’s concern that cultural life in its entirety is at risk of disappearing., The expert said the cultural rights of all individuals, including Ukrainians, Russians and other members of minorities living within Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and elsewhere must be fully respected and protected., “As the battles rage on, we are not completely powerless,” she said. “Beyond recalling that the rules of international humanitarian and human rights law should be scrupulously applied by all parties to the conflict, we must ensure that culture helps us maintain our dignity and is not used as a means to pursue and fuel the war., “We often do not measure how devastating violations of cultural rights can be for peace. Attempts against academic and artistic freedoms, linguistic rights, falsification and distortion of historical facts, denigration of identities and denial of the right to self-determination result to further degeneration and fueling of open conflict.”, The expert paid tribute to many cultural professionals in Ukraine devoted to protecting the heritage resources in danger and resorting to artistic expression to express their rejection of the war and call for peace., The Special Rapporteur also expressed her regret about the indiscriminate exclusion of Russian artists from cultural events. “I am saddened by the numerous restrictions affecting Russian artists in retaliation for the actions of the Russian Government, as well as by the deprogramming of sometimes centuries-old works of art from Russian writers or composers”. Xanthaki referred to reports of Russian musicians impeded from performing or taking part in competitions, and of Russian artists requested to publicly take sides., “It is especially in this situation of continuous dehumanization, that culture and cultural rights must be visible and visibly push for humanity, empathy and peaceful co-existence,” she said., ENDS, Alexandra Xanthaki (Greece) was appointed UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights in October 2021. Ms. Xanthaki works as a Professor of Laws at Brunel University London, United Kingdom. Throughout her academic career, Ms. Xanthaki has published over 50 publications relating to the cultural rights of minorities and indigenous peoples, cultural diversity, cultural heritage, balancing cultural rights with other rights and interests, and multiculturalism and integration in international human rights law. She has worked with NGOs, civil society and has consulted States on such issues., Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 24 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,25 May 2022,"Date: 25 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 24 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 8,628 civilian casualties in the country: 3,974 killed and 4,654 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 23 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 24 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 24 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-24-may-2022-enruuk

Protection and Human Rights",24 May 2022,"Every year Crisis Group publishes two additional Watch List updates that complement its annual Watch List for the EU, most recently published in January 2022. These publications identify major crises and conflict situations where the European Union and its member states can generate stronger prospects for peace. The two additional updates include an overview of the policy environment and main challenges for the European Union and five crises and conflict situations, which can update those identified in the annual Watch List or present a new focus of concern. For each of the five cases included in this update, Crisis Group provides field-based analysis and specific policy advice to the European Union and its member states, with the aim to guide and improve their efforts to prevent, mitigate or end conflicts., CONTENT - President’s Take - Reuniting Libya, Divided Once More - Mali: Staying Engaged Despite Souring Relations - New Opportunities for Mediation in Nagorno-Karabakh - Keeping Turmoil at Bay in Pakistan’s Polarised Polity - The Ukraine War: Europe’s Critical Challenge, President’s Take, Europeans have entered a new world since January, when Crisis Group published its 2022 EU Watch List. Back then, Russian troops were massing near Ukraine’s border. Western intelligence reports warned that an invasion could be on the cards, causing considerable disquiet in European capitals, but Moscow still insisted that its soldiers were merely conducting exercises. Then, on 24 February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion, turning what had been a grinding standoff in Ukraine’s east into a quest to conquer the whole country. The war has wreaked destruction on much of Ukraine, killing perhaps tens of thousands, displacing some 14 million, many of whom have fled to EU countries, and upending European security. The fighting has not gone Russia’s way, to put it mildly. The Kremlin, encountering much fiercer Ukrainian resistance than it anticipated, has for now abandoned efforts to take Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and is concentrating forces in the country’s south and east. The invasion has united NATO and the West more broadly – the opposite of what Moscow intended. Many countries in the Global South, however, have been wary of picking sides.
The war is the gravest threat to international peace and security in decades. To be clear, it does not matter more to Crisis Group because it’s in Europe; every death, every casualty, every person displaced due to war is a tragedy, no matter where it happens. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the biggest violation of another country’s sovereignty since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Especially perilously, it pits Russia, the state with the largest nuclear stockpile in the world, against a smaller neighbour backed by NATO powers, three of which are themselves nucleararmed. There is a real danger of things spiralling into direct war between Russia and NATO, a confrontation that could quickly turn nuclear., Russia’s invasion poses big dilemmas for European leaders. In Ukraine, they must balance competing imperatives: supporting Kyiv, while minimising risks of escalation into a direct NATO-Russia clash and ideally creating incentives for an end – even if it starts as a temporary pause – to the war, on terms Ukrainians can accept. European capitals must prepare for what comes next, particularly as it relates to Europe’s security architecture and the EU itself. They must adapt to a world in which Russia-West hostility is ever more ferocious, doing as much as possible to insulate other crisis management from acrimony. They also need to respond to the cascade of pernicious effects the war has unleashed upon global food and energy prices and supplies, for which some governments blame Western sanctions as much as the Kremlin’s aggression., In Ukraine itself, if Russia has tempered its goals, the risks of escalation are no less severe; indeed, they are perhaps higher now than ever. Western governments are pumping in more and more powerful weaponry, partly because Ukraine’s Sovietera supplies have dried up and partly because, thus far, Russia has done little in response. Some Western leaders have stepped up rhetoric alongside arms supplies, suggesting that their long-term goals are to debilitate Russia and bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to heel. It’s not hard to see things spinning out of control., Clearly, Western arms supplies are critical for helping Ukraine hold the line and securing a settlement it can live with, but Western leaders still need to steer clear of tactics and language that carry too grave a risk of provoking a Russia-NATO war. As our entry below details, that means refraining from providing training to Ukrainian forces on Ukrainian soil and continuing to avoid their own forces’ engagement, all while trying to introduce greater oversight regarding the weapons flowing in. It means emphasising that they will take their cues from Kyiv as to what peace deal or other violence reduction arrangements are acceptable: neither pressuring Ukraine to agree to something not in its interests – a ceasefire whose terms lay the ground for a fresh Russian offensive, for example – nor using language suggesting that Ukrainian victory requires immediate Russian acceptance of Kyiv’s control over all Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea, let alone Putin’s downfall. European leaders should also ponder which sanctions levelled against Russia they might lift if there is a deal acceptable to Ukraine., Beyond Ukraine, the war’s implications for Europe’s security architecture are already far-reaching. It has breathed new life into both NATO and the EU itself. In mid-May, Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership – their break with long traditions of neutrality is a direct response to changed perceptions about the menace Moscow’s belligerence and unpredictability pose. If their membership goes ahead, as appears likely, it would reinforce the alliance’s deterrence and provide further reassurance to the Baltic states, offering substantial capabilities and strategic depth. The very act of their joining would contribute to what looks set to be a large NATO-scale buildup in the east. That said, both countries’ ties to NATO were already tight and their militaries largely interoperable, meaning that their entry into the alliance would not significantly alter Europe’s strategic balance. Thus far, Moscow has said it will cut off gas supplies to Finland in response, but beyond that its rhetoric has been fairly restrained. Nor, sensibly, have Western capitals been especially inflammatory in talking about Finnish and Swedish membership. While new deployments to the Baltics are likely, it is not clear that anything extra to their own considerable capabilities will be deployed to Sweden or Finland themselves., As for the EU, Russia’s invasion has given new impetus to the stalled enlargement process, accelerated defence integration plans and rekindled its ambition to scale up political and trade relations with former Soviet republics. Broadly speaking, the challenge for the EU, as it reinvigorates ties with eastern neighbours, is to avoid fuelling unrealistic expectations for EU accession that could easily undercut Brussels’ credibility. European leaders should make clear that accession is a long and hard-to-accelerate process, but that they can develop other forms of closer association that can have earlier tangible benefits for neighbours, even as they plough ahead with the accession track., Overall, the collapse of Russia-West relations looks set to deepen already dismal trends in multilateral crisis management. True, we should not yet despair. At the UN Security Council, Ukraine hasn’t seeped into all files: in fact, Russia has yet to veto anything not Ukraine-related in 2022. Nor has renewed Russia-West hostility much affected the Iran nuclear talks: the main sticking point now – the U.S. designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organisation doesn’t involve Moscow. Recent truces in Ethiopia’s and Yemen’s catastrophic wars weren’t Ukraine-linked but show that peacemaking can trundle along and opportunities arise notwithstanding broken geopolitics. Still, despite small glimmers of light, the Ukraine war bodes awfully for collective efforts to end crises. The Security Council itself, gridlocked on major crises for years, could well become even less effective. Many efforts to end or head off crises worldwide could be doomed if bad blood from Ukraine spills across multilateral diplomacy.
The EU and European leaders should try not to let that happen. It’s not only about European states on the Security Council trying to firewall disputes over Ukraine from other Council business. The entries below show how important that is more broadly. In Nagorno-Karabakh, Brussels will need to cooperate, at least to some degree, with Moscow to avert another bout of fighting and push Azerbaijan and Armenia toward steps that could shore up the region’s stability. Russia needs to be involved in diplomacy to help Libyan factions resolve their new political standoff. If including Moscow openly proves too hard on either of these files, Brussels and European capitals should at least maintain discreet or, if necessary, indirect lines to the Kremlin., Nor should European leaders be too quick to write off relations with countries edging closer to Moscow. As our entry below details, former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s anti-Western rhetoric and ill-judged visit to Moscow on the day of Russia’s invasion strained Islamabad’s relations with Brussels. Yet the new government that has since come to power quickly signalled that it wants to turn the page on the quarrels of the Khan years, which Europe should welcome. In Mali, relations have deteriorated further still, partly due to the coup leaders’ refusal to hand over power to civilians and partly to their increasing reliance on the Wagner Group, a Russia-based private military contractor closely associated with the Kremlin. Both concerns predated Ukraine, but Western disquiet about Wagner has heightened since Russia’s invasion. Yet in Mali too – as our entry lays out – opportunities may yet appear for the EU to turn the page, in this case by supporting a transition, particularly if the regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States, can nudge the authorities in the right direction., Lastly, the EU should do whatever it can to help countries cope with the global commodities crisis that is another horrific side effect of the war. For many countries already buffeted by COVID-related shocks, potentially disastrous gaps in food, fertiliser and other goods loom., Several factors lie beneath shortages and price hikes. The main ones are the war itself and Russia’s de facto blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, which hinder the export of Ukrainian grain and other exports (land routes are congested and much less efficient). Russia has stopped exporting its own grain and other cereals, as well as fertiliser – none of which are actually under sanction. Sanctions do play a role, though: the blacklisting of key financial intermediaries has upset trade in commodities and deterred insurance companies from covering Russian maritime shipping, inhibiting their operations. Perhaps as important are the jitters generated in global markets by the war and sanctions. The grain market was tight before the war; now India – partly due also to extreme weather – and more than a dozen other countries have imposed food export bans as a hedge against domestic shortfalls., The commodities crisis is reverberating worldwide but its brunt will be borne by those who can least afford it. Even countries that have ways to buffer shocks will find those hard to sustain the longer the crisis endures. Foreign debts ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many states with little fiscal headroom and vulnerable to default. Global price hikes do not necessarily fuel unrest, but for many countries, especially those whose social contracts the pandemic has already torn at, further instability is all too plausible. The war is further testing a global humanitarian aid system that for the past few years has been creaking at the seams. Even before the war in Ukraine, funding shortfalls had forced cuts in life-saving aid to seventeen countries in Africa, plus places including Syria and Yemen. These countries are bracing for further cuts, which will mean yet more suffering for the world’s most vulnerable.
International action so far has focused on increasing emergency aid, mainly by providing the money necessary to procure food supplies at today’s higher prices., The U.S. contribution has been substantial, including an additional $4.3 billion for food and other humanitarian aid that President Joe Biden signed into law on 21 May. The EU has reallocated some existing development and humanitarian funding and mobilised additional aid to respond to these emergencies, while also supporting member states and multilateral initiatives. In May, the G7 presidency and the World Bank, with participation from the European Commission, launched the Global Alliance for Food Security, which will coordinate the efforts of various UN agencies and the African Union. Whether through this initiative or others, the EU and its member states should further increase their aid contributions., The current attention to food aid is entirely appropriate given the severity of the crisis. The shock waves will grow in the months ahead, affecting not only food but economic systems more broadly. But supporting the demand for food should not be the EU’s (or the world’s) only concern. States and multilateral institutions also need to work on the supply side of the equation, to reestablish the smooth functioning of global supply chains for food, fuel, fertiliser and other commodities, if they hope to escape the reactive posture they find themselves in today., The war in Ukraine poses Europe its biggest test in a generation and, however it ends, will reshape the continent’s security. Supporting Ukraine, while avoiding policies that run too high a risk of escalation with Russia; preparing for what comes next; all while avoiding a global standoff that would spoil crisis diplomacy elsewhere; and, crucially, mitigating the food shortages and price hikes that the war has triggered will be no small challenge for European leaders. This Watch List Update sets out some guideposts for these efforts., Comfort Ero, Crisis Group President & CEO May 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/watch-list-2022-spring-update-may-2022
"Joint Statement from the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the establishment of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA) for Ukraine",News and Press Release,EC,Protection and Human Rights,25 May 2022,"Today, the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom announced the creation of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group (ACA), a mechanism aimed at ensuring efficient coordination of their respective support to accountability efforts on the ground. The ACA will reinforce current EU, US and UK efforts to further accountability for atrocity crimes in the context of Russia’s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. It advances commitments made by the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to demonstrate international support and solidarity at this crucial historical moment for Ukraine., The overarching mission of the ACA is to support the War Crimes Units of the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine (OPG) in its investigation and prosecution of conflict-related crimes. The ACA seeks to streamline coordination and communication efforts to ensure best practices, avoid duplication of efforts, and encourage the expeditious deployment of financial resources and skilled personnel to respond to the needs of the OPG as the legally constituted authority in Ukraine responsible for dealing with the prosecution of war crimes on its own territory., EU High Representative/Vice-President Josep Borrell said: “It is critical to ensure that all those responsible for the terrible atrocities committed during the unprovoked Russian military aggression in Ukraine are brought to justice. There can be no impunity for war crimes. The Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group will be providing advice and supporting the ongoing efforts of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s War Crimes Units to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence of atrocities to help the investigations and ensure justice takes its course.”, US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said: “This initiative will directly support efforts by the Ukrainian Office of the Prosecutor General to document, preserve, and analyze evidence of war crimes and other atrocities committed by members of Russia’s forces in Ukraine, with a view toward criminal prosecutions. The ACA is an essential element of the United States’ commitment that those responsible for such crimes will be held to account.”, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “We are determined to ensure those responsible for the vile atrocities committed in Ukraine are held to account. The UK has already made a clear commitment to supporting Ukraine in its investigations, including through deploying war crimes experts to the region and releasing additional funding to aid the ICC in their investigations. We are now stepping up our efforts through this landmark initiative with our partners in the US and EU. Justice will be done.”, General Prosecutor of Ukraine, Iryna Venediktova said: “There is ample evidence of the atrocities committed by Russia’s forces on the territory of Ukraine against civilians, including children. The creation of this support group and the advice of international experts with experience in other international criminal tribunals and national criminal law practice will help the ongoing work of our teams in investigating and prosecuting these crimes.”, Operational support, The ACA will bring together multinational experts to provide strategic advice and operational assistance to OPG specialists and other stakeholders in areas such as collection and preservation of evidence, operational analysis, investigation of conflict-related sexual violence, crime scene and forensic investigations, drafting of indictments, and co-operation with international and national accountability mechanisms. This engagement with the OPG and other justice, law enforcement and security agencies of Ukraine has been and will continue to be driven by the needs of the Ukrainian government and the parameters of its support will be developed in close consultation with the OPG. To this end, it will closely associate its activities with the ongoing operational work taking place in cooperation with EU Member States, partner third countries and the International Criminal Court, including the Joint Investigation Team coordinated by Eurojust., The ACA brings together a multi-national group of war crimes experts from European Union countries, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. Due to the current security situation in Ukraine, the experts are primarily based in south-eastern Poland but are operationally engaged in Ukraine, including by means of short-term missions and on-site interaction with the OPG staff and other international partners engaged. As the security situation permits, it is anticipated that experts and support staff will relocate entirely to Ukraine., The ACA activity will cover coordination of two key elements: , • Advisory Group to the OPG: Experienced senior war crimes prosecutors, investigators, military analysts, forensic specialists, and other experts based in the region on an ongoing basis provide expertise, mentoring, advice and operational support to the OPG and to the field-level Mobile Justice Teams, as well as a wider range of state and non-state actors., • Mobile Justice Teams: Several Mobile Justice Teams (MJTs) are being created and deployed to increase the capacity of the OPG War Crimes Unit and regional prosecutors to conduct field investigations. The MJTs will be composed of both international and Ukrainian experts and will be deployed at the request of the OPG to assist Ukraine’s investigators on the ground. They will be part of the holistic chain for documentation, investigation and prosecution of grave international crimes that is led by the OPG., The ACA is supported by the U.S. State Department’s Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ) and Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). ACA partners include the Arizona State University Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law, Global Rights Compliance, and the International Development Law Organization (IDLO).

The chain of aid consists of thousands of hard-working workers and volunteers,News and Press Release,Finnish Red Cross,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items",25 May 2022,"People who have fled the conflict in Ukraine and volunteers and workers of the Red Cross shed light on what everyday life is like in the middle of a humanitarian crisis., The conflict in Ukraine has forced more than 13 million people to flee their homes. The crisis has caused human distress and suffering but it has also inspired people to lend a helping hand. This is reflected in the following photos and stories collected by the Finnish Red Cross’ communications delegates Ville Palonen and Leena Reikko., Aid given and received in Ukraine, Luda Ostoparentsko, her children and cat fled Mariupol for Lviv in western Ukraine in early May. The father of the family is a migrant worker in the Czech Republic and Luda is planning on fleeing there as well with her children., “We were too scared to stay at home any longer,” she explains., The family was grateful for the Red Cross’ food aid., Many refugees remain in Ukraine. They have been accommodated in school buildings, for example. Approximately 80 refugees are spending their nights in school number 52 in Lviv. The Red Cross provides aid to these refugees., The team of aid workers also includes teachers. Svitlana Kutjanska and Oksana Lavalen help prepare food for the refugees and clean the school, in addition to teaching children remotely. Sometimes, they babysit children when their parents must be somewhere else., Olga Alekshenko lives in school number 52 with her 18-year-old daughter and cat. Her son is in the army and the fate of her husband is unknown., “The hardest thing is to not know what the future will bring. Will we be able to return home or should we move on?”, The conflict in Ukraine has caused a massive humanitarian crisis that cannot be weathered without external aid. The Finnish Red Cross has sent logistics and healthcare professionals, among other experts, to both Ukraine and its neighbouring countries., The logisticians help deliver aid supplies and the health workers help locals set up health clinics, for example., Nurse Julia Perä is in Ukraine to assess the need for healthcare services. Ukraine’s healthcare system is struggling as refugees spread around the country., “ In many regions, the number of people has doubled, even tripled.”, The workers and volunteers of local Red Cross organisations play a central role in the operation. The Red Cross organisations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have gained thousands of new volunteers as a result of the crisis., In the city of Uzhhorod, located in western Ukraine, volunteers help distribute supplies, such as clothes, hygiene supplies and food., One of the volunteers, Bahaeddin al-Jaradar, was about to complete his medical studies in Uzhhorod when the conflict began., “I happened to be in Kiev when the first missiles hit the city. It was terrifying. I came to Uzhhorod, because that is where I lived as a student. The Ukrainian Red Cross was recruiting students and I decided to join the team.”, “The first few weeks were difficult, because I was unfamiliar with the organisation. Now, I enjoy my role as a volunteer. I come from a conflict area and know what it is like. This way, I can be useful.”, The crisis has also inspired ordinary people to help. Shoe and clothes retailer Alina Lavrenko donated 400 pairs of shoes and 600 pieces of clothing, all brand-new, to the Red Cross., Lavrenko has recently moved to Uzhhorod from Central Ukraine. She knows many people who have been forced to leave their homes., “I want to help other people because I can. In Uzhhorod, people are helping as much as they can. We all hope that the war will end soon and we will have peace.”, Refugees need basic supplies. 26-year-old Katia Dobrovolska and her 5-year-old daughter Lilia fled Kharkiv for Uzhhorod in March. They are staying in a hostel room with six other people. Katia came to pick up hygiene supplies from the Red Cross., “Shampoo and washing powder are my priorities. There is a great deal of washing to do. Earlier, I got this red coat and food aid from the Red Cross’ relief centre.”, Living in the middle of a conflict is hard. The president of the local Red Cross, Valentina Mitrovtsij , has been working with all her strength since February. “There is a shortage of everything and we are unable to help everyone.”, Mitrovtsij has also seen rays of hope in the dark circumstances., “I am happy if we are able to help even a small number of people. It gives us strength to carry on and do our best on behalf of our fellow countrymen and countrywomen.”, A total of more than 1.6 million people have received aid from the Red Cross. This work will continue for years even beyond the end of the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/chain-aid-consists-thousands-hard-working-workers-and-volunteers
Kryvyi Rih AIDS centre continues to provide HIV services despite the war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNAIDS,HIV/Aids,25 May 2022,"On 25 November 2021, the city of Kryvyi Rih, the fourth largest city in Ukraine, signed the Paris Declaration to end the AIDS epidemic in cities. The city is an important economic and industrial centre, a major transport hub and the birthplace of the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky., A group created by the city administration to develop and implement the Paris Declaration determined the main areas of work, which included the expansion of HIV prevention services for key populations through community organizations and the scale-up of HIV testing through family doctors, among others., Physicians across the city were trained in HIV, while Gennady Kruglenko, the chief doctor at the Kryvyi Rih municipal AIDS centre, visited Odesa and Dnipro to learn about their experience with implementing the Paris Declaration., “We were seriously preparing to start this work,” said Mr Kruglenko. “But the war slowed down our plans. Our region borders the areas of active military operations, but our centre continues providing full-scale HIV services, and we are not going to stop. And we have not abandoned the main goal of the Paris Declaration: ending the AIDS epidemic.”, The Kryvyi Rih AIDS centre has been operating since 1994, and today there are about 10 000 people living with HIV accessing HIV treatment from it. People can get HIV treatment from five different sites, which makes it much easier for people living in different parts of Kryvyi Rih. Kryvyi Rih is the longest city in Europe, the length of which exceeds 120 km., The AIDS centre continues to work as a reference laboratory for several regional centres. Its modern equipment allows the performance of all necessary tests, including diagnosis confirmation, CD4 counts, viral load and others, to be performed. People living with HIV with complex cases, for example opportunistic infections, that require the attention of experienced doctors are referred to the centre., Marina Baidachenko, an infectious diseases doctor at the AIDS centre, says that the centre currently also provides services to people who have fled the war. “There are people who move within the country, who apply for services through a network of our social workers. The system in Ukraine is such that no matter where the patient is, he or she can receive treatment through the general system,” she said., Each doctor providing specialized HIV care in Ukraine has access to the medical records of patients in a general electronic registry, with strict confidentiality measures in place. This ensures that the records of people living with HIV who move from one region to another can be accessed in the new region, thereby allowing the maximum number of displaced patients to remain on antiretroviral therapy, despite the war., According to Ms Baidachenko, the war is felt every minute. “Air raids are very frequent, missiles are flying,” she said. The employees of the AIDS centre must go to the first floor or basement, which have been adapted as bomb shelters, every time the air raid siren sounds., “To issue antiretroviral therapy to a person, you need to open his or her electronic card in the computer, create an electronic prescription through the registry and send it to the warehouse where the medicines are issued. When there are 200–300 patients in the centre, it’s hard to tell them to wait until the alarm is over,” said Ms Baidachenko., With the help of a UNAIDS emergency grant, the centre equipped additional workplaces with laptop computers, office equipment and Wi-Fi. Now prescriptions take only minutes and doctors can move to a safe place when the siren sounds and take their computers and continue to serve people., Close cooperation with community organizations, such as the Public Health Charity Foundation of Krivyi Rih, has become even more important during the war., “Each of our doctors has about 2000 people on antiretroviral therapy. Now with the war, there are only two doctors left. They have to give a prescription, check the tests, explain the medical aspects—they simply don’t have time for other important issues, such as psychological support,” said Mr Kruglenko., According to Alexander Lee, the Project Manager of the Public Health Charity Foundation, the war has changed the format and scope of the organization’s work. “Many of our clients were left alone with their problems and fears because family members left Ukraine. The response required increased mobility of the organization’s employees for consultations and assistance to clients in remote areas of the city,” he said., Social workers are also helping to connect medical facilities with people who use drugs, gay men and other men who have sex with men and members of other communities, who have become even more vulnerable., “Therefore, in the chain of services, everyone does a small, but very “big”, thing,” Mr Kruglenko added., Raman Khailevich, the UNAIDS Country Director for Ukraine, emphasized that UNAIDS supports the city’s efforts to continue providing all HIV services in close cooperation with civil society organizations. “Such interaction in peacetime was one of the most important components of the successful AIDS response in Kryvyi Rih, and in wartime it is the only way not to lose what has been achieved but also to continue moving towards the goal of ending AIDS, saving every life,” he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/kryvyi-rih-aids-centre-continues-provide-hiv-services-despite-war-ukraine
When War Crimes Evidence Disappears: Social Media Companies Can Preserve Proof of Abuses,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,25 May 2022,"Fred Abrahams, Associate Director for Program, This month, four high-ranking members of the US Congress took an important step to help obtain justice for war crimes worldwide., On May 12, the legislators called on the chief executives of YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and Meta (formerly Facebook) to preserve and archive content on their platforms that might be evidence of war crimes in Ukraine., At issue is a trove of uploaded photos and videos that show apparent laws-of-war violations by Russian forces – including unlawful killings, attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, the use of banned cluster munitions – and some abuses by Ukrainian forces. This content forms an essential part of human rights documentation and may play a role in war crimes cases in Ukraine, other countries, and the International Criminal Court., In a letter to the companies, Democratic Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney, Stephen F. Lynch, Gregory W. Meeks, and Bill Keating asked the CEOs “to preserve content, and the metadata associated with this content, that potentially could provide evidence of war crimes and human rights violations in Ukraine” and to make this content accessible to international human rights investigators, in compliance with relevant privacy laws., Companies understandably remove content that could incite violence, harm individuals, or jeopardize national security or public order. YouTube, for example, has reportedly removed 9,000 channels from its platform related to the Ukraine conflict. But while blocking this content from the public may sometimes be warranted, these companies should preserve the material as potential evidence. Permanent deletion by moderators or artificial intelligence-enabled systems can undermine efforts to expose or prosecute serious abuse., In most countries, national law enforcement can compel social media companies to provide users’ content via warrants, subpoenas, and court orders, but international investigators lack these powers., To address this, human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, have called on social media companies to set up independent mechanisms that would preserve potential evidence of serious crimes for use in national and international investigations, as well as for research by nongovernmental organizations, journalists, and academics. While companies have been receptive to these calls, they have still not created these types of digital lockers., As social media content becomes integral to war crimes investigations in Ukraine and elsewhere, social media companies can step up.

MSF mobile clinic teams are providing medical and psychological care to displaced people living in more than 70 shelters in and around Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia., “We see many elderly, people with disabilities, and people who can’t afford to make the journey further west in Ukraine or abroad,” said Célia Burnand, MSF project coordinator in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. “Our job is to complement the impressive work of the local authorities, volunteers, health care staff and social workers and make sure people who’ve been through incredibly traumatic experiences get the medical and psychological care they need.”, Each mobile clinic team is made up of a medical doctor, nurse, psychologist and health educator. Doctors provide medical consultations and medicines, connect patients with specialists if needed and refer severely unwell people to local hospitals. They currently carry out an average of 60 consultations each day., “We see many patients with chronic illnesses like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, asthma and epilepsy,” said Dr. Sasha Sholokov, MSF medical activity manager. “The conflict has made it hard for them to get the regular care and medications they need, and we need to make sure their condition doesn’t become worse.”, Psychologists provide initial psychological care—also known as psychological first aid—to people who have arrived recently, as well as individual and group mental health sessions for adults and children. Since April 25, MSF teams have provided more than 200 mental health consultations. They also run trainings for Ukrainian first responders in administering psychological first aid., “The situation has become more complicated for many people we see,” said Lina Villa, MSF’s mental health activity manager. “At the beginning they were planning to go back home to Donetsk and Luhansk, but they now realize this is becoming less and less likely. They know everything at home has been destroyed and they can’t get their old lives back. They face a lot of uncertainty, and I see some start to lose the hope they had a couple of months ago. We try to help them regain a feeling of control in a situation that’s completely unpredictable.”, MSF has teams supporting people displaced by the conflict in many areas of Ukraine, including in Berehove, Chernihiv, Dnipro, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kropyvnytskyi, Mukacheve, Uzhhorod, Vinnytsia, and Zaporizhzhia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/caring-people-fleeing-war-eastern-and-southeastern-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 May 2022,"As the war wages on across Ukraine, families have been torn apart, thousands are injured or killed, and many more have been displaced. To date, 14.5 million people are displaced—more than a quarter of the population—and 6.5 million people have already fled Ukraine since February 24, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Half of those who have fled the country are children. At least 15.7 million people remaining in Ukraine are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Mercy Corps has been on the ground in Ukraine, Poland, and Romania, partnering with and funding local organizations that know their community needs best and are providing assistance to refugees and Ukrainians inside the country., From distributing medical supplies and food staples to supporting marginalized groups like third-country nationals, Mercy Corps is acting quickly to help meet the urgent needs of the millions seeking refuge. We have funded and partnered with dozens of organizations that are providing essential services, supplies, and shelter. By the end of 2022, Mercy Corps and our partners aim to reach at least 500,000 Ukrainians and other people in the region affected by the war with life-saving humanitarian aid., People living in many parts of eastern Ukraine that have come under fighting have been advised to evacuate, but for many eldery people or people with disabilities, that is extremely difficult. Mercy Corps supports local organizations that have been evacuating women, children, elderly people, and people with disabilities to safer areas within Ukraine and across the border into neighboring countries., Families have made days-long treks, within Ukraine and to border countries, in hopes of finding safety and a place to rest. Across Ukraine, Poland, and Romania, we learned the stories of the families who found shelter at some of our partner organizations. We’re sharing their stories, highlighting the work of our local partners, and illuminating how the shelters for those who have been displaced can offer a brief respite amidst upheaval., Yulia fled Zhytomyr with her two sons after their home’s windows shattered from nearby missile strikes. They’re staying at a shelter in Lviv, Ukraine, which used to be a cultural center and now offers 40 displaced Ukrainian women with children a safe place to stay. It is one of the 350 shelters in Lviv. Many of those who work in the shelter are refugees themselves. Mercy Corps supports the shelter, serving the many families who have been displaced in eastern Ukraine. “Sometimes it's not convenient to accept help,” said Yulia. “We are used to doing everything ourselves. I worked as a cook. I want to go back to work.”, Trina and Alex and their children stayed at the Radauti refugee center near the border crossing in northern Romania. Before reaching Romania, their five-year-old son had a foot infection from walking over glass and metal shards that covered the roads after explosions. Trini and Alex took turns carrying him on their backs as they walked to the border, where the refugee center provided medical care for their son’s foot. “I don’t want to be a refugee,” said Trina. “We have always taken care of ourselves and worked hard. It is embarrassing for our family, but we are thankful that everyone has been so kind to us.”, From providing medical care and meeting basic needs, organizations on the ground are also helping with the logistics of relocating displaced families. When Trini and Alex arrived in Romania, they didn’t have the correct documents to leave the country. The refugee center will help them obtain approved paperwork so they can continue on their journey to stay with family friends in Bulgaria., At the onset of the crisis, Mercy Corps arrived at the Romanian border to assess the greatest needs for refugees. Mercy Corps continues to work in Romania with partner organizations to ship essential supplies into Ukraine, including food, baby food, face masks, medical supplies, hygiene products, and medicine., Around two-thirds of children in Ukraine are now displaced, either fleeing to nearby countries or are displaced within the country. In Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, Mercy Corps partners with a local organization called Kamyanytsya Austria to run a daycare center for families who have been displaced by the war. The center provides free childcare from morning until afternoon, giving children a safe space to play and learn—a sense of normalcy during a tumultuous time. While the children are taking trips to nearby parks and theaters, their parents take this time to figure out logistics of relocating their families., “We have some children whose dads are in the army now, who are serving our country,” said teacher Denys Kvasov. “I feel grateful to them. And it’s kind of a trade, because they protect me—including all of us—and at the same time, I take care of their children, which is important for me.”, Mubariz Alimov, who is originally from Azerbaijan, was selling goods in a small Kyiv shop when the war began in Ukraine. After escaping to Poland, he is staying in a shelter for refugees, many of whom are non-Ukrainians who were living in Ukraine. Third country nationals, along with Romani refugees, have experienced discrimation, difficulty finding transportation and accommodations, and face additional challenges as refugees because they often lack the documents required to legally work or travel within Europe., Mubariz says he is grateful for the kindness he is being shown. The bakery down the street donates fresh bread to the shelter every day, and a nearby florist brings them flowers to brighten up the space. Kids run back and forth among the clothing donations that line the entrance. Before the war, the shelter was a hostel for sports camps, part of a skate park that takes up a large block on the outskirts of Warsaw, Poland. Through a partnership with the Polish organization KIK (Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej, or Catholic Intelligentsia Club), Mercy Corps funds the hostel for those seeking refuge.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/search-refuge-ukraine-war-displaces-millions

Protection and Human Rights",24 May 2022,"SAFETY, CONFIDENTIALITY AND DIGNITY IN REPORTING ABOUT GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE, Gender-based violence is a manifestation of inherent imbalances in power and gender equality., Human stories about gender-based violence can impact public opinion and policies in a powerful way. Media (including social media) reporting on sexual and other forms of gender- based violence (GBV) in emergency contexts can facilitate advocacy with decision makers and communities to ensure protection of those at risk. In the meantime, covering GBV stories is very sensitive. In many places, being identified as a GBV survivor – and, sometimes, as someone who is helping a survivor - can result in isolation, social stigmatization, re-traumatization, rejection from family and community, and, in some extreme cases, death., Each survivor is unique, reacts differently to gender-based violence, and has different strengths, resources and coping mechanisms. Each survivor has the right to decide who should know their story and how will it be used., This guide is intended to help the media professionals covering the content relating to gender-based violence, including the human stories, do this in line with the necessary ethical and safety principles., Due to the potential threats to safety, security and psychological well-being, all media reporting needs to respect basic ethical and safety principles, in line with the DO NO HARM approach that means taking all measures necessary to avoid exposing people to further harm as a result of our actions, as well as, SURVIVOR CENTERED approach that entails creating a supportive environment for the survivor by respecting their rights, and treating them with respect and dignity.

IOM scales up regional displacement tracking in response to the war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,IOM,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",24 May 2022,"Geneva – More than eight million people are internally displaced in Ukraine due to the war, and a further 6.5 million have fled to safety across international borders. In response, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is scaling up the use of its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) tool to better understand mobility dynamics in the region and strengthen the Organization’s crisis response., DTM, IOM’s flagship data collection tool in crises, gathers and analyses data on the mobility and vulnerabilities of displaced persons to ensure that assistance provided to affected populations is responsive to their needs., Since the start of the war, IOM has expanded DTM data collection across 54 transit and border crossing points in Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia – with a network of 40 enumerators. In addition to collecting data on internally displaced persons, DTM has conducted over 18,000 individual surveys on the profiles, mobility intentions, needs and vulnerabilities of the refugees, including third-country nationals, fleeing Ukraine., In Poland, IOM has conducted 5,710 surveys in eight locations (as of 18 May). Among roughly 1,500 respondents in registration centres and collective shelters, 42 per cent were children and 10 per cent were elderly. Eighty-two per cent said they intended to stay in their current location in Poland. By contrast, among over 3,000 respondents at entry points, only 43 per cent expressed the intention to remain in Poland, and 79 per cent indicated the desire to return to Ukraine when safe to do so., Moldova’s third DTM report jointly produced with UN Women, surveyed over 10,000 respondents, 97 per cent of whom were Ukrainian and three per cent were third-country nationals (TCNs). Moldova was identified as the top intended destination (29 per cent), followed by Germany (15 per cent), Romania (11 per cent) and Slovakia (eight per cent). Additionally, IOM Moldova published its first report on Ukrainians and TCNs crossing to Ukraine: almost half of the 250 respondents were originally from the region of Odessa, and around 93 per cent reported they intended to go back to their habitual place of origin., In Romania, IOM’s first DTM report surveyed 2,028 people in eight locations, of which 97 per cent were Ukrainian and three per cent TCNs. The survey identified Odessa as the top region of origin (39 per cent of respondents) and over half expressed the intention to travel onwards from Romania, primarily to Germany, Bulgaria and Poland. Eighty-one per cent reported that they intend to return to Ukraine once it is safe to do so., In Slovakia, IOM analysed a second round of surveys. Among 481 respondents, the top regions of origin were Kharkiv (22 per cent), Kyiv (20 per cent) and Donetsk (15 per cent). More than half (57 per cent) reported Slovakia as their intended destination. Among respondents travelling with family, food, information, transportation, accommodation and financial support were identified as the top five needs., The Organization is mobilizing to conduct further rapid needs assessments of TCNs who have travelled beyond the countries neighbouring Ukraine. The second report published in Belgium highlighted discrimination and xenophobia as the primary issue respondents face on their journey (55 per cent), while temporary accommodation was ranked highest as the most pressing need (67 per cent). Thirty-one per cent of those surveyed expressed the desire to return to Ukraine., The expansion of IOM’s DTM activities in the region was made possible with financial support from the Council of Europe Development Bank, German Federal Foreign Office, Government of Japan, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and United States Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration., The Displacement Tracking Matrix is now operational under the newly launched Global Data Institute (GDI) in Berlin., Find all published reports at https://displacement.iom.int/reports., For more information, contact:, In Geneva:

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 23 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,24 May 2022,"From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 23 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 8,533 civilian casualties in the country: 3,942 killed and 4,591 injured. This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 22 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 23 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 23 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentiallyshared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-23-may-2022-enruuk

In addition, since the war began, at least 8,089 civilian casualties have been reported in the country, including 3,811 killed. The United Nations says the actual numbers are likely much higher., The consequences of the war, particularly those related to food, are being felt worldwide. The crisis has caused inflation of prices for grains, food oils and fertilizer, creating food crises where previously there were none, and has exacerbated conditions in places already experiencing food insecurity. Fuel availability worldwide also is a concern, particularly in Ukraine, where the price of and access to fuel are impeding humanitarian efforts to deliver aid., Since February, more than 6.3 million people have fled Ukraine. As of May 19, at least 3,296,792 people had crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland, 930,341 had entered Romania, 465,435 had entered Moldova, 615,256 had entered Hungary and 426,605 had entered Slovakia, while 863,086 had entered Russia and 27,308 had entered Belarus., International Medical Corps Response, Three months into the crisis, International Medical Corps continues to respond to humanitarian needs both inside Ukraine and in bordering countries. From the onset of the emergency, our team has helped authorities provide lifesaving care by directly delivering critical supplies and services to communities affected by the invasion. Now, three months since the conflict began, response needs vary. With various oblasts now in the early recovery phase, International Medical Corps is providing support by rehabilitating health facilities and strengthening and rebuilding the health workforce. Our response efforts include providing medical consultations, equipment and supplies; mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services and training; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services; and non-food items (NFIs), including shelter and survival items.

Although active since 2014, the conflict escalated in late February 2022 as hostilities spread to most parts of the country. It has led to critical concern for the protection of civilians, especially for those trapped in urban centres. While it has necessitated a massive scale-up in providing humanitarian aid across the country, humanitarian access remains challenging., Although the geographic scope of hostilities has reduced compared with the first few weeks of the crisis, the needs of people across Ukraine, including refugees/displaced populations and those remaining in hard-hit areas, continue to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands remain without or have reduced access to water, gas, electricity, and mobile communications. At the same time, internally displaced persons (IDPs) in western Ukraine face challenges securing adequate shelter and finding ways to support themselves and their families. The Red Cross Red Crescent Movement has been scaling up its response to respond to the increasing needs within Ukraine as well as in the neighbouring countries., This Operational Strategy is part of a Federation-wide approach, focusing on activities across 3 following priorities, with an overall focus on National Society Strengthening., Health and Care, including Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH);, Integrated Assistance, including Shelter, Multi-Purpose Cash, and Livelihoods;, Protection and Prevention., Federation-wide approach, Consistent with the priority given to membership coordination in the Agenda for Renewal, the IFRC Secretariat continues to strengthen its coordination with the membership at both strategic and operational levels as an utmost priority. The Operation Strategy is part of a Federation-wide Framework and membership coordination, based on the response priorities of the Operating National Society and in consultation with all Federation members contributing to the response, leveraging the capacities of all partners to maximize the collective humanitarian impact and ensure linkages between all response activities., The approach reflected in this Operational Strategy includes, • A Federation-wide country needs assessment and implementation plan with common indicators, • A Federation-wide funding ask to ensure linkages between all response activities (including multilateral, bilateral and activities funded domestically by National Societies and assist in leveraging the capacities of all members of the Federation in the country to maximize the collective humanitarian impact., • a Federation-wide monitoring and reporting framework to standardize monitoring and reporting and ensure accountability and transparency. The Federation-wide monitoring covers reporting on different activities of National Societies, standard indicators across the IFRC, and financial information.

In the Government-controlled part of Luhanska oblast, local authorities informed that, on 21 May, a bridge leading to the administrative centre of the oblast — Sievierodonetsk — was destroyed. This left the partially encircled city reachable by only one road. While some people have managed to leave Sievierodonetsk over the weekend, local authorities estimate that thousands of civilians remain in the war-affected city and require urgent support. Our humanitarian colleagues also tell us that shelling and air strikes were reported in other areas of Ukraine, including in northern, central and southern parts, claiming civilian lives and damaging civilian infrastructure.

War in Ukraine: How can I sell my harvest if there's no market?,News and Press Release,WFP,"Coordination
Food and Nutrition",23 May 2022,"WFP is using cash transfers in Ukraine and beyond to help relieve the essential needs of people affected by the global food crisis. Meanwhile, harvests from Ukrainian farms such as Andriy’s are failing to be shipped to the destinations where they are needed most., Andriy is a farmer in Ukraine. The blockade of ports and exports of grains is severely impacting the livelihoods of farmers in Ukraine. Farmer Andriy’s blazing, yellow-topped rapeseed plants gently sway in the breeze as bees buzz between them. This picture-postcard scene in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia Oblast is stunning, but Andriy is far from content here. He's constantly fidgeting, and his face shows his uneasiness., A year ago, he sold a ton of corn for US$265 (8,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia). If Andriy can find a buyer this year, the best price he'll get is half that. He's equally worried about his wheat harvest, which may end up sitting in silos rather than being turned into bread., “How can I sell my harvest if there's no market?” Andriy asks himself out loud., As record numbers of people across the world wonder what they will eat tomorrow, harvests from Ukrainian farms such as Andriy’s are failing to be shipped to the destinations where they are needed most., The World Food Programme (WFP) is calling for the immediate reopening of Black Sea ports – including Odesa – so that critical food from Ukraine can reach people facing food insecurity in countries such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen, where millions are on the brink of famine., WFP is supporting more than 650,000 displaced people and host community members in seven districts of North Gondar, in Ethiopia, with over 11,000 mt of food through relief distributions each month. Photo: WFP/Claire Nevill Ethiopia, an already fragile and vulnerable country due to conflict, climate change and Covid-19, is also suffering the consequences of the global food crisis. WFP is supporting more than 650,000 displaced people and host community members in seven districts of North Gondar, in Ethiopia, with over 11,000 mt of food through relief distributions each month., Whether his crops sell for low prices, are kept in expensive storage, or in a worst-case scenario, are destroyed, the outcome will be a blow to him, the economy, his ten employees and the intended consumers., “We used to live happily but not anymore,” he says. “There's an unease now, and we're always afraid that everything we've worked for over our lifetimes might be gone tomorrow.”, The conflict has spared his region so far, but uncertainty looms over a country that has already witnessed 6 million people leave due to conflict, and where 8 million people are internally displaced., WFP is supporting people in Ukraine several ways. This includes sourcing wheat locally to supply the country's bakeries, so they can make the almost 2 millions of loaves we have distributed so far to almost 2 million people. To date, through cash assistance, WFP has transferred almost US$58 million to nearly 813,000 people in Ukraine. People receive between US$75 and US$225 per month, depending on family size. Every dollar spent by a family in Ukraine is directly injected into the local economy. , WFP just signed an agreement with the Ministry of Social Policy to scale up cash transfers for up to one million people across Ukraine in May. Cash transfers complement social protection systems, allowing people to buy the items and services they consider most important.  , WFP also provides food assistance through monthly rations and immediate food rations. So far, it has reached a total of 3.8 million people across the country., The daily bread distribution continues in Ukraine with over 2 million loaves - 935 metric tons - distributed in eight cities. WFP’s assistance in Ukraine aims to support markets and promote the resilience of the food system from production to processing, storage, transport and consumption., However, the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine are radiating outwards, triggering a wave of collateral hunger that is spreading across the globe. In 81 countries where WFP works, acute hunger is expected to rise by 47 million people if the conflict in Ukraine continues unabated., Andriy is one of the countless Ukrainian farmers facing an export predicament. Their cumulative inability to export crops will have global ramifications, particularly for the Middle East and North Africa. Countries across that region are expected to be severely affected by the ripple effect of the Ukraine crisis given their heavy reliance on imports of food and energy, leaving them vulnerable to higher food prices., In that region, WFP cash transfers have proven to be an efficient way of providing humanitarian assistance. As people can decide how and where to spend their cash depending on their needs, it can help support objectives beyond food consumption in both emergencies and developmental contexts like those throughout the Middle East, where the World Food Programme has already transferred US$362 million to vulnerable people in 2022., WFP assists people throughout the Middle East with cash transfers. People can use the money to buy food but also to address other essential needs. On the picture on the left, Saleh Ahmed, 45 years old, in Al Horaika village, in Yemen. He receives cash transfers to buy food. On the right, Hanan and her four children in Syria, where people with out-of-school children receive cash transfers to ease some financial burden for them amid a plummeting economy and unabating rise in prices. Photos: WFP/Mohammed Nasher/Hussam Al Saleh Meanwhile, there is another reason for Andriy to be worried: climate change. During his lifetime, the impact of climate change meant reduced yields, and he's fearful that it will worsen., ""Climate change is big, and it's real,“ he says., He has been a farmer his whole life, during which time he's noticed rainfall becoming more erratic, less snow in winter and a gentle shift in seasonal patterns., The local community looks to be hit hard, as farm employees and their families depend on crop profits as their primary livelihood. In anticipation of a bad season, Andriy has been helping the community by providing micro-loans. He does that also to discourage people from seeking work in Europe., Adding to woes, fertilizer prices in Ukraine have tripled in recent months. Gas prices increase daily. Rationed petrol makes transport prohibitively expensive and complex., “There's a possibility I won't be able to pay the workers. All I can do is rely on the hope that doesn't happen,” he explains., Food access issues seem like a bad joke to Ukrainian farmers like Andriy. They have the food right there, ready to go, so the fact that people in countries like Syria and Egypt are eating less at higher costs is just too hard to fathom. He’s grateful for the support that his country receives but will continue to rely on the hope that the consequences of high costs, conflict and climate change are short-lived.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-how-can-i-sell-my-harvest-if-theres-no-market

MAG set to start work in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MAG,Mine Action,23 May 2022,"MAG is set to deliver explosive ordnance risk education in Ukraine in partnership with a Ukrainian mine action charity – with operations to clear landmines and other explosive ordnance to commence later this year., A partnership agreement has been signed between MAG and the non-profit Ukrainian Deminers Association (UDA) that will see long-term collaboration between the two organisations, with an immediate focus on educating vulnerable communities about the dangers of unexploded ordnance and landmines., The agreement is in line with MAG’s ambitions to work closely with and complement the expertise available from Ukrainian NGOs and state institutions., The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding follows an assessment mission to the country by a multi-disciplinary MAG team that has been gathering evidence of contamination and its impact on civilians and the wider humanitarian and relief response., Working in partnership with the Ukrainian authorities and other humanitarian agencies, the team documented evidence of contamination caused by cluster munitions, which are widely prohibited, alongside improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other explosive ordnance in Bucha, Irpin, Andriivka and Borodyanka, close to the capital Kyiv., MAG International Policy and Partnerships Director Josephine Dresner, who led the assessment mission, said: “The overall extent of contamination in Ukraine is now so extensive that it will almost certainly require several hundred million pounds and decades of difficult work to clear., “That is why it so important to work in close and constructive cooperation with Ukrainian organisations so that we are aiding the Ukrainians to build their own capabilities, resources and capacity to deliver a long-term, sustainable approach to the challenges ahead. At the same time, as we mobilise our operations in a context new to MAG, UDA’s extensive understanding of the explosive threat and operational challenges will be absolutely invaluable.”, MAG has now established a permanent base in the country and staff have been meeting with people whose lives have been affected by the conflict, many having lost their homes and, in some cases, close family members., At one point during the initial assessment mission, a senior technical expert for MAG had to warn family members returning not to return to their home because of a suspected IED at the property., Many of those left behind in Ukraine’s conflict-affected areas, such as the elderly and those with disabilities, are among the most vulnerable members of society., MAG is liaising with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, State Emergency Services and Ministry for the Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories and is now progressing a range of formal registrations and accreditations., Data experts at MAG have also been using satellite imagery and sophisticated geographic information systems to assess which areas have been worst affected by explosive weapons. This information will help MAG and its partners assess likely risk and prioritisation., Initial funding for the assessments and team set-up, and to start emergency risk education activities, has been provided by Dutch charitable foundation Stitchting Vluchteling (SV), building on almost 30 years of cooperation between SV and MAG in numerous conflict-affected countries globally., MAG will work with UDA to begin risk education work imminently, incorporating digital and traditional media channels, as well as face-to-face engagement. MAG pioneered the use of social media in explosive ordnance risk education with the support of the US State Department’s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement., Survey and clearance work is expected to begin later in the year, when it is expected that all necessary accreditation procedures have been completed., In addition to the risk education programmes, MAG will work with UDA to build its capacity through training and technical development., MAG has significant experience and expertise in urban survey and clearance in post-conflict countries, gained in places such as Iraq and Syria, as well as extensive explosive ordnance disposal and satellite data mapping capacities, meaning the organisation is particularly well equipped to deal with the kind of contamination occurring in Ukraine, where towns, villages and cities have been affected alongside rural areas., The establishment of a MAG presence in Ukraine comes amidst increasing reports of civilians being killed and injured by unexploded ordnance in the Kyiv region and across the east and south of Ukraine., Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin has said that about 300,000 km² of Ukrainian territory is suspected of having been contaminated by explosive ordnance since 24 February. That is an area larger than that of the UK, although good quality survey is critical to identify the exact location and extent of the problem as areas become accessible., An estimated 2 million people were already at risk of landmines and explosive remnants of war in the east of the country prior to the Russian incursion earlier this year, a result of the conflict in 2014., MAG Director of Programmes Greg Crowther said: “Our team in Ukraine comprises explosive ordnance disposal experts with decades of experience in complex conflict environments and with particular expertise in the challenges of urban contamination, gained in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Libya., “Our approach, as always, will be to work very closely with the relevant national authorities and to engage with local partners to ensure we are having the most impact possible, are co-ordinating efficiently with other agencies and that efforts are not being duplicated.”, “We anticipate being in a position to deliver support in the form of clearance operations, training and community risk education by the end of the summer but the nature and extent of those operations will depend on funding and the needs of the Ukrainian authorities.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mag-set-start-work-ukraine

There have been 235 attacks on health care., • Since 24 February, over 1.6 million people in Ukraine were able to access health care as a result of supplies distributed, either directly by UNICEF or in partnership with implementing organizations. UNICEF also ensured access to safe water for over 2 million people, with 141,541 people benefitting from WASH supplies., • Since 24 February, UNICEF and partner have reached 491,125 children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, provided case management and referral services to 46,364 children, and assisted 14,684 women and children with gender-based violence response services., • Since 24 February, 288,853 children have benefited from learning interventions with supplies provided by UNICEF, and 187,245 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education., • During the reporting period, UNICEF provided support to over 700 people evacuated from frontline locations., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF has received US$387.4 million for its response inside Ukraine out of the US$624.2 million total funding requirement in its revised 2022 Ukraine and Refugee Outflow Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal (March– August 2022).1 Generous contributions have come from the Governments of Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Sweden,
Switzerland, the United States of America, USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), the European Commission, and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).
Ongoing fundraising campaigns by UNICEF National Committees and country offices have also generated timely, flexible support (65 per cent in flexible funding) from the private sector, including from corporate partners, foundations, philanthropy partners and individual donors, with actual funds already remitted amounting to US$364 million. Private sector support has been unprecedented, with donations received from over 500 businesses, 166 philanthropy partners, 92 foundations and a large base of individual donors across over 24 countries. Some prominent private sector donors and partners who have made significant contributions include Epic Games, Akelius Foundation, Aeon,
Apple, Google, LEGO Foundation, ING, HSBC, Google, Finance Blockchain Charity Foundation, Capgemini and Ikea.
UNICEF continues to work with the Government of Ukraine, United Nations (UN) agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs)/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other humanitarian partners. Close consultations are also being held with Presidential advisors, key ministries (Foreign Affairs; Social Policy; Education; Youth; and Health), and mayors in several cities (including through 35 Child and Youth Friendly Cities) and the Ombudspersons Office.
Through its long-standing presence in Ukraine, UNICEF has established partnerships in key hromadas (municipalities) and will continue to expand these in all oblasts (regions). Overall, 85 partners are engaged in UNICEF’s response, which despite the challenging conditions, has been able to ensure humanitarian support in some of the most waraffected and hard-to-access locations., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Almost three months into the war, hostilities are currently concentrated in the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, directly affecting civilians’ safety and security. The frontline has remained relatively stable in the past few weeks, and airstrikes continue to be reported throughout the country. In its latest figures released on 18 May, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 3,778 people killed and 4,186 injured, for a total of 7,564 civilian casualties since 24 February. This includes 250 children verified as killed and 215 wounded, with actual figures likely to be much higher. 2 The World Health Organization (WHO) also reported 235 attacks on health care, leaving at least 75 people dead.
The ongoing fighting has largely prevented rescue efforts and civilian evacuations from the hardest hit locations, also hindering the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance in and around frontline areas. Crossline humanitarian access to areas of eastern and southern Ukraine remains extremely difficult and limited. According to a telephone survey by REACH3 , key informants in conflict-affected urban areas say that their greatest concerns are transport and fuel supply disruptions, security concerns, and limited access to food, medical services, and financial services. Access to drinking water and disruption to water supply also remain critical issues in Mariupol, Rubizhne, and Avdiivka, which are also reported as the worst affected locations overall in this survey.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-13-10-17-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 May 2022,"As the war in Ukraine continues to rage on, the Australian community has rallied together to help provide urgent humanitarian support to families displaced by the war., More than $3.5 million have been raised through the Caritas Australia Ukraine Appeal, which will provide much-needed emergency food, shelter, medication, clean water and other essentials., “We are so incredibly humbled by the generosity of our supporters, both long-term and new. The compassion that they have shown to the people of Ukraine during this hour of need is truly amazing,” said Kirsty Robertson, Caritas Australia’s CEO.  , “It reminds me of what we’re hearing from our partners on the ground, Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes, who have both been blessed with an extraordinary outpouring of support. In dark times, like in times of war and crisis, we often see the best of humanity against the backdrop of the worst.  It gives us great hope for the future.”  , Since the beginning of the conflict, Caritas Ukraine together with local Caritas offices has assisted more than 800,000 people throughout Ukraine. Volunteers are helping transport hundreds of tons of cargo across the country – including bedding, medicines, hygiene supplies, and much more.

Over 460,000 people have fled into Moldova since the conflict began. , More than two months into the war, there is continued active fighting in eastern and southern Ukraine. While the international spotlight has mostly been focused on the impact on children, who are at high risk of human trafficking and exploitation, the conflict is also posing a great threat to the health and wellbeing of the older generation who continue to reside in highly volatile areas., So far, more than 14 million people have been displaced by the war – many of them elderly people who need urgent medication for chronic illnesses. Roughly one in four people in Ukraine are over 60 years old and at least two million older women are still left behind in Ukraine., A HelpAge survey of people over 60 in the Donbas region in March found that 99 per cent of people in this age group do not want to leave their homes, even though they need help getting food and are experiencing extreme cold due to electricity cuts., Many vulnerable older women who are largely reliant on social services are no longer getting the support they need due to mass disruptions, but also cannot afford to, or do not want to, evacuate from their homes., Caritas Ukraine has been directly supporting older men and women through their home care program, which had been running for several years in the Donbas region. Where possible this program continues to deliver support for medicine, food and clean water to vulnerable people. In addition, Caritas Ukraine has been working to provide safe passage to women and children crossing the border to prevent human trafficking., Your support can provide vital shelter, food, clean water and protection to vulnerable families fleeing conflict, like the war in Ukraine., Give now to help Caritas staff and partners on the ground deliver urgently needed humanitarian aid., DONATE NOW",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-appeal-raises-more-35-million-displaced-families

High Level Secretary General Mission to Ukraine: End of Mission Statement (20 May 2022),Analysis,Amnesty,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",20 May 2022,"1. INTRODUCTION, An Amnesty International delegation, led by Secretary General Agnès Callamard, conducted an official country visit to Ukraine from 30 April to 6 May 2022. The objectives of the visit were fourfold:, Release Amnesty’s latest findings on war crimes and other international humanitarian law (IHL) violations, including extrajudicial executions committed in Bucha and air strikes targeting civilian infrastructure in Borodyanka;, Contribute to ongoing reflections about and initiatives for international justice for Ukraine and present Amnesty’s recommendations on accountability for war crimes and the crime of aggression;, Demonstrate global solidarity with the people of Ukraine, human rights defenders, Amnesty colleagues from Ukraine, including those who have remained in Ukraine;, Emphasize the importance of global solidarity: The events in Ukraine raise grave issues which are not confined to Europe but are global in impact. That demands global leadership and global solidarity, inclusive of the Global South. With that in mind, we also sought to respond to accusations of the West’s double standards in response the Ukraine crisis., The Secretary General warmly thanks the Ukrainian authorities for their availability and support during the visit, including senior officials from the Office of the President, Minis-try of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry for Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, Ministry of Healthcare, as well as the Ombudsperson of Ukraine and the Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy., She and her delegation are particularly grateful to the survivors of human rights violations and war crimes whom they met in Bucha and Bonodyanka and members of Ukrainian civil society organisations., The delegation also held a meeting with AI Ukraine colleagues in the office of AI Ukraine, a very emotional moment for all those present., The Secretary General presents the visit’s findings and wishes to draw attention to a number of issues with which she engaged during her visit in the country., 2. CONTEXT OF THE MISSION, On 22 February 2022, the Russian Duma (Parliament) resolved to recognize the Russia-backed self-styled “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” (“LDNR”) in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, as independent states. The Duma also authorized the deployment of Russian military forces outside of Russia to Ukraine, describing it as a “peacekeeping operation”., It was the second time that Russia moved to openly occupy sovereign Ukraine further to the 2014 occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea, and further to its officially denied military presence in eastern Ukraine since then. These actions undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine by contravening international law and agreements, including the 2014-2015 Minsk Accords which recognize Donbas as part of Ukraine. The move also nullified a ceasefire agreed under the Minsk Accords and blocks any envisaged peaceful outcome of the eight-year armed conflict between Ukrainian forces and the Russia-backed separatists. The Minsk Accords, which were signed by the representatives of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia, Ukraine, and “LDNR”, were also endorsed by a UN Security Council Resolution, and called for a significant degree of autonomy for the two regions inside Ukraine., On 24 February 2022 Russia launched a full-scale invasion into Ukraine, crossing its bor-ders and bombing military targets near and in large cities, some of its forces reaching the, immediate outskirts of Kyiv the same morning. Over the last two months, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War Two and has resulted in countless violations of international humanitarian and human rights law., Thus far over 4 million people have left Ukraine, and more are doing so all the time. 3.8 million are officially registered as internally displaced, although the actual number is probably far higher. Hence the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates that 7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced since 2014.
Amnesty International, and many others, have documented scores of war crimes and other violations of IHL, primarily by Russian forces, which include:, Disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks resulting in deaths and injuries of civilians,, Extrajudicial killings, acts of torture, in areas that had been occupied by Russian military forces prior to their retreat,, Siege warfare tactics, characterized by relentless indiscriminate attacks on densely populated areas, most notably in Mariupol,, The use of cluster munitions which is banned under international law,, Disruption of basic utilities and cuts to communication,, Destruction of civilian infrastructure,, Concerns over restrictions to access to medicine and healthcare,, Abuses against prisoners of war (including by Ukrainian forces)., Efforts to create well-planned, safe humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape have faced major challenges. Many Ukrainian civilians have been unable to leave besieged areas, fearing Russian attacks – and some have been shot and killed while trying to flee to safety., There are major ongoing concerns in the Eastern part of Ukraine which is currently experiencing the brunt of the conflict, and numerous allegations of forcible transfers and deportations of populations from occupied territory.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-level-secretary-general-mission-ukraine-end-mission-statement-20-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 May 2022,"As conflict in Ukraine continues to rage, the Red Cross is committed to providing lifesaving aid to those in need — both in the country and in neighboring areas. Of the more than 12 million people who have been displaced by this conflict, an estimated 8 million are still inside the country and in need of urgent life-saving assistance. The Red Cross has reached 1 in 10 people impacted by this crisis and is committed to assisting the most vulnerable., More than just delivering aid, the Red Cross is committed to ensuring the safety of those who remain in Ukraine and are living under dire circumstances. In early May, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) teams completed three safe passage operations evacuating more than 500 civilians from the Mariupol areas. After weeks of living largely underground with dwindling food, water and medicine, the situation for these civilians was dire. Since March, the ICRC has helped facilitate the safe passage of more than 10,000 civilians from Sumy and Mariupol to other locations in Ukraine., ""We are relieved that we could help evacuate more civilians from Azovstal and the Mariupol area and bring them to a safer place,"" said Pascal Hundt, the head of delegation for the ICRC in Ukraine. ""The humanitarian convoy is a life-changing moment and major relief for these people who have suffered the horrors of close combat for too many weeks. They have all endured a level of horror no human should have to go through."", In Ukraine: Aid Amidst the Violence, Under mortal danger to themselves, Ukrainian Red Cross teams are working tirelessly to help people and communities impacted by conflict. There are nearly 8 million people displaced within Ukraine, with millions more living in active conflict zones who are facing a loss of electricity, difficulty accessing drinking water and severe shortages of medicines and available medical assistance., Within the country, more than 200 health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Many pharmacies are closed, stocks of medicines are low, at least 73 health care workers have died, and many have left, leaving people without access to health care and critical medicines needed. The lack of income and the disruption in financial services are also contributing to the rise in the need for basic necessities. The food security situation continues to deteriorate as well. Immediate food needs are reported in conflict-affected areas and in areas hosting internally displaced people. The disruption in food production and delivery challenges due to access constraints continue to drive up the need., Damaged roads have disrupted supply chains, leaving communities cut off from food and basic supplies. Today, many civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely. The ICRC remains committed to the safe passage of these civilians., Over 6 million have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict — 1.3 million of which have reportedly returned to Ukraine. From available information, many returnees to Ukraine are not considered permanent. A significant portion of those returning are going back and forth across the border to check on family members or assess the safety or state of their homes. The Red Cross is committed to providing support to those who make these journeys now, and in the months to come., Around the clock, Red Cross teams continue providing emergency aid amid fear and uncertainty to the people of Ukraine. Since the conflict intensified in late February, the Red Cross has done the following:, Red Cross volunteers will continue to increase their work reuniting separated families, providing food and other household items and increasing awareness about areas contaminated by unexploded ordnance. The current needs are tremendous, critical among them include water delivery, support to health facilities and medical care for wounded families., In Neighboring Countries: Help for Those Fleeing their Homes, More than 6.1 million people have been forced to flee their homes in Ukraine to neighboring countries. It's a heartbreaking situation as many leave loved ones, pets and essentials behind. Every day, more than 42,000 Red Cross workers continue to roll up their sleeves to help. In Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovakia as well as secondary countries including Lithuania, Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and beyond, Red Cross volunteers are supporting displaced people. Trucks and planes loaded with goods are arriving regularly to provide critical items for those in need., As those fleeing violence leave their homes, they are in dire need of assistance. The Red Cross is committed to helping them and to ensuring the protection of those most vulnerable. Across Europe, shelter needs are dynamic. While many refugees have been taken in by host families or relatives/friends in neighboring countries, more have found refuge in accommodation centers. At these centers, the need for improved sanitation, personal care items and hygiene items remains a high priority., As people lose their primary sources of income, face unpredictable futures and struggle to meet basic needs, the need for financial assistance is high. The IFRC has begun its largest ever rollout of emergency cash assistance to people in need. Cash assistance is a fast, efficient and dignified way to provide humanitarian assistance to those who so desperately need it. It enables people to purchase items specific to their individual needs, supports local economies and helps people recover from traumatic events as they take an active role in decision making., Additionally, Red Cross teams from across eastern Europe have done the following:, Role of the American Red Cross, For its part, the American Red Cross has contributed $44.3 million dollars to Ukraine crisis relief efforts. This includes $40.3 million dollars to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to support the most vital humanitarian needs of those affected, including food, shelter, critical care items and first aid. The American Red Cross has also contributed $2 million dollars to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support their life-saving efforts within Ukraine and contributed $2 million dollars to the Danish Red Cross to provide food and non-perishable food items, first aid kits, blankets and hygiene kits to people displaced within Ukraine., The American Red Cross has also deployed several international crisis responders to Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania to provide humanitarian relief in support of the international Red Cross operation helping families who fled their homes. These highly trained crisis responders—who are lending skills such as information management, cash assistance programming, GIS systems, communications and crisis leadership — are supporting on-the-ground relief efforts alongside local teams, including the Polish Red Cross, Moldovan Red Cross and Romanian Red Cross., Additionally, in line with its work supporting military families, the American Red Cross has sent trained staff to Europe to support emergency communication needs of U.S. military members, so they can stay in touch with family members back home. The Red Cross Hero Care Network is a Congressionally-chartered program that connects service members and their families in times of need. Red Crossers are also distributing comfort kits, containing hygiene items and other necessities to service members and U.S. State Department staff., Blood Services, At this time, the American Red Cross is not shipping blood products to Ukraine. The American Red Cross does not ship blood products outside the U.S. without a specific request from the U.S. Department of State, from the United Nations, or unless we have a request from affected Red Cross or Red Crescent societies abroad., Can I Volunteer or Donate Goods?, In countries around the world, Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations have their own staff and volunteers who are trained to respond to large-scale disaster operations. The American Red Cross sends highly specialized and experienced professionals with technical skills and expertise abroad only after the Red Cross or Red Crescent team requests assistance. Those not already on the Red Cross’s international disaster roster will not have the opportunity to deploy at this time. We encourage you to connect with your local Red Cross chapter for future opportunities or to visit redcross.org/volunteer for more information., While we are grateful for the outpouring of support, it’s important to know that neither the American Red Cross, nor our global Red Cross partners, are accepting the donation of in-kind goods such as food, clothing, blankets or toys at this time. These items can be difficult to manage on the ground and divert resources from our mission. Other charitable organizations are better suited to manage such donations., International Humanitarian Law, ICRC called on authorities to adhere to international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and infrastructure delivering essential services, including power and water facilities, schools and hospitals. In Ukraine, over 200 health facilities and 1,635 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Peter Maurer, president of the ICRC, requested protection for humanitarian action so that aid agencies can maintain access to civilians. ICRC has also called for parties to agree to terms so safe passage of civilians is possible., Protecting Red Cross Workers, The Red Cross emblem is strictly regulated under humanitarian law. In armed conflict, it may be used by medical staff and facilities, including army medics and vehicles. It may also be used by Red Cross and Red Crescent workers, vehicles, facilities and the humanitarian relief they bring.
Resources for People Affected by the Conflict, How to Find a Missing Loved One, If you are trying to locate or get in touch with a U.S. citizen, please contact the U.S. Department of State Overseas Citizens Services Office online or call 1-888-407-4747. However, if you are looking for a family member who is not a U.S. citizen but is located in either Ukraine or Russia, the Red Cross may be able to reconnect you through our Restoring Family Links program., In neighboring countries where Ukrainians have fled, the Red Cross is distributing SIM cards for cell phones, so people can get in touch with their loved ones. Some family members have maintained contact with each other, but the situation is rapidly changing. As of now, most have maintained their own family connections via cell phones, but it is important to note that the telecommunication systems in the region have been affected. The ICRC and Ukraine Red Cross will continue to work together to help reconnect families, despite considerable challenges on the ground., How can I learn more about the Red Cross response?, ICRC and IFRC have a comprehensive list of resources, including maps, press releases, videos, photos and stories, further expanding upon Red Cross efforts in the region. To learn more about the role of the American Red Cross in this crisis, visit redcross.org/ukraine., About the American Red Cross:, *The American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides comfort to victims of disasters; supplies about 40% of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; distributes international humanitarian aid; and supports veterans, military members and their families. The Red Cross is a nonprofit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to deliver its mission. *For more information, please visit redcross.org or cruzrojaamericana.org, or visit us on Twitter at @RedCross.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-red-cross-provides-safe-passage-continues-support

The first instalment of €600 million from this emergency Macro-Financial Assistance operation was disbursed in two tranches on 11 and 18 March., These funds are provided to Ukraine in the form of long-term loans on highly favourable terms. They contribute to financing part of the sizable funding gap of the country, estimated by International Financial Institutions at around $15 billion for the second quarter of 2022. This Macro-Financial Assistance is enhancing Ukraine's macroeconomic stability and supporting the continuous operation of state functions at this critical juncture. The disbursement is a tangible demonstration of the EU's unwavering support for Ukraine., The disbursement follows an assessment of the authorities' progress with implementing the structural policy measures agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding. The Commission has concluded that the authorities, overall, have taken action towards the implementation of the agreed conditionality. However, the current war circumstances constitute an event of force majeure that impedes the effective completion of the structural policy measures. As an exceptional response to the acute financing needs of Ukraine, and since the conditionality cannot be achieved at this stage for reasons of force majeure, the Commission decided to proceed with the disbursement of the second tranche as a matter of urgency., Members of the College said:, President Ursula von der Leyen said: *“In these extremely difficult times, the EU unwaveringly stands in support of Ukraine and of its courageous people. Today, we disbursed €600 million in emergency Macro-Financial Assistance to address **Ukraine's acute financing needs, thereby ensuring it can keep on running essential services and addressing basic daily needs. *Today's disbursement is the last tranche of the €1.2 billion financial aid package I announced at the end of January. Going forward, the EU will continue to provide short-term financial support to Ukraine while accompanying it in its long-term reconstruction, in line with the plans announced on Wednesday. Ukraine will get back on its feet as a democratic and prosperous country”., Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for an Economy that Works for People said: *“*Europe has not flinched from supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's relentless military aggression. Since this invasion began, the EU has provided €4.1 billion to help Ukraine and its people. This includes €1.2 billion in emergency macro-financial assistance – and today, we paid out €600 million to Ukraine as the second tranche of this programme. The EU will continue to provide financial support: this week, we announced new exceptional macro-financial assistance of up to €9 billion in loans and started working on a financial plan for Ukraine's long-term reconstruction.”, Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy said: “Two days after we announced our new plan to support Ukraine financially in both the short and long term, today we bring further relief to the country's budget with the disbursement of the remaining €600 million in emergency macro-financial assistance decided earlier this year. This is a further meaningful contribution to Ukraine's immediate financing needs, which are under unprecedented pressure due to Russia's invasion. We stand in solidarity with Ukraine today and will do so tomorrow.”, Background, Macro-financial assistance (MFA) operations are part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring countries and are intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. They are available to EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems., Since the Russian aggression started, the EU has significantly stepped up its support, mobilising around €4.1 billion to support Ukraine's overall economic, social and financial resilience in the form of macro-financial assistance, budget support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid., Addressing Ukraine's significant short-term financial support to sustain basic services, to address humanitarian needs and to fix the most essential destroyed infrastructure will require a joint international effort, in which the Union will be ready to play its part. On 18 May, the Commission set out plans in a Communication for the EU's immediate response to address Ukraine's financing gap, as well as the longer-term reconstruction framework. With this Communication, which follows from the European Council call to address the consequences of the war in Ukraine via a dedicated Europe-led effort, the Commission envisages to propose granting Ukraine in 2022 additional macro-financial assistance in the form of loans of up to €9 billion, to be complemented by support from other bilateral and multilateral international partners, including the G7.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-disburses-eu600-million-macro-financial-assistance-ukraine

In the east, we are still supplying people with food and hygiene supplies, and we are distributing blankets and drinking water; and in the west equipping refugee collective centres. We are also distributing financial support to the most vulnerable and helping others through an extensive network of local charities. Directly in Ukraine, we have 171 employees working from offices in Lviv, Dnipro, and Kyiv. We also operate material aid warehouses in five locations., In the Czech Republic, we work in ten Czech regions; we are training Czech teachers to work with children who fled the war; we are running a phone helpline for Ukrainians who have fled here, and we are undertaking other activities to aid Ukrainians. To maximise our effectiveness, we have financially supported 67 other aid organisations working in areas we cannot cover on our own., Following our SOS UKRAINE emergency appeal, many individual citizens, companies, and foundations have contributed more than €74,9 (CZK 1,851,844,615) to help victims of war. Nearly 500,000 donors have contributed to the relief effort. In addition to this, we are also able to help in Ukraine thanks to the support of institutional donors. Among the most important are the European Union, UN agencies, and several governments., Read our summary of aid to people affected by the war in Ukraine., CONTENTS, OUR AID IN UKRAINE, Food, hygiene, and blankets for besieged cities and refugees, We are supplying water to tens of thousands of people, We are equipping collective centres, We are distributing cash for internal refugees, We are working through local organisations, HELP IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, We help refugees in ten regions of the Czech Republic and on the helpline, In the field, we are doing individual social work, We strive for systemic changes by proposing our own solutions, Thousands are calling the Ukrainian helpline, We are supporting dozens of organisations with the money we raised, We are supporting education and teaching staff, WE ARE PROVIDING AID IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, ""In the first three months since the invasion of Ukraine, we have been able to help those most in need across the country. Thanks to the generosity of our donors, we have become the largest supplier of humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the first month,"" says Šimon Pánek, Director of People in Need., OUR AID IN UKRAINE, Food, hygiene, and blankets for besieged cities and refugees, TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL AID WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF €13 821 984, Just three days after the invasion began, a trio of PIN trucks loaded with humanitarian aid set off for Lviv, where our team had relocated after the invasion. A week later, we dispatched trains loaded with food and other aid to Kyiv and Dnipro. At the same time, we were equipping collective centres for refugees, and our teams provided psychosocial support to those who needed it., ""We are implementing a huge humanitarian aid operation in Ukraine with our partners, such as People in Need. An organisation that was one of the few to get aid to the most needy places at the beginning of the war,"" said Janez Lenarčič, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management and Humanitarian Aid., In the first three weeks, we delivered over eight hundred tonnes of aid to Ukraine. PIN trucks gradually reached the besieged city of Sumy, and later also Sievierodonetsk, Bucha, Irpin and Chernihiv. In total, we have dispatched fourteen trains and thirty-six trucks so far., In the last three weeks, we have delivered food and hygiene supplies to sixteen thousand people in Zaporizhia, Mykolaiv, Dnipro and Kharkiv. We have delivered five hundred mattresses to bomb shelters and medical facilities in Kharkiv. We delivered ten tonnes of food for seven hundred people in the Donetsk Oblast. Another forty tonnes of food and hygiene supplies should arrive in the coming days in the towns of the Donetsk Oblast., ""We are going to gradually replace the import of humanitarian aid by buying goods locally, in areas where the market has already stabilised, so as not to increase prices for locals. In eastern Ukraine, for example, we plan to get locally sourced food aid to 45,000 people. In addition, we are also distributing seeds in western Ukraine to help people make it through the agricultural season, and we have already distributed 15,000 seed kits in the Sumy Oblast. In Chernihiv, we are delivering shelter kits for basic house repairs and also providing financial support to vulnerable groups,"" said Petr Drbohlav, PIN’s Director of Eastern Partnership and the Balkans., We are supplying water to tens of thousands of people, AID WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF €195 273, We continue to supply water to tens of thousands of people in eastern Ukraine; we regularly distribute six to ten litres of water per person in jerry cans and bottles. Whilst we try to buy water locally, our trucks from the Czech Republic have also taken bottled water and empty jerry cans to Ukraine., In the last month, we have delivered water to eighteen thousand five hundred people in Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia Oblasts. In the Mykolaiv Oblast, we distributed water to thirteen thousand people, and in Kharkiv, we distributed twenty-one thousand litres of bottled water to five thousand people. But drinking water is not a given in western Ukraine either; for example, we will be supplying water pumps to the town of Irpin, near Kyiv, and we are planning to restore the centralised water supply., ""They can decide independently what to spend their money on, and there is no surplus of one thing and no shortage of another,"" added Petr Drbohlav., We are equipping collective centres, AID IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF €52 970, Within days of the invasion, we began equipping collective centres for internal refugees in western Ukraine. We regularly supply them with pillows, mattresses, blankets, washing machines, and hygiene kits. Last week, more than three thousand internal refugees in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast received twenty-nine pallets of non-perishable food, fifty sets of bedding, pillows and duvets, towels and other aid., We have been focusing on collective centres in Zaporizhzhia in southeast Ukraine in recent weeks. We are delivering hygiene supplies, food, mattresses, blankets, washing machines, and other equipment. We are building safe spaces for children to talk to psychologists and to have the opportunity to tutor or join distance learning classes, which are taking place in many schools despite the war., We are distributing cash for internal refugees, AID IN THE TOTAL VALUE OF €628 227, We know from previous conflicts that one of the most effective forms of aid is financial contributions directly to the people who need it. In places where shops operate, people choose what to buy, supporting the local market, and this prevents them from having to sell their items below cost., ""They can decide independently what to spend their money on, and there is no surplus of one thing and no shortage of another,"" added Petr Drbohlav., People register for cash assistance on their own or through non-profit organisations that have been working in a particular area for a long time. Based on several criteria, we select the most needy families, who receive the equivalent of about €70 per month. The amount is paid for three months and we aim to financially assist eighteen thousand nine hundred people soon., We are working through local organisations, AID IN THE TOTAL VALUE OF €1 814 332, Donor contributions also help us work through partner NGOs or volunteer groups in areas where People in Need does not have teams. Over 150 local groups have received financial support from us., The organisations we support provide food and water supplies for destroyed villages and towns on the front line; they buy mattresses or generators for shelters, distribute hygiene and medical supplies, and offer psychosocial support and tutoring for children. Together, we are working to ensure that aid reaches as many people as possible., Immediately after the invasion, we began financially supporting ten Ukrainian media outlets. We supported the news site Zaborona.com and Babel, the website Detektor media, and seven regional editorial offices, which are essential, especially for older people without internet access., We have provided substantial support to several organisations with different focuses, such as the 5 AM Coalition, the Ukrainian Helsinki Union for Human Rights (UHU), the Kharkiv Human Rights Group, and the Legal Development Network (LDN), which aim to protect victims, document war crimes and crimes against humanity, combat human rights violations, and much more. We have also assisted two organisations that retrain psychologists, and the DokuDays Ukraine film festival, which is creating a complete archive of war footage., We have supported the creation of two new centres for internally displaced activists and journalists to continue their work in Lviv and Ternopil. The project includes fellowship programmes that allow civil society organisations to implement their own projects or join established initiatives to assist in alleviating the humanitarian crisis., In late February and early March, we quickly relocated several dozen foreign activists who had fled oppression in their own country to seek refuge in Ukraine. They were at risk of ill-treatment by the Russian secret services if captured., HELP IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AID IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF €2 264 178, We help refugees in ten regions of the Czech Republic and on the helpline, Around 330,000 refugees from Ukraine have arrived in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the war. Throughout this time, we have been dealing with hundreds of requests for help every day. Whilst we naturally deal with emergency needs, we also work on longer-term support for these new arrivals. In addition, we call for systemic solutions to address these issues., We are involved in direct assistance to refugees in ten out of thirteen regions across the country. We are supporting municipalities, cities, and organisations working with refugees; we are engaged in social work and counselling and also humanitarian aid, we support education, we are working on a decent housing strategy, and we are providing a large amount of analysis to the State and NGOs., In the field, we are doing individual social work., In the places with the most significant numbers of Ukrainian citizens, we have created teams of advisors who help newcomers process the necessary documents, obtain humanitarian benefits, and receive food aid. We also help refugees find housing and work, find a doctor, and enrol their children in schools and kindergartens., Since the beginning of the war, we have hired forty workers from the Czech Republic and Ukraine, such as psychosocial workers and adaptation group teachers. And while in the beginning, we were focused on groups, we are now concentrating on individual social work., We strive for systemic changes by proposing our own solutions., As a member of a consortium of NGOs working with migrants, People in Need coordinates with other organisations, we meet regularly with the management of the National Assistance Centre for Ukrainians, we participate in many working groups, and we provide feedback from the field. From the beginning, we have been highlighting the importance of refugee integration. In connection with the increase in demand for accommodation, we have developed our own proposal for a solution to prevent the creation of refugee camps. We have presented an analysis of the distribution of refugees in the country to make sense not only in terms of housing availability, but also job vacancies and school capacity., Furthermore, we have organised Czech language courses and created a database of volunteers for the future tutoring of Ukrainian schoolchildren, and we are planning to involve female Ukrainian teachers in education., Thousands are calling the Ukrainian helpline., Since its launch, our Ukrainian helpline has received thousands of calls. Our teams deal with fifty enquiries a day, some of which take several days to process in cooperation with field workers or volunteers., We are supporting dozens of organisations with the money we raised, In cases of acute need, we use the money raised to help solve problems that have no other coverage. So far, we have supported sixty-seven other organisations. Another six have applications submitted or money pledged. Our material and financial assistance also goes directly to refugees who need to pay for things like translation of official documents., We are supporting education and teaching staff, We run adaptation groups for children, which are important for their integration into the Czech environment. We help families with enrolling their children in nurseries and schools, and we lend laptops to children so that they can join distance learning classes., We have organised Czech language courses, and we have created a database of volunteers for future tutoring of Ukrainian schoolchildren. In cooperation with the Czech Centre Kyiv, we are also preparing an essential online Czech language course, which will introduce teachers to the professional vocabulary associated with education and also introduce them to the context of Czech schools. We are also working to support Czech teachers who will teach pupils from Ukraine. We have also prepared online courses on challenging behaviour of pupils and students., Additionally, we have provided a wide range of materials for teachers and pupils on topics related to the war in Ukraine, such as migration, media manipulation, and propaganda., WE ARE PROVIDING AID IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, AID IN MOLDOVA WITH A TOTAL VALUE OF €228 343, Within hours of the invasion, countries neighbouring Ukraine experienced an onslaught of people fleeing. Already on Saturday 26 February, our team went to the Slovak border, where they helped to build mobile toilets, heated tents, and distributed hot food to families waiting at border crossings. A few days later we reinforced the existing branch in Moldova and helped in Romania., Currently, our assistance is focused on Moldova, where over 85,000 refugees from Ukraine remain. Moldova has received the largest number of refugees per capita, and refugees are mostly hosted in private households by ordinary Moldovans themselves. We therefore financially support around 3,500 families in the north and south of Moldova who have taken refugees in. Registration for this type of assistance works by phone, or at town halls and other public places to make sure that people without a connection or mobile phone know about our assistance., At the same time, seventeen non-profit organisations involved in refugee assistance have received financial grants from us. Thanks to this support, they can provide psychosocial support to children and their parents, help children with disabilities, and purchase material and food aid.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/three-months-invasion-ukraine-we-have-helped-more-one-hundred-thousand-people-encs

This is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. Some 8 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine and some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., As of today, more than 6.3 million refugee movements have been recorded out of Ukraine. At the same time, authorities have reported more than 1.8 million movements back into the country. UNHCR estimates that as of last week, some 2.5** million refugees had moved beyond countries neighbouring Ukraine., Inside Ukraine, many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys., Key figures - UKRAINE, As of 16 May:, 422,130 people reached with essential food and non-food items, winter clothes and shelter materials, 170,761 people received protection assistance, advice and referrals at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 331,000 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance. 166,630 have received their first payment., 68,204 people received assistance through humanitarian convoys delivered to hard-hit areas, 46,488 sleeping spaces created / improved in 163 reception centres and collective centres",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-13-18-may-2022
Private accommodation for persons displaced from Ukraine,Manual and Guideline,EU,Protection and Human Rights,20 May 2022,"The European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) has just published practical recommendations on the provision of emergency placement in private accommodation for persons displaced by the war in Ukraine. The publication aims to be a guide to relevant stakeholders (e.g., national, regional and local authorities, as well as civil society organisations) when matching displaced persons with available private accommodation., The Agency’s practical recommendations come as it reports that nearly 2,8 million people have registered for temporary protection in the EU. Beneficiaries of the Temporary Protection Directive have an automatic right to accommodation, access to medical care and public-school education (in the case of minors), while in the European Union., Among many other suggestions and tips, the EUAA notably recommends that authorities:, These practical recommendations do not aim to replace functioning and existing procedures within EU+ countries, regions, municipalities, districts and communities. Rather, they intend to complement these efforts while ensuring that safeguards for persons in need of emergency shelter and for those providing such accommodation are put in place in a coordinated, safe, effective and systematic manner., You can review and download the EUAA’s report., Russia’s War of Aggression against a sovereign, free and democratic Ukraine has displaced over 6,3 million according to UNHCR; with 5,3 million entering the European Union, including Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, as well as – separately – the Republic of Moldova. The majority are women and children. Since the adoption of the Temporary Protection Directive, which confers a right to accommodation for beneficiaries, national authorities across Europe have responded to the crisis by finding ways to increase their traditional reception capacity, including through the use of private accommodation., On 25 March 2022, the Agency organised an extraordinary meeting of its network of reception authorities to discuss best practices related to the distribution, allocation and matching of people fleeing Ukraine with private housing solutions - across Member States and Associated Countries. The subsequent consultations led to the drafting of this document, and also include comments from the European Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/private-accommodation-persons-displaced-ukraine
Ukraine conflict: Families of all POWs need answers on their loved ones [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,20 May 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) – As per its mandate given by the Third Geneva Convention, and in agreement with all parties, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is visiting prisoners of war (POWs) on all sides of the international armed conflict in Ukraine., These visits to prisoners of war on all sides in recent months have allowed the ICRC to inform hundreds of families about their loved ones. Many more families need answers; the ICRC must have full access to POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in order to provide those answers., The nations that agreed to the Geneva Conventions committed to protecting the lives and dignity of people deprived of their liberty during armed conflict. All sides in conflict benefit from ICRC's visits to POWs and civilian internees, a key humanitarian activity and legal obligation,"" said ICRC President Peter Maurer., The Geneva Conventions, as well as customary international humanitarian law (IHL), spell out the ICRC's right to visit all POWs and civilian internees, wherever they are held, in international armed conflicts. These visits help ensure respect for their life and dignity by reminding the detaining authorities that the captives' treatment and their conditions of internment or detention must correspond to standards laid down by IHL. This includes access to medical care, food, and water. They also cannot be tortured, intimidated or exposed to violence. In addition, they must be shielded from public curiosity., ""This is about the fundamental idea of protecting the individual person caught in the machine of conflict, an individual person who needs to be treated humanely, and who has a family deeply worried about their loved one,"" said Florence Anselmo, the head of the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency., The Central Tracing Agency, which receives registration information from visits and directly from authorities, has provided hundreds of families on all sides with information about their missing loved ones since the beginning of the international armed conflict in Ukraine., ""On behalf of all the prisoners of war and their families, we will continue our bilateral dialogue with unabated determination to gain access to all people held captive,"" said Mr Maurer., Note to editors and producers:

In the Lviv region, a missile hit a military facility in the Yavoriv district, damaging railway infrastructure. In the Chernihiv region, a missile strike occurred on the village of Desna, where eight people were reported killed and 12 were injured. In the Sumy region, strikes targeted Okhtyrka, injuring five civilians and damaging a kindergarten, canteen, and civilian buildings.
OHCHR is reporting that between 24 February and 17 May, there have been 7,964 civilian casualties, including 3,778 people killed, though these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA)., Although civilians in conflict-affected areas remain in dire need of basic goods and social services, ongoing fighting continues to impede evacuations. On 17 May, local authorities continued to evacuate the population in Luhansk region: 32 people were relocated from Hirske (including seven children), 8 people were relocated from Vrubivka (including one child), and 36 people were relocated from Severodonetsk and Lysychansk (including six children). Due to intensified hostilities, local authorities have noted an increase in the number of people who would like to relocate despite the dangerous conditions surrounding evacuations. According to local authorities, 720 Mariupol residents reached Zaporizhzhya on 16 May., IOM is particularly concerned about ongoing internal and cross -border displacement resulting from the war and continues to monitor the situation. On 9 May, IOM released the fourth round of its Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, General Population Survey, which documented changes in displacement and mobility flows from 29 April to 3 May. Inside the country, over 8.02 million people have been displaced (63 per cent women, 37 per cent men), an increase of 322,000 (4 per cent) compared to figures from 17 April, the previous round of the survey. In addition, there is a noted increase of displaced persons originally from the east of Ukraine, now totalling 49 per cent of IDPs (an increase from 45 per cent recorded during the third round of the survey). Overall, IOM estimates that a total of 13,686,000 persons have been displaced within Ukraine and or crossed the border to neighbouring countries.
As the crisis evolves, displacement and mobility patterns continue to change, requiring scaled-up and integrated interventions that address both emerging and existing needs",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-19-19-may-2022

School in Western Ukraine offers comfort after loss and displacement,News and Press Release,IOM,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",20 May 2022,"Uzhhorod, 19 May 2022 – Before the war, some 1,200 students walked the halls of School 6’s brick building, in the narrow cobblestone streets of Uzhhorod, the capital of Western Ukraine’s Zakarpattia region., Now, 263 people who fled from the east and south call it a temporary home – a familiar scene across the country., Among them is Oleksandra Telenkova*, 57, who fled her home in the eastern city of Rubizhne in Luhansk region. She spent a month in a cellar protecting herself from shelling before she was evacuated. Widowed before the war, she was separated from her son and grandchildren, who stayed behind., ""I came to Uzhhorod alone, but my family found shelter near Kviv,"" she said., ""My city has been bombed almost every day since the beginning of the war. I had a contusion when my house was shelled in March. I thought I would not be able to speak anymore,” she added, sitting on a single mattress on the floor of a classroom where she lives with six other people and a dog., Like Oleksandra, many have gone through long journeys and experienced the perils of war. Each day, she thinks about her destroyed home, and breaks down in tears. “My home was destroyed. There is nothing to return to. I do not know where I can go back to,” she said., The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and partners have been working to offer information to help Oleksandra and many others get settled as quickly as possible. “The welcoming of the people of Uzhhorod and the support received from humanitarian organizations has been outstanding,” she remarked., But after working all her life in a manufacturing factory in her hometown, Oleksandra does not know what to do next. She wants to find work in Uzhhorod but has some concerns: “At my age and with the situation in the country, my chances may not be great, so I am willing to do anything.”, As the war entered its third month, more than 8 million internally displaced Ukrainians, 17 per cent of the prewar population, struggle to find safety, adequate housing, and access to employment. A further 6 million people have crossed into neighbouring countries., A place to rest, Small chairs and desks are piled up around the school. They have all been removed from the classrooms. Instead, people – mostly women and children – sleep on mattresses laid on the floor, beneath chalkboards and crayon containers., IOM mobile teams are working non-stop to rehabilitate schools, student dormitories, sports centres and other buildings to provide safe and more dignified accommodation for up to 1 million displaced people. Windows, doors and roofs are being replaced; electrical systems rewired; more outlets provided; sanitation facilities improved; non-functioning lights and ventilators replaced; and temporary partitions installed for privacy., “Even though these are temporary solutions for displaced people, we are trying to improve the living conditions by providing safe, secure and dignified spaces to the extent possible. We are especially looking at integrating inclusive design features in these existing facilities, such as installing handrails in showers and toilets, so that they cater to the specific needs of the elderly and people with disabilities,” explained Nadia Tithi, IOM Shelter and Settlement Officer., The first part of this programme has been rolled out in the Zakarpattia region, which currently hosts around 180,000 displaced people. It will cover the five western regions of Ukraine, which are the primary destinations for newly displaced people – viewed as safer than areas where fighting is intense. The programme will then be expanded to other regions, depending on the need and the security situation., To help people like Oleksandra, IOM is working closely with local authorities to significantly expand the temporary reception capacity for internally displaced persons and identify buildings for rehabilitation to serve as collective centres for longer-term stays., Uncertainty remains as conflict endures, On a sunny day, a Ukrainian flag floats over the entrance of the school. The yard is silent; only soft light shines through lines of clothes drying in the back. Through a maze of school corridors, Mariia Grynchuk, the School Director, walks with a beaming smile towards what used to be the school’s sports hall. Dozens of mattresses are placed next to one another. Plastic bags with a few personal effects in them indicate which space is currently occupied., ""Our government asked all of us to help in any way we can,"" Mariia said. ""Here, we might not have much to offer, but it is at least something. IOM has repaired electricity and added additional sockets in the gym and classrooms. Now, people do not need to queue to charge their gadgets.” Mariia is proud of her school for being one of many facilities in Western Ukraine that has opened its doors to provide accommodation for displaced people., In the meantime, Oleksandra is hopeful that she will soon reunite with her son and grandchildren. “I have no idea how long we will stay here. I hope the war will be over soon. I would then like to go home, and I will see my son and grandchildren, but this is not an option now.”, Like every other person who managed to flee for safety, Oleksandra counts herself lucky to be alive, even if she has lost everything. But, like millions of other displaced people, she is living in this school without knowing when, or even if, she will be able to return home., *Names have been changed for protection purposes., This story was written by Gema Cortes, with IOM Ukraine Response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/school-western-ukraine-offers-comfort-after-loss-and-displacement

OSCE human rights office intensifies monitoring of abuses in and around Ukraine as evidence grows [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,20 May 2022,"WARSAW, 20 May 2022 – As the precarious security situation in Ukraine continues, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) is stepping up its monitoring of the impact of the conflict on civilians and prisoners of war for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, following Russia’s military attack in Ukraine almost three months ago., “The human impact of the military action in Ukraine is a tragedy that is still unfolding, and has already impacted millions of Ukrainian citizens forced to flee their homes” said ODIHR Director Matteo Mecacci. “Experience, expertise, and empathy are needed to investigate and document the abuses taking place in and around Ukraine, and that is what ODIHR brings. Above all, our many years of impartial monitoring of democracy and human rights across the OSCE region mean that an objective assessment of violations is assured – wherever they occur and whoever is responsible.”, All parties to an armed conflict must abide by international humanitarian and human rights law, which expressly prohibits indiscriminate attacks targeting civilians and protects the civilian population at all times against violence and inhumane treatment. Parties to the conflict must also allow swift and unimpeded access of humanitarian relief to civilians in need., After carrying out research remotely since the start of the conflict, ODIHR is now deploying monitors on the ground in Ukraine and outside of the country, conducting interviews with witnesses to violations as well as survivors. A final public report including a detailed analysis of these interviews will help efforts to ensure accountability for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law., ODIHR’s monitoring is prioritising the most urgent issues affecting the lives of civilians and prisoners of war, including deliberate attacks against the civilian population, the use of indiscriminate weapons, wilful killings, enforced disappearance, and torture. At the same time, monitors are looking at the situation of internally displaced persons forced by the conflict to leave their homes but still in Ukraine. ODIHR is also investigating the situation of people in territories not under the control of the Ukrainian authorities, and the denial of humanitarian relief and of the right of civilians to flee the violence to an area of their choosing., As the situation continues to develop, ODIHR is focusing on broader human rights issues facing the civilian population, also including human rights defenders. These include the right to liberty, access to information, respect for the right to freedom of expression, the right to peaceful protest, and the right to a fair trial. The use of sexual violence as a weapon and women’s and girls’ rights – which are often the first to be violated in conflict situations – also form an integral part of the monitoring., “ODIHR’s monitoring will help to ensure accountability for the human rights violations committed and provide justice for the many victims of this terrible conflict,” Mr Mecacci added., All OSCE countries have committed to “respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law including the protection of the civilian population” in situations of armed conflict, and to ensure “that those who violate international humanitarian law are held personally accountable”. Full accountability of the armed forces is fundamental to any democracy. At the same time, commanders also play a central role in upholding the rule of law and respect for human rights by the armed forces. The principle of individual accountability is a vital element of military leadership, underpinning respect for human rights and promoting responsible behaviour by each member of the armed forces., Contacts, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights

Its evolving work has included: supporting the evacuation and relocation of civilians; funding efforts to deliver emergency medical supplies and to protect emergency personnel; backing efforts to protect independent journalists and media; and supporting investigations of war crimes committed during the conflict., In addition to expanding its direct funding of IRF, Open Society has also launched the Ukraine Democracy Fund. With an initial $25 million from Open Society, the fund seeks to raise $100 million with other independent funders to support and protect human rights organizations, independent journalists, and other civil society groups., Open Society has contributed over $230 million in grants to Ukraine, benefiting millions of people—including more project funding over the past decade than to any other country in Europe., Nine Facts About the International Renaissance Foundation, The foundation was established in Kyiv in April 1990, shortly before Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union in August 1991. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion, IRF had satellite offices in Odessa, Kharkiv, Lviv, and Dnipro, and employed more than 60 people., The foundation supported civil society advocacy for Ukraine’s 2014 Association Agreement with the European Union, and subsequently for the 2017 agreement providing visa-free travel for Ukrainians across the 26 countries of the European Schengen Area., The foundation was one of the first major donors to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine in 2020. Emergency funding targets ranged from providing protective equipment to doctors and clinics in remote rural areas, to the promotion of accurate public health information across public and digital media., The foundation and its grantees were active supporters of the creation of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine in 2014, and helped lawmakers develop a new anticorruption law that required public officials to declare their assets., In 2015, local groups supported by the foundation brought about wholesale reform of the Ministry of Health’s system for procuring HIV and tuberculosis medication and other essential medicines, after they exposed overwhelming evidence of corruption among Ukrainian distribution firms., IRF backed a multiyear campaign to establish an independent public service broadcaster that led to the launch of the National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine in 2015., In the early 1990s, IRF supported the modernization of Ukraine’s Soviet-era educational system; today the foundation continues to support the Ministry of Education’s ongoing “New Ukrainian School” reforms that seek to advance an inclusive and participatory approach to learning and critical thinking., The foundation has supported the development of independent media outlets in Ukraine and has supported a range of fact-checking initiatives and other efforts to counter disinformation and promote informed public debate., IRF has actively supported the development of Ukraine’s legal aid system, which now includes a country-wide system of community-based paralegals and online tools dedicated to promoting ordinary people’s access to the protections of law., More from Open Society on Ukraine:, Open Society Launches Fund for a Free and Democratic Ukraine, Defending Civil Society in Ukraine, All Our Coverage, Contact, Communications

"Amid war and hardship, I’ve seen so much resilience: Pact’s Ukraine country director reflects",News and Press Release,Pact,Protection and Human Rights,19 May 2022,"I was asleep when the phone rang around 5 a.m. on Feb. 24. “It’s started,” I heard my son’s voice say. I knew immediately what he meant. The United States and the UK had been warning for months that Russia was planning a war in Ukraine much bigger than the one that had been simmering on our eastern border for eight years. Still, I went numb., It can’t be a full-scale war, I thought. We’ll wait this out in our apartment here in Kyiv, my husband and I decided. For the first few days, we stayed in our apartment’s hallway during Russia’s assaults to be away from the windows. Soon the bombing and shooting became unbearably loud, so we’d run to the building’s bomb shelter seven or eight times a day, sleeping between strikes, whether day or night., After a week that was a complete blur, we decided we had to leave Kyiv. The next morning at 7 a.m., as soon as the martial law curfew had lifted for the day, my husband, my son and I were in the car speeding away from the explosions. Kyiv looked like a ghost city. We made it to a small town in Ternopil and stayed there for a week with the family of my son’s friend. Next we found a safe place in Ivano Frankivsk, where we lived for the next two months., Through it all, like many of my Pact Ukraine colleagues, I never stopped working. Miraculously, internet and phones remained functional, and I was essentially online 24/7, doing all that I could with Pact’s local staff and partners to help our fellow Ukrainians amid a war that in many ways still seems unbelievable., In the decade that I’ve worked for Pact – the last five and a half years as Pact Ukraine country director – I’ve always appreciated the organization’s dedication to its local staff around the world, and the safety of me and my colleagues was Pact’s top priority when the bombing began. We had a contingency plan in place even before the war and had already let our Ukrainian staff of about 60 people know that they could relocate out of Kyiv if they chose. The morning that the strikes began, I sent an email encouraging everyone to get out if they could. I was in touch daily with the staff and with Pact’s senior management team. Our planning horizon was basically one day ahead, as the situation was changing so rapidly. Only a handful of our staff decided to remain in Kyiv, and I worried about them so much. I called them regularly, and just hearing their voices was a huge relief. On the whole, our staff supported each other tremendously, and it has made such a difference., As a team, our focus, of course, was doing whatever we could to meet what we knew would be a huge emerging need for humanitarian assistance across Ukraine. Pact implements several large development projects in Ukraine, including two supporting women’s rights and empowerment that are funded by Global Affairs Canada. Under those projects, we work with dozens of local partners – women’s rights organizations across the country, whose capacity Pact works to strengthen. We knew our networks were a powerful tool for quickly providing humanitarian assistance, and we had to make the most of it., We reached out to our partners immediately to make sure they were safe and to coordinate next steps. Global Affairs Canada was one of the first donors to respond to the rapidly growing humanitarian crisis, and they allowed us flexibility to provide aid. UN agencies whose mandate is to provide humanitarian assistance were not able to respond promptly; we were because of our partner organizations on the ground, both in areas of hostilities and in regions where people fled looking for safety. We worked hand in hand with our partners procuring and delivering life-saving humanitarian aid to women and families. This was our emergency response in the first four weeks of the war, and gradually, together with partner organizations, we began to assess the needs of internally displaced women to support them in the longer-term. Some needs we were able to meet under our current programs, but some newly emerged needs required additional funding, so we started looking for it., The fact that we were able to pivot and that our partners provided support to more than 17,000 people in two months is just more evidence that women and girls can do anything. A big lesson for me has been that women and women’s organizations are extremely capable and resilient – even more than I’d realized., I’ve seen Pact’s team do such meaningful work under the most difficult of circumstances, and that is what has kept me going., I’ve seen so much resilience over the past few months. I’ve seen people come together in the best way. I’ve seen such courage and faith in our victory. I’ve seen volunteers unite and businesses step up to support Ukraine’s incredible army. I’ve seen Pact’s team do such meaningful work under the most difficult of circumstances, and that is what has kept me going. All those hard moments, the fear, seem to fade away., I’ve seen that Ukraine and Ukrainians can change the world by doing amazing things and making the impossible a reality – maybe because we don’t know that it’s not possible, so we just try. I am still thinking about Ukraine’s secret for resilience, and I haven’t been able to come up with a short answer. It’s very multifaceted., It’s for this reason – even amid so much loss and hardship – that I have great hope for Ukraine’s future. I believe that a peaceful, prosperous Ukraine is on the horizon, one that serves as a model for countries across the globe. A Ukraine where Pact has no work left to do because Ukrainians are equipped to take good care of themselves, and where one reason why is because women are engaged in decision making, with their voices heard and their skills and capabilities contributing abundantly to Ukraine’s development.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/amid-war-and-hardship-ive-seen-so-much-resilience-pacts-ukraine-country-director-reflects
Loss that cannot be counted: An MCC partner in Ukraine supports people destabilized by war,News and Press Release,MCC,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",19 May 2022,"By Jason Dueck, Content note: This story contains a brief description of a stillbirth, As millions of civilians continue to flee the devastation of the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, organizations like MCC partner UMAN (Charitable Foundation Uman Help Center) are working tirelessly to support those who've left everything they know behind., UMAN operates in the Ukrainian city of Uman, about 200 km (124 miles) from the capital of Kyiv. Due to its centrality within the country, it's been a major hub for the mass movement of displaced people. Hundreds of thousands of people pass through, some stop for a night or two on their way to the west and many others choose to stay., Dima Krotik, founder and director of UMAN, says around 100,000 displaced people have resettled in the Cherkasy oblast (province) surrounding Uman, itself a city of only 80,000 before the invasion. He says the needs are great and the supply is limited., ""Since the first week [of the war], we've been organizing distribution events for these people where we distribute food and other basic items. The supply chain for food has been inconsistent, but it's improving. We still had a container with comforters and hygiene kits left in it, so we've been distributing those as well. MCC responded very quickly by providing some funds, so we were able to be effective very quickly."", MCC is shipping five more containers of emergency supplies like that one to Ukraine with more planned for later in the year. With this increased demand for supplies in Ukraine and other countries around the world, MCC's inventory is getting low --- donations of comforters, towels, soap and other kits are greatly needed. To find instructions and drop-off locations visit MCC Canada's website or MCC U.S.'s website., Before the war, UMAN primarily worked with people with very little or no income, but Krotik says that now he hears countless testimonies of people who've lost their otherwise comfortable lives in a flash., ""People are sharing with me that just a couple of days ago, they had everything --- a house, a car, jobs. Or they might get into the city in a very nice car but have nothing else but the clothes on their backs and now they are coming to us for food and secondhand clothes. They're not fleeing poverty, they're fleeing war."", He says he's heard a lot of very difficult stories over the last few months, but one family in particular has not left his thoughts., ""There was a family from Poposna, which has been completely destroyed --- they have nothing to go back to. The family has many children. They asked us if we could house them because they have nowhere to go back to. The mother, she was pregnant and quite long-term, seven or eight months. And because of the stressful situation, the child died in her womb. We were able to find a house for them in a village near Uman, but we don't know if they'll stay here once the war is over."", For those trying to survive under such taxing conditions, hope can feel like an exhausted resource. But Krotik, who is also a pastor of a local church, says a very important part of the work UMAN is doing is offering counselling and spiritual care., ""We talk and listen and pray with people, we invite them to our church and into our small groups,"" he says. They also offer Scripture verses about anxiety and living in fearful times. ""Encouragement is very helpful so people don't fall into despair."", MCC's response to the crisis in Ukraine is ongoing and includes supplying food, cash, shelter, medicine and hygiene supplies through our partners. Since the beginning of the invasion, MCC has allocated $1.8 million Canadian (about $1.4 million) for its initial humanitarian response., In Canada, support this work by donating here or finding a drop-off location to donate relief supplies. In the U.S, donate here or find a drop-off location to donate relief supplies., Mennonite Central Committee: Relief, development and peace in the name of Christ, -END-, Jason Dueck is a communications specialist from Winnipeg, Man., Questions about this release may be directed to Linda Espenshade, lindaespenshade@mcc.org, 717-859-1151., Read the story online at mcccanada.ca/stories/loss-cannot-be-counted (CA) or mcc.org/stories/loss-cannot-be-counted (U.S.), Photos Available: To download these photos, please visit the News Service 2022photo collection.

Recovery and Reconstruction",19 May 2022,"We, the G7 Development Ministers, condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression which it continues to wage against Ukraine, now also enabled by the Belarusian government. Russia’s war of aggression stands in direct violation of international law, undermining the core tenets of the United Nations Charter, and we condemn the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces and their proxies, as well as killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. We express our full support to Ukraine’s sovereignty and full territorial integrity, stand with Ukraine and its People in their fight against Russia’s aggression, and express our heartfelt condolences to the victims of this war and their families., Building on the work of, in particular, G7 Leaders, G7 Agriculture Ministers, G7 Finance Ministers, and Central Bank Governors, as well as G7 Foreign Ministers, we reaffirm our full G7 support for all appropriate restrictive measures, including sanctions and export controls against Russia and its proxies in direct response to their aggression. We underline that these measures are directed against Russia, and do not target essential exports of food and agricultural inputs, and recall that it is Russia’s war of aggression that has caused a significant further rise in global food and commodity prices amidst heightened volatility., As G7 Development Ministers, we remain gravely concerned by the tragic loss of human lives, including those of numerous civilians, as well as evidence of the deliberate and comprehensive destruction of civilian and public infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, airports, power plants and warehouses, destroying Ukraine’s economic and social development, and producing destructive effects on the environment, for years to come., We therefore commit to continued short-, medium- and long-term financial and technical support for Ukraine, directly strengthening municipalities and host communities as well as the public sector in their efforts for the longer-term economic and social reconstruction in an effective and coordinated manner. We welcome international efforts such as the announcement of the EU Rebuild Ukraine Facility, and the establishment of the International Monetary Fund´s Administered Account for Ukraine, support the World Bank Group’s support package for Ukraine, and stand ready as the G7 to coordinate and align our future efforts in close coordination with Ukraine and our international partners. We call on all countries and international organisations to join our efforts to ensure adequate support for Ukraine., In light of its courageous resistance against Russia’s war of aggression, we underline the importance of a strong Ukrainian voice in the international community´s early recovery and longer-term reconstruction efforts for Ukraine. Recognizing the immense destruction of basic social and public infrastructure, cities, industry and farm facilities in Ukraine, we as the G7 Development Ministers stand ready to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Ukraine’s economy towards a balanced and green recovery, which will also ensure resilience against climate and environmental impacts. It is essential that we continue to closely coordinate our support for the reconstruction of a free and democratic Ukraine and support to its neighbours, amongst others through multilateral partnerships., While the economic and social reconstruction of Ukraine and its society constitute an overarching long-term project, we remain committed to disbursing support to Ukraine quickly, including to address the immediate and medium-term needs of internally displaced persons scattered across Ukraine. Over fourteen million people have been displaced from their homes, including over six million refugees who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. In cooperation with the Government of Ukraine, we will enhance our support in the provision of short- and medium-term housing, rebuilding civilian and energy infrastructure, and strengthening access for a range of support services such as psycho-social, health, education, and social protection support for those displaced and affected., We underscore the significant disruptions to Ukrainian health systems caused by the Russian war of aggression, with hundreds of hospitals and health facilities deliberately damaged and destroyed by attacks, and with thousands of health workers being displaced. Millions of displaced people currently have limited or no access to health services, and people are dying because of disrupted life-saving treatments. We are committed to supporting the Government of Ukraine in their continued efforts to protect the health of the Ukrainian people from public health threats, respond to essential and evolving health needs, and air recovery of the health systems impacted by the assault and strained by the crisis., The G7 pays tribute to the unwavering resilience of Ukraine’s civil society, including women’s rights organizations and movements, and its people, and acknowledge the significance of building strong, resilient societies, including through partnership, against the external destabilisation by authoritarian regimes. We support the Ukrainian people’s heroic resistance as part of a wider struggle, in support of the right to self-determination, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Those values are unequivocally shared and upheld by the Group of Seven. We therefore note that Ukraine belongs to the European family and shares a common set of values, and acknowledge the European aspirations of Ukraine., We acknowledge that while Ukraine is bearing the brunt of the consequences, social and economic impacts of Russia’s war of aggression are being felt in neighbouring countries as well. As G7, we will therefore extend our continued support to Ukraine’s neighbours and our partners in the region. In particular, we strongly appreciate the solidarity and the efforts of all countries in hosting refugees fleeing Ukraine. Moldova in particular is experiencing refugee movements and must be supported in its endeavours to protect refugees fleeing Ukraine. In addition, Moldova and Georgia are to be supported in their long-term socio-economic, political and economic stabilisation, as well as in making them more resilient to external destabilisation., We underscore the need to safeguard the rights of at-risk and especially vulnerable populations in Ukraine and neighbouring states, including human rights defenders, independent journalists, persons with intellectual or physical disabilities, ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, and older people, in addition to those unable to flee besieged areas. We are especially concerned about those who remain left behind, and are being cut off from support, unable to access lifesaving assistance., As G7 Development Ministers, we acknowledge the short- and long-term effects of Russia’s war of aggression on partner countries of the Global South, as additional pressure is put on political systems and populations affected by an already dire situation caused by the pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, economic hardship, and other conflicts. Russia´s war of aggression against Ukraine is exacerbating disruptions of global supply chains, causing rising prices for critical minerals, fossil fuels and energy services, but also driving up prices for agricultural and food commodities and fertilizers, and is therefore worsening an already strained global food security situation. Against this backdrop, we want to reaffirm our continuous support on our path of accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030., We are particularly concerned about the global impact of Russia’s war of aggression on the rise in regional and global food insecurity and malnutrition, poverty and other inequalities within and beyond the region, and notably of its impact on countries affected by pre-existing humanitarian crises. The consequences will further worsen food insecurity and malnutrition around the globe, where up to 40 million people could face increased levels of food insecurity. We fully endorse the Statements made by the G7 Agricultural Ministers on 11 March and 14 May and welcome the G7 Foreign Ministers „Commitments on the Global Food Security Consequences of Russia’s War of Aggression against Ukraine”., We remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to the evolving global food security crisis, which includes providing continued support to our partner countries in the Global South, and will make coherent use of all stakeholder instruments and funding mechanisms to address food security and nutrition. We will support the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, and will address the causes and consequences of the global food crises through a Global Alliance for Food Security, officially launched at the G7 Development Ministers meeting, and other efforts, with the aim of transforming political commitments into concrete actions as planned by various international initiatives such as the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) and key regional outreach initiatives, including towards African and Mediterranean countries. The Alliance will bring together like-minded countries and players that want to lead the way and engage in agile, flexible cooperation fighting the imminent global food crisis. We stress the importance of all humanitarian and development stakeholders working coherently to protect countries with humanitarian crises from rising food insecurity and malnutrition, through increased and prioritised support to anticipate and respond to crises and to strengthen resilience against crises. We will keep the crisis on the political agenda, coordinate our support, offer political advice and provide far-sighted scenario projections in order to better manage the phases of the crisis that are to be expected in 2022 and beyond., We underscore that spikes in food, commodity, and energy prices can drive global fragility and instability. Food price inflation is a major concern, especially for the poor, as it reduces purchasing power and increases poverty. Increasing prices for food, combined with rising input costs, such as for fertilizers, threaten future agricultural productivity. We therefore support the endeavours of our partner countries to accelerate the reduction of our reliance on fossil fuels, and maintain progress in their just energy transition. We are committed to boosting our partner countries’ resilience against external shocks before, during and after social and economic crises, including by strengthening local sustainable agriculture and food systems and social safety nets. In the current crises, strong and coordinated development cooperation will be stabilising in the near, medium and longer terms., We also underline the disproportionate impact of this war and in conflicts around the world on women and girls, as well as on men and boys. Women and children face significant risks of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, and lack of access to lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services, and suffer disproportionally from the socio-economic consequences of war. In this context, we commit to protect the sexual and reproductive rights of all, as well as to support increased access to sexual and reproductive health services and assistance to victims and survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking, especially for women and girls, and LGBTQI+ persons. Recognising women’s critical role and contribution on the front line and in communities, we collectively commit to provide targeted support to the women and girls in Ukraine and in host countries. At the same time, the G7 commits to promote women’s full, effective, equal and meaningful participation and strengthen their role as active agents of peace and key players in the long-term recovery and reconstruction of the country. The specific role of youth in peacebuilding will also have to be considered in due course, not least through demobilisation and reintegration of men and women who are fighting in the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-g7-development-ministers-global-effects-russias-war-aggression-against-ukraine-and-g7s-comprehensive-support-ukraine-affected-neighbouring-countries-well-countries-global-south-19-may-2022

Recovery and Reconstruction",19 May 2022,"We, the G7 Development Ministers, condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression which it continues to wage against Ukraine, now also enabled by the Belarusian government. Russia’s war of aggression stands in direct violation of international law, undermining the core tenets of the United Nations Charter, and we condemn the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces and their proxies, as well as killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. We express our full support to Ukraine’s sovereignty and full territorial integrity, stand with Ukraine and its People in their fight against Russia’s aggression, and express our heartfelt condolences to the victims of this war and their families., Building on the work of, in particular, G7 Leaders, G7 Agriculture Ministers, G7 Finance Ministers, and Central Bank Governors, as well as G7 Foreign Ministers, we reaffirm our full G7 support for all appropriate restrictive measures, including sanctions and export controls against Russia and its proxies in direct response to their aggression. We underline that these measures are directed against Russia, and do not target essential exports of food and agricultural inputs, and recall that it is Russia’s war of aggression that has caused a significant further rise in global food and commodity prices amidst heightened volatility., As G7 Development Ministers, we remain gravely concerned by the tragic loss of human lives, including those of numerous civilians, as well as evidence of the deliberate and comprehensive destruction of civilian and public infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, airports, power plants and warehouses, destroying Ukraine’s economic and social development, and producing destructive effects on the environment, for years to come., We therefore commit to continued short-, medium- and long-term financial and technical support for Ukraine, directly strengthening municipalities and host communities as well as the public sector in their efforts for the longer-term economic and social reconstruction in an effective and coordinated manner. We welcome international efforts such as the announcement of the EU Rebuild Ukraine Facility, and the establishment of the International Monetary Fund´s Administered Account for Ukraine, support the World Bank Group’s support package for Ukraine, and stand ready as the G7 to coordinate and align our future efforts in close coordination with Ukraine and our international partners. We call on all countries and international organisations to join our efforts to ensure adequate support for Ukraine., In light of its courageous resistance against Russia’s war of aggression, we underline the importance of a strong Ukrainian voice in the international community´s early recovery and longer-term reconstruction efforts for Ukraine. Recognizing the immense destruction of basic social and public infrastructure, cities, industry and farm facilities in Ukraine, we as the G7 Development Ministers stand ready to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Ukraine’s economy towards a balanced and green recovery, which will also ensure resilience against climate and environmental impacts. It is essential that we continue to closely coordinate our support for the reconstruction of a free and democratic Ukraine and support to its neighbours, amongst others through multilateral partnerships., While the economic and social reconstruction of Ukraine and its society constitute an overarching long-term project, we remain committed to disbursing support to Ukraine quickly, including to address the immediate and medium-term needs of internally displaced persons scattered across Ukraine. Over fourteen million people have been displaced from their homes, including over six million refugees who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. In cooperation with the Government of Ukraine, we will enhance our support in the provision of short- and medium-term housing, rebuilding civilian and energy infrastructure, and strengthening access for a range of support services such as psycho-social, health, education, and social protection support for those displaced and affected., We underscore the significant disruptions to Ukrainian health systems caused by the Russian war of aggression, with hundreds of hospitals and health facilities deliberately damaged and destroyed by attacks, and with thousands of health workers being displaced. Millions of displaced people currently have limited or no access to health services, and people are dying because of disrupted life-saving treatments. We are committed to supporting the Government of Ukraine in their continued efforts to protect the health of the Ukrainian people from public health threats, respond to essential and evolving health needs, and air recovery of the health systems impacted by the assault and strained by the crisis., The G7 pays tribute to the unwavering resilience of Ukraine’s civil society, including women’s rights organizations and movements, and its people, and acknowledge the significance of building strong, resilient societies, including through partnership, against the external destabilisation by authoritarian regimes. We support the Ukrainian people’s heroic resistance as part of a wider struggle, in support of the right to self-determination, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Those values are unequivocally shared and upheld by the Group of Seven. We therefore note that Ukraine belongs to the European family and shares a common set of values, and acknowledge the European aspirations of Ukraine., We acknowledge that while Ukraine is bearing the brunt of the consequences, social and economic impacts of Russia’s war of aggression are being felt in neighbouring countries as well. As G7, we will therefore extend our continued support to Ukraine’s neighbours and our partners in the region. In particular, we strongly appreciate the solidarity and the efforts of all countries in hosting refugees fleeing Ukraine. Moldova in particular is experiencing refugee movements and must be supported in its endeavours to protect refugees fleeing Ukraine. In addition, Moldova and Georgia are to be supported in their long-term socio-economic, political and economic stabilisation, as well as in making them more resilient to external destabilisation., We underscore the need to safeguard the rights of at-risk and especially vulnerable populations in Ukraine and neighbouring states, including human rights defenders, independent journalists, persons with intellectual or physical disabilities, ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ persons, and older people, in addition to those unable to flee besieged areas. We are especially concerned about those who remain left behind, and are being cut off from support, unable to access lifesaving assistance., As G7 Development Ministers, we acknowledge the short- and long-term effects of Russia’s war of aggression on partner countries of the Global South, as additional pressure is put on political systems and populations affected by an already dire situation caused by the pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, economic hardship, and other conflicts. Russia´s war of aggression against Ukraine is exacerbating disruptions of global supply chains, causing rising prices for critical minerals, fossil fuels and energy services, but also driving up prices for agricultural and food commodities and fertilizers, and is therefore worsening an already strained global food security situation. Against this backdrop, we want to reaffirm our continuous support on our path of accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030., We are particularly concerned about the global impact of Russia’s war of aggression on the rise in regional and global food insecurity and malnutrition, poverty and other inequalities within and beyond the region, and notably of its impact on countries affected by pre-existing humanitarian crises. The consequences will further worsen food insecurity and malnutrition around the globe, where up to 40 million people could face increased levels of food insecurity. We fully endorse the Statements made by the G7 Agricultural Ministers on 11 March and 14 May and welcome the G7 Foreign Ministers „Commitments on the Global Food Security Consequences of Russia’s War of Aggression against Ukraine”., We remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to the evolving global food security crisis, which includes providing continued support to our partner countries in the Global South, and will make coherent use of all stakeholder instruments and funding mechanisms to address food security and nutrition. We will support the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, and will address the causes and consequences of the global food crises through a Global Alliance for Food Security, officially launched at the G7 Development Ministers meeting, and other efforts, with the aim of transforming political commitments into concrete actions as planned by various international initiatives such as the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) and key regional outreach initiatives, including towards African and Mediterranean countries. The Alliance will bring together like-minded countries and players that want to lead the way and engage in agile, flexible cooperation fighting the imminent global food crisis. We stress the importance of all humanitarian and development stakeholders working coherently to protect countries with humanitarian crises from rising food insecurity and malnutrition, through increased and prioritised support to anticipate and respond to crises and to strengthen resilience against crises. We will keep the crisis on the political agenda, coordinate our support, offer political advice and provide far-sighted scenario projections in order to better manage the phases of the crisis that are to be expected in 2022 and beyond., We underscore that spikes in food, commodity, and energy prices can drive global fragility and instability. Food price inflation is a major concern, especially for the poor, as it reduces purchasing power and increases poverty. Increasing prices for food, combined with rising input costs, such as for fertilizers, threaten future agricultural productivity. We therefore support the endeavours of our partner countries to accelerate the reduction of our reliance on fossil fuels, and maintain progress in their just energy transition. We are committed to boosting our partner countries’ resilience against external shocks before, during and after social and economic crises, including by strengthening local sustainable agriculture and food systems and social safety nets. In the current crises, strong and coordinated development cooperation will be stabilising in the near, medium and longer terms., We also underline the disproportionate impact of this war and in conflicts around the world on women and girls, as well as on men and boys. Women and children face significant risks of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, and lack of access to lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services, and suffer disproportionally from the socio-economic consequences of war. In this context, we commit to protect the sexual and reproductive rights of all, as well as to support increased access to sexual and reproductive health services and assistance to victims and survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking, especially for women and girls, and LGBTQI+ persons. Recognising women’s critical role and contribution on the front line and in communities, we collectively commit to provide targeted support to the women and girls in Ukraine and in host countries. At the same time, the G7 commits to promote women’s full, effective, equal and meaningful participation and strengthen their role as active agents of peace and key players in the long-term recovery and reconstruction of the country. The specific role of youth in peacebuilding will also have to be considered in due course, not least through demobilisation and reintegration of men and women who are fighting in the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-g7-development-ministers-global-effects-russias-war-aggression-against-ukraine-and-g7s-comprehensive-support-ukraine-affected-neighbouring-countries-well-countries-global-south-19-may-2022
"ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan QC announces deployment of forensics and investigative team to Ukraine, welcomes strong cooperation with the Government of the Netherlands",News and Press Release,ICC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",17 May 2022,"I can confirm that today my Office has deployed a team of 42 investigators, forensic experts and support personnel to Ukraine to advance our investigations into crimes falling into the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or the “Court”) and provide support to Ukrainian national authorities. This represents the largest ever single field deployment by my Office since its establishment., I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Government of the Netherlands whose strong cooperation in recent weeks has facilitated the secondment of a significant number of Dutch national experts to my Office in support of this mission. This collaboration will significantly enhance the impact of our forensic and investigative actions on the ground. In real terms, it will allow us to collect more testimonial accounts, support the identification of relevant forensic and digital materials and ensure that information and evidence is collected in a manner that strengthens its admissibility in future proceedings before the ICC., During this mission, my Office will focus on a set of core objectives aimed at accelerating our independent investigations and strengthening synergy of investigative action with national authorities on the ground in Ukraine. Through the deployment of a team of investigators, we will further expand lead development and collect testimonial accounts relevant to military attacks that may constitute Rome Statute crimes. Through close cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities, our forensic experts will map the existing action of national crime scene investigators in order to trace workflows and strengthen chain of custody with respect to hard evidence., It is essential that the work of all actors seeking to support accountability efforts in Ukraine benefit from effective coordination and communication. In doing so, we will significantly strengthen the impact of our collective work in establishing the truth. Reflecting this, the team deployed by my Office today will also engage with a team of French forensic experts on the ground in Ukraine in order to ensure continuity and continuation of their work with respect to the identification of remains, ballistics analysis and the storage and preservation of forensic evidence. We will also be engaging with teams deployed by other States in Ukraine in order to comprehensively map existing activities and strengthen coordination across all actors. It is my intention to ensure that this collaborative work is then continued through the consistent presence of my Office on the ground., Since taking up the position of Prosecutor in June last year, I have emphasised that the work of my Office will be founded on the principles of partnership, creativity and of bringing our work closer to those impacted by Rome Statute crimes. The deployment of this team today, supported through excellent cooperation with the Government of the Netherlands and Ukrainian national authorities, represents a model of how these principles can be converted into concrete action., These principles are also being implemented across the situations addressed by my Office. Following our issuance of a Note Verbale on 7 March 2022 requesting support from States Parties, I can confirm that 21 States have now indicated their willingness to second national experts in support of the work of the Office, while 20 States have committed to provide financial contributions. As I have also recently outlined to the United Nations Security Council in my most recent report on the Situation in Libya, I believe that this injection of support will have a tangible impact, multiplying the effectiveness of our activities in all situations addressed by my Office., Now more than ever we need to show the law in action. It is essential that we demonstrate to survivors and the families of victims that international law is relevant to their experience, that the ideals of the Rome Statute can be applied meaningfully in order to bring them some measure of solace through the process of justice., Today represents an example of how we can convert this imperative into results. I look forward to working with all actors, including survivor groups, national authorities, civil society organisations and international partners in order to accelerate this collective work moving forward., For further details on ""preliminary examinations"" and ""situations and cases"" before the Court, click here, and here., Source: Office of the Prosecutor | Contact: OTPNewsDesk@icc-cpi.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-announces-deployment-forensics-and-investigative-team-ukraine-welcomes-strong-cooperation-government-netherlands

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 17 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 18 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 18 May have been included into the above figures.

Ukraine: ICRC registers hundreds of prisoners of war from Azovstal plant [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",19 May 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) – A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has registered hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) this week from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol., The ICRC started on Tuesday, 17 May to register combatants leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties. The operation continued Wednesday and was still ongoing Thursday. The ICRC is not transporting POWs to the places where they are held., The registration process that the ICRC facilitated involves the individual filling out a form with personal details like name, date of birth and closest relative. This information allows the ICRC to track those who have been captured and help them keep in touch with their families., In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all POWs in all places where they are held. The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted. Whenever circumstances permit, each party to the conflict must take all possible measures to search for and collect the dead., The ICRC maintains a confidential dialogue with the parties to the conflict on their obligations under international humanitarian law., Note to editors and producers:, For more information please contact:, Mirella Hodeib (Arabic, English, French), ICRC Kyiv, + 380 952628422

Update 77 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (19 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,19 May 2022,"Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that new wildfires in the area near the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) did not pose a radioactive threat to people, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Informing the IAEA about the occurrence of the wildfires, Ukraine said the gamma dose rate levels in the vicinity of the Chornobyl NPP were ""not exceeding the reference levels""., The Director General said that, based on previous experience, such fires could lead to a very small increase of radioactive concentration in the air. He said the Agency agreed with Ukraine's assessment that it would not constitute a danger to human health. Spontaneous fires often occur in the area, still contaminated by radioactive material from the 1986 accident, this time of the year., In March, when the plant was still occupied by Russian forces, Ukraine also informed the IAEA about wildfires in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone that were not expected to cause any significant radiological concern. The Exclusion Zone was established around the Chornobyl NPP after the accident 36 years ago., Ukraine also informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country's 15 operational reactors at four NPPs, Ukraine said eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, IAEA headquarters is receiving remote safeguards data from the Chornobyl NPP as well as from the four operational plants in Ukraine.

Intense fighting continued in eastern Ukraine throughout the reporting period, especially in Luhanska oblast (east), while airstrikes and missile attacks were reported almost daily in several oblasts across the country. On 17-18 May, hostilities in Luhanska oblast were reported to move closer to its administrative centre – Sievierodonetsk. It was also reported that at least four civilians had been killed and one injured and that there had been more significant damage to civilian housing and infrastructure. While Luhanska oblast has been the most affected by hostilities, active fighting and air attacks have also been reported in eastern Donetska and Kharkivska oblasts. Throughout the week, there were also reports of airstrikes elsewhere, often hitting infrastructure but also residential areas and resulting in civilians being killed and injured. Namely, the strikes reportedly affected an oil refinery in Poltavska oblast (centre), residential homes in Zaporizka oblast (south-east), the energy infrastructure in Dnipropetrovska oblast (centre), a residential building, kindergarten and other buildings in Sumska oblast (north-east), residential areas of Chernihivska oblast (north), railway infrastructure in Lvivska oblast (west) and a private house in Mykolaivska oblast (south)., Meanwhile, in southern Khersonska oblast, humanitarian needs are growing – especially for medicines, food and cash – as active hostilities have been reported as continuing around Vysokopilska hromada, south of the Government-controlled Kryvyi Rih (Dnipropetrovska oblast). On 14 May, a gas pipeline was reportedly damaged in Stanislav (west of Kherson city).
Moreover, on 16 May, Kherson Mayor said that medicines would run out in two weeks, adding that oxygen supplies were also limited. The oblast authorities have reported disruptions to electricity and water supplies as well as to cell phone and online services in both Government-controlled and non-Government-controlled areas (GCA and NGCA), and that food is running low in some places. The need for cash and medicines is also widespread. The authorities have also been calling for safe corridors to evacuate civilians and deliver humanitarian aid. Reportedly, however, residents have only limited freedom of movement within the oblast and are not allowed to leave new NGCA areas, while volunteers with humanitarian aid are not allowed to enter. There was a report on 17 May of some civilians waiting for several days in a kilometres-long queue of vehicles – trying to drive north out of Khersonska oblast. There have also been reports of evacuation efforts in other areas., Civilian casualties and damages to civilian infrastructure. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as of 17 May, the number of civilian casualties stands at 7,964 in the country: 3,778 killed and 4,186 injured, according to OHCHR. More than half (4,326) of all casualties so far verified have been recorded in GCA and NGCA of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed, and many reports are still pending corroboration.Separately, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General reported on 13 May that there had so far been over 640 child casualties of the war, including 226 children reportedly killed and another 420 injured. The Prosecutor General’s Office said that most of the casualties, 139, had been registered in Donetska oblast, followed by 116 in Kyivska (north) and 99 in Kharkivska oblasts and that there were also significant numbers in Chernihivska (north), Khersonska, Luhanska, Mykolaivska (south) and Zaporizka (south-east) oblasts. The UN conducts independent verification of civilian casualties, which might differ from the number of civilian casualties reported by the UN Member States.
The Joint Centre for Control and Coordination (JCCC) in Donetska oblast (NGCA), on its official website, maintains a database of war damage, listing daily damage to infrastructure and social facilities in the NCGA of Donetska oblast, including medical facilities, educational institutions, social and production facilities (i.e., garages, workshops, administrative offices, grocery stores, etc.), critical infrastructure facilities (i.e., hazardous materials storage, transformer sub-stations, water storage, etc.), and electricity, water and gas supply facilities. The records show damage recorded since the beginning of 2022, however, the figures have not been independently verified by the UN. As reported, the majority of the damage has occurred since 24 February. Since the beginning of 2022, as of 18 May, 3,466 residential buildings have been damaged. In addition, 729 civil infrastructure facilities have been affected, including nearly 320 electricity, water and gas supply facilities, over 210 social and production facilities, more than 120 educational institutions, over 40 medical facilities and more than 25 critical infrastructure facilities.
The London-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) reported on 12 May that at least three people had been killed and 19 others injured in an airstrike that hit a school in Novhorod-Siverskyi (Chernihivska oblast). Reportedly, several air-fired missiles hit a school building and a boarding school, and the resulting fire also damaged an administrative building and a number of houses. The report also cites Ukraine’s First Lady, Olena Zelenska, saying that, while it has been claimed that only military facilities are being targeted, the war is deeply impacting the country’s children. Overall, according to theUkrainian Ministry of Education and Science, as of 18 May, 1,604 education facilities across the country have been damaged and 144 destroyed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-19-may-2022-enruuk

"ACLED Regional Overview - Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (7 - 13 May 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,19 May 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the region saw continued violence in the Russian military invasion of Ukraine and along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Demonstrations were recorded in countries across the region related to several causes, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, women’s reproductive rights, and in Greece, police presence on university campuses., In Ukraine, heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week.1 The Donetsk region remained the most active conflict zone, home to almost half of all political violence reported in the country last week. Russia continued to carry out airstrikes and artillery attacks and to clash with remaining Ukrainian troops in the besieged Azovstal plant in Mariupol. Ukrainian authorities reportedly negotiated humanitarian corridors for the surrounded troops in Azovstal; on 16 May,2 Russian troops began evacuating Ukrainian soldiers from Mariupol to occupied territories for a potential future prisoner exchange (Reuters, 17 May 2022). In the Luhansk region, Russian forces engaged in several unsuccessful offensive operations last week. Ukrainian forces repelled Russia’s multiple attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets river in the Severodonetsk district of the Luhansk region, inflicting significant losses on the Russian side (The Guardian, 14 May 2022; Suspilne Media, 13 May 2022). Following several effective counterattacks, Russian soldiers withdrew from Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, which suffered heavy Russian bombardment last month (Al Jazeera, 13 May 2022)., Russian forces continued to shell residential areas on the frontlines and launch missiles at various regions in Ukraine, often targeting civilian infrastructure. On 7 May, a Russian airstrike on a school building in Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region reportedly killed around 60 civilians (BBC, 8 May 2022). At least 50 more civilians were reportedly killed last week by Russian shelling and missile strikes across the country.3 Russian forces also increased the shelling of the Sumy border region, which Ukrainian troops liberated from Russian control in early April. These trends contribute to the 204% increase in violence in the Sumy region last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in the Sumy region in the past month., Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine took place in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In Russia, anti-war action continued last week, despite intimidation from the state. Over 100 people in several cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, were arrested for wearing anti-war symbols or protest signs during the Victory Day celebrations on 9 May (Novaya Gazeta, 9 May 2022). A day later, unidentified groups threw Molotov cocktails at two military enlistment offices in the Moscow region and Omsk (Activatica, 10 May 2022; The Moscow Times, 13 May 2022). This violence contributed to the 83% increase in violence in Russia last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., Meanwhile, on the occasion of Russia’s Victory Day, people gathered in Rome, Italy, in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia last week (La Repubblica, 8 May 2022). Demonstrations in support of Russian troops were also recorded in Russia, Germany, Spain, Cyprus, Moldova, Serbia, Slovakia, and Poland., In Greece, far-left students and members of anti-establishment groups demonstrated against police presence on university campuses last week. In Thessaloniki, demonstrations turned violent as demonstrators clashed with riot police, including those protecting the construction crew working on a new university library in a space formerly occupied by anarchists (To Pontiki, 10 May 2022). Since last year, there have been ongoing demonstrations against the government establishing a university police force, claiming that policing on campuses will infringe on academic freedoms. Amid the demonstrations, the Council of State, the country’s supreme administrative court, ruled that establishing a university police force is constitutional (To Pontiki, 11 May 2022)., Meanwhile, protests in favour of abortion access, and against the possible overturning of the US landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, were recorded in France, the Netherlands, and Czech Republic last week. If the ruling is overturned, individual US states would have a constitutional right to ban abortion (BBC, 3 May 2022). A wave of pro-choice demonstrations also took place in Croatia, though seemed to be unrelated to the developments in the US. Several feminist groups organized large protests in nine Croatian cities, demanding adequate healthcare for women. The demonstrations were triggered by the case of a pregnant woman who was denied an abortion by hospitals in Zagreb despite the foetus being diagnosed with a malignant and deadly brain tumour (Total Croatia News, 12 May 2022). Although abortion is legal in Croatia, doctors can refuse to perform the procedure based on conscientious objection, a right currently exercised by around half of the country’s obstetricians–gynecologists (BBC, 15 May 2022)., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued last week. One civilian was wounded amid fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces in the Gegharkunik province of Armenia. Additionally, one civilian was killed in a mine explosion in the Shirak province of Armenia and two were wounded in mine explosions in the Agdam district of Azerbaijan.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-7-13-may-2022
"Interview: “The war in Ukraine may be changing the women’s movement, but it’s not stopping it”",News and Press Release,UN Women,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",17 May 2022,"Adapted from a blog post by the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, Olesia Bondar, Director of the Ukrainian Women’s Fund (UWF) spoke to the UN Trust Fund on how the current crisis is affecting Ukrainian women and girls, and the key role of civil society and women’s rights organizations play in the context of humanitarian and intersecting crises., The UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, managed by UN Women, remains committed to supporting civil society and women’s rights organizations in crisis, while first and foremost prioritizing their safety. As part of its practice in crisis context, the UN Trust Fund is working to support current and past grantee organizations who are continuing to work for women and girl survivors of violence amidst the current crisis. Among them, the Ukrainian Women’s Fund has been transforming its operations to meet the needs of local feminist networks and coalitions to reach women and girls., How is the escalation of conflict affecting women and girls? What are you seeing as an emerging phenomenon?, Women and girls were forced to leave their homes and to face the risks of being killed, raped, involved in human trafficking, wounded or infected on the way of evacuation. Those women and girls who decided to stay at home or in the bomb shelters faced the same challenges., Numerous women and girls who have managed to survive are in the constant search for accommodation and means for living, taking care of children, elderly relatives and family members with disabilities. Lots of them lost opportunities to work and earn money. Many still need to heal from physical and psychological trauma., Many children have been sent to live with elderly relatives, where their parents assumed as safer places while they themselves stayed to work. Sixteen-year-old Liza did not speak after being evacuated from Izium. When she finally found the strength to speak, she shared that her mother was in Odesa. Liza had not been sleeping for weeks: she was afraid she would die in her sleep, never having hugged her mother., What role are women’s rights organizations playing in the evolving crisis?, The war in Ukraine may be changing the women’s/feminist movement, but it’s not stopping it. On the contrary, we’re translating most of our movement-development initiatives into new formats., One of the organizations supported by UWF whose focus was single mothers and mothers with multiple children has stayed in the war zone in Donetsk Oblast to rescue the wounded, women with disabilities and other women and girls with limited mobility., The leader of the organization, a mother of four children, together with other members of the volunteer group, was transporting people when her car was hit by targeted shelling. Nevertheless, she continued to drive until she lost consciousness., She said: ""It was important for me to get behind the wheel and show everyone that a woman does not succumb to fear, that a woman keeps it all operating. It lifts the spirits of other women and gives encouragement to men.”, Currently, she continues to coordinate the organization’s work from the hospital. She also shared that some of the rescued mothers have decided to stay with the organization to help rescue others who had been sleep and food deprived., Additionally, women’s rights organizations and human rights defenders are making sure that incidents of hostilities are being documented., How has UWF supporting women’s rights organizations, and what does your organization need at this time?, UWF is currently helping women’s/feminist organizations to implement effective and systematic solutions such as:, On 28 February, UWF announced a grant competition in response to the crisis caused by the Russian Federation’s military incursions into Ukraine. These grants are helping non-governmental women’s/feminist organizations respond to urgent humanitarian issues, with a focus on the needs of vulnerable women and girls., Over the next month, UWF will continue to provide rapid response grants for critical humanitarian challenges. We are also preparing institutional support grants for women’s/feminist organizations, as well as grants to strengthen organizational networks and to form alliances with organizations from other countries. Every day we seek and implement solutions that help women and girls overcome the challenges of war and mitigate its impact on their future. The UWF is also working on the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security National Action Plan, translating it into military terms., We encourage those individuals and organizations who are willing to help should resource women’s and feminist organizations timely and invent system solutions for crisis., UN Women* shares the UN Secretary-General’s concern for the safety and wellbeing of all civilians in Ukraine who have already suffered from so much death, destruction and displacement, especially women and girls as they often are uniquely and disproportionally affected in conflicts.*, *UN Women is working to support women’s priority needs, including access to information, safety and security, basic necessities, accommodation and livelihoods. Through a rapid gender assessment, UN Women is ensuring up-to-date data and analysis on the gender dynamics of the war and its impacts. In Moldova and Ukraine, we are supporting women’s civil society organizations that support war-affected populations as well as essential services for refugee women and girls. *",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/interview-war-ukraine-may-be-changing-womens-movement-its-not-stopping-it

Food security in Ukraine: FAO distributes seed potatoes to vulnerable rural families [EN/RU],News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",18 May 2022,"Some 46 000 people are assisted during the spring potato sowing campaign, Kyiv/Rome – Working to safeguard the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable rural families in Ukraine, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has distributed seed potato kits to 17 740 households from across ten of the country's oblasts so they can plant food in time for the next harvesting season., Some 46 000 people stand to benefit from the campaign which receives financial support from the European Union (EU) and the Central Emergency Response (CERF)., ""It's absolutely crucial right now to help farmers. The big ones but also the small ones, and those families involved in backyard farming,"" said Pierre Vauthier, FAO Ukraine Designated Responsible Officer. ""Agriculture is one of Ukraine's major sectors and is important for the country's food security. It is also a key source of income for the 12.6 million people who live in rural areas, who make up almost a third of the country's population."", In total, 862 tonnes of seed potatoes have been delivered to those in need over the last weeks. Distribution was achieved in time for the spring potato sowing campaign to ensure that this nutritious food source can be harvested in September., Each family or household - consisting on average of 2.6 people - receives a kit with 50 kilograms of seed potatoes with an expected yield of about 600 kilograms of potatoes. These may be stored for many months for later consumption, used for the following planting seasons or sold to local markets., At each location, FAO has been working closely with local authorities and implementing partners, who assisted in the selection of beneficiaries, distribution, monitoring and engagement with communities., ""Thanks to our cooperation with FAO, we have delivered 2.5 tonnes of potatoes to the Rudkivska Amalgamated Territorial Community in Lvivska oblast. This is for 50 households who host internally displaced persons,"" said Ihor Vuitsyk, Head of the Board of Lviv Agrarian Chamber, FAO's implementing partner. ""It is important that an organization like FAO really helps people, and today it especially helps those who are engaged in production because one of the FAO's tasks is to ensure local food production""., Some 15 tonnes of seed potatoes have been delivered to 300 households in Lvivska oblast, west of Ukraine. Out of this, 30 kits have been distributed to the families in the village of Khlopchytsi in Rudkivska Amalgamated Territorial Community. This village is now hosting over 150 internally displaced people from other regions of Ukraine., Another oblast targeted by the seed potato distribution campaign is Dnipropetrovska in central and eastern Ukraine where 3 690 households have received the kits. Some of these were delivered to 41 villages in Verkhniodniprovska Amalgamated Territorial Community whose residents are hosting 2 685 internally displaced people., ""Some companies closed, reduced staff or fired people. We cannot provide work to the local population. And we have to think about how to feed people this winter,"" said Genadii Lebid, Head of Verkhniodniprovska Amalgamated Territorial Community, who noted that because of the disruptions and uncertainty caused by the conflict people are very eager to plant their gardens and have some food for their families., FAO's work in Ukraine, FAO has been operating in Ukraine since 2003 and following the start of the war, the Organization has developed and updated its Rapid Response Plan (RRP) to provide agricultural assistance and ensure food security to those most affected by the conflict., FAO's response includes providing crop and livestock inputs along with cash to support the most affected smallholder farmers and livestock holders to meet seasonal deadlines. This support will enable households to produce vegetables, cereal crops, milk, meat and eggs to feed themselves., ""In the coming weeks, FAO will reach 3 700 households (9 600 people) with multi-purpose cash transfers and over 14 600 rural families (38 000 people) with vegetable production kits to resume food production for consumption and sale,"" added Pierre Vauthier. ""We are also planning to distribute poultry and support vulnerable livestock keepers by providing animal feed and vitamin-mineral supplements. With more resources, we will be able to reach more people in vulnerable rural areas of Ukraine""., FAO is calling for $115.4 million in funding to provide support to 979 320 small farmers and medium-sized producers through December 2022 to boost food availability and access. To date, FAO has raised $11 million. The financial contributions have been provided by Australia, Belgium, the CERF Rapid Response, the EU, France, Japan, the Louis Dreyfus Foundation, Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA)., Further contributions are urgently needed to reach more people to maintain the spring cropping season and support the harvest preparation., More information on data, analyses, policy recommendations, and FAO's actions on the ground can be found here.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/food-security-ukraine-fao-distributes-seed-potatoes-vulnerable-rural-families-enru

This included:, a total of 3,778 killed (1,419 men, 929 women, 86 girls, and 97 boys, as well as 68 children and 1,179 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 4,186 injured (738 men, 500 women, 100 girls, and 115 boys, as well as 167 children and 2,566 adults whose sex is yet unknown), o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 4,326 casualties (2,070 killed and 2,256 injured),  On Government-controlled territory: 3,707 casualties (1,946 killed and 1,761 injured),  On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 619 casualties (124 killed and 495 injured), o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,638 casualties (1,708 killed and 1,930 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-17-may-2022-enruuk
First-ever meeting of WHO mental health coalition focuses on Ukrainians’ resilience and concrete steps towards change [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,Health,18 May 2022,"The first-ever meeting of the Pan-European Mental Health Coalition, a new network of organizations and individuals aiming to transform mental health systems across the WHO European Region, gathered to discuss ways to support the mental health of people in Ukraine., The meeting, held on 4–5 May, kicked off with an hour-long briefing led by WHO experts and mental health care practitioners supporting Ukraine. This focused on the extraordinary efforts being made to maintain the Ukrainian mental health system and support the mental health needs of people in Ukraine, as well as refugees fleeing into neighbouring countries., The war in Ukraine is affecting the mental health of millions through direct exposure to violence and atrocities, displacement and family separation. The health system in Ukraine has been similarly impacted, with WHO recording over 200 attacks on health care since 24 February., “Weeks of war in Ukraine have led to incalculable uncertainty, insecurity, grief and loss. Attacks on health care are depriving countless people of hope and access to services. Food insecurity and safety concerns are rampant in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Hostilities are causing immeasurable loss of lives and livelihoods, forced displacement and family separation,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe., “Ukraine’s mental health system, strengthened over several years following WHO’s special initiative on mental health, is already responding – through large-scale training of volunteers, promotion of self-care tools, and support to the most vulnerable in institutions across the war-torn country,” he added., “There is not a boy, a girl, a woman or a man who is not affected by the current crisis,” said Alisa Ladyk-Bryzghalova, National Professional Officer at the WHO Country Office in Ukraine. “And we try, as WHO, to support people as much as possible to overcome the consequences of the crisis for their mental health.”, Ms Ladyk-Bryzghalova and her colleague, Fahmy Hanna, Technical Officer at the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, spoke via video message after an airstrike which disrupted internet services in Lviv., Coalition “vital” for advancing mental health Speaking during the meeting, Stella Kyriakides, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, said that the war in Ukraine “compounds the mental health challenges that we have before us,” – many of which were revealed by COVID-19. “And that’s why this Coalition is so vital.”, Meeting people’s mental health needs during emergencies is a key area of work for the Coalition, 1 of 6 working packages discussed over the 2 days, by over 150 participants – including country representatives, staff of international nongovernmental organizations, mental health experts and people living with mental health conditions., These working packages aim to position mental health as not merely one sector of the health-care system but as the heart of any functioning society – supported in workplaces, schools and communities, for all ages and groups. In more concrete terms, Coalition members are working on identifying good practices and tools and then delivering a framework for these practices to be easily adapted to specific settings and cultures., “We should aim at a fully inclusive European plan that would boost Member States to foster a new approach to the concept of mental health,” said Stelios Kympouropoulos, Member of the European Parliament. He called for mental health to be a political priority for all governments, with “significant financial investment at the level of scientific research and human resources”., The Ukraine briefing illustrated that a well-planned mental health system made up of well-trained, motivated professionals and volunteers can endure even in the most dire circumstances. Oleksii Kostiuchenkov, a psychiatrist of the Community Mental Health Team in Donetsk oblast in Ukraine, spoke of the adaptability of his team in spite of large-scale evacuations of patients with mental health conditions. “We continue to consult with our patients online and by phone,” he explained. He was followed by Natalia Morhun, a family doctor from the same area implementing the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGap)., Within days of the outbreak of war, WHO/Europe deployed a team of mental health professionals to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, setting up and leading working groups to coordinate with governments and other aid organizations, including the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). These partners worked together to provide survivors with all manner of mental health support – from basic security and family support to specialized services for people with severe mental health conditions. Ms Ladyk-Bryzghalova highlighted a stress management programme that WHO had jointly organized with the Ukrainian ministries of health and social policy., Hope for change, and determination to see that change through, was the main focus throughout the Ukraine briefing and the remaining 2 days of the Coalition meeting, when members met in small working groups to begin designing the working package content. There are plans to test some of the working packages in several countries by year end.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/first-ever-meeting-who-mental-health-coalition-focuses-ukrainians-resilience-and-concrete-steps-towards-change-enru

Protection and Human Rights",27 Apr 2022,"CRISIS OVERVIEW, The Russian military invasion on February 24, 2022 came as a shock to the country and the world (CARE, 2022) and is causing significant risks (including risk of GBV) to the affected population in Ukraine. The Ombudsman and Ministry of Interior of Ukraine reported cases of rape and sexual violence in nongovernment-controlled areas. Human Rights Watch documented ""apparent war crimes"", including rape, in Russia-controlled areas, and local officials in Bucha (Kyiv oblast) reported the discovery of a mass grave of civilians allegedly killed by Russian troops. The UN Secretary-General and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an independent investigation of these reports (UNFPA, April 5, 2022). After eight years of armed conflict – stemming from Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 -, the resulting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has become protracted (OCHA, 2022). With the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s most complex emergencies (ICG, April 5, 2022)., Ukraine had made substantive gains on women’s rights in recent years, with a developing state-level ‘gender machinery’ (See refer to relevant sections of this report for detail). These reforms were successful in contributing to the establishment of GBV response services in Ukraine with an investment of 200 million UAH from the Government committed to opening of shelters, crisis rooms and psychosocial support mobile teams for GBV in 2021. Prior to the invasion, these gains were already under threat from deeply entrenched and persistent gender and discriminatory-based inequalities, eight years of conflict in the east of the country, and the gendered social and economic stress wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic., This current crisis, with mass displacement inside and outside Ukraine, will add to that complex situation and put pressure on any gains that have been made (CARE, 2022)., Women’s groups and civil society organizations (CSOs) have been quick to react to the immediate priorities of their communities, but face many challenges as they attempt to provide support to large numbers of internally displaced people, host communities and those directly affected by violence and insecurity (UN Women, 2022). UNFPA has continued its service provision and preventive work without interruption., Multiple forms of GBV are being reported, with particularly high insecurity and risk for women and girls on the move, at border crossing points and transit/collective centres, and in bomb shelters. This includes reports of intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment, sexual violence (including conflict-related sexual violence), and economic abuse. There is a high risk of trafficking for sexual exploitation at borders where registration is patchy, little control of documents, and young women are often not accompanied by other family member. In some cases, volunteers may offer accommodation and transportation without vetting. Those who are traveling with children, who are pregnant, living with disabilities, or older persons may remain behind in vulnerable circumstances including volatile militarized locations and face life-threatening risks. Importantly, violence is taking place where GBV risk mitigation measures should be in place, such as collective centres and bomb shelters (GBV AoR, April 1, 2022). Conflict-related sexual violence is being reported in war-affected militarized areas with Human Rights Watch reporting cases of rape in Kharkiv (HRW, April 4, 2022) and The Guardian highlighting that women across Ukraine are grappling with the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence of sexual violence emerges from de-occupied areas. (The Guardian, April 3, 2022).Within Ukraine more than 7 million people have been displaced internally since February 24, 2022, and over 12 million have been affected in the areas hardest hit by the war and are believed to be in need of assistance (OCHA, March – May 2022 and IOM, April 1, 2022). 59% are believed to be female (IOM, April 1, 2022). In addition, by the 30 of March, UNHCR estimated that there were over 4 million refugees, making this the fastest growing refugee crisis since World War II (UNHCR, March 24, 2022)., This is a profoundly gendered and intersectional crisis. Under martial law in Ukraine, men aged 18 to 60 have to stay in the country and remain available for military conscription (Deutsche Welle, 2022). The vast majority of refugees fleeing the country are women and children - believed to be 90% (UN website) - including minoritized women and children such as Roma (Deutsche Welle, 2022). There are challenges for members of vulnerable groups, for example, the LGBTI+ community, including trans and non-binary people, whose gender according to their legal documents becomes a deciding factor in whether they remain in Ukraine or have the scope to flee the country (OHCHR, March 22, 2022)., Humanitarian needs within Ukraine, and in destination countries, are increasing exponentially. Many people remain trapped in areas of escalating conflict and, with essential services disrupted, are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of lifesaving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access (UNHCR, March 24, 2022; OCHA, March 28, 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-gender-based-violence-secondary-data-review-27-april-2022-enuk

Protection and Human Rights",27 Apr 2022,"CRISIS OVERVIEW, The Russian military invasion on February 24, 2022 came as a shock to the country and the world (CARE, 2022) and is causing significant risks (including risk of GBV) to the affected population in Ukraine. The Ombudsman and Ministry of Interior of Ukraine reported cases of rape and sexual violence in nongovernment-controlled areas. Human Rights Watch documented ""apparent war crimes"", including rape, in Russia-controlled areas, and local officials in Bucha (Kyiv oblast) reported the discovery of a mass grave of civilians allegedly killed by Russian troops. The UN Secretary-General and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an independent investigation of these reports (UNFPA, April 5, 2022). After eight years of armed conflict – stemming from Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 -, the resulting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has become protracted (OCHA, 2022).

Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 May 2022,"Executive Summary, The Russian offensive in the east continues although it appears to be making little progress.
There has been intense fighting around the city of Kharkiv where Ukrainian troops are trying to push back Russian forces. This is causing a further deterioration in the living conditions for those within the city. Elsewhere in Ukraine, air strikes and missile attacks have targeted key infrastructure including railways and bridges, hitting targets in the central region, Lviv and Odessa., The number of internally displaced persons within Ukraine has now topped 8 million, along with 5.89 million people having fled to neighbouring countries. Yet, there have also been significant numbers of returns, both from abroad (approximately 1.5 million border crossings) and internally (an estimated 2.77 million IDPs have returned to their home areas). However, many of these returns may be temporary in nature and therefore it is hard to be sure of exact numbers of displaced or likely future trends. In addition, many refugees have indicated that they intend to stay until the war is over, increasing the need to invest in long-term solutions for local integration Humanitarian access to the cities and areas most heavily affected by conflict remains challenging, with few international aid organisations able to operate in these areas. Efforts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant were finally successful and 600 people were evacuated from Mariupol and nearby towns, however evacuation routes and ceasefires continue to be difficult to implement. The presence of mines and unexploded ordination (UXO) is a further barrier, especially in areas formerly occupied by Russian forces., Similarly, there is limited access to areas currently under Russian control such as the city of Kherson.
Damage to roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure is also impeding humanitarian logistics.
Continued attacks on health facilities and difficulties in transporting medication are both impacting the availability of health services. Added to this is the risk of being caught in shelling/air strikes and the cost of health services (when many people have lost their livelihoods). Therefore the situation of the health sector is particularly grave in conflict-affected areas. The impact is also being felt on long-term health issues such as immunisation campaigns and treatment for those with chronic illnesses such as HIV., Eastern oblasts are experiencing higher levels of food shortages and food prices in comparison to the rest of Ukraine, this situation is exacerbated by the lack of livelihood opportunities as a result of the war. Although the food security situation has stabilised in many parts of the country, WFP estimates that one in every three households in Ukraine are now food insecure. There is an increased prevalence of negative coping mechanisms such as limiting the amount of food eaten, reducing the number of meals taken per day and adults reducing food intake to ensure children are fed.
The impact on livelihoods for both conflictaffected populations and the displaced is being felt. Women are being disproportionately affected by the conflict with many women facing increased pressure to provide for their families while male family members are involved in defence activities; at the same time they are taking on an increased burden as the primary carer., Reports of incidents of safety and protection issues particularly gender-based violence continue to be reported in conflict-affected areas. Reports of mass graves; burnt and severely mutilated bodies, along with widespread reports of rape and torture are emerging from areas recently retaken by Ukrainian forces. However, verification of such incidents can be both challenging and time consuming., Education facilities continue to be damaged or destroyed and access to education is a challenge across all affected groups. Those in conflict-affected areas may not have access to online learning or places conducive to learning.
Displaced children also face difficulties although provisions for refugee children to enrol in local education systems and for displaced children to access online schooling are being stepped up., In neighbouring countries, especially Poland (which is hosting approximately three million refugees) national infrastructures and services are witnessing an increasing pressure, resulting in additional challenges in the response. In addition, inflation rates are also pushing up the prices of commodities, especially food, although it is yet to be seen what impact this will have on the situation for refugees and host communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-09-may-2022
Ukraine Crisis: Stay tuned on the latest health science with the Geneva Centre of Humanitarian Studies,News and Press Release,Geneva Centre of Humanitarian Studies,Health,18 May 2022,"The Geneva Centre of Humanitarian Studies has mobilized its expertise to assist the humanitarian system by launching a Ukraine crisis resource repository, to provide a range of peer-reviewed, health-related academic articles covering the health challenges caused by the Ukraine crisis. The selection is reviewed by the Centre’s Director, Professor Karl Blanchet., ‘When the Ukraine crisis started we felt it was important to gather all the evidence-based articles in one place. This gives researchers a one-stop-shop, where they can browse what we have selected to keep abreast of the latest health-related research’ explains Professor Blanchet, himself an expert in humanitarian public health., The service provides a useful repository immediately and for future analysis. The range of articles shows the extent of the health issues facing those affected by the crisis. The health need spectrum is vast, including chronic disease management, sexual health, wound management, mental health, COVID19, dementia, and vaccination programmes., The service also aims to inform governments, humanitarian organisations, students and the media of the latest available information on the health situation of those fleeing Ukraine or trapped in the country. This page includes systematic reviews and analysis and it also provides links to other resources from reputable organisations where updated information is published., ‘Logging these articles in one place will prove important further down the line. Grouping the likes of Nature, BMJ and Lancet articles together, will act as a useful chronological map of the health issues and how they were addressed, and will provide a rich tapestry of sources for the purposes of research in the future’ concluded Professor Blanchet., This repository is updated regularly every week, and is an open-source, free service., -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, The repository web address link is: https://humanitarianstudies.ch/ukraine-health-science-resource/, Professor Blanchet is also available for comment or media interviews as a humanitarian public health expert., For further information or to set up interviews with Professor Blanchet please contact Ms Sian Bowen: sian.bowen@graduateinstitute.ch",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-stay-tuned-latest-health-science-geneva-centre-humanitarian-studies
"Ukraine: Executions, Torture During Russian Occupation [EN/RU/UK]",Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,18 May 2022,"Apparent War Crimes in Kyiv, Chernihiv Regions, (Kyiv) – Russian forces controlling much of the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions in northeastern Ukraine from late February through March 2022 subjected civilians to summary executions, torture, and other grave abuses that are apparent war crimes, Human Rights Watch said today., In 17 villages and small towns in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions visited in April, Human Rights Watch investigated 22 apparent summary executions, 9 other unlawful killings, 6 possible enforced disappearances, and 7 cases of torture. Twenty-one civilians described unlawful confinement in inhuman and degrading conditions., “The numerous atrocities by Russian forces occupying parts of northeastern Ukraine early in the war are abhorrent, unlawful, and cruel,” said Giorgi Gogia, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “These abuses against civilians are evident war crimes that should be promptly and impartially investigated and appropriately prosecuted.”, Human Right Watch interviewed 65 people between April 10 and May 10, including former detainees, torture survivors, families of victims, and other witnesses. Human Rights Watch also examined physical evidence at the locations where some of the alleged abuses took place as well as photos and videos shared by victims and witnesses., Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russian forces have been implicated in numerous violations of the laws of war that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch previously documented 10 summary executions in the town of Bucha and several other northeastern towns and villages during Russian forces’ occupation in March., In 1 of the 22 newly documented killings, in the Kyiv region, Anastasia Andriivna said that she was at home on March 19 when soldiers detained her son, Ihor Savran, 45, after they found his old military coat. On March 31, the day after Russian forces withdrew, Anastasia Andriivna found her son’s body in a barn about 100 meters from her house after recognizing his sneakers sticking out the barn door., Civilians described being held by Russian forces for days or weeks in dirty and suffocating conditions at sites such as a schoolhouse basement, a room in a window manufacturing plant, and a pit in a boiler room, with little or no food, inadequate water, and without access to toilets. In Yahidne, Russian forces held over 350 villagers, including at least 70 children, 5 of them infants, in a schoolhouse basement for 28 days, severely limiting their ability to leave even briefly. There was little air or room to lie down, and people had to use buckets for toilets., “After a week everyone was coughing violently,” said someone formerly held at the school. “Almost all the children had high fevers, spasms from coughing, and would throw up.” Another said some people developed bedsores from constant sitting. Ten older people died., In Dymer, Russian forces held several dozen people, the men blindfolded and handcuffed with zip-ties, for several weeks in a 40 square-meter room in the town’s window manufacturing plant, with little food and water, and buckets for toilets., Human Rights Watch documented seven cases of torture in which Russian soldiers beat detainees, used electric shocks, or carried out mock executions to coerce them to provide information. “They put a rifle to my head, loaded it and I heard three shots,” said one man who had been blindfolded. “I could hear the bullet casings falling on the ground, too, and thought that was it for me.”, Human Rights Watch documented nine cases in which Russian forces fired on and killed civilians without an evident military justification. On the afternoon of March 14, for example, as a Russian convoy passed through Mokhnatyn village, northwest of Chernihiv, soldiers shot to death 17-year-old twin brothers and their 18-year-old friend., All of the witnesses interviewed said they were civilians who had not participated in hostilities, except for two torture victims who said they were members of a local territorial defense unit., All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation found in the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions. International human rights law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, is applicable at all times., The laws of war prohibit attacks on civilians, summary executions, torture, enforced disappearances, unlawful confinement, and inhumane treatment of detainees. Pillage and looting of property are also prohibited. The internment or assigned residence of civilians is permitted exceptionally for “imperative reasons of security.” A party to the conflict occupying territory is generally responsible for ensuring that food, water, and medical care are available to the population under its control, and to facilitate assistance by relief agencies., Anyone who orders or commits serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent, or aids and abets violations, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., Russia and Ukraine have obligations under the Geneva Conventions to investigate alleged war crimes committed by their forces or on their territory and appropriately prosecute those responsible. Victims of abuses and their families should receive prompt and adequate redress., As a general matter, Ukrainian authorities should take steps to preserve evidence that could be critical for future war crimes prosecutions, including by cordoning off gravesites until professional exhumations are conducted, taking photos of bodies and the surrounding area before burial, recording causes of death as possible, recording names of victims and identifying witnesses, and looking for identifying material that Russian forces may have left behind., “It’s increasingly clear that Ukrainian civilians in areas occupied by Russian forces have endured terrible ordeals,” Gogia said. “Justice may not come quickly, but all steps should be taken to ensure that those who suffered see justice someday soon.”, For more information on the abuses documented in the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions, please see below., Summary Executions, Human Rights Watch has documented 32 apparent summary executions by Russian forces in Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, including 10 in a previous report on Bucha. Summary executions, irrespective of the victim’s status as a civilian, prisoner of war, or otherwise as a captured combatant, are serious violations of the laws of war. Anyone who orders or commits summary executions is responsible for war crimes., Kyiv Region, Andriivka, Anastasia Andriivna, 66, the mother of 45-year-old Ihor Savran, lives in the village of Andriivka, 40 kilometers northwest of Kyiv. She said that when Russian forces took control of the area on February 26, they came to her home, confiscated her and her son’s cellphones, and threatened to kill anyone who kept a working phone. She gave them an old phone and hid her newer, working phone. On March 19, a commander and a soldier came to her door, demanding that she let them inside. They said they had a device that had sensed cell phone usage coming from the area. The commander took her into one room to search for the phone, while the soldier dragged Savran to a summer kitchen in the yard. Anastasia Andriivna heard the soldier find Savran’s old military overcoat, from his 1993 National Guard service, and start shooting at it. The commander ordered her to stay in the house for the next 30 minutes, “without moving,” and left with the soldier, taking Savran., On the night of March 30, Russian forces withdrew. The next morning, Anastasia Andriivna left home for the first time in weeks, hoping to find her son. About 100 meters from her home, she recognized her son’s sneakers, with a red stripe, sticking out of a barn door. She said:, He was lying there in a fetal position, with his hands tucked under his head, and his jacket draped over his shoulders. He had been shot in the ear, with blood covering his face. His best friend [Volodymyr Pozharnikov] was lying next to him; he had also been shot. His legs were bent in an unnatural position., The stepfather of Anton Ischenko, 23, said that Russian forces came to their home in Andriivka and took Ischenko on March 3. Anton had been in the Ukrainian armed forces years earlier. The family found his body in a field in the suburbs of the village on March 31, the morning after Russian forces left the area. The stepfather declined to detail the state of Anton’s body but said that they had to identify him by his clothes., Motyzhyn, On April 4, a Human Rights Watch researcher in Motyzhyn, a village about 50 kilometers west of Kyiv, saw the body of a woman whom the authorities identified as the mayor, Olha Sukhenko, 51, along with the bodies of her husband, Ihor, and son, Oleksandr. There was a fourth body, an unidentified man, who had tape covering his eyes and zip-ties lying next to him, indicating he may have been bound. His head had a large hole in it., The four people appear to have been summarily executed, but Human Rights Watch was not able to confirm the circumstances of their deaths. A fifth body, an unidentified male with bruises and other marks, was found in a well nearby the mass grave on the same property. Human Rights Watch found evidence on the property and in the area in which the bodies were found that suggested that Russian troops occupied the area for an extended period, including discarded and partially consumed food and clothing consistent with that worn by Russian forces., Chernihiv Region, Novyi Bykiv, A Novyi Bykiv villager whom Russian forces had held with about 20 others in a boiler room said that on March 30, a day before the Russian forces withdrew, several soldiers came to the boiler room saying that they had an order to execute 8 detainees and asked if there were any “volunteers.” When no one stepped forward, they took away eight men. The following day, after Russian forces withdrew, the villager found the bodies of two of the eight men about 50 meters from the boiler room, their heads smashed. He said he heard that the body of a third detainee was also found a bit further away. Human Rights Watch has no information about what happened to the other five men., Staryi Bykiv, Russian forces in the village of Staryi Bykiv rounded up at least six men on February 27. Viktoria Hladka, the mother of one of the men, said she was sheltering in the family basement when Russian forces took her son Bohdan, 29, and brother-in-law Oleksandr Mohyrchuk, 39, from their yard. They had been smoking cigarettes, having just come up from the basement. Bohdan was a post office employee while studying management in Kyiv, and Mohyrchuk was a construction worker. Hladka saw their dead bodies and four others in a field the day after the men were taken., Human Rights Watch documented these killings through a telephone interview with Hladka just after Russian forces withdrew from the village. Human Rights Watch on April 16 went to Staryi Bykiv and spoke with Hladka, who said that following the Russian forces’ departure, Ukrainian law enforcement officers exhumed the bodies. An examination showed that some of her son’s ribs had been broken, and he had a knife wound to the heart and a shot in the head. Mohyrchuk had a knife wound near the heart and his neck had been slit. Hladka also provided the names of the other men found dead: Oleksandr Vasylenko, 39; Volodymyr Putiata, 46; Ihor Yavon, 32; and Oleh Yavon, 33., Yahidne, In Yahidne, Russian forces held over 350 villagers in a schoolhouse basement for 28 days, severely limiting their ability to leave, even for brief periods. Valerii Polrui, a local councilman from Yahidne, said that a village resident, Viktor Shevchenko, was shot on March 3, the day Russian forces arrived in the village. Polrui said that one of the soldiers told him that Shevchenko was shot because he was a major in the Ukrainian armed forces, which he said was untrue. Shevchenko’s body was found a month later, buried in his own backyard. Ukrainian law enforcement officers exhumed Shevchenko’s body and conducted a forensic exam. Polrui said that the forensic exam showed that Shevchenko was shot in the head., The bodies of two men who had been visiting Yahidne were found in a cellar on March 6 or 7. A villager who saw the bodies said their hands were tied behind their back and that each had two bullet wounds, in the head and in the back. Both were in their 40s., Petro Tolochyn, in his 50s, was believed to be a retired lieutenant colonel who had a holiday home in Zolotynka, about 6 kilometers from Yahidne. One of the women held in the school basement and who sat close to the door, which had cracks in it, described seeing an armored vehicle bringing Tolochyn, covered in a blanket, to the schoolyard. She saw Russian soldiers put him on his knees and question him, and then throw him into the boiler room on the other side of the schoolyard., The following day, the soldiers brought him to the basement, but took him away next morning, allegedly to take him to a hospital. Another villager in the basement who said he knew Tolochyn well and recognized him there, said Tolochyn’s body was discovered after Russian forces withdrew on March 31. Human Rights Watch visited the school on April 17 and saw a body bag. A villager who had identified Tolochyn’s body said it had gunshot wounds to the temple and left leg., Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske, On March 4, Russian forces detained Oleh Prokhorenko, 38, in the town of Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske. He was allegedly using his phone to film Russian troop movements and provide the information to Ukrainian forces. Witnesses said they saw Prokhorenko, after he was detained, digging trenches for the Russian soldiers, a laws-of-war violation. Then no one saw him for weeks. His body was found on April 8 in the nearby woods, shot and buried. The forensic exam on file with Human Rights Watch says that he had gunshot wound to the head with skull fracturing and brain destruction., Unlawful Killings of Civilians, Human Rights Watch documented nine cases of apparently unlawful killings of civilians by Russian forces in the Chernihiv region. Parties to an armed conflict, including occupying forces, may not attack civilians unless they are directly participating in the hostilities. Parties must do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives, such as soldiers, weapons, and military equipment., On March 14, between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., as a Russian convoy passed through Mokhnatyn village, soldiers shot to death 17-year-old twin brothers Yevhen and Bohdan Samodiy and their friend, Valentin Yakimchuk, 18. Yevhen and Bogdan were in vocational training to become electricians, while Yakimchuk was a first-year university student in Chernihiv., The twins’ sister, Tanya, and other witnesses said that Russian forces had not occupied Mokhnatyn. Tanya said by phone that a Russian convoy earlier that day had been attacked near Mokhnatyn, and vehicles had scattered to various villages, including Mokhnatyn., Tanya, who lived on the main road, said that her brothers and Yakimchuk had left for a friend’s house early that afternoon. She was at home when she heard the rumble of a convoy heading from the village center on the main road toward her house. After shots were fired, she immediately ran toward the village center and saw about 10 Russian military vehicles on the road, including armored personnel carriers, vehicles hauling rockets, and a gasoline supply truck., When she arrived at the site of the incident, neighbors told her to get her parents. When she returned with them, they saw the bodies of the three on the ground. Yevhen and Yakimchuk were dead. Witnesses said half of Yakimchuk’s head was gone and Yevhen had been shot in the chest. Bohdan was wounded in the abdomen and still alive. His mother and her partner drove him to the Chernihiv children’s hospital, but Bohdan died before they arrived., On March 4, in Nova Basan village, Russian soldiers shot dead Dmytro Solovei, 14, who was kicking around a football on a playground near his house. His brother, Serhii, 30, who saw Dmytro playing, went outside to bring him in, but also got shot at and wounded in the leg. Serhii managed to crawl to a neighbor’s house and get first aid. He could not seek professional medical assistance until Ukrainian forces regained control of the area on March 31. Their mother, Anzhela Solovei, said on May 10 that Serhii remained hospitalized, and his recovery was expected to take several months., On February 28, also in Nova Basan, Russian soldiers apparently shot Mykola Kucherina, about 40, in the head as he passed by their post. The village administration chief said that although the family knew about Kucherina’s death, his body remained there for a month, as the Russian forces did not allow his parents to collect it., On March 4, around 3 p.m., five Russian soldiers detained Mykyta Buzinov, a 24-year-old taxi driver in Chernihiv city, at his house in the town of Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske. His uncle, Borys Buzinov, who was at home at the time, said that the soldiers checked everyone’s phones and saw that Nykyta had provided information to the Ukrainian forces. The soldiers first took Buzinov and his girlfriend, Katya, and then his mother and uncle to a nearby veterinary clinic, where the Russian forces were encamped., Later that evening, the soldiers released everyone except Buzinov, saying they would talk to him and release him later. The encampment relocated the following day and Buzinov has not been seen since then. Borys Buzinov has been trying to locate Nykyta since his detention and spoke to members of various Russian units stationed throughout Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske in March, but he could not obtain any information about his nephew’s whereabouts., Three residents of Levkovychi village said that around 6 p.m. on February 28, Russian forces entered the village and shot dead four men – Oleksandr Oryshko, Oleksandr Derkach, Yaroslav Varava, and Serhii Nimchenko – in the village center. The residents said that the men were unarmed and that each suffered multiple bullet wounds., Enforced Disappearances, Human Rights Watch documented six cases in which Russian forces detained civilians, but their families could find no information about their circumstances or whereabouts. During an international armed conflict, failure to acknowledge a civilian’s detention or to disclose their whereabouts in custody can constitute an enforced disappearance, a crime under international law. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has since February 24 documented 204 cases of enforced disappearances involving 169 men, 34 women, and a boy, the overwhelming majority of them attributed to Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., Russian soldiers detained Anatolii Shevchenko, a Yahidne resident in his 40s, on March 4. His next-door neighbor saw him being apprehended and again later sitting handcuffed on the concrete near the schoolhouse where other residents were arriving to shelter in the school basement. For a month, Russian forces used the school as their base. Shevchenko’s family members told the neighbor, who sees them regularly, that they had received no news of Shevchenko’s whereabouts., Natalia Tarashenko, 48, and her husband, Mykola Sadovyi, 47, residents of Krasne, Chernihiv region, moved to her mother’s house on the other side of the town because their house was close to Ukrainian positions on the main road. Her husband stayed to take care of the household and domestic animals. On March 9, their neighbor’s child came to Natalia to say that her husband had not been seen for two days., Sadovyi had told the neighbor on March 7 that he had run out of his heart medication and was planning to bicycle to Chernihiv to buy it. He was with his friend, Kostya Sivko, who also disappeared the same day. They are concerned that Russian forces took them into custody. Although Krasne remained under Ukrainian control, to get to Chernihiv, the men would have had to ride on roads controlled by Russian forces, through Russian checkpoints, and also pass through Yahidne, which was under Russian control at the time., On March 10, Serhii Molosh, 39, and his friend, Vitalii Kulik, were missing from the village of Ryzhyky, about 22 kilometers north of Chernihiv, and there are concerns that they were taken into custody. Serhii’s mother, 69, said the men set off by foot during daylight hours to buy meat in the village of Riabtsi, 2.5 kilometers away. They never reached Riabtsi and were not heard from since. Villagers knew of no shelling in either village or on the road between them. Russian forces were in full control of the area where Ryzhyky and Riabtsi are located, and Russian armored vehicles were patrolling the road between both villages as well as other neighboring villages., Unlawful Confinement and Inhuman, Degrading Detention Conditions, Human Rights Watch documented numerous cases in which Russian forces rounded up and unlawfully detained civilians in dirty and suffocating conditions, restricting their access to food, water, and toilets. The Fourth Geneva Convention applies to all civilians, who are considered protected persons when under the control of belligerent or occupying forces. The Geneva Conventions permit the internment or assigned residence of protected persons only for “imperative reasons of security,” as a measure of last resort. In the cases investigated, Human Rights Watch found no basis for detaining civilians. The ban on torture and other ill-treatment is absolute under both the laws of war and international human rights law., Chernihiv Region, Yahidne, Russian forces entered Yahidne, a small village 15 kilometers south of Chernihiv city, early March, after days of shelling. For 28 days, they held over 350 civilians, almost the whole population, in the basement of the village schoolhouse without ventilation in extremely cramped and unsanitary conditions. They severely limited people’s ability to leave the basement, even for brief periods, arbitrarily depriving them of their liberty. Seventy were children, including five infants. During this time, 10 died, all older people., On March 3, Russian forces rounded up the villagers or otherwise ordered them to the school basement ostensibly for their own safety. Some refused and were allowed to remain in their homes because they were sick or were providing someone health care., Russian forces turned the school into a military base, thereby endangering the villagers detained there., Human Rights Watch interviewed 13 people detained in the basement, which consisted of two large rooms and a warren of six smaller rooms. They said that during the first few days Russian soldiers did not open the door at all, and subsequently opened it no more than once a day, allowing people to leave irregularly to use the outdoor toilet and to cook over outdoor fires, and at times allowing some detainees to go home to bring food back to the basement. They described the suffocating lack of air, the absence of space to move around or lie down, and having to use buckets for toilets. Many fell ill., Some villagers went voluntarily to the basement, fearing the continued shelling. Some were directly coerced. Olha Volodymyrivna said that on March 3, three Russian soldiers came to her house, beat and kicked her husband, Volodymyr, 63, in her presence, smashed his phone, and locked both in their stand-alone cellar for two days, while the soldiers lived in their house. On the third day, they ordered the couple to go to the school basement., On March 3, Volodymyr Ivashchenko was sheltering in the basement of his home with his wife, mother-in-law, daughter, and 3-year-old grandson, when five soldiers banged on the basement door and ordered everyone out. Ivashchenko’s 70-year-old mother-in-law, who walked with a cane, remained inside. Ivashchenko explained to the soldiers that she had difficulties walking. She left the basement only after one of the soldiers threatened to drop the grenade he was holding if she did not leave. The following day, Ivashchenko and his family walked to the school basement. He described the conditions there:, It was damp and everyone was coughing. There was not enough air…. There were hundreds of people [and] nowhere to sleep, we were locked there for days at a time, used buckets as toilets. Imagine sitting on a chair for weeks, no place to even lie down., A woman from Yahidne said:, The room had no light. We could only sit on small children’s chairs or narrow benches. Our baby was sitting and sleeping on laps. The air was filled with dust and the smell of lime from the walls. … After a week everyone was coughing violently. Almost all the children had high fevers, spasms from coughing, and would throw up. We tried not to walk unnecessarily, because people were sitting so densely that it was only possible to move sideways…, We tried not to drink much because there was not enough water, and we were anxious that the soldiers would not allow us to use the … small outdoor toilet. They … [soldiers] didn’t give us food during the first days. … After that, they allowed some of us to go home for food supplies. They allowed us to make a fire near the exit and cook for ourselves. We were able to provide a half liter of [cooked] food per two people., She also said the soldiers would not allow a 63-year-old man with cancer, for whom sitting was painful, to go home. They said he could “hang himself” to alleviate the pain. Some people developed bedsores from constant sitting. Around March 20, several children and adults came down with chickenpox and secondary infections from scratching the blisters., Halyna Tolochyna, who spent nearly a month in the Yahidne school basement, said that to keep track of days, together with another woman, she drew a calendar using chalk on one of the basement doors. On the right side of the door, she kept a list of people who died, 10 in all, including their date of death, and on the left, a list of people, totaling 7, who were shot or were forcibly disappeared., Tolochyna said 2 of the 10 people had died at home a few days after the soldiers let them leave because of their rapidly deteriorating health. Among the eight who died in the basement was Ivashchenko’s mother-in-law, Nadiia Buchenko. Ivashchenko said:, Imagine sitting on a chair for weeks. Nowhere to lie down, and not enough air. Her legs got swollen and her blood pressure would drop a lot. We had no medications and could not leave. She died on March 28. Her body was moved to the boiler-room and two days later, Russian soldiers allowed me to … bury her at the cemetery., Some former detainees were still hospitalized when Human Rights Watch visited on April 17 for various ailments they contracted during their confinement., Among them was Ivashchenko’s wife, Liubov, 50, who went to the hospital on March 31, the day they were released. Her legs had become swollen, and she was having difficulty walking., Nova Basan, Mykola Diachenko, 63, head of the village administration in Nova Basan, spent 26 days in Russian custody, in five locations, including a post office building, a warehouse, a summer kitchen, and a cellar., Russian soldiers detained Diachenko on March 5 at home, together with his deputy. Diachenko said that the Russian soldiers rounded up every man on his street as the soldiers were establishing control over the village. He said:, They demanded that we put on some clothes and follow them. I asked if I could take my eyedrops, [they said] I would not need them anymore. I thought they knew I was the head of the village administration, and they were going to shoot me., One of the detention places was in a stand-alone underground cellar, which was no more than nine square meters, with 20 detainees, all men from 22 to 65. They spent two days there, with the door sealed shut. People started to suffocate. Diachenko said, “We started banging on the door, pleading [for someone] to open it and let us breathe. Eventually, the soldiers left the door slightly open to let some air in.” The men inside were given no food, only two liters of water for the 20 to share., Novyi Bykiv, On March 24, seven or eight Russian soldiers came to the home of Volodymyr Zhadan in Novyi Bykiv, started shooting in the air, and demanded that he hand over his phone. Zhadan, 64, said:, I was in my underwear. … They started to beat me [with rifle butts], pushed me to the ground and started to kick me in the stomach, legs, back, demanding my phone. …Then they blindfolded and handcuffed me from behind and took me away. They only allowed me to put on my slippers and a jacket, no pants., Zhadan said he was taken, together with two neighbors, to the basement of the village preschool. “They took the blindfolds away, but it was completely dark,” he said. “We spent the night there, freezing in complete darkness.” In the morning, the Russian soldiers gave him pants, blindfolded him again, and took him for questioning next door at the village school. After Zhadan was released, later that evening, he found his house had been trashed and looted., On March 24, soldiers detained a 66-year-old Novyi Bykiv villager because they found he had a cell phone. They took him to a small boiler room in the village center, which was holding about 20 people. In the far-right corner was a pit several meters deep. Soldiers put him in the pit, where he spent five nights together with four other detainees. He said he was allowed to use the toilet only three times during the five days, that they were given no food and just one bottle of lemonade a day for all five men. “One of the detainees was in handcuffs all the time; his hands were swollen,” the villager said., Kyiv Region, Dymer, After the Russian offensive began on February 24, Ihor Zyrianov, a 58-year-old hair stylist from Kyiv, fled to his summer house in Bohdany, a village about 80 kilometers north, together with his wife and 12-year-old daughter. On the morning of March 21, Zyrianov and five friends, including two women, got together at the home of his neighbor, Pavlo Rudyk, 47, because he had internet reception. Soon six Russian soldiers, wearing masks, arrived in an armored vehicle. They ordered everyone out, checked their documents, and stole US$11,000 that Zyrianov said he had in his passport folder., The soldiers confiscated the two vehicles parked in the yard, took off the license plates and sprayed a “V,” one of the Russian symbols for the Ukraine conflict, on them. They blindfolded the four men, handcuffed them behind their backs with plastic zip-ties, and bundled them in the trunks of the two cars. They put the two women in the back seat of one of the cars and drove all six about 30 minutes to the window manufacturing plant complex in the town of Dymer., There, they were taken to a 40 square-meter room that Zyrianov described as a compressor station with a big industrial air pump in the middle of the room. The six friends spent three days in custody there. At least 30 others were already in the room when they arrived, and the number grew to 49 by the end of the day. Zyrianov said the detainees ranged in age from 17 to 73, and that at least eight were 17 and 18, and that one young man had been detained there for two weeks before they arrived., Zyrianov and Rudyk, interviewed separately, each said there was very little light in the room. There were two buckets instead of toilets, one 20-liter bottle of water and one hose for drinking and that everyone, except the women, was kept blindfolded and handcuffed with zip-ties., Zyrianov said:, The door had a small hole, which allowed enough light for us to know whether it was a day or night. People slept and sat on the ground, on plastic buckets, or on some cloths, no beds… There was not enough space for us to lie down, so we slept in shifts. Food was given once a day... Once there was barley, once pasta, and once some kind of boiled rice. We… learned how to loosen the zip-ties when the door was closed and would lift the blindfolds when Russian soldiers were not there., On March 23, a Russian officer told the detainees that they would be released in groups. Zyrianov, Rudyk, and their four other friends were in the second group, together with three others. They were taken, blindfolded and handcuffed, to the center of Dymer at around 4 p.m. Zyrianov said that the Russian soldiers told them that they would be killed on the spot if they were detained again., When they returned home, both men discovered that their houses had been looted. Rudyk said that among the items stolen were a car, his wife’s wedding ring, a generator, tools, Bluetooth speakers, about $30,000 in cash, and a watch worth US$22,000., Torture and Other Ill-treatment, Dymer, Zyrianov and Rudyk described the abuses they endured during their three days of detention at the window manufacturing plant. Zyrianov said that on the first day, March 21, Russian soldiers confiscated their phones and demanded access codes. Each day, soldiers interrogated them, one by one, for 10 to 15 minutes each, in a nearby room. He said that the soldiers had nicknames for all detainees, and they called him “American” because of the US visas in his passport., He was interrogated, while blindfolded, three times about where he served in the military and why he had traveled to the United States. Soldiers hit him twice with a rifle butt when they did not like his responses. Zyrianov said that he was spared compared to others: “They used ‘electric shockers’ and beat some detainees. We could hear the screams.”, Rudyk said soldiers interrogated him twice and subjected him to a mock execution:, I sat blindfolded and handcuffed. They told me that it was over for me. They put a rifle to my head, loaded it and I heard three shots. I could hear the bullet casings falling on the ground too. …They told me that they would not miss next time if I don’t tell them everything… whether I participated in the Maidan events [2013 protests in Kyiv] or whether I fought in the 2014 war. Second time they interrogated me, they used an electric shocker on me. They shocked me on the back of my head. It was very painful., Rudyk said that as of mid-April, more than 40 people detained at the window manufacturing plant were still missing. Rudyk and Zyrianov said that on April 14, two other detainees – a Red Cross volunteer driver and a nurse – were missing after the ordeal. In an April 27 CNN report about the window manufacturing plant industrial site, reporters interviewed Volodymyr Khrapun, a former detainee whom Russian forces forcibly transferred to Russia, together with dozens of other window manufacturing plant detainees. Khrapun appears to be the Red Cross driver whom other detainees had described, and who told CNN he was released as part of a prisoner exchange., Nova Basan, Mykola Diachenko, the Nova Basan village administration head, said that at one of the five sites where he was held, Russian soldiers took him outside with other detainees. They blindfolded them and demanded that they cooperate if they wanted to survive. Diachenko then heard rifle shots, thinking that someone had been executed. They also threatened to hang him by his feet, stab his fingers, and impale him on a wooden pole so he “would die in a lot of pain.” At the fifth detention site, a small summer kitchen packed with detainees, the soldiers threatened to throw in a grenade. “I was sure that I would not survive the detention,” Diachenko said. He and others detained with him were freed after Russian forces withdrew from the area., In Nova Basan, Human Rights Watch spoke with a villager who participated in the local territorial defense unit, the quasi-military resistance groups in Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. On March 9, about 15 Russian soldiers arrived on an armored vehicle and took the villager and his 25-year-old son, also an active resistance member, at gunpoint. They pushed them to their knees, while firing their rifles in the air, tied their hands behind their back and ordered them to show where they had hidden their guns., The soldiers took the son to their basement and made him dig out buried guns. The soldiers blindfolded the villager, put him in an armored vehicle and took him to a farmhouse. “They put me on a chair,” he said. “I told them that I had given them all the weapons I had, but someone then kicked me in the back of the head, and I fell off.”, The soldiers released him the next day, detained him again on March 12 and held him until March 31. They took him back to the farmhouse and threatened to cut his hands off or run over him with a tank if he did not tell them more about the resistance., The villager said that one soldier tied his hands together in front with a zip-tie and hung a cable from the ceiling roof, pulling his hands upward, the tips of his toes touching the floor. He said the only way to avoid pain was to stand on tiptoes. He was kept in this position for two or three hours. He was set free after Russian forces withdrew from Nova Basan., Hostomel, Kyiv region, Oleksandr Novichenko, 35, evacuated his mother from Hostomel, but stayed behind to feed his and his neighbors’ domestic animals. On the afternoon of March 27, as he was closing the neighbors’ gates, a Russian soldier took him into custody, tied his hands behind his back with a zip-tie, blindfolded him, and pushed him down into a basement, where for two days soldiers repeatedly questioned and electroshocked him., “The zip-tie was so tight that my wrists were swollen,” he said. “I had an open wound on my knee, and they would shock me right there … I was screaming from pain, telling them that I knew nothing, but they would go on shocking me.” After two days, the soldiers put a black bag over his head and released him in the village.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-executions-torture-during-russian-occupation-enruuk
Update 76 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (17 May 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,17 May 2022,"The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plans to send its next nuclear safety, security and safeguards mission to Ukraine’s Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in the coming weeks, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., “Our on-the-ground assistance will concentrate on radiation protection, safety of waste management, and nuclear security,” the Director General said in a video statement about the IAEA’s efforts to help ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and maintain its safeguards activities in the country during the current military conflict., “The safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities remains my top priority,” he said., Director General Grossi personally led the IAEA’s previous two assistance missions to Ukraine, travelling to the South Ukraine NPP in late March and to Chornobyl about a month later. The next mission to Chornobyl will consist of IAEA safety and security experts as well as safeguards inspectors. They will continue their work from the previous visit to the site of the 1986 accident, which was occupied by Russian forces for five weeks before they withdraw on 31 March., Director General Grossi is now also focused on agreeing, organizing and leading an IAEA mission to Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhya NPP, to carry out important nuclear safety, security and safeguards work at this site in the country’s south., “The IAEA is perfectly positioned to ensure Ukraine gets what it needs efficiently and quickly,” he said in today’s statement. “At the IAEA we never stop, not even for a single minute. That’s true today and will be as long as Ukraine needs our assistance.”, Ukraine separately informed the IAEA today that there had been no significant developments related to nuclear safety and security in the country over the past 24 hours., Regarding the country’s 15 operational reactors at four NPPs, Ukraine said eight are currently connected to the grid, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at the Rivne NPP, two at the South Ukraine NPP, and one at the Khmelnytskyy NPP. The seven other reactors are shut down for regular maintenance or held in reserve. Safety systems remain operational at the four NPPs, and they also continue to have off-site power available, Ukraine said., In relation to safeguards, IAEA headquarters is receiving remote safeguards data from the Chornobyl NPP as well as from the four operational plants in Ukraine. This follows last week’s full re-establishment of such transmission from Chornobyl.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-76-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-17-may-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",4 Apr 2022,"2. Rationale, 2.1 Background, On 24 February, after weeks and months of military build-up at the border and heightened tensions, Russia has started a full-scale invasion in Ukraine, with rocket strikes hitting targets throughout the country and its ground forces advancing from the north, east, and south. Major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv, causing civilians to flee into shelters and subways as air raid sirens rang out in the streets of the capital. Russian troops have quickly reached several main cities that are close to the border, bringing military clashes to these cities. Chernihiv (north), Sumy (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east), Mykolaiv (south), Odesa (south-west), among other cities in northern, eastern and southern parts of the country, including Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, suffered from ongoing military fights with reported civilian casualties from the very first days., Ground military clashes, rocket strikes, shelling and bombings in these densely populated urban settlements have caused major displacement flows with more than 1 million people moving towards safer areas in the center and west of the country and more than 2 million people fleeing the country., Reported critical infrastructure destructions, active military clashes in settlements, large scale displacement contribute to the worsening of the humanitarian situation in the country. People that remain blocked in cities encircled by the militaries, and internally displaced people who have reached safe havens are in humanitarian need. Different challenges related to each of the groups are complicating organisation of the response. Access to affected communities remains severely restricted, while the constantly deteriorating security situation prevents the possibility of evacuation in many locations, leading to the accumulation and exacerbation of unmet needs. Many settlements that host displaced people are reportedly facing problems with their capacity to absorb incoming flows of internally displaced people at such scales., 2.1 Intended impact, Humanitarian agencies have urgently intensified their work in the country in order to organise and provide necessary response of the relevant scale. It was agreed by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) that multi-purpose cash (MPC) is going to be the main modality of the response. The Cash Working Group (CWG), co-led by OCHA and ACTED, has established four task teams to assess and plan the cash-based response. These teams are focusing on targeting (led by WFP), transfer mechanisms (led by Norwegian Refugee Council, NRC), deduplication and registration (led by UNHCR) and monitoring (led by ACTED). REACH is engaged as a technical partner in all four task teams of the CWG and is fully involved in the development and implementation of the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) tools in Ukraine., Given the current conditions of mass displacement and active military clashes in urban centers, as well as the importance of MPC in the response in Ukraine, market monitoring is key for the humanitarian intervention. Due to the conflict's sudden expansion to areas of Ukraine that were previously untouched, usable humanitarian market data in areas of partner intervention is highly limited and incomplete. The JMMI seeks to fill this information gap by providing useful and timely data on trends in Ukrainian market prices which will enable the Cash Working Group to continually revise its standard MPC transfer values to reflect developments in the humanitarian situation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-research-terms-reference-joint-market-monitoring-initiative-ukr2203-march-2022-v1
Navigating humanitarian dilemmas in the Ukraine crisis,Analysis,ODI - HPG,Protection and Human Rights,3 May 2022,"Introduction, The Ukraine crisis presents heightened tensions and dilemmas for humanitarian actors – some familiar, others new. These are informed by a fraught geopolitical context and a rapid series of developments., This could be a very long war, with no end to the violence in sight. A second phase has already begun: Russia has intensified hostilities in Eastern and Southern Ukraine – which have been the most severely impacted – while rebuilding its capacity to carry out attacks elsewhere. The conflict is reverberating globally through rising commodity prices, food insecurity and energy shocks (Pantuliano, 2022). It is also seen as a pivotal moment in geopolitics: a nuclear power, and a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council (or P5), triggering a conflict in Europe paves the way for turmoil and challenge to other multilateral institutions, such as the European Union and NATO, and the current rules-based international order., The humanitarian impact is severe: the civilian death toll stands at over 5,000 (OHCHR, 2022). Almost one-third of the country’s population has been forcibly displaced, including 7.7 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and over 5 million refugees, the fastest-growing refugee flow since the Second World War (DTM, 2022; UNHCR, 2022). There has been heavy shelling of populated urban centres. Russia is increasingly targeting strategic fuel stocks and industrial facilities. Hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine are without electricity. There have been numerous attacks on healthcare facilities and schools., Humanitarian needs and the ability to respond to them will vary according to context. These include:, • Contested areas where fighting is the most intense or are under siege. This is where needs will continue to be most acute and most difficult to respond to., • Areas occupied by Russian forces, or are under Russian influence but where authority is unclear. This is where Ukrainian resistance will continue to be active. Needs here are also likely to be acute and difficult to respond to. While in some contexts Russia might want to be seen to be minimising suffering, in others it could also collectively punish populations for resisting, or continue to deport civilians to Russia., • Areas of relative peace under Ukrainian government control.
These areas will continue to struggle with the influx of IDPs and the impact of the war on the economy, infrastructure and services., • Neighbouring and other countries with refugees. People in this situation will continue to need short-term relief while on the move, but above all access to jobs and services to become self-reliant., • Russia itself, which might see a rise in the number of people facing extreme poverty and vulnerability as a result of the economic impact of the conflict, including international sanctions., The crisis has triggered extraordinary levels of solidarity. National and local governments in neighbouring countries have mobilised quickly. In contrast with their response to refugees from other conflicts, EU countries are providing temporary protection and access to jobs and services to Ukrainians seeking refuge. The UN humanitarian flash appeal for Ukraine is one of the largest, fastest and most generously funded ever, and the United Kingdom’s public emergency appeal from the Disasters Emergency Committee (only one example of public donation instruments) has attracted more funding for Ukraine than all previous nine appeals combined (FTS, 2022; DEC, 2022). With these resources, international organisations have been mounting large operations inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, with varying levels of coordination with and support to national authorities., What are the options for humanitarian actors in this crisis? The following are extreme positions towards which these actors might be pulled, rather than exclusive binary choices, Read the full report",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/navigating-humanitarian-dilemmas-ukraine-crisis

This characterization raises serious concerns over their fate as prisoners of war., “Amnesty International has documented summary killings of captives by Russia-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, as well as the extrajudicial executions of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces in recent weeks. The soldiers who surrendered today must not meet the same fate., “Prisoners of war must not be subjected to any form of torture or ill-treatment, and should be given immediate access to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The relevant authorities must fully respect the rights of prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva conventions.”, Background, On 17 May, Ukraine‘s armed forces confirmed that the soldiers who were holed up in Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel works had been ordered to surrender to Russia-led forces., According to Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, 264 soldiers, including 53 wounded servicemen, have already left Azovstal and now are being held in Novoazovsk and Olenivka, two villages under the control of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainerussia-rights-ukrainian-prisoners-war-azovstal-must-be-respected

Shelter and Non-Food Items",17 May 2022,"Background, Since 24 February 20221, over 14 million people have been forcibly displaced internally and across international borders as a result of the armed conflict in Ukraine, while thousands of civilians still remain in areas directly exposed to the armed hostilities. Despite the fact that sexual diversity is not outlawed in Ukraine, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and other diverse identities (LGBTQI+) have long remained under stigma and subject to a widely spread negative perception by the vast part of the Ukrainian society. Even before the war, there had been instances of hate speech, discrimination, harassment and abuse of LGBTIQ+ people in Ukraine, on the basis of their real or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and/or sex characteristics (SOGIESC). For this reason, the LGBTQ community refrained from public appearances and related advocacy campaigns – resulting in the community being prone to isolation and marginalization. 1 In situations of forced displacement and armed conflict, individuals who are LGBTIQ+ have the same rights and basic needs as other displaced and affected persons. Nonetheless, they are often at heightened risk of exclusion, exploitation, violence and abuse, and encounter distinct protection risks because of their real or perceived SOGIESC. These challenges often add numerous barriers to accessing humanitarian assistance and services such as safe accommodation, appropriate health care, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response services, education and livelihoods opportunities. Due to the perception that LGBTIQ+ do not conform to prevailing sociocultural norms, they may be excluded from traditional support networks among displaced and host communities. Barriers are especially acute for transgender persons whose gender identity does not match their official identity documents.2 It is therefore important that humanitarian actors and service providers understand and address such risks through tailored programmes to ensure LGBTIQ+ persons in displacement and/or affected by the war in Ukraine enjoy equal rights.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/protection-lgbtiq-people-context-response-ukraine

These challenges often add numerous barriers to accessing humanitarian assistance and services such as safe accommodation, appropriate health care, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response services, education and livelihoods opportunities. Due to the perception that LGBTIQ+ do not conform to prevailing sociocultural norms, they may be excluded from traditional support networks among displaced and host communities. Barriers are especially acute for transgender persons whose gender identity does not match their official identity documents.2 It is therefore important that humanitarian actors and service providers understand and address such risks through tailored programmes to ensure LGBTIQ+ persons in displacement and/or affected by the war in Ukraine enjoy equal rights.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/protection-lgbtiq-people-context-response-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",17 May 2022,"Statement by Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, Kyiv, 17 May 2022, Good evening, Ukraine., I’d like to begin by expressing my immense appreciation and admiration for the health workers of this country, who have shown tremendous bravery and dedication since the war began. You have done the impossible: you stand firm and save lives., As of today, WHO has verified 226 attacks on health care in Ukraine. That is almost 3 attacks per day since 24 February. They have left at least 75 people dead and 59 injured. Two thirds of all attacks on health care this year verified by WHO globally have been in Ukraine., These attacks are not justifiable, they are never OK, and they must be investigated. It is an insult to the dedication and integrity of health workers everywhere that they continue with impunity. No health professional should have to deliver health care on a knife edge., But this is just what nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers – the medical teams of Ukraine – are doing. You keep health services and hope alive in the face of unbelievable sorrow and suffering. I salute your courage and want you to know that WHO stands with you., This is my third visit to Ukraine this year, and the second since late February. I am here for 3 main reasons., Firstly, I have been fortunate enough to meet some of the country’s health heroes, to hear their stories and the challenges they face in delivering health care, and to understand how WHO can continue to support them., Yesterday I spent the day in Chernihiv oblast with Minister of Health Viktor Liashko, where I visited several hospitals and health facilities and spoke to professionals and patients. It was both heartbreaking and inspiring. Heartbreaking because of the immense destruction to the health system and the devastating impact on people’s lives. Inspiring because of the stories of resilience and perseverance., I heard of ordinary citizens coming to the rescue of patients in hospitals under fire; of doctors and nurses coming out of retirement to volunteer their services for free; of boats being used to get medicines to people when roads were inaccessible; and many individual stories of bravery and sacrifice., Secondly, I am here this week to meet national authorities and partners to get first-hand insights on what further action is needed now., Many health challenges lie before us:, With our dedicated teams, WHO is working with national authorities and partners, responding to the immediate and long-term health needs of the Ukrainian people – those who have returned after being forced to flee, those who stayed and those who are displaced within the country’s borders., From what I saw yesterday while visiting Chernihiv, mental health services need to be further scaled up to reach communities. According to WHO, 1 in 5 people in conflict areas are likely to develop serious mental health problems. Over 16 000 people in Ukraine with moderate to severe mental health conditions face shortages of essential medicines. I am happy to see that the Government of Ukraine, with the strong support of the First Lady, are putting mental health on the agenda., According to the United Nations, sexual violence is a serious threat to mostly women and girls in conflict areas. I am deeply troubled by reports of an increase in sexual violence and exploitation in Ukraine, which ruins lives and is inadmissible. WHO is committed to meeting the health needs of survivors while doing everything we can to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse in the first place, together with the Government and nongovernmental organizations, with which I just met., We are also concerned about the potential of a cholera outbreak in occupied areas, where water and sanitation infrastructure is damaged or destroyed. That’s why we are already pre-positioning cholera vaccines in our hub in Dnipro., Today, on day 83 of this war, we are starting to understand more about how the health system in Ukraine has been affected, and perhaps more importantly, what the long-term needs will be, as we begin the long and challenging road to recovery., My third reason for being here is to put health at the heart of Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction efforts. Prime Minister Shmyhal and I agree – health is not everything, but without health there is nothing., Even as we try to meet Ukraine’s urgent health needs today, we are also looking ahead to the future, and how we can help Ukraine’s health system build back smarter, stronger and greener., For example, power supply has been a consistent problem for many hospitals and health facilities that find themselves in active conflict areas. WHO has been working very hard to deliver generators to fill this gap. But looking more long-term, we are working with the Ministry of Health to move towards renewable energies to power Ukraine’s health system, ensuring reliability and sustainability for the future., And as your health workers represent hope in their local neighbourhoods today, so the future health system must deliver people-centred services closer to the communities it serves – responsive and agile services, such as mobile mental health, primary care and digital services., Peace is a precondition for health. All our efforts to rebuild and reform could fail without peace. I would like to reiterate the call by the United Nations Secretary-General “for an immediate ceasefire and for an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine”., These days, I have borne witness to the incredible positivity, ingenuity and resilience of you, the Ukrainian people. WHO is with you today, tomorrow, and for a brighter, healthier future., Thank you., ENDS, This statement was delivered to the press in Kyiv, Ukraine, on 17 May 2022., Multimedia content:, Video: https://who.canto.global/b/SRQ8C, Photo: https://who.canto.global/b/LNH0T, Press contacts:, Bhanu Bhatnagar: bbhatnagar@who.int, WHO/Europe Press Office: eupress@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/hope-heart-ukraines-health-response-recovery-and-reconstruction

Protection and Human Rights",13 May 2022,"The U.S. Agency for International Development has selected Pact to lead the Ukraine Public Health Systems Recovery & Resilience (PHS R&R) project, a five-year, $45 million effort to protect the health of all Ukrainians, including vulnerable and marginalized populations. The project represents USAID’s largest investment to date in a single initiative to strengthen the Government of Ukraine’s capacity to respond to public health shocks, sustain critical public health services during a crisis, and expand mental health support to veterans and conflict-affected populations. , Ukraine is under siege in a protracted, yet unpredictable war. Massive destruction of health care infrastructure, including at least 162 health facilities, has severely disrupted health and other critical services. Covid-19 and other infectious diseases remain a substantial threat, given low vaccination coverage in the country. War-related psychological trauma has affected the entire country, especially children who in many cases are separated from the people they traditionally rely on for support such as parents, teachers and other family members. Large-scale sexual violence has been inflicted on innocent civilians, particularly women and girls. In addition to violence, women’s health and safety have also been disproportionately impacted by the war, according to a recent UN Women and CARE report., “We expect PHS R&R will play a significant role in rebuilding Ukraine’s health system following the devastating impacts of the war,” said Michèle Laird, Pact’s Vice President of Programs. “Pact is deeply committed to supporting the well-being of the people of Ukraine. Together with our partners, we will address the new and urgent health challenges facing all Ukrainians that have resulted from and continue to develop as a result of the ongoing war.”, PHS R&R was originally designed to strengthen Ukraine’s national health security, building on the momentum of recent public health reforms and the imperative to build a more resilient public health system and stronger partnerships with civil society and communities in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. The project will now focus on public health challenges resulting from the war, including humanitarian health needs; increased demand for community-based mental health services, including support for survivors of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence; and continuity of care for displaced and mobile populations., Together with project partners – Swiss Tropical Institute of Public Health, Overseas Strategic Consulting, Ltd., the European Institute on Public Health Policy, the Ukrainian Coalition for Vaccination, and Temple University School of Public Health with Drexel University School of Public Health and Health Federation of Philadelphia – we will support a strengthened, resilient and durable public health system that will benefit all Ukrainians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/pact-lead-effort-strengthen-ukraines-health-resilience-and-protect-citizen-health-wake-war

Protection and Human Rights",17 May 2022,"Schools have suffered enormous damage in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Finn Church Aid wants to be among the first organisations to support the return of children to school., FINN CHURCH AID is entering the next phase of its emergency assistance programme in Ukraine; this includes support for the education sector that has suffered from the war. Work will begin in the city of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, approximately 150 kilometres northeast of Kyiv. To make this possible, Finn Church Aid is opening an office in the Ukrainian capital., Jouni Hemberg, Executive Director of Finn Church Aid, was recently on a field visit to Ukraine. He emphasises that Finn Church Aid wants to support the return of Ukrainian children to school., ""The summer holidays are coming soon; the schools have to be repaired now so that children returning to their home districts can get back to their lessons in the autumn,"" he explains. ""There are currently few education sector players north of Kyiv, so that's why we're heading there with our work."", Russian troops withdrew from the Kyiv area in March/April. After battles, bombings and occupation, the schools in this area are in poor condition. There are unexploded munitions and mines in the area., ""Finn Church Aid's team visited the area and assessed the condition of the schools there after the occupation and how they are damaged,"" Hemberg continues. ""Most of the schools have suffered somehow, and most of the ones that are still standing have been vandalised in many ways; even doors and windows have been stolen."", Schools are important to children living amid war, The bombings have destroyed and damaged schools all over Ukraine. The Chernihiv area has seen missile strikes as recently as May., ""We believe that targeting schools with hostilities is inhumane and prohibited outright by humanitarian law,"" says Hemberg emphatically. ""Attacking schools means that the rules of war have not been followed, and it is also clear that such acts have a negative impact on the civilian population and the prospects of children and youth."", Education in humanitarian crises is a central expertise of Finn Church Aid. The organisation leads education work in eleven countries on three continents., Education in emergencies can be viewed as a life-saving activity. Schools bring routines and a sense of normality to the daily lives of children living amid war or as refugees. Schools can also disseminate vital information, for example, about unexploded mines and munitions; in Ukraine there are large numbers of these, due to the current and past conflicts., Psychosocial support is also an important part of educational work in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. Finn Church Aid has long experience in this area in all of its programme countries, such as providing essential training to teachers on psychosocial support. Ukraine has many children who will need multi-layered support due to the long-term psychological effects of war, and this will form a key part of Finn Church Aid's work in the region., Finn Church Aid continues relief distributions in Ukraine, In addition to working in support of the education sector, Finn Church Aid will continue to provide internally displaced people with emergency aid, together with Hungarian Interchurch Aid, its local partner organisation., Part of this work has involved the delivery of 662,000 kilograms of aid including food and drink, nappies and other hygiene products. Furthermore, refugee shelters opened in places like schools, nurseries and church premises have been supported with washing machines and kitchen refrigeration appliances., The relief work began in March on the Hungarian-Ukrainian border and in Lviv. Just recently, aid lorries belonging to Finn Church Aid and Hungarian Interchurch Aid have reached areas in eastern Ukraine as well., For more information:, Executive Director, Mr. Jouni Hemberg, jouni.hemberg[a]kirkonulkomaanapu.fi, +358 50 325 9579

"Anti-Trafficking Task Force (ATTF) Ukraine, Terms of Reference - May 2022",Manual and Guideline,Protection Cluster,Protection and Human Rights,16 May 2022,"Background, Human trafficking is a crime and a human rights violation, with serious human rights and protection implications - and which is known to significantly amplify in times of wars, crisis and conflict. This is reflected in several reports published by UN agencies, international organizations and the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons. It is also a concern of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, who signed a framework for cooperation with the Ukrainian government in May 2022. These reports and actions establish a clear link between human trafficking and emergency contexts, and identify a critical gap in the humanitarian response system., In Ukraine, human trafficking has been known as a widespread phenomenon event before the war.
Human trafficking is known to proliferate through highly adaptable strategies, including fraudulent employment offers inside the country and abroad, offers of support for accommodation and residence for those considering leaving their place of usual residence or the country, as well as through online recruitment and disinformation. Both the internally displaced and refugees are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, but also generally the millions of war-affected populations. For example, it is known that children and adults in care institutions are at risk of abandonment, and constraints to mobility severely limits their ability to seek cover from the bombardment or to evacuate through humanitarian corridors which are already heavily obstructed. These people are extremely vulnerable and with few options, are likely to accept any offer of support which could have questionable motives., In 2021, IOM through its Direct assistance Programme identified and assisted nearly 1100 survivors of trafficking, with additional 132 VoT identified in first the three months of 2022 (but whose exploitation happened before the war)., There are indications of increased risk of trafficking due to loss of income and resources, loss of homes and inadequate/non-family style accommodation, family separation, psychological distress, disruption to education, breakdown of law and order, conflict related sexual violence, amongst others. Such situations increase both supply of potential victims and the number of potential traffickers, as potential victims’ resort to negative coping strategies, individuals not previously involved in trafficking or exploitation use the opportunity to turn take advantage of desperate people, and as organized trafficking networks arise in or extend into the affected areas and populations., According to the rapid assessment conducted by La Strada International and Freedom Fund during March – April 2022, the risks are clear – and it is likely that these risks will increase in the coming period, as the war continues, more people are internally displaced, access to services and livelihoods becomes more precarious, and millions of refugees face the need to settle for longer periods in other European countries and begin to access the labour market. The vulnerability is also increased with the experience of secondary displacement resulted in the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the City of Sevastopol and the on-going armed conflict in Donetsk and Luhans’k regions as indicated in the GRETA report on the result of secondary evaluation round., While the activation of article 5 of Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001, introducing temporary protection for Ukrainians arriving in EU countries, significantly reduces the exposure for those fleeing the war to human traffickers, economic need is one of the most often identified vulnerability factors for trafficking in persons (UNODC (2020).

"After Russia’s invasion, Pact and partners provide humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians affected by war",News and Press Release,Pact,"Food and Nutrition

Shelter and Non-Food Items",16 May 2022,"When Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, Iryna Trokhym and her colleagues were holding a three-day training in Lviv for women’s rights organizations from across the country’s western regions. Sixteen participants had just arrived in Lviv when the shelling began., Trokhym is a project manager with the women’s rights organization Centre Women’s Perspectives. Founded in 1998, the organization works to build equal rights for women in all areas of life. The organization is a key partner in the Women of Ukraine: Heard, Capable, Resilient project. Led by Pact and funded by Global Affairs Canada, Women of Ukraine has been working since 2019 to increase women’s rights and gender equality in Ukraine by strengthening the capacity of local women's organizations. Through Women of Ukraine, Pact has provided funding and capacity development support to Centre Women’s Perspectives, a “hub” partner that then passes that support down to less established women’s right organizations across the west. The goal is to effectively build women’s rights from the community level up. Pact also leads the Global Affairs Canada-funded WINGS project in Ukraine, which works to build women’s economic security by enabling their success as employees and entrepreneurs., When Russia’s full-scale invasion began, though, everything changed., “Serving IDPs (internally displaced people) became an immediate need,” Trokhym says. “So we responded.”, Of the 16 organizational leaders who’d traveled to Lviv for the training, most decided to stay put. With support from Centre Women’s Perspectives, they began working together to figure out how to respond to the needs of their communities and IDPs amid war., Across the country, with Pact’s support, other Women of Ukraine and WINGS partners are doing the same. Two days after the invasion began, Pact’s team in Ukraine gathered local partners for a call, urging them to replan their work to provide humanitarian assistance if they felt they could. Pact coordinated with Global Affairs Canada to quickly reallocate funding for humanitarian needs, and Pact is continuing to adapt to serve internally displaced women and children and women serving in the army. Pact’s partners are helping to provide shelter, food, medical services, psychosocial support and more. So far, Pact and our partners have assisted more than 17,000 women and their family members., More than 7 million Ukrainians are estimated to have been internally displaced since late February, with another 6 million fleeing the country as refugees., “Since Russia started its unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Pact’s team hasn’t stopped working for a day,” says Pact’s Ukraine country director, Alyona Gerasimova. “We’re more dedicated than ever to the women, families and local organizations we serve – we’ve just changed how we are supporting them because needs have changed so drastically. Our donor, Global Affairs Canada, responded very quickly to the humanitarian crisis and supported us as we pivoted from development work to a much-needed humanitarian response.”, For its part, Centre Women’s Perspectives has provided assistance for hundreds of IDPs. They created a shelter for women and children in Lviv, working with local business owners to repurpose office space as temporary housing. The shelter is located near Lviv’s rail station, offering women and children a convenient place to stay during stopovers before continuing on abroad. The organization’s staff and volunteers meet IDPs at the station and help them to the shelter, where they can eat, bathe and recover. In addition to medical services, the shelter offers psychological support and art therapy for children. Those who want to stay in Ukraine are offered longer-term housing. Those wishing to leave the country are supported with transfers to do so and, when possible, accommodations abroad., With support from Pact, Centre Women’s Perspectives has also been able to provide hygiene items, bedclothes, dishes and medicine. The organization’s lawyer is gathering documentation for an international tribunal on Russian war crimes, and the centre has worked with international journalists covering the war. The centre has just started working on programming to help displaced women gain economic opportunities., Critically, the organization also continues to support its partner women’s rights organizations. They have resumed regular meetings, with the centre providing advice, mentorship and funding as the partners have established shelters and aid centers of their own across the west., “Some of the organizations struggled at first,” Trokhym says. “But all together we figured out how to efficiently help communities. During our weekly meetings we continue to consult with the organizations, because not all of them have experience responding to such challenges. They also help each other and share best practice. We also try to take care of the organizations themselves, offering advice to prevent burnout.”, Trokhym acknowledges how difficult the past few months have been, but seeing communities come together to help each other in every way needed has kept her going., “From the first days of the full-scale war, everyone has been involved.”, Gerasimova agrees: “The networks that we built before the war have allowed us to work together to effectively help our fellow Ukrainians when they needed it most.”, As United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organizations step in to respond to the crisis, Pact’s programs will shift back toward development with a focus on recovery and peacebuilding., “We will continue to adapt to meet the needs of Ukrainian women and families to the very best of our ability,” Gerasimova says.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/after-russias-invasion-pact-and-partners-provide-humanitarian-assistance-ukrainians-affected-war

Ukraine: UN expert urges all war crimes investigators work closely with national authorities,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,16 May 2022,"GENEVA (16 May 2022) – A UN human rights expert today called on the international community to step up its support for Ukraine’s own investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the context of the armed attack by the Russian Federation, saying it is crucial that all investigators work closely together and in compliance with international standards of forensic best practice., The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Morris Tidball-Binz, welcomed the progress made so far by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine in its work to ensure that perpetrators of violations of human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law are brought to justice., “I also welcome the swift mobilisation of the international community in setting up different mechanisms and launching initiatives to investigate, collect, document and preserve evidence of gross violations of international human rights and serious violations of humanitarian law in Ukraine, including unlawful killings, since Russia’s armed attack more than two months ago,” he said., “These mechanisms can play a key role in supporting the work of the Office of the General Prosecutor, as well as other accountability frameworks, ranging from the International Criminal Court to national prosecutions by the parties to the conflict and in States with universal jurisdiction., “It is therefore of paramount importance that the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, which is leading the investigations in the country, receives all the support and resources necessary to ensure the adequate coordination of investigative efforts under its responsibility in Ukraine.”, To achieve progress and deliver tangible results, however, all contributing international mechanisms and initiatives must take into account ongoing national evidence-gathering processes and make sure that national ownership of investigative efforts are duly respected where these efforts are in line with relevant international norms and standards, the UN expert said., “Without coordination of responsibilities and of efforts between various bodies, there is a considerable risk of overlap and duplication to the detriment of the effectiveness and efficiency of investigations,” Tidball-Binz said. “For example, the identification of deceased persons requires the proper collection, analysis and matching of information, for which centralisation, adequate management and protection are paramount., “Proper coordination can also prevent the re-traumatisation of victims and witnesses arising from being interviewed multiple times by different investigators, and ensure that interviews fit into the overall investigative strategy.”, Tidball-Binz said all investigations into violations of human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law must conform to international standards, including the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions and the Revised UN Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (the Minnesota Protocol for the Investigation of Potentially Unlawful Death (2016)., “International law requires that investigations be prompt, effective, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent,” he added. “To this end, proper coordination and adequate data management are fundamental requisites, particularly in complex cases, such as those under investigation in Ukraine.”, He said investigations of war crimes and crimes against humanity required multiple areas of expertise and specialised knowledge so that the high volume of sensitive and complex evidence can be adequately collected, documented and securely preserved., “Within this context, for instance, the identification of human remains and their dignified treatment, including respect for the families of those deceased, is paramount and coordination of efforts to this effect is absolutely essential for adequately resolving cases of enforced disappearances and preventing the dead from becoming missing persons,” he said., “All stakeholders should therefore comply with applicable international norms and standards. They should communicate and actively coordinate among themselves, to prevent any duplication of efforts but also in the best interest of victims.”, The Special Rapporteur, who is a medico-legal expert, said he stood ready to assist and offer technical advice on these matters.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-un-expert-urges-all-war-crimes-investigators-work-closely-national-authorities

This included:, a total of 3,668 killed (1,353 men, 897 women, 82 girls, and 94 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,173 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,896 injured (602 men, 441 women, 91 girls, and 100 boys, as well as 167 children and 2,495 adults whose sex is yet unknown)

This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 12 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred from 13 to 15 May only, as during these days OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported from 13 to 15 May have been included into the above figures.

Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",16 May 2022,"Highlights, WFP assisted over 3.8 million displaced and conflict-affected people with food and cash throughout Ukraine., WFP is working closely with the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine to scale up cash transfers. Around USD 15.9 million cash assistance have been transferred to more than 237,000 IDPs across Ukraine., WFP’s Ukraine emergency response faces a net funding shortfall of USD 259 million to sustain its operations through the month of August 2022., Situation Update, Active fighting in Ukraine and the destruction of civilian infrastructure have triggered critical humanitarian needs and disrupted access to food and basic services, as well as the livelihoods of a growing proportion of the population.
WFP has established a remote food security monitoring system in Ukraine to inform its response., Parts of eastern and southern Ukraine reported the highest levels of food insecurity in the latest WFP Food Security Report and the same areas remain hard to reach by the humanitarian community due to conflict. Larger households that are displaced and separated in these areas showed the highest level of food insecurity and inadequate food consumption., The survey found that close to two thirds of the households interviewed use cash to buy food. Around 34 percent of the respondents, however, reported that they no longer have a regular income source or rely on assistance. One quarter of respondents reported that they already borrowed money to meet their needs. These findings demonstrate that households are in urgent need of a sustained source of income to cope, maintain an acceptable level of food consumption and improve their food security., Moreover, disrupted markets and lack of commodities impede further people’s access to food. Grains, bread, dairy and milk products, sugar, vegetables, and meats were amongst the foods most often mentioned as being scarce.
Fuel and medicine were also among the reported scarce products in the WFP survey., Food prices have been also increasing, pushing more people to feel worried about not having sufficient food to eat.
Analysis of the national food supply chain indicates that after the initial shock, food retailers have managed to adapt their sourcing and transportation strategies to remain functional, despite the decreased warehouse capacity and lack of fuel and manpower., With over one third of Ukraine’s population being displaced, the food security situation is likely to continue to evolve over time. Continuous monitoring will be carried out to capture changes as the situation unfolds.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/wfp-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-situation-report-17-16-may-2022
Project HOPE Seeks to Address Effects of War on Ukrainian Refugees and Health Care Workers,News and Press Release,HOPE,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",16 May 2022,"Washington, D.C. (May 16, 2022) – Today, Project HOPE is recognizing Mental Health Awareness Month by outlining its plans to address the mental health needs of the people impacted by the violence in Ukraine, millions of whom have become refugees or are internally displaced., “All Ukrainians – but health care workers in particular – have proven their strength and fortitude. But no person should be forced to suffer the atrocities that they are enduring,” said Rabih Torbay, Project HOPE’s President and CEO, who traveled to Ukraine recently and witnessed the devastation first-hand. “We must be conscientious about the long-term effects of war and trauma on their mental health and emotional well-being, and remember that, unlike physical wounds, these injuries are not easily seen or stitched up. However, as soon as our rapid response teams deployed to Poland, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, it became clear that we must prioritize mental health and psychosocial support for refugees, health workers, and other affected populations.”, In parts of Ukraine, people have been under constant siege from aerial bombardment and shelling. Women have been targeted with acts of gender-based violence, including rape, and vulnerable citizens have been deprived of electricity, food, water and medical attention. Families have been ripped apart. A majority of refugees and asylum seekers are women and children, and they are relocating to communities where many do not speak the language and are unsure whether they will ever see their husbands, fathers, and sons again., Across the globe, emotional distress, and mental disorders – exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic – are practically ubiquitous, while mental health services are often overwhelmed, especially in areas afflicted by conflict and humanitarian crises. Russia’s devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people, however, pose a particular concern for Project HOPE’s work in Central and Eastern Europe, and the challenge of providing appropriate psycho-social support cannot be overstated., Approximately 14 million people have either fled the country or remain internally displaced, and thousands of civilians have been killed. More than 200 Ukrainian health care facilities have been degraded by systematic attack, while neighboring countries have absorbed a substantial patient caseload, straining their health systems., Meanwhile, mental health, which is already stigmatized, is difficult to prioritize when one is struggling to stay alive. And the ability to conduct conventional talk therapy, which relies on a trusting, one-to-one relationship between provider and patient, is compromised by language barriers and the lack of privacy afforded to many Ukrainian refugees. Of the mental health professionals in countries welcoming refugees, few are fluent in Ukrainian. Native Ukrainian therapists, by contrast, may be burdened by traumas of their own and in need of preventative care., In addition to delivering shipments of medicines, medical supplies, and other support to health facilities in Ukraine, Project HOPE is collaborating with local governmental agencies and partnering with nongovernmental organizations that can provide counseling services. In Poland, Romania, and Moldova, the organization has also hired experienced mental health leads with clinical backgrounds, responsible for developing and implementing local programs., At the onset of the COVID pandemic, Project HOPE employed an online training platform, targeted specifically at mental health concerns, to build resiliency among health care workers pushed to the brink by stress and fatigue. Those training courses are projected to reach more than 50,000 health workers across five continents. Project HOPE intends to utilize similar online training tools to teach psychological first aid and help health care providers in the Ukraine crisis, and is exploring the use of group sessions, language training, and other efforts to screen large numbers of people and build capacity., “As a global health and humanitarian assistance organization, we are committed to a person’s whole health. That includes mental health. Mental Health Awareness Month is an important moment to focus on what Ukrainians are being forced to endure, the pain they are experiencing, and how we are responding,” Torbay added. “Our mission is to empower health workers to address localized needs in a sustainable manner, and that is what we are doing – adapting our approach as the unique health care needs of this humanitarian crisis emerge.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/project-hope-seeks-address-effects-war-ukrainian-refugees-and-health-care-workers

Water Sanitation Hygiene",13 May 2022,"In Ukraine, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is helping the affected populations in the conflict zones but also in the regions where many people have found refuge. This report illustrates the support provided by the organisation to Ukrainians who are confronted daily with hunger, cold, lack of drinking water and hygiene., In Shehyni, on the border between Ukraine and Poland, Luda is waiting with her two daughters to leave the country, a trolley suitcase in her hand and two small bags on the girls’ shoulders. “We are from Polohi,” she says as she heads for the border post, “a small village next to Zaporizha”, a town 150km from Mariupol from where the evacuation trains leave. Next door, a minivan arrives and Sasha*, a 70-year-old woman, gets off with her dog in her arms. “I’ve spent my whole life in Marioupol,” she says, “for the younger people it must be easier, but for us… how can we rebuild a life at our age? We’re going to Poland without knowing what’s going to happen, or where to go…”, This is the story of one in four Ukrainians., Since the beginning of the conflict, 5.3 million people have left Ukraine, and 7.7 million are currently internally displaced (source: OCHA). In the early days of the conflict, Philippe Bonnet, head of mission of SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL in Ukraine, crossed the border “in impressive conditions, with thousands of refugees and a 20 km queue to access the border”, he recalls. A month and a half later, the flow of people crossing the border has decreased significantly. “Those who wanted to leave have already left the country, the others are now internally displaced persons,” he says in front of the SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL stand distributing meals and hot drinks at the Lviv train station, 80 km from the Polish border., Lviv is now internationally known for the number of people who have been transiting and/or taking refuge there since the end of February: it is estimated that more than 400,000 internally displaced people have been welcomed there. In the station, loudspeakers announce the evacuation trains. People get off silently. Three women with two children from Marioupol cannot speak. Their eyes are red and they are about to leave for the Polish border. A girl sitting next to them has a transparent face, a blank stare towards the ground, her shoulders slumped. She can barely drink her hot tea., “Many trains arrive in the night,” says Katia, a volunteer at the SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL stand at the station. She has been in charge of the volunteers for more than a month, “We are there 24/7 to distribute meals and hot drinks so that people can warm up”. At night, temperatures are still below zero. What follows is another departure, this time outside the country or to a reception centre, to stay for one night, two nights, a week and sometimes for an indefinite time., “When the explosions started in our neighbourhood, the bridge was bombed and we didn’t live far. We decided to leave, because it was very scary,” says Nina, 70, from Kiev, who arrived with her son and daughter. With a few things, she took the first train. “We arrived in Lviv at night. My daughter found some volunteers and they quickly accompanied us to the State Administration and we moved here, to this place”., The centre where Nina is staying is close to a military site that was bombed a few days earlier. The windows are covered with black plastic bags to prevent them from shattering from the impact. “At the moment, we are hosting about 80 people,” says Iryna, a volunteer administrator at the collective centre where SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL distributes meals. “Many of the people who are here don’t know where to go, so they are staying,” she explains., Natalia, a former sales department manager, now retired, has been volunteering at the centre since the second day of the conflict. “If you look at Sasha,” she says, pointing to her stirring soup in a pot for 30 people, “she’s from Kiev and she’s an IDP, but she helps in the kitchen, and the other volunteers come from all sorts of professions – a cosmetologist, a lawyer, a teacher.” The volunteers quickly mobilised to coordinate and help. The Walnut House Foundation, a partner of SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL, provides the reception centre with meals that are prepared in the Catholic University’s kitchens., At the Catholic University, 2,500 meals are prepared every day and the classrooms have now become dormitories. Here, Cristina coordinates the team of cooks. “Before the war, I was the manager of the Walnut House catering service; we did meal deliveries, weddings, parties, all these nice things. But now we’re volunteering and preparing meals for those in need,” she says., The whole city mobilised to deal with such a large number of people whose main needs were food and shelter. On the other hand, the large influx of people has pushed up housing prices in the entire Lviv region. “This is the safest area in Ukraine at the moment,” says Maud Rivoal, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL’s programme coordinator in Ukraine. “In Lviv, there was housing, and obviously there is not enough of it anymore because of the number of people moving around.” As a result, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is developing rehabilitation projects that are “more sustainable for the people”, says Maud, “These buildings need to be refurbished, especially in terms of heating, electricity, furnishings such as beds, and access to water, so that people have access to hygiene.”, Two months into the war more and more people are staying closer to their homes, so that some of the transit towns are now being re-inhabited, such as Uman, which is a central axis linking north and south and east and west. “When we arrived in Uman, it was evening, the city was completely dead, in complete blackout, no lights were allowed in order to avoid the bombings,” says Philippe Bonnet. “When I went back four weeks later, life had resumed, people were in the streets and were beginning to adapt to this new situation, to the sirens for example, which announce potential air attacks. Now people are used to it, it’s part of the landscape, but at the time people were rushing to the shelters.”, However, the wave of displacement is far from over. Especially following the resumption of fighting in several areas of Donbass., “There are areas that are not accessible at all, where humanitarian aid does not arrive, such as Marioupol for example,” adds Philippe. For the time being, humanitarian convoys cannot yet enter the encircled towns. When there are negotiations, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL will take part in the convoys, “but we have first chosen to work with local associations that regularly travel to these areas, and which, on the way out, in their small trucks, manage to bring a few hundred kilos of food each day, and which, on the way back, evacuate people from the combat zones,” explains Philippe., Actions have been carried out in the Kharkiv metro, where hundreds of families now live to protect themselves from the bombings. SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has distributed food kits, drinking water, hygiene kits and even games for children. SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL teams have also installed water filters in the metro to make the water drinkable., In Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk, two towns in the Donbass that are in danger of being surrounded very quickly, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has stocked the air raid shelters with drinking water and food kits., Many elderly people and people with reduced mobility who cannot leave their homes are at risk of running out of everything very quickly., SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is also working in Moldova, where 110,000 people have found refuge, 35% of whom remain in the country waiting to return to Ukraine if the situation changes. Operations in Moldova focus on supporting the various organisations present in the country through the distribution of food and basic necessities, as well as activities to provide access to water, sanitation, hygiene and shelter., *first name changed",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/solidarit-s-international-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",13 May 2022,"By Chiara Torelli, At least three people were killed and 19 injured in a Russian airstrike on schools in Novhorod-Siverskyi, Chernihiv, on Thursday 12 May. Russian troops reportedly fired several missiles at a school and boarding school, also damaging an administrative building and some residential houses in the ensuing fire., According to the Ukrainian Education Ministry, 1, 635 educational facilities across Ukraine have been affected by bombardments and shelling, and 126 have been completely destroyed. Ukraine’s First Lady, Olena Zelenska, says “The Russians, who claim to be attacking only military facilities, are waging war against our children. In fact, they are waging war against our future.”, Since 2010, AOAV has recorded 14 incidents of Russian explosive weapons use on educational facilities, as reported in English-language media. These incidents have resulted in a reported 358 civilian casualties., Five of the recorded incidents of Russian attacks on educational facilities took place in Syria, between 2016 and 2019, and resulted in 177 reported civilian casualties and no armed actor casualties; nine of the incidents have occurred in Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, and have resulted in 181 civilian casualties and 9 armed actor casualties. Civilians, therefore, constitute 98% of casualties when Russia has targeted educational facilities., Russian airstrikes account for 56% (201) of these recorded civilian casualties, missiles for 23% (82), rockets for 13% (46), shelling for 5% (18), and artillery for 3% (11) of civilian casualties., Globally, AOAV has recorded 466 incidents of explosive weapons use on educational facilities since 2010, resulting in a reported 6, 850 civilian casualties and 514 armed actor casualties. At least 269 of the reported civilian casualties are women, and 1, 798 are children., Non-state actors are the reported perpetrators in the case of 36% (168) of these incidents, and 32% (2, 213) of civilian casualties of explosive violence on educational facilities are attributed to non-state actors in English-language media., IEDs (non-specific IEDs, roadside bombs, and car bombs) account for 64% (108 incidents) of incidents of explosive violence on educational facilities reportedly perpetrated by non-state actors since 2010, and 75% (1, 650) of civilian casualties of non-state violence on educational facilities can be attributed to IEDs., States are the reported perpetrators in the case of 23% (109) of recorded incidents of explosive weapons use on educational facilities since 2010, and 36% (2, 488) of civilian casualties of explosive violence on educational facilities are attributed to state actors in English-language media. Airstrikes account for 54% (109) of reported incidents, and for 56% (1, 397) of reported civilian casualties of state-perpetrated explosive violence on educational facilities., The worst affected territories for explosive violence on educational facilities since 2010 are Syria (2, 591 civilian casualties), Afghanistan (1, 100), Iraq (897), Pakistan (594), and Gaza (344)., AOAV’s casualty figures represent the lowest of estimations in terms of the number of people killed and injured by explosive weapon use. In an effort to quantify the explicit harm caused by specific explosive weapons, AOAV solely records incident-specific casualty figures, as reported in English-language media., * * *, AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. All actors should stop using explosive weapons with wide-area effects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/least-three-killed-and-19-injured-9th-recorded-russian-air-strike-school-ukraine

That's when all hell began to break loose, a kind of stone age. Petrol stations were bombed, there was no fuel and logistics came to a halt. A few grocery shops were running on leftovers. Now, every day there is constant shelling.”, According to Mariupol’s mayor, 90 per cent of the city has been destroyed by fighting. Families are in urgent need of immediate humanitarian aid., After blasts shattered the windows of Mykola's flat, he and his family decided to leave. For a while, they lived in a freezing underground car park, before finally fleeing the city in three cars to Zaporizhia., Mykola worries about the effect this ordeal has had on his 12-year-old son Ilya., “He got worried when he saw that there was water left for a day or two and we had nothing to drink,” recalls Mykola. “And I noticed he had stopped drinking at all. I asked: ‘Why aren't you drinking?’ And he replied: ‘We don't have enough water, let it be for everyone else.’, As of 20 April, UNICEF has provided assistance to over 9,000 people evacuated from Mariupol and frontline locations, including 115 people (40 children) evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant on 3 May. The evacuees have been provided with over 30,000 litres of water, 5 metric tons of medical supplies, 1,200 hygiene kits, recreational items, emergency food for children, counselling, and psychosocial support activities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/families-devastated-mariupol-face-daily-nightmare-enuk
Commission to establish Solidarity Lanes to help Ukraine export agricultural goods,News and Press Release,EC,"Agriculture
Logistics and Telecommunications",12 May 2022,"Brussels, 12 May 2022, As part of the EU's solidarity response with Ukraine, the Commission today presented a set of actions to help Ukraine export its agricultural produce. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its blockade of Ukrainian ports, Ukrainian grain and other agricultural goods can no longer reach their destinations. The situation is threatening global food security and there is an urgent need to establish alternative logistics routes using all relevant transport modes., With today's Communication, the Commission sets out an action plan to establish ‘Solidarity Lanes' to ensure Ukraine can export grain, but also import the goods it needs, from humanitarian aid to animal feed and fertilisers., Commissioner for Transport Adina Vălean said: “20 million tonnes of grains have to leave Ukraine in less than three months using the EU infrastructure. This is a gigantesque challenge, so it is essential to coordinate and optimise the logistic chains, put in place new routes, and avoid, as much as possible, the bottlenecks. Our communication addresses the emergency solutions but also medium and long time measures to better connect and integrate Ukraine's infrastructure with the EU one. For both short-term and long-term solutions, we will work with the Ukrainian authorities and in close collaboration, especially with the neighbouring Member States, who spared no effort in helping during this crisis.”, Urgent action to address transport bottlenecks, In spite of immediate efforts by the EU and its Member States to ease border crossings between Ukraine and the EU, thousands of wagons and lorries are waiting for clearance on the Ukrainian side. The average current waiting time for wagons is 16 days, while it is up to 30 days at some borders. More grain is still stored and held back in Ukrainian silos ready for export. Among the challenges are differing rail gauge widths: Ukrainian wagons are not compatible with most of the EU rail network, so most goods need to be transhipped to lorries or wagons that fit the EU standard gauge. This process is time-consuming and transhipment facilities along the borders are scarce., To address these obstacles and set up the Solidarity Lanes, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, will work on the following priority actions in the short term:, Additional freight rolling stock, vessels and lorries: The Commission calls on EU market players to urgently make additional vehicles available. In order to match demand and supply and establish the relevant contacts, the Commission will set up a matchmaking logistics platform and ask Member States to designate dedicated Solidarity Lanes contact points (a ‘one-stop-shop')., Capacity of transport networks and transhipment terminals: Ukrainian agricultural export shipments should be prioritised, and infrastructure managers should make rail slots available for these exports. The Commission also calls on market players to urgently transfer mobile grain loaders to the relevant border terminals to speed up transhipment. A road transport agreement with Ukraine will also remove bottlenecks. To encourage EU transport operators to allow their vehicles to enter Ukraine, the Commission will also investigate options for top-up financial guarantees., Customs operations and other inspections: The Commission urges national authorities to apply maximum flexibility and to ensure adequate staffing to accelerate procedures at border crossing points.** * Storage of goods on the territory of the EU: The Commission will assess available storage capacity in the EU and coordinate with Member States to help secure more capacity for temporary storage of Ukrainian exports., Improving EU-Ukraine connectivity in the medium term, In the medium to long term, the Commission will also work on increasing the infrastructure capacity of new export corridors and on establishing new infrastructure connections in the framework of the reconstruction of Ukraine. The next round of Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) calls for proposals will allow support for projects improving transport connections to Ukraine, including for railway connections and rail-road terminals. Against this background, the Commission today adopted a Decision with a view to signing a high-level agreement with Ukraine, updating the maps for the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), as part of the Commission's policy on extending the TEN-T to neighbouring countries., Background, Under normal circumstances, 75% of Ukraine's grain production is exported, generating around 20% of national annual export revenues. Before the war, Ukrainian Black Sea ports accounted for 90% of its export of grain and oilseeds. Around one third of the exports is destined to Europe, China and Africa, respectively., For More Information, Communication from the Commission: An Action Plan for EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes to facilitate Ukraine's agricultural export and bilateral trade with the EU, Commission Decision on the signing of a High-Level Understanding between the European Union and Ukraine on indicative maps of the Trans-European transport network in Ukraine, Press contacts:, Adalbert JAHNZ (+ 32 2 295 31 56)

Distinguished Members of the Security Council,
I would like to extend my appreciation to Council members for the opportunity to brief you this morning., I am aware that the Russian Federation has submitted new information regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine., I wish to note that Under-Secretary-General Nakamitsu informed the Council in her respective briefings on 11 and 18 March 2022, that the United Nations was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. This remains the case today., I would like to note that the United Nations currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information., I recall that the relevant instrument of international law is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons., The Russian Federation, the United States, and Ukraine are all States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention., Mr. President,, The Biological Weapons Convention does contain several measures to which concerned States Parties can have recourse in order to address situations in which they have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers.
For example, pursuant to Article V of the Convention, its States Parties undertake to consult one another and to co-operate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of the provisions of, the Convention., Such consultation and cooperation can take place through appropriate international procedures, including on a bilateral basis between the concerned States Parties., One such international procedure that has been elaborated within the framework of the Biological Weapons Convention is the convening of a consultative meeting., Other possibilities for addressing concerns between States Parties also exist under Article V of the Convention, as well as under Article VI., I would therefore encourage any States Parties with compliance concerns to use the procedures available under the Convention., The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support any procedures under the Biological Weapons Convention that States Parties may decide to use., As Under-Secretary-General Nakamitsu had mentioned in her previous statements to the Council, the Biological Weapons Convention needs to be operationalized and institutionalized to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to face future challenges. The Convention’s upcoming Ninth Review Conference in November and December this year presents an ideal opportunity for its States Parties to strengthen the Convention., I thank you very much for your attention.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/briefing-security-council-threats-international-peace-and-security-mr-thomas-markram

SC/14890
13 MAY 2022, The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine, a senior disarmament affairs official told the Security Council today, as it met to consider new information submitted by the Russian Federation alleging the existence of such weapons., Briefing the 15-member body, Thomas Markram, Deputy to the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, recalled Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu’s March briefings in which she had stated the above, and affirmed that this still remains the case. Further, he pointed out, the Organization currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information., Noting that the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction contains several measures of recourse to address situations in which States parties have concerns about the activities of their peers, he highlighted article V of the Convention, according to which States parties can undertake to consult one another and co-operate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the Convention., He also underscored the importance of operationalizing the Convention so that it is properly equipped and resourced, reminding delegates that the upcoming ninth Review Conference in November and December this year is an ideal opportunity for that., When the floor opened for Council members, the representative of the Russian Federation said his delegation has accumulated a lot of materials that directly indicate that the United States and Ukraine are violating the Convention by carrying out dangerous biological projects in the centre of Eastern Europe and on the western borders of his country. Highlighting project 3007 in which Ukrainian specialists, supervised by United States colleagues, have carried out collections of water samples from rivers flowing through Ukraine, he said their aim is to establish specific dangerous pathogens and determine their ability to incapacitate., As soon as the collection of materials is complete, he said, they will be presented to the Council for investigation, so that his country can finally cut off the military-biological activities that threaten international peace and security. Further, given the United States’ refusal to engage in a constructive discussion, he added, his delegation plans to use the mechanisms under articles V and VI of the Biological Weapons Convention., Countering, the representative of the United States said the Russian Federation repeatedly debases the Council through absurd meetings and ludicrous claims. Highlighting a well-worn pattern in which its authorities accuse others of the very violations it has perpetrated or intends to perpetrate, he said the country used chemical weapons in attempted assassinations while also supporting the Assad regime in Syria, which has repeatedly used such weapons., The documents circulated by the Russian Federation do not support its allegations, he said, calling on that country to publicly and unequivocally state that its forces and its proxies will not use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine or anywhere else., “Let’s be serious here and come back to facts,” France’s delegate said, stressing that the Russian Federation is using the Council as a platform for propaganda. In 2011, that country accused Georgia of developing biological weapons without any evidence, he said, also expressing concern that this disinformation campaign is a prelude to the use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine., All States parties should abide by the objectives of the Biological Weapons Convention, China’s delegate said, urging “one particular country that has not yet destroyed its stockpiles of chemical weapons to do so as soon as possible.” He also highlighted the need for an impartial and professional multilateral verification system, noting that the ninth Review Conference is a chance to restart negotiations towards this and enhance global biosecurity., Other delegates also stressed the important window of opportunity offered by the Conference, with Brazil’s representative pointing out that the absence of a verification mechanism for the Convention hobbles the transparency of international biosecurity research initiatives. The international community must resume negotiations with a view to adopting a protocol that implements the Convention and contributes to building trust among parties about the exclusively peaceful use of such technologies, he stressed., Along similar lines, Mexico’s delegate stressed the importance of safeguarding the peaceful uses of biological research. It is necessary to promote all synergies between the Convention and other regimes for export control, public health and animal health in order to develop coherent public policies, she pointed out., Ghana’s delegate struck a sobering note, reminding delegates of the all-too-real risk of a nuclear exchange, and the catastrophic consequences that would be felt in Europe and far beyond. With any instance of threat of use or the potential use of biological or chemical weapons, impartial investigations conducted by internationally recognized and mandated bodies should be the only way to establish the facts. Calling on both parties to avoid the deliberate or accidental release of chemical or biological agents, she underscored the need for diplomacy and constructive dialogue., Also speaking were representatives of Albania, Gabon, Norway, Kenya, India, United Kingdom, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 10:03 a.m. and ended at 11:06 p.m., Briefing, THOMAS MARKRAM, Deputy to the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, noting that the Russian Federation has submitted new information regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine, recalled that Under‑Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu had informed the Council in her 11 and 18 March briefings, that the United Nations was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. “This remains the case today,” he added, stressing that the Organization currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information. The 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, which the United States, Russian Federation and Ukraine are States parties of, he pointed out, does contain several measures of recourse in order to address situations in which States parties have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers., Highlighting one such measure, he noted that, pursuant to article V of the Convention, States parties can undertake to consult one another and to co-operate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the Convention. Encouraging any State party with compliance concerns to use such procedures, he reaffirmed the commitment of the Office for Disarmament Affairs to the Convention. Further, the Convention needs to be operationalized and institutionalized to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to face future challenges, he said, adding that the upcoming ninth Review Conference in November and December this year presents an ideal opportunity for that., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said his delegation has asked for a meeting on the military biological activities of Ukraine for the third time due to worrying documentary evidence that the United States Department of Defense is directly involved in carrying out dangerous biological projects that look like a secret biological military programme. Those activities are being carried out in the centre of Eastern Europe and on the western borders of the Russian Federation, he said, posing a threat to the biosecurity of his country, the region and the world. There is no information on this in the reporting stipulated by the Biological Weapon Convention from Ukraine or from the United States, as confirmed by Mr. Markram. “Preventing that dangerous activity is possible only through our special military operation,” he underscored., He went on to say that, in the two months that have passed since the previous meeting, his delegation has received much new evidence and those materials have been presented to the Security Council. Drawing the Council’s attention to the most salient information, he said that, with respect to documentation on project 3007 related to proliferation in Ukraine of dangerous water-borne diseases, Ukrainian specialists under the supervision of United States colleagues have regularly carried out collections of water samples from rivers flowing through Ukraine, with the aim of establishing specific dangerous pathogens, including cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E, and evaluating how they spread through the waters in order to determine their ability to incapacitate., Referring to other evidence indicating efforts by Ukraine to use biological and chemical substances and United States support to fund bioweapons activities in Ukraine, he said the United States has repeatedly refused to explain the nature and aims of its activities in Ukraine. His delegation has accumulated a lot of materials that directly indicates that those two countries are violating the Biological Weapons Convention and will continue to collect and analyse those materials. Given the United States’ refusal to engage in a constructive discussion on the topic, his delegation plans to use the mechanisms under articles V and VI of the Biological Weapons Convention. As soon as the collection of materials is complete, they will be presented to the Council for investigation, he said, expressing hope that that would allow the Russian Federation to finally cut off the military‑biological activities that threaten international peace and security and bring those responsible to account., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), noting that the Council is meeting for the fourth time and being presented the same unverified, uncorroborated, unsubstantiated, non-factual claims for a non-existent biological programme in Ukraine, said attempts to use the Council for propaganda purposes and divert attention from the terrible reality of crimes committed in Ukraine must stop. The Russian Federation knows better regarding chemical weapons and their use, he said, adding that “its protégé, the Syrian Government”, used them against rebel forces. Recalling instances of use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, he said issues related to chemical and biological weapons should never be taken lightly. The Biological Weapons Convention and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction contain precise measures and protocols to which concerned States parties can have recourse to address situations for any suspicious activity. Therefore, if there were reasonable doubts for any allegation on any biological programme in Ukraine, the Russian Federation, as a State party to the Biological Weapons Convention, may take those issues to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), address them properly and professionally by providing the opportunity to international and independent experts to investigate., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), recalling how the 11 March meeting quickly turned into an exchange of accusations, stressed that the Council must not become the epicentre of fear and unending cycles of intimidation and propaganda. Expressing concern about the hardening of positions and verbal warfare in the Council, he pointed out that innumerable civilians are dying because of the body’s inaction. Appealing to the parties to restrain from using biological weapons, he highlighted articles V and VI of the Biological Weapons Convention, as well as Council resolution 620 (1980). Stressing the importance of an impartial investigation into the allegations just raised, he called for diplomatic engagement towards a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), stressing that the Russian Federation is once again using the Council as a platform for propaganda to justify an unjustifiable war, said: “Let’s be serious here and come back to facts.” The United Nations has no information on this subject, he said, adding that repeated dissemination of false information will not transform these allegations into a reality. Recalling that, in 2011, the Russian Federation accused Georgia of developing biological weapons without any evidence, he said it has also repeatedly campaigned against the OPCW in order to protect its Syrian ally. Expressing concern that this disinformation campaign is a prelude to the use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, he pointed out that the Convention provides procedures for consultations with States parties., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said that, in any instance of threat of use or the potential use of biological or chemical weapons, the independent and impartial investigations conducted by internationally recognized and mandated bodies should be the only way to establish the facts. The cruelty associated with the use of biological agents and toxins as instruments of war and the fact that related diseases would not confine themselves to national borders justify the prohibition of Member States under the Biological Weapons Convention from the use of biological agents and toxins as war instruments. She called on both parties to exercise restraint and avoid the deliberate or accidental release of chemical or biological agents and other weapons of mass destruction, given the immeasurable risk those weapons pose to the lives of civilians and the environment. The risk of a nuclear exchange is real and will be catastrophic for the whole planet, she stressed, noting that the effects would not only be felt in Europe, but around the world. She called on all actors to uphold their obligations and commitments under international law and international humanitarian law, underscoring that a sustainable solution to the conflict can only be reached through diplomacy and constructive dialogue among the parties and stakeholders., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) stated that the Russian Federation is once again using the Council as a platform for blatant disinformation and to draw attention away from its unprovoked, unjustified, irresponsible — and frankly brutal — warfare in Ukraine. Stressing that her country is a firm supporter of the Biological Weapons Convention and determined to uphold the total ban against biological weapons, she said that, once again, the Russian Federation has failed to offer any credible evidence for its accusations regarding the development of biological weapons in Ukraine, providing instead unsubstantiated claims and mere insinuations. “If Russia is serious about these accusations, they should use the proper procedure under the Biological Weapons Convention, and provide fact-based evidence,” she said. Reiterating Norway’s condemnation of the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine, she demanded it immediately end its aggression, withdraw its troops and stop causing death, suffering and destruction., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya) said that any allegation of breach of the Biological Weapons Convention, to which her country is State party, must not be taken lightly. All States parties must make the necessary efforts to strengthen the biological weapons regime and the norms that safeguard humanity from the threat of use of those weapons, she said, calling on all States parties to the Convention to make use of the established mechanisms to ensure no ambiguity on the presence of those weapons. Noting the grave cost of the war in Ukraine to its people, the entire region and the world, she called on the Council to focus on finding a path to peace, urging a cessation and meaningfully safe humanitarian passages for trapped civilians particularly in eastern Ukraine., ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico), stressing that the use of biological weapons would be repugnant to the conscience of humanity, noted that article V of the Biological Weapons Convention stresses the importance of cooperation and consultation between States parties. Unfortunately, the Convention does not have a mechanism for verification, she pointed out, adding that the next Review Conference is an opportunity to provide the agreement with such a mechanism. Also stressing the importance of safeguarding the peaceful uses of biological research, she said it is necessary to promote all synergies between the Convention and other regimes for export control, public health and animal health in order to develop coherent public policies., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) said his country attaches high importance to the Biological Weapons Convention as a key global and non-discriminatory disarmament convention, prohibiting an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. Any matter relating to obligations under the Convention should be addressed as per the provisions and through consultations and cooperation between the parties concerned, he said. Underscoring the need for negotiation of a comprehensive and legally binding protocol, providing for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism to strengthen States parties’ implementation of the Convention, he reiterated his country’s deep concern about the worsening situation in Ukraine, and voiced support for the efforts of the Secretary-General’s good offices., FERGUS JOHN ECKERSLEY (United Kingdom) said that the current meeting is a complete waste of the Council’s time. These disruptive tactics by the Russian Federation prove that “they know as well as we do that none of their excuses for invading Ukraine have any basis whatsoever”, he stressed., CAIT MORAN (Ireland) said there can be no impunity for those who use biological agents or toxins, or as instruments of war. In that regard, the international community must collectively uphold the international legal norm against such weapons, she said, noting that her country looks forward to the Biological Weapons Convention Review Conference and will work with States parties to further strengthen that key instrument. Expressing grave concern that the Russian Federation continues to use biological weapons to justify unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, she said that, despite the large amount of material shared by the Russian Federation, no substantive or credible evidence has been presented to support its allegations. Instead, the Council sees baseless and unfounded claims against Ukraine and others, including the United States, to paint itself as the victim in the face of its horrific actions in Ukraine. The Russian Federation must stop seeking to use the Council as a platform for its disinformation. Underscoring that its actions risk undermining essential multilateral disarmament and non‑proliferation instrument, as well as peaceful, legitimate cooperation and research supporting public health, she called on the Russian Federation to immediately end its hostilities, unconditionally withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine and refrain from further threat or use of force of any kind against Ukraine or any other State., DAI BING (China), stressing that his country is opposed to the development, stockpiling or use of biological and chemical weapons by any country, urged “one particular country that has not yet destroyed its stockpiles of chemical weapons to do so as soon as possible”. All States parties should scrupulously abide by the objectives of the Biological Weapons Convention, he said, underscoring the need for an impartial, independent and professional multilateral verification system. The ninth Review Conference at the end of this year is an opportunity for States parties to restart negotiations regarding a verification protocol and effectively enhance global biosecurity, he said. Welcoming an assessment of the documents disclosed by the Russian Federation under the framework of the Convention, he said the priority is to step up efforts to stop hostilities., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) said any allegations concerning the existence of biological weapons must be thoroughly substantiated with evidence. Recalling that the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention established clear obligations binding upon all State parties to not develop, produce or acquire such weapons, he expressed regret that, years later, the international community still has not agreed on a multilateral mechanism to verify compliance. The absence hobbles the transparency of international biosecurity research initiatives, he pointed out, voicing support for the resumption of negotiations with a view to adopting a protocol that implements the Convention and contributes to building trust among parties about the exclusively peaceful use of such technologies. Until such a protocol is adopted, State parties must cooperate with each other by sharing the widest possible range of information on research topics related to the objectives of the Convention, he stressed., RICHARD M. MILLS, JR. (United States), Council President for May, speaking in his national capacity, said the Russian Federation is once again using the Security Council as a platform to spout disinformation and conspiracy theories against Ukraine, even as it continues its brutal and inhumane assault on the Ukrainian people. The Russian Federation repeatedly debases the Council through absurd meetings and endless claims about chemical and biological weapons programmes in Ukraine that are categorically false and ludicrous, he said, noting that they follow a well-worn pattern in which Russian authorities accuse others of the very violations the country has perpetrated or intends to perpetrate. Referring to the Russian Federation’s claims about poisoned bank notes and secret treatment on psychiatric prisoners, he said: “What is not fiction and must not be forgotten is that the Russian Federation has a long and well‑documented track record of using chemical weapons including an attempted assassinations and the poisoning of Putin’s political enemies.”, He went on to say that it is the Russian Federation that continues to support the Assad regime in Syria, which has repeatedly used chemical weapons, and has long maintained a well-documented biological weapons programme in violation of international law. Any use of chemical or biological weapons by the Russian Federation will result in severe consequences. ""We expect the Russian Government to publicly and unequivocally state that Russian forces and its proxies will not use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine or anywhere ever in accordance with its international legal obligations.” Even documents circulated by the Russian Federation do not support their allegations, he said, pointing to its attempts to distract the Council from the violence it is perpetrating in Ukraine. “The United States is not fooled, nor are Council members and we are not going to look away. We will continue to hold the Russian Federation accountable and call on Putin to end the war of choice,” he concluded., DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said that, once again, there are attempts to divert the discussion, move the focus from the subject initially raised by his country, and to mix chemical and biological weapons, adding that those are different things. “We are talking about specific facts that we have uncovered and specific documents that indicate that biological labs in Ukraine, in working with the United States, are carrying out biological programmes,” he said. Pointing to the several hundred documents distributed by his delegation, he underscored that there are specific data, cases, companies and people involved. ""If you think that is not enough, then what is evidence to you?”, he asked, urging the United States to provide information or clarification about the nature or real aims of its biological activities in Ukraine., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) thanked Council members for their expressions of condolence regarding the death of his country’s President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan., For information media.

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 12 May 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,13 May 2022,"Date: 13 May 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 12 May 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 7,389 civilian casualties in the country: 3,573 killed and 3,816 injured. This included:, a total of 3,573 killed (1,314 men, 855 women, 78 girls, and 94 boys, as well as 69 children and 1,163 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 3,816 injured (597 men, 430 women, 91 girls, and 99 boys, as well as 167 children and 2,432 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 3,878 casualties (1,919 killed and 1,959 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 3,280 casualties (1,802 killed and 1,478 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian affiliated armed groups: 598 casualties (117 killed and 481 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Poltava, Rivne, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 3,511 casualties (1,654 killed and 1,857 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), and Popasna (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 11 May 2022 (local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 12 May only, as during this day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days. Similarly, not all civilian casualties that were reported on 12 May have been included into the above figures. Some of them are still pending corroboration and if confirmed, will be reported on in future updates.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-12-may-2022-enruuk

This is the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. Some 8 million people have been displaced internally within Ukraine and some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation., As of today, more than 5.9 million refugee movements have been recorded out of Ukraine. At the same time, authorities have reported some 1.5 million movements back into the country. UNHCR estimates that some 2.4 million refugees have moved beyond countries neighbouring Ukraine., Inside Ukraine, many people who are trapped are unable to meet their basic needs including food, water and medicines. The delivery of life-saving aid remains challenging, with a lack of safe humanitarian access. UNHCR and partners continue striving to reach hard-hit areas with life-saving assistance as part of inter-agency humanitarian convoys., Key figures - UKRAINE, As of 9 May:, 402,905 people reached with essential food and non-food items, winter clothes and shelter materials, 148,524 people received protection assistance, advice and referrals at border crossing points, transit and reception centres and through hotlines, 275,850 people enrolled for multipurpose cash assistance. 157,716 have received their first payment., 64,954 people received assistance through humanitarian convoys delivered to hard-hit areas, 37,858 sleeping spaces created / improved in 154 reception centres and collective centres",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-flash-update-12-11-may-2022

Protection and Human Rights",12 May 2022,"UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Omar Abdi's remarks at the UN Security Council Meeting on the maintenance of peace and security in Ukraine, As delivered, NEW YORK, 12 May 2022 - ""Mr President, Excellencies and colleagues, I would like to express my appreciation to Ambassadors De La Fuente and Riviere for convening today’s meeting. I would also like to thank the United States for hosting this briefing during your Security Council presidency., ""It has been just one month since UNICEF last briefed this Council on the situation in Ukraine – as each day passes, more Ukrainian children are exposed to the horrors of this war. In just this past month, the UN verified that nearly 100 children were killed, and we believe the actual figures to be considerably higher. More children have been injured and faced grave violations of their rights, millions more have been displaced. Schools continue to be attacked and used for military purposes and water and sanitation infrastructure impacted. The war in Ukraine, like all wars, is a child protection and child rights crisis., ""Last month, UNICEF briefed the Council following the attack on Kramatorsk train station – an attack on families fleeing the violence and which interrupted the work of our team on the ground to deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance. We meet again after another horrifying attack, this time on a school in Luhansk – yet another stark example of disregard for civilian lives. Today, even more families are mourning the loss of loved ones., ""It is also a stark reminder that in Ukraine today, education is also under attack. In February, the school year came to a standstill when the war broke out. As of last week, at least 15 of 89 - one in six - UNICEF-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war. Hundreds of schools across the country are reported to have been hit by heavy artillery, airstrikes and other explosive weapons in populated areas, whilst other schools are being used as information centres, shelters, supply hubs, or for military purposes – with long term impact on children’s return to education., ""Last month, UNICEF briefed the Council following the attack on Kramatorsk train station – an attack on families fleeing the violence and which interrupted the work of our team on the ground to deliver desperately needed humanitarian assistance. We meet again after another horrifying attack, this time on a school in Luhansk – yet another stark example of disregard for civilian lives. Today, even more families are mourning the loss of loved ones as the war’s dramatic impact on children’s lives and futures is put into sharp relief., ""These attacks must stop. All parties must honour their legal and moral obligation to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, and to ensure the rights of children are upheld., ""In 2021, this council adopted Resolution 2601, which condemns attacks on schools and calls for all necessary safeguards to uphold the right to education. The Safe Schools Declaration outlines what is needed to enhance protection of education in conflict. What is needed now is the courage, discipline, and political will to translate these words into action., ""Excellencies, schools are a lifeline for children, especially in conflict. Schools are a safe space, with routines providing protection from harm and a semblance of normalcy. Schools are also critical conduits for information about the risks of deadly explosive ordnance. And they are a connector to essential health and psychosocial services., ""The workforce in Ukraine – teachers, principals, social workers, psychologists, and other professionals – are equally impacted by this conflict. Supporting them so they can stay and deliver is more important than ever., ""We must also ensure creative, multi-faceted, and flexible solutions that combine low and high-tech methods to reach all children and minimize disruptions to their learning. In mid-March, over 15,000 schools resumed education in Ukraine, mostly through remote learning or in-person hybrid options. The Ministry of Education and Science, supported by UNICEF and partners, is doing everything possible to reach Ukrainian children, including supporting online education from Kindergarten through grade 11. We are also supporting an ongoing digital campaign on explosive ordnance risk education, and provision of education-related supplies. However, remote learning can only be a temporary solution. Lessons from the pandemic show the importance of children learning in a school setting with their peers and teachers., ""In the broader region, thanks to the EU’s Temporary Protection Directive, governments and municipalities in neighbouring countries are enrolling children in national school systems and alternative education pathways. This is helping ensure the continuity of children’s learning and supporting their completion of the school year. It is estimated that 3.7 million children in Ukraine and abroad are using online and distance learning options. But enormous obstacles remain, including capacity and resource constraints, language barriers, and unpredictable movements of children and their families., ""We must make every effort to reach those most at risk of being left behind. For the youngest learners, access to education can be especially challenging: less than 5 per cent of refugee preschool-aged children are estimated to be enrolled in public kindergarten. Children with disabilities need access to inclusive services and assistive technology, as well as targeted programmes to cover their specific needs, including rehabilitation., ""In the last month, we have seen small moments of relief as children and other civilians evacuated from Mariupol and other frontline locations reach relative safety. Humanitarians have reached millions of people in need across the country with health, education, water, and essential supplies as well as information, counselling, and psychosocial support., ""Yet we know that the situation for children and their families in conflict-affected areas without access to humanitarian assistance continues to be grim. Children and parents tell us of their ‘living hell’ where they were forced to go hungry, drink from muddy puddles, and shelter from constant shelling and bombardments, dodging bombs, bullets, and landmines as they fled., ""The war in Ukraine has also had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable children globally as world food and fuel prices spike to all-time highs. Children already affected by conflict and climate crises across the world – from Afghanistan to Yemen and the Horn of Africa – are now paying a deadly price for another war far from their doorsteps. The repercussions of the war in Ukraine will continue to ripple across the globe., ""Excellencies, Ukrainian children have been uprooted from their homes, separated from caregivers, and directly exposed to war. Their schools have been destroyed and the critical infrastructure essential for their survival and well-being, including hospitals and water and sanitation systems, are being devastated by the fighting., ""Ukrainian children tell us that they want to reunite with their families, to return to their communities, to go to school and play in their neighbourhoods. Children are resilient but they shouldn’t have to be. They have already paid an unconscionably high price in this war. We must do everything possible to help ensure it doesn’t also cost them their futures., ""Once again, as humanitarians, we will do everything we can to continue meeting the needs of children affected by this war – to provide safety, stability and protection, but this will never be enough., ""Ultimately, children need an end to this war – their futures hang in the balance."", Media contacts

"L'élimination des mines en Ukraine pourrait prendre des décennies ; Le travail pour les trouver, les cartographier et les enlever a déjà commencé",News and Press Release,GICHD,Mine Action,13 May 2022,"Pour publication immédiate - 13 mai 2022 - Genève. Le conflit armé en cours en Ukraine a déclenché des crises humanitaires de grande ampleur, avec des rapports faisant état de milliers de victimes civiles, de l'utilisation de mines et autres engins explosifs, et de la situation des réfugiés qui connaît la croissance la plus rapide depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Les mines antipersonnel et anti-véhicules, ainsi que les autres munitions non explosées ou abandonnées laissées en Ukraine menacent la vie de millions de personnes, entravent la reconstruction et rendent dangereux le retour des populations à leur vie quotidienne antérieure. Il faudra des années pour les éliminer., Alors que les efforts de déminage humanitaire à grande échelle sont impossibles pendant le conflit, la coordination pour aider les autorités ukrainiennes à localiser, identifier et, si possible, retirer les engins explosifs est déjà en cours., Cartographie urgente des risques liés aux mines en vue d'une action coordonnée, Les autorités nationales ukrainiennes indiquent qu'elles ont déjà localisé, enregistré et retiré près de 80 000 mines et engins explosifs. Cette entreprise massive est étroitement soutenue par la cellule de gestion de l'information de la lutte antimines (IM), coordonnée par le Centre International de Déminage Humanitaire de Genève (GICHD), où les autorités nationales sont rejointes par des agences des Nations Unies et des organisations internationales et locales de lutte antimines. En réponse à l'afflux de rapports sur les engins explosifs, la cellule de gestion de l'information agit comme un centre d'information sur la lutte antimines, rassemblant des données provenant de diverses sources nationales et internationales, y compris les réseaux sociaux., Le système ukrainien de gestion de l'information dans la lutte antimines (IMSMA), utilisé dans le pays depuis 2012, en est la pierre angulaire. Cet outil, développé par le GICHD, est devenu une plateforme de coordination d'urgence, permettant à la cellule IM d'agréger, d'interpréter et de partager le flot de données entre les partenaires et les sources, afin de cartographier les zones où les menaces existent et de définir les actions possibles. Pendant cette phase d'urgence, l'accès coordonné à des données actualisées aide les autorités nationales à cibler les ressources et à prendre des mesures stratégiques., À plus long terme, la cartographie des zones minées, basée sur des données, constitue la base d'opérations de déminage humanitaire efficaces et efficientes. L'identification des zones et de l'étendue de la contamination permet d'accélérer le processus de rétablissement afin que les gens puissent retourner chez eux et utiliser leurs terres en toute sécurité., Aider les civils dans les zones contaminées par les mines à réduire les risques, Alors que les efforts de lutte antimines sont en cours, les civils ukrainiens ont un besoin urgent de comprendre comment reconnaître les engins explosifs dans leurs communautés, ce qu'il faut faire si des engins explosifs sont trouvés, et comment réduire leurs risques., ""10 à 30% des armes explosives utilisées, larguées, tirées ou lancées n'explosent pas comme prévu et de nombreux autres engins explosifs sont abandonnés à divers endroits"", estime le groupe consultatif sur l'éducation aux risques des engins explosifs (EREE), un groupe international d'experts du GICHD, d'agences des Nations Unies, d'organisations internationales et d'ONG, dans les questions et réponses sur l'EREE pour l'Ukrainerécemment publiées. Cela signifie qu'une grande partie des mines et autres engins explosifs utilisés pendant le conflit resteront une menace pour les civils après la fin des combats, en particulier pour les enfants., Les acteurs travaillant sur le terrain en Ukraine jouent un rôle crucial dans la sensibilisation aux risques encourus par les communautés locales. Grâce au groupe de travail EREE dirigé par l'UNICEF en Ukraine, le GICHD contribue aux informations sur l'éducation aux risques et aux bonnes pratiques disponibles dans ce pays. Ce soutien est important pour aider à s'aligner sur les bonnes pratiques les plus récentes et à identifier les menaces d'engins explosifs en temps réel., Identification des engins explosifs, Outre la quantité d'engins explosifs en Ukraine, la variété de ces derniers constitue un défi supplémentaire pour les opérateurs de la lutte antimines sur le terrain. Identifier correctement les engins explosifs est la première étape pour les traiter de la manière la plus sûre possible., Rédigée en trois semaines afin de fournir des conseils urgents aux opérateurs menant des activités de lutte contre les mines en Ukraine, la première édition du Guide des engins explosifs pour l'Ukraine publiée par le GICHD (GICHD's Explosive Ordnance Guide for Ukraine*) *identifie plus de 100 engins explosifs distincts, tels que des mines antipersonnel et anti-véhicules, des sous-munitions explosives et des grenades, trouvés en Ukraine depuis le début du conflit. Le GICHD continuera à mettre à jour le guide au fur et à mesure que de nouveaux engins explosifs seront identifiés, afin d'aider les opérateurs à gérer les risques auxquels ils sont confrontés dans leur travail., Planification de la réponse à long terme en vue de la reconstruction, Alors que l'Ukraine approche du troisième mois depuis l'escalade du conflit armé, un soutien technique et financier accru est nécessaire pour soutenir les efforts actuels et préparer une réponse à plus long terme., ""Le déminage humanitaire en Ukraine doit se concentrer sur les capacités nationales et les programmes menés par les autorités nationales"", explique le directeur du GICHD, l'ambassadeur Stefano Toscano. Les efforts actuels dans le pays s'appuient sur des bases nationales solides qui existent en Ukraine depuis des décennies, remontant à la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale. Ces capacités doivent être renforcées davantage pour répondre à l'ampleur de la contamination par les engins explosifs actuellement présents, afin de soutenir les efforts de reconstruction plus larges., Le GICHD continuera à travailler à long terme aux côtés des autorités nationales et des organisations internationales pour faire face à l'impact des engins explosifs en Ukraine. Aujourd'hui, l'accent est mis sur un soutien ciblé pour sauver des vies et prévenir les pertes et les blessures. Demain, nos efforts conjoints seront une condition préalable à la reconstruction et au développement durable., ###, Le GICHD est reconnaissant du soutien généreux de ses donateurs et tient à souligner les contributions de l'Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement du Département d'Etat américain, ainsi que des gouvernements suisse et néerlandais, qui rendent possible notre travail en Ukraine*. *",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/l-limination-des-mines-en-ukraine-pourrait-prendre-des-d-cennies-le-travail-pour-les

Anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines, as well as other unexploded or abandoned ammunition left behind in Ukraine, threaten the lives of millions of people. They will take years to remove, hindering reconstruction efforts and making it unsafe for people to return to their previous daily lives., While full-scale humanitarian demining efforts are impossible during the conflict, coordination to support Ukrainian authorities to locate, identify and, when possible, remove explosive ordnance is already underway., Urgently mapping landmine risks for coordinated action, Ukrainian national authorities report that they have already located, recorded, and removed nearly 80,000 mines and explosive devices. This massive undertaking is closely supported by the Mine Action Information Management (IM) cell, coordinated by the GICHD, where national authorities are joined by UN agencies, and international and local mine action organisations. Responding to the surge of reports of explosive ordnance, the IM cell is acting as a mine action information hub, gathering data from a variety of national and international sources, including social media., A cornerstone of this has been Ukraine's Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA), used in country since 2012. The GICHD-developed IMSMA has transitioned to an emergency coordination platform, allowing the IM cell to aggregate, interpret, and share the flood of data across partners and sources, in order to map areas where threats exist and define possible actions. During this emergency phase, coordinated access to up-to-date data helps national authorities target resources and take action strategically., In the longer term, data-driven mapping of areas where landmines and other explosive ordnance are reported builds the foundation for effective and efficient humanitarian demining operations. Identifying the areas and extent of contamination helps speed the recovery process so that people can return to their homes and use their land safely., Helping civilians in mine-contaminated areas reduce risks, While mine action efforts are underway, Ukrainian civilians have an urgent need to understand how to recognise explosive ordnance in their communities, what to do if EO is found, and how to reduce their risks., ""10 to 30% of the explosive weapons used, dropped, fired or launched do not explode as intended and many other explosive ordnance are abandoned in various locations,"" estimates the Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) Advisory Group, an international group of experts from the GICHD, UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs, in the recently published Questions and Answers on EORE for Ukraine. This means that a large portion of mines and other EO used during the conflict will remain a threat to civilians after the fighting is over, especially for children., Actors working on the ground in Ukraine play a crucial role in promoting awareness on risks faced by local communities. Through the UNICEF-led EORE working group in Ukraine, the GICHD is contributing to the information on risk education and good practices available there. This support is important to help to align with up-to-date good practices and identify evolving EO threats in real time., Identifying explosive ordnance items, In addition to the sheer quantity of explosive ordnance in Ukraine, the variety of the types of EO adds an additional challenge for mine action operators on the ground. Correctly identifying explosive ordnance is the first step in dealing with it as safely as possible., Drafted over three weeks to provide urgent guidance to operators conducting mine action activities in Ukraine, the first edition of GICHD's Explosive Ordnance Guide for Ukraineidentifies over 100 separate items of explosive ordnance, such as anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines, explosive submunitions, and grenades, found in Ukraine since the conflict began. The GICHD will continue to update the guide as more explosive ordnance is identified, aiming to assist mine action operators to manage the risks they face in their work., Planning for long-term response toward recovery, As Ukraine approaches three months since the escalation of the armed conflict in February, increased technical and financial support is needed to sustain current efforts and prepare for longer-term response., ""Humanitarian demining in Ukraine needs to focus on national capacity and nationally-led programmes,"" explained GICHD Director, Ambassador Stefano Toscano. Current efforts in country build on solid national foundations that have existed in Ukraine for decades, dating back to the end of the second World War. These capacities need to be strengthened further to respond to the scale of explosive ordnance contamination now present, in support of wider recovery efforts., The GICHD will continue to work alongside national authorities and international organisations over the long-term to address the impact of explosive ordnance in Ukraine. Today the focus is placed on targeted support to save lives and prevent losses and injuries. Tomorrow our joint efforts will be a prerequisite for reconstruction and sustainable development., ###, The GICHD is grateful for the generous support of our donors and would like to recognise the contributions of the U.S. Department of State's Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, as well as the Governments of Switzerland and the Netherlands, which make our work in Ukraine possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/clearing-landmines-ukraine-may-take-decades-work-find-map-and-remove-them-has-already
"Ukraine: FAO Humanitarian response update, 13 May 2022",Situation Report,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",13 May 2022,"The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that at least 20 percent of Ukraine’s winter crops – wheat, most notably – may not be harvested or planted. This will further reduce the global food supply, with serious implications for Europe,
Central Asia and beyond., Food prices were already on the rise due to concerns over crop conditions, exports and price inflation in the energy, fertilizer and feed sectors. As the war in Ukraine sent shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils, food prices soared even higher, reaching a historic peak in March., As of 3 May, more than 8 million Ukrainians are estimated to be internally displaced. Most of them are women and children who are in besieged areas where people have lived for weeks without access to food, while under the constant threat of bombardment., FAO’s revised Rapid Response Plan was issued on 19 April 2022, seeking USD 115.4 million to assist 979 320 people in rural areas through December.
To date, FAO has raised USD 11 million. Further contributions are urgently needed to reach more people to maintain the spring cropping season and support the harvest preparation., FAO is on the ground in Ukraine, rapidly scaling up humanitarian programming. The Organization had a significant presence in the country (81 people) prior to the war, and has increased its sta to 114 members (87 national and 27 international) with additional technical, operational and security sta deployed to support the scale-up., As of 11 May, FAO has reached 18 044 households (46 914 people) and will reach an additional 14 647 households (38 082 people) in the coming days with support. Moreover, at least a further 15 200 households (39 520 people) will be supported in the coming months. In addition, 83 000 kits containing animal feed and vitamin-mineral supplements will be delivered to livestock keepers. Several FAO monitoring missions are currently underway.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-fao-humanitarian-response-update-13-may-2022
Austria Provides an Additional €46 Million in Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. Austria,"Contributions
Food and Nutrition",4 May 2022,"Largest payment of all time from the Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Disaster Fund (AKF), In light of the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine due to the brutal Russian war of aggression and its grave consequences, which can be felt far beyond the region, the Austrian government is providing an additional nearly 46 million from the Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Disaster Fund (AKF). This year’s budget for humanitarian aid has thus exceeded the 100-million-euro mark for the first time., The provision of 45.96 million euros from the AKF was approved by the Council of Ministers last Wednesday. It is the largest payment of all time. 41.96 million euros will be given to the “Nachbar in Not” (Neighbour in Need) aid campaign. The federal government has announced that it will double all private donations received by Easter Monday. Another 4 million euros will go to the World Food Programme (WFP) for its essential work in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Libya. Due to the rising prices of basic food items and the absence of grain exports from Russia and Ukraine, the WFP is planning for a dramatic increase in demand so it can supply the most necessary items to people in the region who are already impacted by humanitarian crises., We see it as our humanitarian duty to help ease the suffering of the people in Ukraine. Since the start of the war, Austria has already provided a series of emergency relief packages, including 17.5 million euros from the Foreign Disaster Fund and deliveries of civilian emergency vehicles, helmets, body armour and fuel. With today’s decision by the Council of Ministers, the federal government is keeping the promise it made in March, doubling all donations to Ukraine that were collected through ORF’s “Nachbar in Not” campaign by Easter Monday. This money will now go where it is most urgently needed, as direct local assistance,, said Chancellor Karl Nehammer., The fates and images of the suffering of the Ukrainian population are tragic, and they sometimes make us feel helpless. But in this hour of difficulty, Austrians’ have shown a great willingness to help support the victims. Today’s decision is important and right. The government will keep its promise of doubling Austrians’ private donations to ‘Nachbar in Not’. We will also give an additional 4 million euros to the World Food Programme. The AKF will again be increased by 46 million and this year’s budget for humanitarian aid will pass the 100-million-euro mark for the first time. It is quite clear: We stand by the Ukrainian population. With this 42-million-euro payment, we want to give “Nachbar in Not” rapid assistance, without red tape. Together we can better support all those who especially need our help and solidarity. I want to thank all of the donors who are committed to providing this important humanitarian aid,, said Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler., At least 15 million euros of the funds approved today will be used in projects to ease humanitarian suffering, particularly among women and girls. At least 5 million euros will be provided to organisations working in the Republic of Moldova, which has been particularly affected by floods of refugees from Ukraine. Thus, Austrian aid to Ukraine and other strongly impacted states will total more than 80 million euros since the start of the Russian war of aggression., In light of the brutal Russian war of aggression, Ukraine deserves our unlimited solidarity and help. With the largest-ever payment from the Foreign Disaster Fund, we are particularly helping the most vulnerable people suffering the effects of this completely unjustified aggression. Thus, Austria is consistently pursuing its approach of providing aid on site – responsibly and thoughtfully,, said Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg., Women and children are the ones who suffer the most from this devastating war in Ukraine. Therefore our priority as the federal government is to help women and children in particular, because they are the ones who most urgently need aid—both in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries. We will provide at least 15 million euros from the AKF to this group alone. My sincere thanks go to all those who donated to the ‘Nachbar in Not’ campaign, or who otherwise helped and are still helping refugees from Ukraine,, concluded Minister for Women’s Affairs Susanne Raab., Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs

A third MedGlobal team of trauma and emergency specialists trained 150 Ukrainian physicians on mass casualties,News and Press Release,MedGlobal,Health,12 May 2022,"Chicago - MedGlobal team of four US physicians completed a third successful medical mission to Ukraine from May 3-6. Dr. John Peter McBryde, physician, Dr. Tanya Bucierka, emergency medicine physician with Eugene emergency physicians, Oregon, Dr. Judah Slavkovsky, surgeon at Carle Foundation Hospital, and Dr. Kathleen Gallagher, surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, traveled to war-torn Ukraine to deliver medical supplies and ultrasound machines worth $200,000 and trained Ukrainian doctors in multiple hospitals in different Ukrainian cities., The MedGlobal team trained 150 Ukrainian physicians in the period of four days in six different hospitals, including Clinical Municipal Communal Emergency Hospital, Lviv Veterans Hospital, Municipal Polyclinic #5, Communal Municipal Clinical Hospital 8 - St Luke's, Dnipro Emergency Hospital, and Central District Hospital in Sambir. The training focused on polytrauma, triage, FAST exam, blast injury and ultrasound.

Grass-roots providers stay mobile in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNAIDS,HIV/Aids,12 May 2022,"Many life-saving health services could not operate after the breakout of the war in Ukraine., But grass-root providers such as the Alliance for Public Health found ways to keep going. Despite roads being mined and many bridges blown up, the Mobile HIV Case-Finding project used its 16 vans to deliver food, HIV treatment and other essentials around the country. It also helped people find shelter., Iryna, the Coordinator of the mobile clinic team in the Chernihiv region, said the war had complicated its work immensely. Chernihiv borders the Russian Federation and Belarus in northern Ukraine., “Many people were on the move, going from one place to another,” she said. “It was very difficult to work.”, But since mid-March, the Alliance for Public Health has restored many of its services. The nongovernmental organization works mainly with people who inject drugs and their partners., “The substantial number of new HIV cases in Ukraine are registered among injecting drug users because of unsafe injecting practices,” explains the UNAIDS Country Director for Ukraine, Raman Hailevich., He knows that reaching drug users was a challenge before the war, and it’s an even greater challenge now. The credit, he said, goes to civil society groups., “Community-based organizations working with this type of hard-to-reach population provide the most essential outreach to these groups. Without them, the delivery of prevention programmes among people who use drugs would not be possible,” he said., Because of the insecurity, the Alliance for Public Health saw a drop in testing for HIV and hepatitis C. Iryna, however, is proud because, she said, the teams delivered treatment to more than 1400 people in March and April through the mail and/or personal home delivery., The Mobile HIV Case-Finding project, founded in 2019, is implemented by the Alliance for Public Health and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and is funded by the CDC and PEPFAR.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/grass-roots-providers-stay-mobile-ukraine
